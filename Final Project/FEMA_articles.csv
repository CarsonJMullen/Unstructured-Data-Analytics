"Who Is Peter Todd, The Man Named By HBO As Bitcoin's Mystery Creator Satoshi Nakamoto?",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/08/who-is-peter-todd-the-man-named-by-hbo-as-bitcoins-mystery-creator-satoshi-nakamoto/,2024-10-08T22:05:17Z,"Satoshi Nakamoto -- the mysterious, anonymous creator of bitcoin -- has successfully kept their real identity hidden since they published bitcoin's white paper in 2008.

Bitcoin has become a $1.2 trillion asset (though one Wall Street giant has predicted it could be about to go far higher) over the last 15 years -- making the man, woman or group known only as Satoshi Nakamoto worth almost $70 billion if they still control the 1.1 million bitcoins they're believed to hold across a series of wallet addresses, pieced together by blockchain sleuths.

Now, HBO documentary film maker Cullen Hoback has named Peter Todd, a bitcoin core developer who has been involved with bitcoin since 2010, as who he believes to be the real-world identity of Satoshi Nakamoto.

""What if the real reason for using the name Satoshi, for the anonymity, was so that people could take bitcoin seriously, so they could believe it was created by [a famous cryptographer] and not some kid still in school,"" Hoback said during the Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery documentary on HBO before putting his theory directly to Todd -- who was in his early 20s and finishing a fine arts degree in 2008, the year Satoshi Nakamoto published the bitcoin white paper.

""Here's what I think happened, possibly,"" Hoback said, speaking on camera to Todd and Adam Back, the chief executive of bitcoin development company Blockstream that Todd has worked with since the earliest days of bitcoin.

""I think that John Dillon [an anonymous BitcoinTalk contributor that some believe to have been linked to the intelligence community] was created so you would have an excuse to make replace-by-fee, a concept you had envisioned years earlier but needed some kind of cover in order to make, and you also needed some cover for the 2010 post,"" Hoback told Todd, referring to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 125 introduced by Todd in 2015 and a 2010 BitcoinTalk post replying to Satoshi Nakamoto that Hoback believes was accidentally posted using Todd's profile.

Hoback's theory relies on a chat log message written by Todd in which he claims to be the ""world's leading expert on how to sacrifice your bitcoins ... I've done one such sacrifice and I did it by hand,"" Todd wrote.

Hoback characterized the message as an ""admission"" by Todd that he destroyed his ability to access the 1.1 million bitcoin believed to be held by Satoshi Nakamoto, something Todd denies.

""It's ludicrous,"" Todd told Hoback, also denying he's John Dillon. ""This is going to be very funny when you put this into the documentary and a bunch of bitcoiners watch it.""

Ahead of the documentar airing, leaked clips appeared online, spreading on the social media site X.

In a statement to Coindesk, Todd denied he's Satoshi Nakamoto, saying Hoback is ""grasping at straws.""

Todd is a Canadian who started contributing to bitcoin's code in 2012 and describes himself as a ""cryptochronomancer"" on X.

During bitcoin's so-called blocksize war, waged from August 2015 to November 2017, Todd was on the side of the ""small blockers"" -- along with Adam Back and Blockstream -- who wanted to keep bitcoin's 1 megabyte limit, arguing against the ""big blockers"" who wanted to increase the block size to enable cheaper and faster transactions.

The small blockers won, forcing those who had opted to increase the blocksize to ""fork"" from bitcoin, creating the bitcoin cash cryptocurrency.

Todd is the founder of OpenTimestamps, an open-source project designed to provide a standard format for blockchain timestamping.

He has worked on so-called ""bitcoin 2.0"" projects, including Counterparty, Mastercoin and Colored Coins and was involved in the launch of privacy coin zcash in 2016 alongside NSA whistle blower Edward Snowden -- publicly destroying the computer he used to create the cryptocurrency.

In 2019, Todd was accused of sexual misconduct by privacy-tech expert Isis Lovecruft, a developer of the Tor identity-masking onion browser, settling his defamation suit filed in response to the allegation in 2020."
Some Indian American Democrats see themselves in Harris. Others see the limits,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5131223/some-indian-american-democrats-see-themselves-in-harris-others-see-the-limits,2024-10-08T21:57:10Z,"In the warm Georgia heat, Kannan Udayarajan is sipping chai and talking politics at an Indian restaurant in a small strip mall in suburban Atlanta.

There used to be only one Indian restaurant here, Udayarajan says, in this corner of adjoining suburbs at the edge of Forsyth County.

""Now in a 10 mile radius we probably have 40 to 50 at a minimum.""

The exponential rise in Indian restaurants follows a wave of Desi immigrants here. Desi is a term many people from the South Asian diaspora use to describe themselves. These immigrants are no longer primarily landing in traditional South Asian strongholds, like California and New York, but are also reshaping states like Texas and Georgia, helping transform metropolitan suburbs into some of the most diverse spaces in American life. Indian Americans now make up the second largest immigrant population in the United States.

Udayarajan says he's been a political junkie ever since he came to America for work in 2007. He hadn't planned to stay, but he got married and had kids, and in 2018 he became a citizen. Still, he didn't get involved in local politics until 2020, when former President Donald Trump was running for his second term. Udayarajan organized in his own community, helping register Indian Americans to vote, sometimes teaching them about American democracy.

""Joe Biden won Georgia by 11,780 votes,"" he says. ""And Forsyth County polled16,000 brand new Democratic votes in that election. So we made an impact.""

South Asians are one of the most progressive Asian American communities, a realignment that dates back to 9/11 and the policies and racial animus that followed. A recent Pew Research Center study found that 68 percent of Indian registered voters identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning.

Two years ago, Udayarajan became the head of the Forsyth County Democratic Party. He says this year, he believes Desis could again make the difference in a battleground state like Georgia.

Udayarajan is joined at the restaurant by Ashwin Ramaswami, a 25-year-old who was born and raised just a few blocks away in Johns Creek. Udayarajan asks Ramaswami if he thinks the South Asians here are excited about Vice President Kamala Harris' nomination for president.

""I see a huge amount of excitement,"" Ramaswami tells him. Udayarajan asks if it's more among the immigrant community or among folks who were born here?

""I think everyone,"" Ramaswami says. ""It's so different to have a presidential nominee called Kamala, right? Kamala is a Sanskrit word.""

A meme circulating on messaging apps and other social media has been hard to miss. The meme goes that in Sanskrit, Kamala means ""lotus,"" but in America Kamala means POTUS -- President of the United States.

""The ticket's been supercharged for the Desi community,"" Ramaswami says. He points out a personal overlap: Harris' mother is from the same village as his mother in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

""People can see the connections, they can see their own stories in her, because politics -- a lot of it is about the policy, but it's also about can you trust the person you're going to be electing.""

Ramaswami left John's Creek to go off to school, and then work. Now he's returned and is making a run for Georgia state Senate. He's part of another growing group -- young South Asian Americans running for office.

At the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this past summer, South Asians gathered everywhere: Delegate meetups and happy hours and networking lunches.

""For all the years that I've been involved in politics, I've been part of the broader Asian American community,"" says Ann Lata Kalayil, co-founder of the South Asian American Policy and Research Institute. ""But more recently, we've started talking about South Asian Americans."" She points out the number of times she heard ""Indian American"" mentioned on the DNC stage and in the media to describe Harris. ""There's a real sense of pride, you know?""

Deep Singh Badhesha grew up in predominantly white Colorado Springs, Colo.

""I was the only South Asian there,"" he says. ""I was always trying to find my identity, but it was hard,"" he says, because no one at school looked like him. He describes experiencing a classic Asian American childhood experience -- the lunchbox moment. ""Your mother will make you a deliciously cooked Indian dish"" Badhesha explains, ""and you'll bring it to school and you open it up and everyone's like, oh, what the hell is that gross food?""

He says when it happened to him he felt like an outsider, so he broke off parts of himself to fit in.

""I used to actually be a super Republican and libertarian person because I used to look for folks like Bobby Jindal or Nikki Haley. And I'm like -- 'oh this is where South Asians look like they're having acceptance, right?'""

Then he went to college and met South Asian peers.

""They instilled a lot more pride in who I was,"" he says.

Badhesha believes things are different now.

""Being in this moment and seeing a lot of young folks in particular who see themselves in the Democratic Party -- who see themselves in Ro Khanna or Pramila Jayapal -- and of course Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket, you know, it's like a huge moment for South Asians.""

Back in the Atlanta suburbs, another group of South Asians are meeting to talk politics, but there is no celebration over Harris' nomination.

""It stings, right?"" says Anjali Enjeti. ""I mean, boy, would I love to celebrate a Black, Jamaican, Indian woman.""

Enjeti says she cannot support Harris because of the Democratic party's political, military and financial support for Israel, and what is happening in Gaza and in other parts of the Middle East.

""It feels like a betrayal that when we finally get somebody who we can relate to in some way, to have them support and enforce a genocide is -- it's just devastating.""

Israel stands accused of war crimes and genocide in front of the International Criminal Court, whose preliminary finding is that it is plausible Israel has violated the convention against genocide. Israel and the Biden administration strongly deny the charges.

Enjeti and Harris are both half Indian, and they can each trace their roots back to southern India. Enjeti says that is where the similarities to Harris end.

""I think identity politics is a trap,"" she says. ""It is a trap to think that somebody's shared demographics or community has anything to do with your values.""

Enjeti is sitting with Farhana Rahman, remembering 2020. They registered voters and knocked on doors and drove people to the polls.

""We were screamed at,"" Enjeti says. ""We faced very real physical threats. We risked it all for Biden to win in Georgia.""

""That same me has done nothing this election cycle,"" Rahman adds.

Rahman says as an Indian American Muslim, she believes another Trump presidency is a ""existential threat to democracy,"" even potentially to her own safety. But she says she doesn't feel safe now. She says she's afraid to speak out against the conflict in Gaza and she's reluctant to tell colleagues and acquaintances that she is Muslim.

""I feel like I have to hide my identity,"" she says. ""It's unfortunate, but the level of Islamophobia, just making it so prevalent -- people can say horrible things to Muslims, and it's completely okay.""

She believes she has faced more Islamophobia and repression in the past year than she did after 9/11.

""After October 7th, it has become extremely dividing to the point where being a Muslim automatically means you are pro-Hamas and [an] anti-Semite.""

Rahman says she still doesn't know who she will vote for on Election Day, but she says the options only fill her with sadness and fear."
Inside Project 2025 And Its Connection To Donald Trump,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2024/10/08/inside-project-2025-and-its-connection-to-donald-trump/,2024-10-08T20:15:42Z,"There has been a lot of discussion about Trump's connection to Project 2025, a 922-page document, written by the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation. Is the Democrat's assertion that Trump is connected to the effort, correct? What does Project 2025 actually say? Project 2025 contains a multitude of items, more than we can cover in this article.

Is Trump connected to Project 2025? According to the slightly left leaning newspaper USA Today, this is a false assertion (read more here). The slightly right leaning NY Post also refutes the notion that Trump is connected to it. CNN has gone on record to say that Harris has made false claims about Trump and Project 2025. She said Trump, if elected, would cut Social Security. While the document says very little about Social Security, it does not propose cuts in the program (read more here).

Why then are Democrats claiming a Trump connection to Project 2025? In this hotly contested political race, each party is looking for ways to attack the credibility of the other and instill fear in the electorate to garner votes. To accomplish this, each party has made assertions about their opponent with the hope that it will resonate in the minds of undecided voters. While there may be several reasons to be hesitant about a second Trump presidency, his connection to Project 2025 or lack thereof, isn't one of them. What is true about Project 2025? Here's what I found after reading much of the 922-page document.

The Heritage Foundation published Project 2025 in 2023. There were 34 authors, 276 contributors, and 2 editors. Among the contributors, about 71% of them worked for the federal government during the first Trump administration. Some worked closely with Trump himself.

What prompted the creation of Project 2025? The premise behind it is that the federal government is far too powerful and too inefficient. This is a widely held belief among Americans. However, there are a few items in the document that run contrary to the Democrats agenda. For example, Project 2025 would restore the definition of ""sex"" as ""biological sex at birth"" instead of ""sexual orientation and gender identity."" According to a Pew research poll from May 2022, 60% of those polled believe gender is determined by the sex assigned at birth. Yet, Democrats continue to define sex as ones ""sexual orientation and gender identity."" Thus, the document states, ""The CDC should immediately end its collection of data on gender identity, which legitimizes the unscientific notion that men can become women (and vice versa)...""

Another example involves abortion. Liberals promote abortion as health care. The Project 2025 document (page 455) states, ""It should fund studies into the risks and complications of abortion and ensure that it corrects and does not promote misinformation regarding the comparative health

and psychological benefits of childbirth versus the health and psychological risks of intentionally taking a human life through abortion."" Conservatives see the issue as more than a woman's right to choose. They see abortion as the taking of life. In general, conservatives are against abortion but do believe exceptions to protect the life of the mother, rape, incest are appropriate.

Project 2025 also exposes some conflicts of interest in the federal government. One such conflict is found in the National Institute of Health (NIH). It states, ""In 2018, it was revealed that a $100 million NIH study on the benefits of moderate drinking was funded by the beer and liquor industry."" It also points out how the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) owns half of the patent for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, among thousands of other pharma patents. It goes on to say that several NIH employees personally receive up to $150,000 per year from Moderna vaccine sales.

Project 2025 does have some controversial items within the document, but its overarching theme is that government has become too large, too inefficient, and there are too many agencies whose actions go well beyond their charter. In short, the document makes suggestions that would reorganize the federal bureaucracy, returning agencies to their original mandates.

Democrats have suggested Trump will enact its provisions if elected in November. While Trump may indeed implement some of the provisions of Project 2025, many of them are standard conservative ideals and not something from a horror movie as Democrats have suggested."
Garth Brooks tells fans 'this thing is on' as he gears up to fight rape accusations,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/garth-brooks-tells-fans-this-thing-on-gears-up-fight-rape-accusations,2024-10-08T20:05:33Z,"Fox News' Chanley Painter reports the latest on the accusations and the country star's response.

Country singer Garth Brooks is speaking out for the first time since denying allegations of rape made by his former makeup artist last week.

The musician spoke candidly during his livestreamed weekly chat with fans, Inside Studio G, expressing his expectations going forward regarding legal proceedings.

""Lot's happened in the last two weeks. Let's address the elephant in the room, shall we?"" Brooks began.

GARTH BROOKS ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT IN LATEST CONTROVERSY TO PLAGUE COUNTRY MUSIC SUPERSTAR

""This thing is on. It's gonna happen, and people are telling me it could be up to two years, OK?"" Brooks said of fighting the accusations. ""So my suggestion is, we all take a deep breath, we all just kind of settle in, and let's hold hands and take a trip together.""

""Because it is something that you cannot talk about... that's all we can say about it.""

""This thing is on. It's gonna happen, and people are telling me it could be up to two years.""

""So for those who joined us tonight to hear about that, I bid you a wonderful rest of your night, cause that's the last we can say about it. And for those people who want to stick around, holy cow people, Habitat [for Humanity]? I saw a different side of my bride [Trisha Yearwood] at Habitat. She was the power tool queen, and I gotta tell you guys, this might have been one of the greatest Vegas weekends too,"" he added.

Brooks' filed his own complaint against ""Roe"" for extortion and defamation, among other things, a month prior to her filing. In the document obtained by Fox News Digital, filed under ""John Doe,"" Brooks denied the woman's claims.

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Brooks said for the past two months he had been ""hassled to no end with threats, lies, and tragic tales of what my future would be if I did not write a check for many millions of dollars.""

""It has been like having a loaded gun waved in my face,"" he stated.

""Hush money, no matter how much or how little, is still hush money. In my mind, that means I am admitting to behavior I am incapable of - ugly acts no human should ever do to another. We filed suit against this person nearly a month ago to speak out against extortion and defamation of character. We filed it anonymously for the sake of families on both sides. I want to play music tonight. I want to continue our good deeds going forward. It breaks my heart these wonderful things are in question now. I trust the system, I do not fear the truth, and I am not the man they have painted me to be.""

""I trust the system, I do not fear the truth, and I am not the man they have painted me to be.""

-- Garth Brooks

Wigdor LLP, the firm representing Roe, released a statement following the filing.

""We applaud our client's courage in moving forward with her complaint against Garth Brooks. The complaint filed today demonstrates that sexual predators exist not only in corporate America, Hollywood and in the rap and rock and roll industries but also in the world of country music. We are confident that Brooks will be held accountable for his actions and his efforts to silence our client through the filing of a preemptive complaint in Mississippi was nothing other than an act of desperation and attempted intimidation. We encourage others who may have been victimized to contact us as no survivor should suffer in silence."""

A Florida woman accused of suffocating her boyfriend inside a suitcase prepares to stand trial next week after Hurricane Milton delayed the case.

Sarah Boone's request for professional hairstyling and makeup for her murder trial was denied by a judge last week because of security concerns about those products, CourtTV reported.

Boone, 46, has been charged with second-degree murder in connection with the 2020 suffocation death of her boyfriend, Jorge Torres, 42, at their Winter Park apartment.

Torres was found dead inside the suitcase at the apartment the morning of Feb. 24, 2020.

WOMAN ACCUSED OF KILLING HER BOYFRIEND IN SUITCASE SAYS HER 8TH LAWYER HAS 'SNOTTY ATTITUDE'

The Florida State Attorney's Office released a video allegedly recorded on Boone's cellphone, showing Torres' final moments as he shouted, ""I can't breathe,"" after allegedly being shut inside the suitcase during a drunken game of hide-and-seek.

Boone allegedly told law enforcement that she and Torres drank wine and played hide-and-seek when she passed out in her bed.

Authorities have said cellphone video shows Torres trying to get out of the suitcase.

""For everything you've done to me, [expletive] you! Stupid,"" Boone allegedly yells in the video, Fox 35 Orlando previously reported. ""That's on you. Oh, that's what I feel like when you cheat on me.""

Boone had sought to suppress her initial interview with police from being used during the trial, but a judge denied that request, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

The Power And Prescience Of Octavia Butler's 'Parable Of The Sower' : 1A,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/1210938285/1a-10-08-2024,2024-10-08T18:40:09Z,"It's 2024. Extreme weather events due to global warming have overwhelmed parts of the United States. Water is increasingly scarce. The mass migration of people in search of more livable conditions has caused political tension and border closures. A drug epidemic spreads across the country. And a candidate for president promises he can fix the country's problems with more religion and fewer regulations.

That's the premise of Octavia E. Butler's novel Parable of the Sower, which was published in 1993.

The novel contains a powerful and poignant vision of the United States of the future, one that rings scarily true in the present. The 2024 of Butler's 1993 work isn't so far away from the 2024 in which we'll all currently living. Butler published a sequel, Parable of the Talents, in 1998. Both feature a protagonist named Lauren Olamina, a young woman trying to survive and make a life for herself.

What can we learn from Butler's novel? What makes both Sower and Talents so enduring as a series of speculative science fiction? And what does it mean that our world more and more bears resemblance to works of apocalyptic fiction?"

The wide receiver was arrested on misdemeanor charges of battery and assault of an unborn child, per Athens-Clarke County Jail records. Young was booked into the Athens-Clarke County detention center shortly after 4 a.m. ET. His bond was set at $2,500.

One Georgia football program employee and 10 players have been taken into police custody for some sort of driving-related incident within the past 22 months.

Young spent the 2022 and 2023 seasons playing for the Miami Hurricanes, racking up 939 yards over the two years. He also hauled in 10 touchdowns at Miami before deciding to transfer to Georgia in December 2023.

Georgia athletic department spokesperson Steven Drummond declined to offer further comment on the arrest.

""This is a pending legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time,"" Drummond said in a statement to ESPN.

VANDERBILT QUARTERBACK AFTER HUGE ALABAMA UPSET: 'WE WANT A CHANCE AT THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP'

A woman, who was listed in the incident report as Young's ex-girlfriend, informed authorities that she arrived at the football player's apartment around midnight on Oct. 8 to talk about the status of their relationship.

According to the complaint, the 20-year-old woman stated that Young ""grabbed her left arm near her biceps and triceps and physically pulled her out of his room."" She alleged that the wide receiver was ""using derogatory terms and being demeaning of her,"" before claiming he closed and locked the door to his bedroom.

The woman said she was gathering her personal items when a friend called her cellphone. After answering the call, the woman told investigators that, ""Mr. Young came out and grabbed her from behind. She said that he picked her up and began to squeeze her torso and abdomen very hard. She said she felt like [Young] was trying to harm her.""

The woman was taken to a local hospital after an officer noticed some bruising and redness. She ""had a bruise and discoloration on the bottom right side of her chest where it meets the abdomen. She also had redness on her right flank. No injuries were noted on the arm where she said Mr. Young grabbed her,"" the officer reported.

Young pushed back against the accusations that he grabbed the woman, saying he simply walked her to the door when he noticed the discussion became elevated. He also told police that the woman did not receive the injuries ""from him.""

""Colbie Young was arrested last night after he asked his ex-girlfriend to leave his apartment,"" Kim Stephens, an attorney representing Young told ESPN. ""He did not make physical contact with her in any way that could ever be considered a crime. I expect Mr. Young to be fully exonerated once our investigation is complete and the truth revealed.""

Young has 149 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns so far this season.

Wide receiver Rodarius ""Rara"" Thomas, whose transfer to Georgia was announced one year before Young's, was arrested on misdemeanor battery charges in January 2023. Thomas transferred from Mississippi State just one month prior to being taken into police custody.

Thomas accepted a plea deal, but was dismissed from the football program this past offseason after he was arrested on multiple family violence charges in a separate case. He was initially suspended from the football team on an indefinite basis, in accordance with the school's policy after felony charges are filed against an individual.

""He can no longer be part of the football team,"" Georgia football head coach Kirby Smart said in August following his meeting with Thomas upon the receiver's release from jail on bond. ""He understands that. We wish him the best moving forward."""
Taylor Swift Becomes World's Richest Female Musician: Here's Who Is Right Behind Her,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/10/08/taylor-swift-becomes-worlds-richest-female-musician-heres-who-is-right-behind-her/,2024-10-08T18:05:15Z,"Taylor Swift leapfrogged singer and beauty mogul Rihanna to become the world's richest female musician following the blockbuster success of her Eras Tour, as other female artists, including Madonna and Beyoncé, rank just outside the billion-dollar club.

Swift, 34, became the first musician to become a billionaire solely based on the value of songs and performances in 2023. Forbes estimates her music catalog is worth $600 million, and her tours and royalties have pocketed her another $600 million. She also owns an estimated $125 million in real estate. Her jump to billionaire status was driven largely by her ongoing Eras Tour, which began in March 2023 and is set to conclude in December. Last year, Forbes estimated the first leg of the Eras Tour alone earned her $190 million. The Eras Tour became the first ever concert tour to surpass $1 billion in total gross, Pollstar reported in December.

Rihanna, 36, became a billionaire in 2021, Forbes estimated, largely because of the value of her stake in Fenty Beauty, the cosmetics company she launched in 2017. She owns a 50% stake in the company, as well as an estimated 28% stake in lingerie brand Savage X Fenty. Both companies are named after the singer, whose real name is Robyn Fenty. She launched her latest beauty line, Fenty Hair, in June. Forbes ranked Rihanna as the 74th most powerful woman in the world in 2023. The rest of her wealth comes from her music catalog -- she has 14 Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hits, the third-most of any artist, only behind The Beatles and Mariah Carey. She performed at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2023, a brief break from her years-long hiatus from her music career. She hasn't released an album since her 2016 album ""Anti.""

Jay-Z is the richest musician on the Forbes billionaire list, with an estimated net worth of $2.5 billion. He's the first rapper to make the ranks. His wealth largely comes from his liquor business: He sold a 50% stake in his champagne brand, Armand de Brignac, to French luxury goods company LVMH in 2021 for at least $300 million, and a majority stake in his D'Usse cognac brand to Bacardi for $750 million in 2023. Forbes ranked Jay-Z as the fifth-richest celebrity in the world in April. Forbes reported Bruce Springsteen became a billionaire in June, with an estimated net worth of $1.2 billion. The New Jersey legend made much of his wealth from his music catalog, which he sold to Sony in 2021 for $500 million. Outside of music, Kim Kardashian ($1.7 billion) and Oprah Winfrey ($3 billion) both rank ahead of Swift and Rihanna as the world's richest female celebrities.

As Swift's wealth and fame have ballooned, so has her reputation as one of the world's most powerful people. Forbes ranked her the fifth most powerful woman in the world in 2023 -- making her the highest-ranked entertainer, and putting her in the company of the world's most influential political and business leaders -- citing the impact her Eras Tour has had on local economies and the dedication of her fan base, known as Swifties. Swift was also named the 2023 Time Person of the Year, and she has been considered an influential figure in politics. Her endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris was credited with a spike in visits to vote.gov, a voter registration website.

PIZZA + PURPOSE

Caroline D'Amore's career trajectory has taken her from DJing around the world to walking the runways of Diane von Furstenberg to becoming a finalist on Gordon Ramsey's ""Food Stars"" in 2023, to now being known as the pink-haired activist Pizza Girl,

Prior to the pandemic, her products were sold in over 100 stores, but given the challenges that came with sourcing organic ingredients during the pandemic, she had to stop production.

D'Amore credits her daughter with inspiring her to re-launch Pizza Girl in 2021. D'Amore now has built a successful brand of pasta sauces and a countertop pizza oven, which sold out within days of the launch. She opened a store in Venice Beach, California, with a second location slated for early 2025. Her company champions quality, authenticity and social responsibility. She challenges the status quo, showing that women can lead in any industry they choose, from the boardroom to the kitchen and beyond.

D'Amore didn't always feel this confident. ""Pizza Girl started out of the frustration of not feeling heard as a young girl in my Italian pizza family,"" she explained. She was even admonished not to put the word ""Girl"" in the name of her company. Her response? Not only is it called ""Pizza Girl,"" everything from the pizza boxes to the ovens are pink.

D'Amore started using her Instagram platform to talk about more than just pizza after the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023. By sharing personal experiences from her visits to Israel in December 2023 and February 2024, D'Amore has used her business platform for broader social impact. Her dedication to justice and stance against hate form a core theme, inspiring audiences and showcasing a powerful model of purpose-driven business leadership, ""Standing up for what's right against all forms of hatred is crucial because it inspires others to be courageous in the face of injustice,"" she said.

D'Amore's story serves as an inspiring reminder that every girl has the potential to become a changemaker. She can be found on Instagram @pizzagirl and @carolinedamore and also as a guest on podcasts and stages around the world. Sharing her entrepreneurial journey and standing up against hate, D'Amore provides inspiration for girls everywhere. As she put it: ""Being able to inspire others has given my time on this earth more meaning than I ever thought possible, and it all started with one little video on Instagram asking the world to stop the hatred and calling it out as I saw it unfolding. There is no voice too small. Speaking your truth can take you places you never even imagined.""

ROOTED IN FAMILY

Chelsea Bowers and Emily O'Neill, two native Montanans, are forging their own path. Growing up with strong entrepreneurial spirits, both had businesses rooted in hard work and long hours -- Chelsea with a professional house-painting business and also assisting with hunting trips, and Emily with a catering and Dutch Oven camp cooking venture. When Chelsea married Emily's brother Phillip in 2010, the two became not only sisters-in-law but also powerful business partners.

In 2017, Chelsea and her mother, Denise, decided to start a flower shop in Livingston, Montana. The venture soon blossomed into Rooted in Montana. Though Denise eventually left due to health issues, Chelsea and Emily took a leap of faith. They credit prayer, perseverance and adaptability for helping them transform Rooted in Montana into a thriving business.

Since its inception, Rooted in Montana has expanded to offer houseplants, event florals and custom wedding designs. The sisters-in-law, now seasoned entrepreneurs, have designed flowers for almost 300 weddings and overcome challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which required them to step up their leadership and advocate for themselves and their customers.

O'Neill remembers that time: ""We were persistent when it came to the covid shutdowns in our little town. I actually called the governor's office and said that I thought that our business was an 'essential' business. This was after I got off the phone with a woman whose father passed away in Livingston, and they lived on the East Coast and weren't able to fly."" O'Neill wanted to help the woman honor her father's memory at a time when life was greatly disrupted.

Residents of the town of Livingston were adamant that businesses should be open while being respectful about safety concerns. Eventually, O'Neill heard back from the governor's office that while they could not have customers in their shop, they could offer contactless delivery. ""That was a really good day,"" recalled O'Neill.

Chelsea Bowers and Emily O'Neill's journey embodies the determination that defines so many women entrepreneurs. Their story is a powerful reminder on International Day of the Girl of how important it is to empower young girls to dream big, take risks and forge their own paths in business and beyond.

HITTING THE AIRWAYS

Julia Howe, the inspiring teen founder of the podcast Hitting The Wall, is a powerful example of how young women can make an impact in today's world. While enrolled in WIT - Whatever It Takes, a mentorship and training program for teenage entrepreneurs, Howe created the podcast to shed light on issues that often go unnoticed -- mental-health struggles, societal pressures and the importance of self-care, especially among young women.

Howe's stories of being an endurance athlete fuel meaningful conversations and demonstrate the resilience and strength that align with the values celebrated on International Day of The Girl. Her mission resonates with young girls worldwide, encouraging them to embrace their vulnerabilities and turn them into strengths. Howe's work was recently recognized as a ""force for good"" by Frigo Cheese Heads Build a Bright Future program.

Through Hitting The Wall, Howe provides a platform for voices that are often silenced. Not only does she share her own experiences on the podcast, but she also invites experts and advocates to provide listeners with practical advice and support, particularly connected to self-worth tied to body performance and appearance.

In sports, many girls push beyond their limits, with 8 in 10 showing signs of Relative Energy Deficiency, including disordered eating, menstrual issues, and risks to cardiovascular and bone health. This harmful cycle forces them to prioritize performance over well-being, leading to unhealthy training habits.

By equipping the Hitting The Wall audience -- primarily young women -- with the knowledge and tools to navigate these complexities, Howe is inspiring a global community of young women. Her work embodies the spirit of International Day of The Girl, which focuses on advocating for girls' rights, challenging gender norms, and ensuring that young women everywhere are heard, valued and empowered to make a difference. Howe explained, ""On the podcast, we talk about the things people often shy away from: disordered eating, burnout, body image. We show girls that they aren't alone in these experiences but also give them strategies to navigate them. What we most want to show these girls is that strength doesn't just come from winning races. True strength is knowing when to prioritize your health, your mind, and your well-being.""

In a world that still grapples with gender inequality and societal expectations, the achievements of these women serve as powerful reminders of the importance of empowering young girls. Their stories reflect not only personal triumphs but also a collective movement toward a future where women can lead in any industry they choose. As we honor the International Day of the Girl, let us take inspiration from these change makers and strive to create a supportive environment where every girl can dream big, embrace her unique journey and become a catalyst for change."
Kamala Harris's 'joy' is quietly turning to panic for Democrats,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kamala-harriss-joy-quietly-turning-panic-democrats,2024-10-08T16:59:02Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

In the days after Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential election to be replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris, there was real joy among Democrats across the country. That was not just a made-up media story, I saw it, but with less than a month to go, the joy is gone and a quiet panic is setting in.

In the first week of August I was, appropriately enough, in Harrisburg, Pa. and Democrats I spoke to were ebullient and effervescent at the change atop the ticket. One woman told me of calling her mother to celebrate together the chance at a Black female president.

Other left-leaning voters told me that they didn't love how Biden had been shown the door but that they felt Harris could turn the race around and take down Donald Trump. For about a month, it sure looked that way.

5 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM KAMALA HARRIS' '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW

In San Francisco, most voters I spoke to, red and blue alike, felt like Harris was likely to win, that the Democrats' stalled campaign had called AAA, gotten a jump, and was back on the road.

Harris had erased the lead Trump had over Biden, quickly eclipsing him as the frontrunner and much like a new restaurant opening in a small town, voters were eager to give her a try.

While Republicans and some in the media were frustrated by her unwillingness to do traditional interviews or hold so much as one press conference, her arrogant advisers smirked and said basically, ""So what? She's winning.""

Well, she's not winning anymore, and with her back against the wall appeared on ""60 Minutes"" this week, showing voters the real reason why she is camera shy when it comes to tough questions.

Asked if she and the Biden administration had lost America's influence with our Middle East ally Israel, the veep once again proved herself to be a walking, talking salad bar, here is what she had to say:

""Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.""

KAMALA HARRIS SET FOR EXTREMELY FRIENDLY INTERVIEW BLITZ WITH 'THE VIEW,' STEPHEN COLBERT AND HOWARD STERN

The most generous interpretation of this odd assemblage of verbiage is that she is saying, ""we're trying,"" the more likely one is that she has no idea what she is talking about.

Over the past two weeks in my travels, it has been increasingly difficult to engage Democrats about the presidential race, much like a fan whose team has dropped a few playoff games and who is avoiding the sports page, they just don't want to talk about it.

As one lifelong Democrat in Ohio who I did get to talk to put it, ""I don't know, she's just kind of there.""

It is hard to say exactly when the shine started wearing off the Harris penny, when joy gave way to frustration, but the failure of the Teamsters to endorse her, and the massive union's internal polling showing Trump with a lead seems significant.

It was only after that, that I started hearing Democrats uttering words that seemed unthinkable back in August, namely, ""Maybe we should have stuck with Biden."" Ouch.

Biden himself even joked about it at a press conference, something he is at least still capable of, quipping ""I'm back in.""

Harris spokespeople are busy trying to talk Democratic voters down off the bridge, they insist she still leads in the polling averages, she has a war chest worth more than Fort Knox, and a ground game that Trump can only envy.

These points are all true, and the latter may prove decisive. The Harris movement may be Astroturf and not grassroots, much like her crowning as the nominee, but those busloads of supporters in matching teachers' union T-shirts are the same machine that gets out the vote.

But still, there is no mistaking that the thrill is gone.

It is not clear what Harris can do to reverse the clear trends favoring Trump today, ""60 Minutes"" wasn't it, and her appearances on podcasts, late night shows, and ""The View"" make her look like she is pitching a new Rom Com, not running for president of the United States.

The only answer left may be for Harris to make this fight uglier and dirtier as the clock runs out. If the joy is gone, and it is, the only thing left to do may well be to rage and rage, against the dying of the light."

Harris scheduled interviews on ""The View,"" ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" and with radio host Howard Stern on Tuesday, who have all expressed open support for Harris or Democrats in general.

""I vote we put this woman into that Black job,"" she declared.

Co-host Ana Navarro, a Republican who has supported Democratic candidates since 2016 and hosted night two of the Democratic National Convention, asked Harris bluntly at the end of the interview if she would come back on the show ""when"" she's elected president.

How the Know Your Value contest helped this woman transform into a workplace leader,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/career-growth/know-value-contest-helped-woman-transform-workplace-leader-rcna174426,2024-10-08T16:40:56Z,"Danielle Oceguera, 25, won Mika Brzezinski's Grow Your Value contest in 2018.Miller Hawkins

In 2018, a colleague encouraged 25-year-old Danielle Oceguera to apply for Mika Brzezinski's Know Your Value bonus competition -- a contest that awards $25,000 to the woman who can best articulate her value in a 60-second pitch to the Morning Joe co-host. At the time, the master's degree student had a few doubts.

Oceguera, and Oakland native, had just transitioned into a coordinator role in the talent department at Stanford University, and was hesitant to put herself on stage, in front of a national audience.

""I would never describe myself as a confident person or someone that was willing to freely express their ideas or see value in their ideas,"" she recently told Know Your Value.

Despite her initial lack of self-confidence, Oceguera was accepted as a contestant to Know Your Value's San Francisco event, and went on to win the live pitch competition and claim the cash prize. But she admitted the biggest reward wasn't the money -- it was the personal change that the contest sparked in her.

""When I went into the Know Your Value [conference], it was quite literally such a life-changing experience, because I was, I was just a different person,"" she said. ""I'm a friendly person, but I didn't talk in meetings. I didn't speak up to my supervisors. I didn't want to engage in those types of conversations, or even higher-level thinking conversations, because I just thought I wasn't smart enough, or I wasn't articulate enough.""

Oceguera spoke about her difficulties asserting herself. ""I'd be in meetings and I'd see a problem, or I'd see something that we should be anticipating, but I would literally not say anything at all, just because I didn't think that it would add value.""

Growing up as a third-generation Latina, respecting authority and ""keeping her head down"" were cultural traits that subconsciously followed her into the workplace. ""I was the youngest person in the office,"" she recalled. ""It doesn't come natural for me to speak up ... you don't want to be contradictory, because you should be grateful for the job that you have.""

As one of the only Latinas in her workplace, Oceguera struggled to envision her own progression in leadership. ""It just felt like something very far away, like I didn't really see myself as a leader at Stanford,"" she said. ""And the Know Your Value experience gave me a lot of vocabulary around what my value really was.""

Learning her value helped her earn the $25,000 grand prize, which she used, in part, to pay for her education. ""That whole experience was really pivotal for me,"" Oceguera said.

She received body language training from behavior expert Janine Driver, confidence development skills from communications expert Chris Ulrich, and personal style tips Gravitas founder and CEO Lisa Sun. Oceguera and two other finalists were given a crash course to prepare for their live pitch competition.

Ultimately, the confidence she honed during that time led her to become a better advocate at work. ""If anyone asked about the number one characteristic to describe me, it would probably have been 'helpful,'"" she said. ""So my value was in helping others, but I didn't do very much to help myself at the time. Post the Know Your Value [conference] ... I learned a lot about myself.""

During her winning pitch -- in front of Brzezinski and 600 conference attendees -- Oceguera advocated for ""the voiceless and underrepresented communities.""

Almost six years later, she has done just that. She now focuses on growing middle management at Stanford, helping staff climb the ladder, get promoted and gain key leadership skills. Oceguera was part of the university's talent development team that spearheaded an important DEI initiative to create more inclusion and a sense of belonging for underrepresented communities at the elite institution.

Reflecting back on all the work she's done to help university staff find their own voice and grow their value, she credits her 2018 experience the most. Now, when she talks to young people -- especially from immigrant backgrounds like hers -- she shares the same lessons she learned from the Know Your Value conference.

""I let them know that the reason they're here is because they deserve to be here, and I encourage them to speak up in meetings [and not to be afraid],"" she said. ""What you have is important for us to learn, and your experience is important."""

Montana authorities are searching for a woman who disappeared after an afternoon ride, leaving her horse and phone behind.

Meghan Rita Rouns, 27, has not been heard from since Friday, Oct. 4 around 2 p.m., when she took her horse out to a recreational area about 90 minutes from Bozeman, according to the Lewis & Clark County Sheriff's Department.

Rouns' parents reported the woman missing around 8 that night, after she failed to return home; her horse and a saddlebag containing her phone were found the next day.

Although she was last seen around 2 p.m., Rouns posted a photo via Snapchat around 4:20 p.m., Sheriff Leo Dutton told KXLH.

Foot and drone searches carried out by multiple agencies have turned up empty, the department wrote in a Monday Facebook post.

Foul play as been ruled out in the woman's disappearance, Dutton told the US Sun. The sheriff said that the woman may have fallen into the lake due to gusty winds in the area that day, the outlet reported.

""We believe something happened that spooked the horse to get it into the waters,"" he said. ""We just don't know what yet.""

After a Texas woman was tied up, robbed at gunpoint and pistol-whipped in her Dallas home in late September, multiple Venezuelan men have been arrested and charged in connection with the incident.

The robbery occurred around 10 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 21, after the woman returned from dinner to her home in Bluffview, a neighborhood in Dallas where the average home price is more than $880,000, according to Zillow.

The men are accused of targeting the woman in her driveway, forcing her into her home and tying her up while pointing guns at her head, according to police records obtained by FOX 4 Dallas-Fort Worth. The men allegedly hit her in the head with a gun and threatened to cut off her fingers.

The suspects allegedly used Google Translate to communicate with the victim and made off with $75,000 worth of jewelry, a Gucci purse, a Ferragamo handbag, a Judith Leiber handbag, the victim's phone and coins from a wooden box, FOX 4 reported.

TEXAS MAN SUSPECTED OF AGGRAVATED ROBBERY AND THREATENING TO CUT OFF WOMAN'S FINGER ARRESTED

On Sept. 28, Dallas police arrested and charged 28-year-old Manuel Hernandez-Hernandez with aggravated robbery in connection with the incident, the department told Fox News Digital.

On Oct. 3, the Dallas Police Fugitive Unit executed an arrest warrant in Irving, Texas, with the assistance of Irving Police SWAT and Dallas Police SWAT, and arrested three other male suspects in connection with the same crime.

Those suspects are 20-year-old Yean Brayhan Torrealba-Sanabria, 34-year-old Carlos Alberto Martinez-Silva and 27-year-old Wilmer Jesus Colmenares-Gonzalez, who are also each charged with aggravated robbery.

On May 21, Hernandez-Hernandez pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated and was sentenced to three days' confinement, ICE said. Hernandez-Hernandez was also arrested by Colleyville police on Sept. 19 and released a day before the robbery occurred.

After his arrest on Sept 28, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Dallas placed an Immigration Detainer, Notice of Action, Form I-247 on Hernandez-Hernandez.

He allegedly admitted to the robbery and gave police the nicknames of the other suspects involved, but said he did not know their real names. One of the other suspects apparently contacted Hernandez-Hernandez via Facebook and asked him to meet up before the robbery occurred.

'Joker 2' Flop In 2024 Threatens Worst-Case Future For DC Studios,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2024/10/08/joker-2-flop-in-2024-threatens-worst-case-future-for-dc-studios/,2024-10-08T15:55:00Z,"As I forecast for you yesterday, Warner Bros. Discovery's and DC Studios' Joker: Folie à Deux came in below the widely projected $121.1 million worldwide box office. Expected to be among the year's biggest blockbusters, does the films status as 2024's biggest flop threaten a worst-case future for the rebooted DC cinematic universe?

The $119 million worldwide opening weekend for Joker: Folie à Deux, combined with terrible audience scores and equally bad critical reviews, means it will probably suffer above-average weekly declines, so don't expect the sub-50% drops other successful tentpoles like Deadpool & Wolverine and Inside Out 2 have enjoyed this year.

At this point, signs point toward a final cume in the $250-275 million range, depending a lot on weekday numbers, China's and Japan's contributions when the film opens in those markets, and exactly how bad the second weekend drop is.

I modeled based on a modest 60% decline, but if the bottom falls out at 70% for example then all bets are off and we are probably looking at right around a $200 million finish.

As bad as all of this already looks at face value, the result is worse when compared against Joker: Folie à Deux's enormous budget. Summer tentpole superhero team-up blockbusters typically have equal or lower budgets than this film's pre-deductions $200 million bill, and that's before marketing (although the studio avoided equivalent summer tentpole promotional costs, for better or worse).

A significant portion of Joker: Folie à Deux's budget -- approximately $52 million, according to The Hollywood Reporter -- went to Todd Phillips', Joaquin Phoenix's, and Lady Gaga's salaries alone (albeit to different degrees, as Gaga reportedly earned $12 million while Phoenix and Phillips split the rest at $20 million each).

Compared against the roughly $4-5 million Phoenix received for Joker back in 2019, the pay raises for the top three names explains a lot of inflation from the first film's $70 million budget to the sequel's nearly $200 million budget.

The significance of Joker: Folie à Deux's financial pain is separate from its artistic merit and reception, obviously, and even the fact it was widely panned by critics and audiences alike is likewise still not an objective measure of its value or merit as a film. But it's not insignificant when every measurements align to tell us a film is widely deemed an expensive swing and a miss.

The value in studios funding artistic swings and misses is another discussion, of course, and there's value in discussing it apart from the nuances and particulars we debate over anything else about the films.

But for DC Studios and WBD, right now these are characters, source material, and projects that cost a lot of money to bring to the big screen, and it's an investment within a profit-driven private corporate entity, competing for audience attention and dollars against similar projects by other corporate entities.

That might sound cynical, but I don't actually mean it that way -- it's simply the reality of cinema, and it's always been the reality, however much we often pretend toward some rose-colored idealized Hollywood past.

And however impersonal and cold that math sounds, remember that it represents ultimately the artistic assessments, opinions, discussions, and recommendations among worldwide professional critics of cinema and a mainstream global public. It would be unfair to disregard numbers legitimately reflecting widespread public opinion and reaction to cinematic art created exactly for those audiences and to elicit their reactions. Certainly nobody was insisting that the reviews, audience reactions, box office, and awards were irrelevant with regard to the first Joker film, right?

Negative reviews and bad box office don't take away from the value of Joker: Folie à Deux for anybody else. Measurements of it are relevant to understanding and discussing not only artistic value, but also financial merits of investing in specific films. Especially since Joker: Folie à Deux's reception could play a role in influencing audience reception of forthcoming DC projects, and how the studio might react if they anticipate audience backlash.

Without diving too deeply into the past, WB isn't exactly a stranger to reactive studio leadership abruptly changing course when facing box office adversity. The results of that are precisely why Warner is now starting from scratch next year with writer-director (and DC Studios co-CEO alongside Peter Safran) James Gunn's Superman.

Since Aquaman swam to $1.1 billion in 2018, eight of the nine DCEU superhero movies have failed to reach even $400 million, with half of them taking less than $200 million in total worldwide box office, and two others failing to reach $300 million. The only bright spots for DC on the big screen for the past six years have been Joker in 2019 and The Batman in 2022.

I'm not rubbing salt in the wound, I'm trying to apply some light and some blunt diagnoses, to determine what it tells us about the risk of reopening the same old wounds again compared to healing and moving on. The DCU has the potential for both, depending very much on how WBD and DC Studios leadership react or don't react to Joker: Folie à Deux's failed launch.

Quality is always a factor, but it's also the hardest to measure and most subjective to determine. So while it's true that studios must commit to taking material seriously making sure everyone involved delivers the best film possible, it's also true that everyone involved in Joker: Folie à Deux feels pretty certain they did exactly those things, and they felt they succeeded.

One recurring lesson I've seen across the past 20 years is that audience are less interested in deconstruction of superhero cinema outside of effectively established and recognizable popular iteration first. Because DC did more of the former in their films, it's a lesson most visible in audience reception of DC movies.

Look at the well-received and financially successful DC films over the past 20 years -- Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Man of Steel, Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Joker, The Batman. Those films pretty much delivered (to varying degrees) the expected, recognized versions of superheroes, conforming mostly to audience preferences for those characters and/or superheroes in general.

So the lesson ""make good movies"" is really pointless beyond that. Even claiming ""listen to what people prefer"" suggests pandering and not taking risks, which isn't the right lesson either.

But what is true, and what is a good lesson, is to understand the reasons audiences rejected the deconstructions, the reasons they felt uninterested or ""cheated.""

And that's part of the larger lesson at the heart of all of this: knowing your audience, knowing not only what they prefer and expect but also why they do, and knowing the characters and stories well enough to be able to deliver what audiences prefer and expect in interesting ways that still challenge the audience and even eventually subvert their expectations because you've earned it.

If you prove to audiences that you understand the characters and understand why the characters matter to them, you earn their permission to deconstruct the characters. And like it or not, you need viewer ""permission"" if you want audiences to buy in.

You also need to be sure you established which version you're deconstructing. Because when the approach goes an extra layer deep by deconstructing an incarnation that is itself a deconstructed iteration of the character, then you're asking audiences to take two big leaps of faith with you, beyond even the built-in leaps of faith you're asking when you tell fantasy-sci-fi myths in the first place.

I love deconstruction. Mainstream audiences do, too. They just want to see it within the framework of something larger to care about on the front end, and particularly through a more recognizable version that they care about to begin with (or the deconstruction is pointless).

Whether it's done across several films (the way Marvel Studios set up their shared universe before deconstructing it), or within a single but effective story (such as Zack Snyder's Justice League did for Cyborg, or Barry Allen's arc in The Flash), it usually needs to happen in some semblance of that format when you're making movies about existing pop culture icons.

Marvel did it on the front end and largely avoided the problem of audience backlash. But Warner's DCEU moved quickly into deconstructive territory, rooted in incarnations of certain characters that were already edge cases leaning toward deconstruction. Anyone's personal opinion and preferences regarding the quality and value of that is beside the point, at this level of the discussion. It created a two-point barrier for audiences, and while it only initially slowed mainstream buy-in, it didn't take long to turn audiences off entirely.

Financially, Man of Steel was a success at $668 million, despite slightly underperforming. Batman v Superman did blockbuster business with $874 million, but it underperformed as well and obviously quickly lost audience interest. Then, Suicide Squad did well to the tune of $749 million, and Wonder Woman was a huge hit that grossed $823 million. Justice League failed at $661 million, but Aquaman rebounded as the biggest hit of the DCEU with $1.1 billion.

Wonder Woman and Aquaman were widely accepted by audiences and critics alike, but the rest of those films -- despite being generally financially successful -- had mixed reviews and (mostly) so-so audience scores.

A new DC superhero shared world kicked off with the biggest and most popular versions of DC heroes, at a time when the MCU and the Nolan TDK trilogy put superhero cinema at the top of the charts, was always going to attract initial attention from audiences. But all of the signs of trouble were clear, and studio executive leadership's hands-on approach not only didn't help, it resulted in the franchise-killing Justice League fiasco.

I've already recounted the subsequent nine-film collapse, so I won't repeat that. But what it reflected was audiences having decided the DCEU wasn't what they wanted, and they were mostly done giving it more attention or money.

Now look closely at which of those early films did best, and which underperformed. The films that were generally what audiences expected and prefer in foundational superhero franchises were all successful -- Man of Steel (mostly), Suicide Squad (theatrically, it delivered most of what the trailer reflected), Wonder Woman, and Aquaman.

Before them, it was the TDK trilogy and its moody faux-realism approach that reflected what's always been most popular about Batman -- the notion he's got no powers, he's just someone with resources who trained and wants to save his city. Batman Begins set up the Batman audiences love best and leaned into that. Then, in The Dark Knight, the series deconstructed Batman's assumptions right in front of him, and then in The Dark Knight Rises they tore it all down and showed us its strengths and weaknesses before rebuilding it into something stronger in the end.

But the new DCEU only set up the idealized popular heroes in a few instances, while starting off with deconstruction when it came to some of the biggest and most important foundational characters and films.

The deconstructive elements in Man of Steel, and then the more pronounced deconstruction evident in Batman v Superman and Justice League, seem to have been a case of too much too soon for mainstream audiences.

The studio also felt that audiences knew these characters well enough not to need establishing them more popularly and positively, that deconstruction was possible out the gate. Which it is, and I liked and loved most of the early DCEU films, but being possible and liked by a portion of audience willing to bring their own awareness and preferences of the characters to the table is different from whether it's a good idea that will be successful and embraced by the mainstream.

From there, those underlying disconnects from the audience mixed with soft critical reception and the unfortunate comparison to Marvel's well-received sequels and new franchises. The comparison became all the more relevant at this particular point in time, because Marvel's success was precisely because they were telling stories that mixed the overwhelmingly popular superhero origin template, with deconstructive elements arising later within the larger connected story elements.

After several years of the same sort of stories mostly signaling a lack of appreciation for what the viewers wanted, it seems audiences gave up giving DC a chance -- with two exceptions, that is.

When a new Joker origin film appeared on the radar, audiences saw all of the signs that it was the sort of Joker we know the public prefers, presented in the sort of film audiences tend to favor for Batman and Batman-adjacent movies -- namely, what Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy did. And what Joker did. And what The Batman did (and what The Penguin is currently doing).

Joker: Folie à Deux suffered because of early mixed to negative reactions at festival, from marketing that hid its musical nature while word of it being a musical spread anyway (thus creating buzz that the studio was hiding the musical nature because they feared audiences wouldn't like it), and (mild spoiler) it winds up making many feel like they were cheated or that the film retroactively makes both films pointless.

It shouldn't be hard to look at the films that succeeded, the ones that failed, and learn the right lessons. The only question now is, will audience show up?

My fear is that we are in a mirror of the same moment WB faced in 2013, with a new Superman movie launching a new shared universe, a solo Batman franchise that's a rare bright spot after many rocky years for DC on film, changes in studio leadership, and a rising popular Marvel (again!) defining audience expectations for the genre going forward.

The final mirroring factor to consider is that we also just had a return of the 1990s cinematic Batman, in a film that was widely derided and failed at the box office (akin to Batman & Robin killing off the franchise in the 1990s).

There is a loud warning in all of this, and Batman is sort of the canary in the coal mine. It's not that Batman is a ""tainted brand,"" it's that the DC brand has become so tainted that with the failure of The Flash last year and Joker: Folie à Deux this year, for the first time since the 1990s Batman isn't able to draw built-in audience trust and interest. Joker's own box office draw has been firmly established since 1989, with even Jared Leto's oft-criticized Joker enjoying great financial success in his one-film appearance.

Is the Batman brand no longer safe? Will audience distrust of the DC brand carry over in coming years to even otherwise good or great Batman projects? If Joker's sequel to a billion dollar origin story can't generate enough audience interest and trust to at least have a decent opening weekend, should we be concerned about the future of Batman movies, solo or in the DCU?

I'd like to think audiences will reward The Batman - Part II with another huge box office cume, and that as long as WBD and DC Studios don't meddle or cancel it, the Matt Reeves Batman world could be immune to the other pressures working against DC's shared world stuff. Perhaps the DCU's upcoming new Batman and Robin movie has something to worry about, but surely not the newly established solo Batman?

Sadly, the fact is I also thought Joker's success and its proximity to Batman -- especially as a ""grounded and gritty"" continuation -- was a safe bet. But audiences have told us loud and clear -- there are no safe bets anymore."

Commentators are predicting that Rachel Reeves will unveil a clutch of tax hikes to fill a £22 billion 'black hole' she has identified in the public coffers, when she delivers her Budget speech on Wednesday 30 October, writes Kevin Pratt.

She'll also want to raise additional funds to underwrite the government's spending plans.

The decision to axe Winter Fuel Allowance payments to around 10 million pensioners this winter has demonstrated that Reeves - the first woman to hold the post of Chancellor of the Exchequer - is not afraid to make unpopular decisions.

She's received unwavering support from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in the teeth of protests from across the political spectrum, so it's reasonable to assume she's not going to pull any punches.

Reeves has reiterated Labour's manifesto commitment not to increase the rates of three key government revenue-generators - the holy trinity of income tax, National Insurance Contributions and VAT (although VAT is being introduced on private school fees).

The Chancellor could, however, maintain the freeze on income tax thresholds, which would result in more people becoming taxpayers or ascending into higher tax bands as their pay increases - something known as 'fiscal drag'.

Say, for example, your income is £12,000 and you have no other taxable income. This amount falls within the £12,570 standard personal tax allowance, so you do not pay income tax.

But if your pay increases and you earn more than £12,570, you would then be taxed at 20% on the amount above the allowance.

The same scenario applies with the threshold between the 20% basic rate of tax and the 40% higher rate (£50,270), and between the higher rate and the 45% additional rate (£125,140).

Couple of points to note here: if your taxable income is over £100,000, you lose £1 of your personal allowance for every £2 of income above the £100,000 level. This means by the time you get to £125,140, you don't get any personal allowance and are taxed on everything you earn.

If you live in Scotland, there are six thresholds rather than three, set at different levels with different rates of tax applying. Any changes here will likely be announced in December.

Under the Tories, the thresholds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were already due to remain frozen until 2028, but it is conceivable that the Chancellor might extend this date to help balance the books over a longer forecast period.

The decision to axe Winter Fuel Allowance payments to around 10 million pensioners this winter has demonstrated that Reeves - the first woman to hold the post of Chancellor of the Exchequer - is not afraid to make unpopular decisions.

The prime candidates for a tax hike in the Budget are:

We may also see changes to the rules affecting 'non-doms'. These are individuals who live in the UK but who are non-domiciled for tax purposes, meaning they can avoid or reduce the tax they pay on overseas earnings.

If the Chancellor is feeling particularly combative, she could introduce a wealth tax on the super-rich, although this would be immensely complicated as well as deeply controversial as it would seek to harvest revenue from illiquid assets such as property and other possessions."
"Remains of Michigan woman, 68, who disappeared during vacation, found in stomach of shark",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/remains-american-woman-68-found-stomach-shark-after-disappearing-diving-vacation,2024-10-08T15:47:43Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

The remains of an American woman have been discovered inside the stomach of a shark after she disappeared on vacation in Indonesia while on a diving trip, according to a friend of the woman.

Colleen Monfore, 68, was diving with friends near the Pulau Reong island off the coast of Indonesia's Southwest Maluku Regency on Sept. 26 when she did not resurface, Asia Pacific Press reported.

Two weeks after Monfore disappeared in the tropical waters, a fisherman spotted a shark in distress and killed the creature. Upon cutting open the shark's stomach, the fisherman uncovered what were believed to be Monfore's remains along with her wetsuit and bathing suit.

Initial reports indicated the shark had attacked and eaten Monfore, but a friend of the Michigan woman says that the evidence so far suggests this is likely false.

TOURIST, 30, DIES AFTER LOSING HER LEG IN SHARK ATTACK OFF CANARY ISLANDS

Kim Sass, who wrote that Monfore was her ""very good friend"" in a Facebook post, listed what is known about the case, and how it appears likely that Monfore died of a medical issue during a dive.

Sass wrote that the fisherman captured the shark around Oct. 4 near Timor-Leste, a southeast Asian country which is 70 miles away from the dive site where Monfore vanished over a week earlier.

Monfore's remains were identifiable, according to Sass, which would not have been had the shark eaten her at the time she went missing.

While it can take days for sharks to fully digest a meal, the stomach of a shark ""produces an acid that is strong enough to dissolve metal,"" while ""large bones and other indigestible objects are prevented from going past the stomach due to the small size of the opening to the intestine,"" according to the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Sass believes that the nearly eight-day timeframe from when Monfore disappeared to when the shark was found suggests that the shark consumed Monfore after she was already dead.

""Colleen's body was identifiable. Her fingerprints (again identifiable) are being used by our US Embassy and the local government for proof of death,"" Sass wrote. ""This would not be possible if the shark had attacked her weeks ago.""

7-FOOT SHARK WAS EATEN BY EVEN BIGGER SHARK, RESEARCHERS SUSPECT

Sass said that dive information, photos and witness accounts from two other divers and the group's dive master show that Monfore was in 24 feet of water when the group turned around due to a change in the current. Sass added that Monfore likely had half a tank of air at that time.

""There was a down current at the turn around site, but it was manageable,"" she wrote. ""I've easily done 1000+ dive with this gracious woman; she was an excellent diver. I don't believe it was the environment and certainly not a shark that ended her life.""

Indonesian authorities are continuing to investigate."
Suspect in Madeleine McCann disappearance case acquitted of unrelated sexual offense charges,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/suspect-madeleine-mccann-disappearance-case-acquitted-unrelated-sexual-offense-charges,2024-10-08T14:58:23Z,"Brueckner has not been charged in the McCann case, in which he is under investigation on suspicion of murder.

A German court on Tuesday acquitted a man who is also under investigation in the 2007 disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann in a trial on charges of unrelated sexual offenses.

The Braunschweig state court acquitted the 47-year-old German national, who has been identified by local media as Christian Brueckner, of two counts of rape and two of sexual abuse.

However, Brueckner will remain in prison another year because he is still serving a seven-year sentence for rape in a different case, German news agency dpa reported.

MADELEINE MCCANN WITNESS CLAIMS SUSPECT IN HER KIDNAPPING DRUNKENLY CONFESSED TO CRIME

Brueckner had been on trial since February over offenses he is alleged to have committed in Portugal between 2000 and 2017. Defense lawyers had pointed to what they labeled a lack of evidence and witnesses who weren't credible, and suggested he might not have been charged if he hadn't also been a suspect in the McCann case.

Prosecutors had argued he should be given a 15-year prison sentence and kept in preventive detention once he has served it.

""The evidence we had was not enough to convict the defendant,"" presiding judge Uta Engemann said, according to dpa, adding that ""we were dealing with unreliable witnesses, some of whom deliberately lied to the court.""

Engemann argued that witnesses had been influenced in their statements by the media's reporting on Brueckner, who she said had been ""stylized as a sex monster and child murderer.""

Prosecutors said they would appeal the ruling.

""We believe that the decision is wrong, so we will appeal to the German supreme court so that the supreme court can check the verdict for mistakes,"" prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters said.

Brueckner's lawyer, Friedrich Fülscher, told reporters after the ruling that ""it was foreseeable, at least from the point of view of the defense, that there can only be one outcome that corresponds to the factual and legal situation and that is the acquittal.""

Brueckner has not been charged in the McCann case, in which he is under investigation on suspicion of murder. He spent many years in Portugal, including in the resort of Praia da Luz around the time of Madeleine's disappearance there in 2007. He has denied any involvement in her disappearance.

He is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence after being convicted in 2019 by the Braunschweig court for the rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Portugal in 2005.

The Braunschweig state court has jurisdiction because Brueckner had his last German residence in that city in Lower Saxony."
LGBTQ+ women face disproportionate rates of mental health issues and barriers to care,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5131619/lgbtq-women-mental-health-care,2024-10-08T11:07:09Z,"LGTBQ+ women face high rates of trauma and other mental health problems, a new report finds. SDI Productions/E+/Getty Images hide caption

A leading national survey finds that 22% of LGBTQ+ women respondents have attempted suicide, and 66% reported seeking treatment for trauma.

""The trauma burden in this community is enormous,"" said Jaime Grant, one of the researchers who conducted the survey.

These findings are included in a report released Tuesday from the Urvashi Vaid National LGBTQ+ Women's Community Survey, named after the late lesbian activist. The report comes from analysis of a national survey of 5,000 LGBTQ+ respondents who previously or currently identify as a woman, conducted between June 2021 and June 2022.

The analysis finds that LGBTQ+ women experience substantial health disparities, mental illness and barriers to care.

These findings come more than a decade after Grant's earlier research found that transgender people had attempted suicide at a rate nine times higher than the national average. Grant, who also led the National Transgender Discrimination Survey in 2011, said those data helped improve medical treatment for transgender people. She hopes this report will do the same for LGBTQ+ women.

The survey found that respondents experience higher rates of mental illness than the general population. Nearly half of respondents live with anxiety (44%) or depression (51%). The National Association on Mental Illness reports 19% of U.S. adults have an anxiety disorder and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports 18% of U.S. adults have depression. The survey also found differences among race -- Black and indigenous women of color reported higher rates of disability and attempted suicide.

""It's distressing to see such high trauma rates, but it's consistent with what we've seen in the past,"" says Christina Dyar, an assistant professor at the Ohio State University who studies health disparities in LGBTQ+ communities and wasn't involved in this report.

The survey also sought to identify barriers to health care for LGBTQ+ women. Research shows that 77% of the U.S. population has a primary care physician, but just over half of LGBTQ+ women in the survey reported being under the care of one. Black and indigenous women of color were twice as likely to say they lacked access to quality health care.

Respondents cited cost and discrimination as the leading reasons for why they put off or didn't seek out medical care when they were sick or in need. Dyar says there's been limited research done to determine what exactly limits access to care for LGBTQ+ women. ""These numbers are great to have.""

""Historically, medical spaces have not been safe for us,"" says Savy Elahian, who led the data analysis for this report and serves as a program coordinator with the National LGBTQ Institute of Intimate Partner Violence.

""There's been experimentation [on people], there's been medical racism. It's important to understand the historical impacts, especially for LGBTQ+ people of color.""

Elahian says the medical field is behind on understanding how to fully serve LGBTQ+ people, which can leave patients feeling unaffirmed and uncomfortable. This discomfort can impact how likely it is they'll return to a provider when they're in need, which can be especially dangerous when thinking about preventative care.

According to the survey, 14% of respondents had never had a pap smear and all respondents were nearly twice as likely to have cervical cancer than women in the general U.S. population. A 2022 study found that nearly 1 in 3 lesbian, gay, and bisexual women were overdue on cervical cancer screenings.

""LGBTQ+ women and gender-diverse people are really missing out on preventative care and holistic wellness,"" says Elahian. While community-oriented care can help address certain health disparities, community centers and organizations can sometimes lack sufficient resources.

""[LGBTQ+ people] still need to operate in these larger health systems,"" they add. ""It's a bit inevitable.""

Report authors Grant and Elahian say they hope the medical field will learn from these findings.

""This is powerful data that people need to listen to,"" Elahian said, ""from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to doctor's offices to medical universities.""

Grant noted how the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey and follow-up surveys helped to put numbers to suffering, reshape medical school curricula, and served as a model and resource for other researchers. She hopes the same thing will happen here.

While the Urvashi Vaid National LGBTQ+ Women's Community Survey has been led by community activists and researchers, it's moving to a more prominent organization in an effort to boost its reach and impact. The survey will now be housed at the National Center for Lesbian Rights, the group announced on Tuesday.

""This is enormous for us,"" says Imani Rupert-Gordon, the organization's president. ""We aren't able to fully advocate for our community if we don't know what's happening in our community.""

The Center, which serves as a litigation organization, will look to include the survey's findings in their policy recommendations.

Grant and her team want these findings to go beyond just the doctor's office and courtroom, though. ""This data needs to go to our own people, so they can know the current state of our health,"" says Elahian. To do that, they've made the findings free and accessible to all and hope to disseminate the research through LGBTQ+ community groups.

Dyar emphasizes community-led surveys are often more accessible and tend to reach more respondents. Academic health disparity research ""often ends up behind a paywall,"" she says. ""It can be really frustrating when our findings don't get out there.""

Elahian hopes that community education will foster people's ability to self-advocate in medical settings -- yet another example of how community support helps strengthen this resilient group."
DeSantis administration warns local TV stations to remove ads about abortion ballot measure,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/desantis-abortion-rights-florida-amendment-4-caroline-ad-rcna174387,2024-10-08T10:47:32Z,"The Republican administration is pressuring Florida stations to take down an ad that promotes a ""yes"" vote on Amendment 4, which would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration had already tried to put its thumb on the scale against Amendment 4, a statewide measure that could enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. And now the admin has added to that disturbing trend.

Florida's six-week abortion ban is one of the strictest in the country. The DeSantis administration recently had its election police unit investigate people who had signed a petition to get Amendment 4 on the ballot. Then the administration used taxpayer money to launch an anti-abortion website. The administration also used state money to air Orwellian television ads proclaiming that ""Florida cares about women and families.""

Now the DeSantis administration appears to be trying to intimidate people who have run an ad that promotes a ""yes"" vote on Amendment 4.

""The doctors knew if I did not end my pregnancy, I would lose my baby, I would lose my life, and my daughter would lose her mom,"" a woman says in the ad, titled ""Caroline.""

""Florida has now banned abortion even in cases like mine,"" she says.

Investigative journalist Jason Garcia published a letter from the Florida Department of Health's general counsel to the general manager of WFLA-TV, the NBC affiliate in the Tampa Bay area. The letter, dated Oct. 3, argues that the ad contains a ""categorically false"" claim about abortion in Florida -- and warns that the ad is in violation of state law.

""The advertisement is not only false; it is dangerous,"" the letter reads. ""Women faced with pregnancy complications posing a serious risk of death or substantial or irreversible physical impairment may and should seek medical treatment in Florida.""

In practice, Florida's law hasn't been so clear. Even though the law includes exceptions for rape and incest in certain cases, the law has confused doctors and caused a chilling effect among providers. The problem has been so glaring that the DeSantis administration has threatened doctors who don't provide emergency care in these confusing scenarios, which are only occurring because of the law Republicans put in place.

In another letter Garcia posted online, lawyers for the group sponsoring Amendment 4 defended the ad as true and urged a Florida TV station to continue carrying it.

The Florida Department of Health's letter ""is a flagrant abuse of power and must be rejected,"" the lawyers wrote.

The DeSantis administration sure seems like it's attempting to hide the dangerous impacts of Florida's abortion laws from public view."
Michael Moore mocks Democrats panicked by tight 2024 race: 'Shocking to me' they believe Trump is going to win,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/michael-moore-mocks-democrats-panicked-tight-2024-race-shocking-me-believe-trump-going-win,2024-10-08T10:44:31Z,"Liberal filmmaker and activist Michael Moore mocked Democrats worrying about the tight 2024 race, saying he found it hard to believe former President Trump could win election.

Liberal filmmaker and activist Michael Moore knocked Democrats who are panicking over the tight 2024 presidential race, admitting he's stunned that people on the left believe former President Trump could win the election.

""Democrats, they're such a frightened group of people,"" Moore said during a Monday interview on CNN. ""I mean, they still think that Trump is going to win.""

""This is kind of shocking to me. Like, don't you live with people? Are you not aware that there's going to be a tsunami of women voting between now and Election Day?"" he said, referring to backlash over the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022.

""Anybody who thinks women are going to stay home, that women are going to stay home -- Do you not know any women? Do you not live with a woman?"" Moore continued.

MICHAEL MOORE WARNS KAMALA HARRIS TO NOT GO 'CENTRIST'

CNN anchor Brianna Keilar asked Moore if he believed polling which shows the race is close.

According to the latest national Fox News poll from September, Harris currently holds a two-point edge over Trump with voters.

""I don't think it's a dead heat,"" Moore responded. He clarified that while he wasn't outright dismissing polling, he had more faith in surveys that questioned voters on the issues, rather than the candidates.

He pointed to polling misses from the 2016 campaign, such as when The New York Times predicted on Election Day, 2016, that Hillary Clinton had an 85% chance at winning the presidential election.

""No, I don't think people should be running their lives based on these polls,"" he said.

BLUE PHILLY WORKING-CLASS VOTERS START LEANING TOWARD TRUMP AHEAD OF THE ELECTION: 'PEOPLE ACTUALLY LOVE HIM'

Moore ripped Democrats pushing Harris to the center because of these concerns, arguing that the VP's progressive policy positions on abortion, the environment, guns and jobs are actually in the mainstream.

""You mentioned Democrats who want [Harris] to 'tone it down,'"" Moore continued. ""That's something women have been told for decades.""

""The reason she's so progressive -- because she believes in a woman's right to choose, she believes a 14-year-old shouldn't take an assault rifle to school....you go down all her positions and they line up exactly with where the majority of Americans are at,"" he continued.

""The majority of Americans believe climate change is real. The majority of Americans believe the minimum wage is too low. Just go down the list,"" Moore argued.

""The majority of Americans want regulation. They want people to be making sure that, when you have a hurricane and only 1% of the people have flood insurance -- That's not the country I live in. That's not the country I'm going to live in, where people now are suffering because of this,"" he said, referring to devastation from Hurricane Helene.

Last week, Moore warned Harris to not ""move to the center"" or it could backfire for Democrats.

""If Harris is advised by her wealthy donors to shun the left and drop her more progressive positions in favor of a 'move to the center,'"" Moore warned in a post on Substack, that could ""reduce or depress the vote."""
'Fresh Kill' imagined a contaminated city. 30 years later it feels spot-on,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5132641/fresh-kill-staten-island-shu-lea-cheang-film,2024-10-08T09:02:14Z,"Filmmaker Shu Lea Cheang, 70, had been on the road for about two weeks of a month-long road trip across the United States when she met a reporter in Ann Arbor before a screening of her 1994 experimental film Fresh Kill.

""When the film first came out, many people didn't quite get it,"" Cheang said. She wore bright orange trousers and her white hair was cropped close to her scalp.

Fresh Kill is neither a horror movie nor a documentary. It's an experimental film, taking its name from the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island that, at its peak, took in about 29,000 tons of garbage every day. The ginormous landfill is now a park.

The film has aged well. Its surreal, sci-fi inflected story of pollution and environmental inequality feels prescient, and the film's vision of a contaminated city is scathing, funny and surreal. Characters include concerned lesbian moms, eco-terrorists and wealthy business bros who snack on sushi that turns their skin glowing green.

Shu Lea Cheang is a leading new media and multimedia artist, who's exhibited at museums all over the country, including the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. She was the first to create a web-based artwork for the Guggenheim Museum and won this year's LG Guggenheim Award.

Cheang joined New York's vibrant downtown theater scene in the 1980s after moving there from Taiwan. Fresh Kill is filled with many of its faces, including George C. Wolfe (former artistic director of the Public Theater), and National Book Award finalist Jessica Hagedorn, who also wrote Fresh Kill's screenplay. The soundtrack is by Vernon Reid, who founded the band Living Colour. New York rents have priced out Cheang, who now lives in Paris though she has been for decades an American citizen.

New York University, which holds Cheang's archives, recently restored the original 35mm film.

That's when Cheang decided to take her film on a road trip, to be screened across the country. ""I wrote to every cinema that had 35mm projection capacity,"" she said. ""So romantic, right?""

Jazz Jones, who is one of two young filmmakers traveling with Cheang, met her last year at a Florida film festival where he first saw her one of her movies.

""I was just like, this is freaking insane. I have to talk to this woman,"" he recalled. ""And she starts talking about this trip and I'm like, 'Can I be your driver?'""

Jean-Paul Jones, who is also accompanying Cheang, is a projectionist in addition to being a filmmaker, a useful skill on a trip when the film print is handed off and inspected at 21 theaters in 33 days. The theaters that have the capacity to screen the film tend to be among the most beautiful and eclectic in the country, including Chicago's Music Box Theatre, the Harris Theater in Pittsburgh and Cine Athens in Georgia.

As they travel, Jones and Franklin are filming their own documentary about the experience, which so far has included stops in Flint, Mich., to discuss the water crisis with people who live there, and a detour for lunch at a Haitian restaurant in Springfield, Ohio."
Woman with muscular dystrophy completes 12 marathons in wheelchair for charity: 'Won't let it define me',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/health/woman-muscular-dystrophy-completes-marathons-wheelchair-charity-wont-let-define,2024-10-08T08:46:59Z,"Born with a rare form of muscular dystrophy, Peri Finkelstein has never let her disorder define her.

Instead, the 24-year-old New Yorker has used her challenges as a springboard to make the world a better place, completing 12 marathons to raise funds for charity.

In January 2024, Finkelstein's nonprofit organization -- the Team Peri Foundation -- exceeded the $1 million fundraising milestone for its Chai Lifeline project, which offers support to families following an illness diagnosis or trauma.

FATHER CREATED A DRUG TO SAVE HIS SON FROM A RARE DISEASE, NOW OTHER FAMILIES ARE DESPERATE TO GET IT

Muscular dystrophy is a group of more than 30 genetic conditions that affect the functioning of the muscles, according to Cleveland Clinic.

Finkelstein's form of the condition, called nemaline rod myopathy, causes severe muscle weakness and affects her speech and mobility.

Despite her physical limitations, she was inspired to start doing marathons in 2010 when her mother and brother began running them for charity.

""After watching everybody do the marathon and cheering from the sidelines, I knew that I wanted to make more of an impact,"" she said during an interview with Fox News Digital.

MOTHER FRANTIC TO SAVE CLINICAL TRIAL THAT COULD CURE HER DAUGHTER: 'THE TREATMENT IS SITTING IN A FRIDGE'

For the first few years, Finkelstein's mother pushed her in a jogging stroller with all the necessary medical equipment secured to the bottom.

Then, in 2016, Finkelstein decided it was time to stand up and walk a few steps over the finish line, with the help of her physical therapist and her parents.

""At that moment, it felt as if I could do anything that I put my mind to,"" she said.

""It was a defining moment, when I realized the only person who could get in my way was myself -- and that it was up to me to change my life.""

'LIQUID GOLD' COULD BRING NEW HOPE TO MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS, STUDY SUGGESTS: 'PROFOUND BENEFIT'

In subsequent marathons, those initial steps turned into walking more than 1,000 steps, then a mile, and then a mile and a half, forwards and backwards across the finish line.

After several years of pushing that ""extra mile,"" Finkelstein experienced medical challenges in 2022 that made her unable to compete.

""It never dawned on me that part of my life would be over,"" she said.

""You have to push yourself to the limit for each mile marker, as nothing will ever come easily.""

""Once I officially lost that part of myself, I realized that I couldn't allow this setback to get to me -- I knew that I had to keep moving.""

Instead of competing physically, Finkelstein now funnels her energy into her foundation's fundraising efforts.

""Since I was 8 years old, my dream was to launch a nonprofit organization of my own,"" she said.

""The same mindset that I used to prepare both physically and mentally for a marathon is what I carry into my daily life as an entrepreneur.""

The Team Peri Foundation strives to make the world a ""more connected and inclusive place for all,"" Finkelstein said, with the mission to ""educate others on the power of inclusion and to disrupt the stereotypical views revolving around disability.""

While Finkelstein strives to stay positive and focus on her goals, she acknowledges that her day-to-day life isn't always easy.

""Not every day is all rainbows and sunshine -- some days are harder than others, to the point where severe migraines, fatigue and pain keep me from doing what I have to do,"" she said.

THE GIRL WHO CAN'T SMILE: HOW A RARE DISORDER BECAME A YOUNG WOMAN'S 'GREATEST GIFT'

Finkelstein undergoes different forms of therapy multiple times a week, has frequent doctor's appointments and is ""always in pain,"" she shared.

Her social media posts highlight the highs and lows.

""My hope is that by sharing bits and pieces of my world -- portraying all the different sides of me, whether it's rather dark or filled with light -- I can portray that people with disabilities can live a full life and step out of line in ways that can change the course of their future,"" she said.

To other people living with a disabling condition, Finkelstein advises them, ""Use your rareness to your advantage.""

""My time is precious and I still have a lot more to accomplish.""

""Growing up, I would give anything to blend in and become invisible, as being 'different' put a lot of labels on me that caused me to be bullied severely by students and teachers alike,"" she said.

""But as I've gotten older, I've realized it's OK to be rare.""

Life itself can be compared to the dozen marathons she has competed in, according to Finkelstein.

""You have to push yourself to the limit for each mile marker, as nothing will ever come easily,"" she said.

""All the pain, traumas and setbacks are what enable you to keep going and keep hustling.""

""You have to power through the pain, because there is no other option.""

Since hitting the $1 million milestone, Finkelstein and her foundation have launched new projects, including a scholarship fund in partnership with Adelphi University, where she earned her MBA in marketing.

She also works to boost awareness and education through speaking engagements, social media and podcasting, and hosts various fundraising events throughout the year.

Finkelstein plans to write and publish a memoir to share her life's journey with the world.

""While I used to be an athlete, I am still just as competitive and am somewhat of an overachiever in the real world,"" Finkelstein said.

The entrepreneur is also acutely aware that life is short.

Meghan Markle's daring plan to win over Hollywood amid royal drama: expert,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/meghan-markles-daring-plan-win-over-hollywood-royal-drama-expert,2024-10-08T08:07:08Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Meghan Markle displayed a bold new look for a surprise appearance, a move that some royal watchers claim was part of a master plan to win over Hollywood.

On Saturday, the Duchess of Sussex was a glamorous guest at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles 2024 gala. The 43-year-old walked the red carpet solo as Prince Harry was absent at the event. The Duke of Sussex was in the African Kingdom of Lesotho this week.

The mother of two recycled her plunging red Carolina Herrera gown, which she originally wore in 2021 when she and Harry attended the Salute to Freedom gala honoring veterans in New York City.

PRINCE HARRY'S NYC TRIP WITHOUT MEGHAN MARKLE CAN HELP HIM BOOST REPUTATION AFTER ROYAL DRAMA: EXPERTS

""Meghan's ultimate aim seems to be to make herself relevant and to transform herself into American royalty who is admired and powerful, independent of her husband,"" psychotherapist Dr. Robi Ludwig told Fox News Digital. ""Whether this will be successful remains to be seen, as the public has not always been receptive to many aspects of her character and personality.""

""Wearing red is a powerful, boss lady color,"" she shared. ""It says, 'I'm here, I'm not hiding, and I'm ready to assume my position of power.' Wearing red often symbolizes attraction, confidence and empowerment.

""The 'red dress effect' studies found that red enhances the male gaze and encourages men to find women wearing red more appealing. In fashion, red is also considered a power color that represents strength and determination. The hair is a throwback to her Hollywood actress days. It's all in sync with Meghan taking control of her life and doing things her way again.""

Meghan's appearance came shortly after a friend told People magazine that a ""twin-track approach is evolving for Duke and Duchess of Sussex as they take on individual projects.""

While Harry has been supporting his philanthropic passions both in New York City and in Africa, Meghan is gearing up to launch a new Netflix show and lifestyle brand, American Riviera Orchard.

""The Duke and Duchess have now hit their stride as individuals, not just as a couple,"" an insider told the outlet. ""The duke appears focused on his patronage work and the duchess focused on her entrepreneurial track.""

Several royal experts told Fox News Digital that the couple is now working individually to boost their brands. British royals expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News Digital the duchess in particular has been unpopular with the U.K. press since she and Harry decided to step back as senior royals in 2020.

""Sadly, she has squandered both the support of the British public, which greeted her with open arms and adoration, as well as the celebrity status she originally garnered in the U.S.,"" Fordwich said.

Ludwig claimed that Meghan is looking to revamp her image, especially in Hollywood where she's looking to expand her business empire.

""Meghan Markle seems to be constantly strategizing to achieve more -- more fame, more power, more popularity, and more wealth,"" Ludwig explained. ""Her goal appears to be establishing herself as a global brand, aiming to be the most famous and influential woman in the room. However, she may have realized that being high-profile comes with its challenges. Fame can be a double-edged sword; while it can attract admiration, it can also invite criticism and disdain. The unconditional adoration she may have hoped for is not a given.""

""She may be considering ways to re-imagine her public persona,"" she said. ""Meghan might be... curious to explore what happens when she steps out on her own.""

Kinsey Schofield, host of the To Di For Daily podcast, pointed out to Fox News Digital that the mother of two has a long way to go before she wins over the public on both sides of the Atlantic.

An unnamed source recently spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's staff, labeling Meghan a ""dictator in high heels"" who has reduced ""grown men to tears.""

Fox News Digital reached out to a spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. It is understood that Josh Kettler, the couple's former chief of staff who left the position after three months in August, was hired on a trial basis. The decision to part ways was described as ""mutual,"" with both sides agreeing it wasn't the right fit.

Several former and current staff members have since come forward to Us Weekly, defending the couple and their work ethic.

""I think Prince Harry and Meghan Markle seem incredibly lost when it comes to their purpose, but Harry comes off far more confident,"" Schofield claimed. ""There are a significant number of people that question Harry and Meghan's sincerity when they flipped a switch almost overnight from selling family secrets to showing up at charity events. It does not seem authentic... This strategy looks like a desperate attempt to get back into everyone's good graces. For a lot of royalists, it would be too little, too late.""

""I agree with the theories that Prince Harry is doing more solo events because the public responds better to him alone,"" Schofield claimed. ""Perhaps if Harry's team nurtures that love for Harry... it will organically and inevitably seep over to his wife. And I think the theory that this is his way of expressing that Meghan is not his boss is also a fair observation.""

Royal expert Shannon Felton Spence told Fox News Digital that we can expect to see Meghan doing more solo engagements as she attempts to win back the public and earn positive press.

""She looked great, better than she has in years,"" said Felton Spence about Meghan's latest appearance.

""The hair and makeup were very USA Network Meghan, which I think is interesting,"" she noted about Meghan's ""Suits"" years.

""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex seem to be embracing a new PR strategy that focuses on their strengths, and it's a smart move.

""Prince Harry looked like his old self at the UN General Assembly, where his passion for global causes shone through -- a return to the grounded, purpose-driven image many admire. Meanwhile, Meghan's recent appearance on the red carpet in LA was a clear nod to her roots, showcasing the same style and charisma that made her a popular cable TV actress.""

""This approach allows them to capitalize on the very qualities that first made them popular -- Harry's dedication to statesmanship and philanthropy and Meghan's TV glamour and activism,"" Felton Spence explained. ""By leaning into their individual interests, they're not only redefining their public personas but also bringing renewed authenticity to their respective platforms.""

""I just think they haven't had a lot of success reinventing themselves over the past four years,"" she continued. ""And so, they are going back to the elements which initially made them likable. And so, yes, in that regard, the red color [Meghan chose] is bold and confident. Even her hair and makeup - everything about it was more USA Network Meghan than 'quiet luxury' Meghan. People like 'Suits' and Tig Meghan.""

As Meghan and Harry take on solo projects, their work together will continue behind the scenes, insiders claimed. According to People magazine, they launched The Parents Network, an initiative to support families impacted by online harm. They've also participated in local engagements, like the opening of Godmothers, a bookstore near their home in Montecito.

""An entrepreneurial and enterprise focus is going to be more the duchess's priority, and the duke will continue to champion his not-for-profit patronages,"" the friend told the outlet. ""But there will be joint efforts around those cause-driven areas of work.""

""What we are seeing is a functional and healthy relationship with two working partners, not the contrary,"" a royal insider added."

Marston thought there was a link between vital signs and emotions, and that a machine might show that.

For over a century, people have been inventing technology to catch a liar in the act.

The polygraph was wildly popular in the mid-20th century, until science and federal law cracked down. Then, there was an era of Micro Expression Training. Now, there's talk of using AI to analyze the human voice.

GREG GUTFELD: Trump showed the election can be decided on the merits and not under the threat of the left,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/greg-gutfeld-trump-showed-election-can-decided-merits-not-under-threat-left,2024-10-08T03:27:45Z,"Fox News host Greg Gutfeld and the panel discuss former President Trump's return to Butler, Pa., after an assassination attempt on his life on 'Gutfeld!'

So on Saturday, Donald Trump returned to Butler, Pa., where roughly three months ago, he was almost assassinated by a loser who couldn't make his high school rifle club but somehow mastered slanted roof technology. It was huge. So huge, the rest of the media had to cover it. First, Trump returns to the scene of his near death, and then opens with this.

MUSK ENERGIZES TRUMP SUPPORTERS AT BUTLER RALLY, 3 MONTHS AFTER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON FORMER PRESIDENT

Yes, Trump's got charts while Biden's got sharts. Elon Musk showed up jumping around like a human embodiment of the First Amendment. All it needed was Hulk Hogan tearing his shirt off or Kid Rock putting a shirt on. The crowd was even bigger this time around, and it's solemn. It was funny and, dare I say it, joyous. Now compare that to the existential prophecies of a future Trump presidency. A ""threat to democracy, dictatorship, chaos."" Was there anything in Butler resembling that?

Tens of thousands of people from all over standing together to hear speeches that painted America as a place worth protecting, where safety matters, where borders matter, where American jobs matter, where our leaders would actually put our country first. All things that a Harris presidency would make disappear faster than an erection on Bikini Day at The View. That sentence started out so well.

Tens of thousands of people, the people that the legacy media demonizes all day long, people who happen to be in the ultimate swing state, by the way. Who do you think, though, our media is going to blame if Trump wins this thing? Just listen to these chuckleheads continue to push violent retribution if Trump wins.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: This is an increasingly desperate person who's preparing for civil war.

MSNBC GUEST: People right now in the Republican Party are, in fact, actively rooting for and inciting a split, you know, a division in the country.

MICHAEL COHEN: What he says he intends to do. And when he turns around and says he intends to use Seal Team Six or the military within which to round up his critics or his opponents, he intends to do it.

MSNBC GUEST: He's putting in place what he needs to disrupt the process and to create enough tension and confusion that you'll have people on the streets protecting and defending him.

So, you get the sense there's going to be chaos if Trump wins. That's the sense they want you to have. It's less an election and more of an extortion. And sadly, they may be right. There will be chaos if Trump wins because it will come from them. What they're saying is if you win, there will be blood, your blood. It's the mafia saying, nice country you got here. It'd be a shame if something were to happen to it. At least the thugs from Goodfellas had style. Democrat fellas look like this. Think about it. Has Kamala Harris articulated a single original policy point?

KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN FRUSTRATED BY RECENT BIDEN MEDIA APPEARANCES, SAYS CNN REPORTER

Sure, she mentioned not taxing tips, which she lifted from Trump like a Cartier watch during a smash-and-grab. She doesn't bother with policy because she doesn't have to. Because as the woman who babbles on about not going back from her own administration, it's always followed by 'or else.' Or else disaster, chaos, chaos they seem to be guaranteeing. We've seen their chaos in Chicago, New York, San Fran and Minneapolis. Well, Tim Walz, he missed that one. He was busy fighting ISIS in Iraq with exploding tampons.

Now, some of us might be a bit scared, but that's what they want. But you can't let them blackmail or threaten you into a Democrat win because, clearly, this is their last sure sign of desperation. From a side that doesn't have policy or history or even common sense on their side, only threats. But the good news, like Gerald Nadler's deodorant, it's not working. Tens of thousands of people standing shoulder to shoulder in a field that had the blood of Trump and three others in it showed him that. Trump came back like he promised.

He didn't let them set the limits. They took their best shot, literally, then he boldly returned to the scene of the crime. Like Brian Stelter, returning to steal from the CNN fridge. Trump showed up saying, 'Forget it.' The threats won't stop us. So it wasn't just about Butler, but the election itself. By gathering all those people in the same field where a weaponized nutcase tried to end Trump's run for president, Trump and thousands of others showed that this election can actually be decided on the merits and not under the threat of the left, vowing chaos if they don't get their way.

It's funny, the guy they're telling us will end elections and democracy is actually the one doing the most to preserve it. And tens of thousands joined him. They're ready to fight, fight, fight with a prez who has their backs every step of the way. So let the Dems keep telling you that Team Trump will end America as we know it. And if they're talking about the way we've known it the past four years, let's hope this is one time they're right."
"WWE Raw Results, Winners And Grades After Bad Blood 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2024/10/07/wwe-raw-results-winners-and-grades-after-bad-blood-2024/,2024-10-08T02:04:03Z,"WWE Raw, the first two-hour Raw since 2012, advertised Jey Uso defending the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Xavier Woods and GUNTHER defending the WWE World Championship against Sami Zayn.

Raw is the fallout show from WWE Bad Blood 2024 where CM Punk defeated Drew McIntyre in an instant classic Hell in a Cell match. Meanwhile, The Rock returned and Kevin Owens turned heel on Cody Rhodes off-camera.

Last week's broadcast of WWE Raw garnered 1.516 million viewers.

CM Punk cut a promo thanking his fans and his haters. Addressing his detractors, Punk said he turned their hate into cash. Punk then said he hadn't seen his wife in five weeks, so he was going home and didn't know when he would be back.

CM Punk was interrupted by Seth Rollins, who exchanged a glare with Phil and headed to the ring. Rollins instructed fans to applaud Punk and said he wanted CM Punk to get well soon so he could retire him.

Rollins mentioned Kevin Owens' heel turn on Cody Rhodes (which did not happen on TV) and it didn't get much of a reaction. It seemed as if many of these fans were not aware of the social media angle, which I thought was brilliant by the way.

After vowing to destroy Bronson Reed, Rollins pretty much previewed Raw and recapped Bad Blood before he was interrupted by Jey Uso. WWE had to squeeze three segments into one because they only have two hours now.

Fans booed Xavier Woods during the ring introductions, and cheered top babyface Jey Uso. Xavier Woods is heel and he hasn't even turned yet.

Woods dominated most of this match before making a misstep and suffering a loss to Jey Uso. It was a quick match in the two-hour era. Woods refused a handshake, opening the door for Bron Breakker to Spear the hell out of Jey. Woods wanted no part of helping Uso, so Kofi Kingston tried and was speared for his efforts. Breakker then hit a Super Spear on Woods, who is set to officially turn heel any (new) day now.

Joe Tessitore noted this was only the fourth Good Old-Fashioned Donnybrook in WWE history.

Sheamus hit an awesome White Noise from the barrel through the tables. It was a sight to behold and earned well-deserved ""holy s -- t"" chants, followed by ""this is awesome!""

Surprisingly, Dunne kicked out of a Celtic Cross and fans were shocked.

After using a cricket bat, Dunne zip-tied Sheamus and hit a running knee. Not only did Sheamus kickout with his hands tied behind his back, he hit a Brogue Knee followed by a Brogue Kick for the win. As much as Dunne shined in this match, he couldn't have looked weaker with that finish.

The participants in this match were Natalya, Katana Chance, Kayden Carter, Zelina Vega and Lyra Valkyria vs. Pure Fusion Collective and the Unholy Union. This felt like another symptom of the two-hour era as WWE tried to squeeze as many women into one segment as possible.

Early on, the 10-woman tag broke down into an all-out brawl.

Lyra won the match with a flying leg drop to the back of Sonya Deville's head. Considering all the moving parts in this match, they did a solid job.

WWE showed a promotional poster for Crown Jewel showing Cody Rhodes vs. GUNTHER in the Crown Jewel Championship match, but Joe Tessitore mentioned this could change as the graphic changed from GUNTHER to Sami Zayn as world champion.

Zayn and Cody Rhodes had an exchange backstage. Before Zayn could apologize on behalf of Kevin Owens, Cody cut him off and wished him luck against GUNTHER.

GUNTHER vs. Sami Zayn started at 6:40 pm PST. WWE's final commercial break was at 6:51.

GUNTHER was chopping the maple leaf out of Sami Zayn's chest during break, which is a shame because they sounded loud as hell.

GUNTHER hit a brutal clothesline on Zayn, and Zayn kicked out at the last possible second. Zayn then kicked out of a power bomb as fans went into a frenzy rallying behind him. The match reached a fever pitch after Sami kicked out of another power bomb at one. GUNTHER finally won with a rear-naked choke."
How To Be A Supercommunicator,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevincoldiron/2024/10/07/how-to-be-a-supercommunicator/,2024-10-08T02:03:52Z,"Communication is a human superpower. We do it with art, music, words, gestures and even emojis.

Charles Duhigg should wield this power better than most. He is a professional journalist, a New York Times bestselling author and owner of an MBA from Harvard Business School.

Despite these credentials, he reached a point a few years ago where he had ""become someone who couldn't seem to read cues or hear what others were saying"". He sometimes ""only half-listened to my wife"", ""failed to empathize with coworkers"" and ""spent meals talking about myself instead of asking about others"".

I've done the same myself.

Duhigg decided to do something about it. He began a quest to figure out why some people were able to tap into their superpower, and become experts at building connections, while many of us struggle. These efforts culminated in his latest book: Supercommunicators: How To Unlock The Secret Power of Connection.

Duhigg says there are three types of conversation - practical, emotional and social. The first step to satisfying communication? Make sure both parties are having the same conversation.

If you initiate a conversation, take time beforehand to think about the type of response you want. For example, if you're talking to a friend about work problems are you looking to vent or do you want them to suggest solutions?

If someone begins talking to you, figure out what they want. Ask a question about what they've said. When they answer, repeat it back in your own words and then ask if you got it right. That last bit is key - it signals you care about understanding and helps you figure out what they want from the conversation.

The best questions are not about the facts of someone's life (what do you do for a living?). Instead, ask how they feel about their life (what do you like about being a lawyer?). This isn't wokeism, it's getting to values - how someone sees the world, what type of mindset they are in. When you get an answer, reciprocate with a response that reveals something about your own values.

There may be differences, perhaps large ones. That's fine. Follow up by asking why they feel that way, then respond with your own why. There is an astonishing section in the book where people of opposed views on gun control discover their beliefs developed for the same reason - tragic events had left both of them feeling unsafe. They understood each other better after the conversation because they had uncovered a desire for the same outcome, even though they disagreed on how to achieve it.

I mean this literally. We all know about the dopamine hit we get when someone likes our social media posts. That hit - or even just the anticipation of it - keeps us relentlessly checking our devices. It's an addictive process, and one that's wreaking havoc on our mental health, particularly for kids.

Turns out that great conversations also produce a dopamine hit. But the good feeling lasts longer and, more importantly, builds deeper bonds as opposed to stoking anxiety. Imagine if we got addicted to conversing and connecting in the same way we've become addicted to social media.

I don't think that's a crazy idea. Duhigg has laid out a path I think we can follow because it's not fighting our nature, but tapping into it.

One barrier to great conversations and connection is the use of single identities to characterize people. Labeling someone based on a single identity can easily trigger a fight or flight response. Neither state is great for communicating.

Why does this happen? The person being assigned to an identity might not want to be part of that group. Or they may feel the identify excludes them from another group that they want to be part of.

We all have multiple identities, expand the conversation until you find overlap.

I got a chance to put all this into practice this summer when I attended a conference with the theme 'Being Human in the Age of AI'. I knew the conference organizers - Ben Hunt and Rusty Guinn of the excellent website Epsilon Theory - but no one else. Because of this I found myself scanning around for another loner to speak with during breaks. At lunch on the final day, I asked a woman who was sitting by herself if I could join her. Within minutes of chatting it was clear that we were on opposite sides of all the usual divides. I started to feel tense, frustrated, even a smidge angry.

But we both shared a desire to connect - the conference was literally titled 'Epsilon Connect'. So...we worked at it. Turns out we did have common ground - we were both parents, spouses, somewhat north of 50. We had similar frustrations at work! My son had spent a couple of summers near her hometown, even though we lived 3,000 miles apart. We shared our perspectives, listened...connected. At the end of lunch she said, ""well I'm glad we talked, I learned some things I didn't know."" I repeated those sentiments to her.

And the good feeling from that conversation lasted far longer than the dopamine rush from the (35!) likes of my most recent Facebook post about the $46 grilled cheese sandwich I had come across in Napa.

Give it a try (conversation that is, not the sandwich)."

A Reddit user recently took to the subreddit thread ""r/AmericanAirlines"" to discuss the moment which has people reacting.

The user said in a post that although people try to pull ""annoying"" moves on flights often, this occasion on an American Airlines flight gave passengers a ""great laugh.""

The Reddit user added, ""Well, lo and behold, the right seat owner comes up and, of course, says, 'Excuse me, but you're in my seat.'""

The user said that after a few passengers laughed, the ""seat stealer"" got up and walked back 27 rows to her assigned seat.

""Did everyone clap? I would have clapped,"" another wrote.

California-based etiquette expert Rosalinda Randall told Fox News Digital that ""assigned seating does not come with an option to relocate to a preferred seat.""

""People are becoming bolder in taking what they want, or expecting others to back off,"" she said, adding, ""Civility requires a lot of self-control, listening and deep sighs of disbelief.""

If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, Randall recommended first double-checking your boarding pass to ensure you're in the right place -- then seek the assistance of fellow passengers or flight attendants if it escalates.

A 60-year-old man was arrested in Hawaii on Sunday after allegedly stabbing and killing a Wendy's employee, while seriously injuring another, according to reports.

The Honolulu Police Department's arrest logs show that Reynaldo Cheney was charged with murder and criminal contempt of court.

Hawaii News Now reported that the Honolulu Police Department said the incident happened just before 10 a.m. on Sunday at a Wendy's on Farrington Highway in Nanakuli.

Police confirmed with the station that the suspect, later identified as Cheney, was a customer and the other two people involved were employees of the fast-food restaurant.

Police said Cheney was moving furniture when a 22-year-old employee approached him and asked him to stop moving the furniture.

The back and forth between the employee and the patron escalated after the suspect allegedly called the employee a derogatory name, police said.

As the two argued, a 44-year-old employee reportedly intervened and escorted the man out of the restaurant, where the argument continued.

"'Traitor' Liz Cheney walloped by Wyoming voters for Harris endorsement, break with GOP",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/traitor-liz-cheney-walloped-wyoming-voters-harris-endorsement-break-gop,2024-10-07T22:55:27Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Former Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney officially endorsed Vice President Harris for the Oval Office, breaking from the GOP to hit the campaign trail with the Democrat ticket in the key battleground state of Wisconsin last week.

Fox News Digital traveled to Casper, Wyoming, over the weekend to speak to voters about their thoughts on the upcoming election and Cheney snubbing the Republican presidential ticket in favor of endorsing Harris this cycle. Voters in the Cowboy State overwhelmingly admonished Cheney for the endorsement, with some slamming her as a ""traitor"" and ""turncoat.""

""I'm not impressed with that at all,"" Clark Johnson told Fox News Digital when asked about his thoughts on Cheney campaigning with Harris last week in Wisconsin.

""I think it's ridiculous. I think she's a traitor to the country,"" another Wyomingite, Gunner Berg, said of the campaign event.

KAMALA HARRIS TEAMS UP WITH LIZ CHENEY IN BIRTHPLACE OF REPUBLICAN PARTY

Cheney, who is the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, is a vocal critic of former President Trump, putting her at odds with the Republican Party and her former constituents, who overwhelmingly supported Trump in his 2016 and 2020 elections. Wyoming is again expected to vote red this election.

The vast majority of voters who spoke to Fox Digital from Casper said they are no fan of Cheney's and that she would unlikely hold another elected office in Wyoming due to her politics.

""I'm definitely not a fan, and it definitely kind of turned some tables there,"" Dillon Sigman said, adding that he does not believe Cheney could again successfully run for office in Wyoming.

""I think Liz Cheney, who originally was a Wyoming person that moved to Connecticut and then returned to Wyoming wearing cowboy blue jeans and a cowboy rodeo belt buckle and seated herself, completely flipped and became a turncoat. Liz has gone totally Democratic and appears to be down the road of the DEI inclusion and all the other dysfunctional things that are going on in her government,"" said a Wyoming resident who identified himself as ""Ralph.""

""I support her decision to campaign for whoever she chooses. However, I do not think that she is a voice for the Wyoming people. The majority of people I know do not back Kamala Harris or that campaign,"" Alicia Kellch told Fox Digital.

NIKKI HALEY DEFENDS TRUMP SUPPORT AFTER BEING CALLED OUT BY LIZ CHENEY: 'THIS IS ABOUT AMERICA'

Kellch said it is unlikely Cheney would be re-elected in Wyoming if she were to pursue such an avenue, adding that she believes many people who initially voted for Cheney feel ""sold out once they got her in office and realized what her true intentions were.""

Chuck Kucera added in an interview that Cheney is a ""backstabber,"" quipping that a Harris campaign event is ""probably a good place for her.""

John Shelton said Cheney could ""never"" run for office again in Wyoming and that he wouldn't vote for her even ""if she's the last one to be voted for.""

One Wyoming resident told Fox Digital that Cheney teaming up with Harris didn't ""bother"" him and didn't view it as an issue, while noting that ""most folks in Wyoming don't agree with"" Cheney endorsing Harris.

JAN 6 COMMITTEE ALLEGEDLY SUPPRESSED TESTIMONY SHOWING TRUMP ADMIN PUSHED FOR NATIONAL GUARD PRESENCE: REPORT

Two Wyoming residents told Fox News Digital they support Cheney teaming with Harris, with Jennifer Dillinger saying it was ""absolutely amazing.""

""It's amazing how somebody who is extremely conservative, has been Republican her entire life but will support the Constitution and the country and not be specific for the party,"" Dillinger said, adding that it's unlikely Cheney would make a successful return to Wyoming politics as the state is ""too conservative.""

TRUMP CALLS LIZ CHENEY A 'LOW IQ WAR HAWK' AFTER APPEARANCE IN SUPPORT OF HARRIS

Another woman, Randi Chepke, said she's ""thrilled that Liz Cheney is supporting Kamala Harris,"" arguing that Cheney is ""putting our country above her party.""

Chepke added that Cheney's endorsement of Harris will ""absolutely"" encourage some Republican voters to cast ballots for Harris next month.

""I think that she is a die-hard conservative and that she is stating her case about why she thinks it's important to put democracy first. And, you know, frankly, democracy is much more important than the cost of a loaf of bread or a gallon of gas at this point in our lives,"" Chepke said.

Cheney joined Harris in Ripon, Wisconsin, which bills itself as the birthplace of the GOP, on Thursday, and formally endorsed Harris for president.

""I have never voted for a Democrat, but this year I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,"" Cheney told the audience. ""As a conservative, as a patriot, as a mother, as someone who reveres our Constitution, I am honored to join her in this urgent cause.""

LIZ CHENEY CALLS SPEAKER JOHNSON 'DANGEROUS' FOR HELPING TRUMP 'UNDERMINE OUR REPUBLIC'

Harris praised Cheney as a leader who ""puts country above party and above self, a true patriot.""

Cheney was the third-most powerful Republican in Congress from 2019 to 2021 but saw her rising star fade in the party as she launched repeated attacks against Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol.

""What is important is to recognize we just had a violent mob assault the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to prevent us from carrying out our constitutional duty,"" Cheney said on Jan. 6 after Trump supporters stormed into the Capitol.

""There is no question that the president formed the mob. The president incited the mob, the president addressed the mob. This is what America is not.""

HOUSE JAN 6 COMMITTEE DELETED MORE THAN 100 ENCRYPTED FILES DAYS BEFORE GOP TOOK MAJORITY: SOURCES

Cheney went on to vote to impeach Trump on a charge of inciting an insurrection, sat on the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack to investigate the protest and has continued leveling attacks on Trump this year.

""I ask you to stand in truth. To reject the depraved cruelty of Donald Trump,"" Cheney told the Harris supporters in Wisconsin last week.

Trump has meanwhile slammed Cheney as ""a low IQ War Hawk"" who suffers ""gravely from Trump Derangement Syndrome.""

Cheney lost her GOP congressional primary in Wyoming to Harriet Hageman in 2022, a candidate backed by Trump. She has not announced another run for political office, but Cheney has fueled speculation since leaving the House that she could one day run for president.

Georgia high court restores state's 6-week 'heartbeat' abortion law,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-high-court-restores-states-six-week-heartbeat-abortion-law,2024-10-07T22:07:07Z,"Abortion Survivors founder Melissa Ohden breaks down how Governor Tim Walz has changed Minnesota's abortion laws during an appearance on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.'

The Georgia Supreme Court on Monday stopped a lower court's ruling from last week that allowed abortions up to 22 weeks, as opposed to six weeks, as it considers an appeal filed by the state.

The order from the state Supreme Court came a week after Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled that abortions must be regulated the way they were before the ""Heartbeat Law"" went into effect, meaning abortions could be allowed until the 22-week mark.

The Associated Press reported that Justice John J. Ellington argued against McBurney's ruling, saying the case ""should not be predetermined in the State's favor before the appeal is even docketed.""

""The State should not be in the business of enforcing laws that have been determined to violate fundamental rights guaranteed to millions of individuals under the Georgia Constitution,"" Ellington wrote. ""The 'status quo' that should be maintained is the state of the law before the challenged laws took effect.""

GEORGIA JUDGE OVERTURNS STATE'S 6-WEEK 'HEARTBEAT' ABORTION LAW, CALLS IT 'UNCONSTITUTIONAL'

Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed the ""Heartbeat"" abortion bill, also known as the Living Infants Fairness and Equality Act, into law in 2019. The law made abortions after the six-week mark illegal.

McBurney called the law ""unconstitutional.""

""The authors of our Constitutions, state and federal, entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning,"" McBurney wrote in his final order last week. ""A review of our higher courts' interpretations of 'liberty' demonstrates that liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.

GEORGIA GOV BRIAN KEMP SIGNS CONTROVERSIAL 'HEARTBEAT' BILL INTO LAW

""That power is not, however, unlimited,"" the judge added. ""When a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then - and only then - may society intervene.""

McBurney continued by saying a law that prevents abortions after six weeks was inconsistent with those rights as well as the proper balance that a viability rule establishes between a woman's rights and society's interests in protecting and caring for unborn infants.

There were exceptions written into the law Kemp signed in 2019, including rape and incest as long as a police report was filed.

GEORGIA ABORTION LAW: A LOOK BACK AT WHAT HOLLYWOOD PRODUCTION COMPANIES HAVE SAID ABOUT FILMING IN THE STATE

The law signed by Kemp was blocked by a federal judge in October 2019 - before it went into effect - and ruled it violated the right to abortion as established by Roe v. Wade in 1973.

The Supreme Court then overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, clearing the way for Georgia's law on abortion to go into effect.

McBurney, in November 2022, ruled the law was ""unequivocally unconstitutional"" because it was enacted in 2019 when Roe v. Wade allowed abortions after six weeks.

But in October 2023, the Georgia Supreme Court rejected the ruling in a 6-1 decision, saying McBurney was wrong.

McBurney's ruling last week determined that the state, county, municipal and other local authorities are ""enjoined"" from seeking to enforce the six-week abortion law."

A man, who New York City police arrested on Monday for an alleged assault on former New York Gov. David Paterson and his stepson, is claiming self-defense.

Officers escorted Travor Nurse, 40, out of the 23rd Precinct in handcuffs on Monday. Asked by a reporter why he allegedly assaulted Paterson and his stepson, Nurse replied, ""He attacked me,"" without specifying who he was referring to.

When asked what had happened, Nurse said, ""Look at my eye,"" showing reporters his injuries before officers put him in the back of a police cruiser.

""His son punched me in my eye and I defended myself,"" Nurse said, before officers slammed the door.

Paterson, 70, and his stepson, Anthony Sliwa, 20, were attacked around 8:30 p.m. Friday while they were walking in Manhattan's Upper East Side. They were treated for minor injuries, police said.

Nurse is charged with gang assault and assault, a police spokesperson said, while another woman, age 34, has also been charged with gang assault.

It was not clear whether they had attorneys who could speak for them.

""Governor Paterson and his family are happy that these two adults were caught. Friday night was a traumatic experience for the Governor and his stepson and they are looking forward to putting this entire thing behind them as quickly as possible,"" a spokesperson for Paterson told Fox News Digital in a statement without addressing Nurse's claims of self-defense.

Their arrests came after two boys, ages 12 and 13, were arrested Saturday on gang assault charges in the attack.

Describing the assault at a news conference Saturday afternoon, Paterson said he and Sliwa fought off a group of people after Sliwa quarreled with some of the attackers earlier in the evening.

Paterson said he suffered bruises and some pain to his head. Sliwa, also battered and bruised, received a cut lip that required five stitches, Paterson said.

An Uber driver sexually assaulted a Pennsylvania college student last month after dropping her off on campus, before demanding she pay for a mess made in his backseat, authorities said.

Mirvan Dinler, 26, was arrested last week and faces several criminal charges, including rape, related to the alleged Sept. 13 incident.

The unnamed victim, a 21-year-old Villanova University student, had requested an Uber after heading to a birthday party in Philadelphia with friends, according to a criminal complaint. She began to feel sick on the way to the venue and decided to go home, prosecutors said.

She told authorities that she arrived at the campus around 11 p.m. and was being escorted by Dinler to her dorm building.

He allegedly followed her into her room before raping her and forcing her to perform oral sex.

After the assault, Dinler left but came back a short time later to demand the woman give him money for a mess in his car. She handed him her cell phone, and he transferred $150 to a Venmo account under another name, court documents state.

She reported the rape to the university, prosecutors said. The university referred Fox News Digital to the Delaware County District Attorney's Office for any inquiries.

Keren Nechmad & Swell Ariel Or Dive Into Netflix's 'Kissufim'  --  The Israeli 'Dazed And Confused',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshweiss/2024/10/07/keren-nechmad--swell-ariel-or-dive-into-netflixs-kissufim---the-israeli-dazed-and-confused/,2024-10-07T21:01:28Z,"Keren Nechmad didn't set out to make Israel's answer to Dazed and Confused, but that's exactly what she's done with Kissufim.

""It's a happy coincidence,"" the first-time director, a graduate of NYU's renowned film school, tells me over Zoom when I bring up the comparison between her unforgettably confident feature debut and the Richard Linklater classic. ""My intention was just to give an understanding of what it is to live on a kibbutz and how time doesn't really move much. You're just going through life. I really wanted to do an ensemble as well; to show the different types of people there are in Israel.""

Now streaming exclusively on Netflix, the coming-of-age drama takes place on the titular, Gaza-adjacent kibbutz (a collective, agrarian-based community rooted in the country's founding Socialist principles), circa 1977, where a tight-knit group of young soldiers confront an uncertain future as they finish up their requisite military service through the volunteer program known as Nachal.

Grappling with the physical and psychological trauma of the Yom Kippur War four years prior, the soldiers dream of lasting peace with their neighbors, particularly in the wake of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat making a historic détente visit to Jerusalem. Embodying that sense of optimism is Eli, a free-spirited young woman loosely based on real-world terror victim, Elian Gazit, and portrayed by Swell Ariel Or (The Beauty Queen of Jerusalem). ""It's not a war film, except at the end,"" she says. ""You don't see blood and explosions and armies fighting each other. It's very delicate and it's more around the experience of Israelis. It's a film that humanizes Israelis without even trying.""

When it came to playing a real person, Or says she wanted to capture ""the essence"" of the individual rather than get bogged down in minutiae. ""It was more important to share her heart and how she would have lived her life if she didn't die. I focused more on that and after the film came out, her mother and sister approached me. That's the most important thing when you play a character based on [a real person] who still has living relatives; when they reach out and are moved by what you did.""

Like any great Bildungsroman put to screen -- whether it's American Graffiti or Dazed and Confused -- Kissufim eschews the traditional character arc format in favor of an anti-plot comprised of laid back vignettes centered around the bittersweet, yet intoxicating, milestones along the road to adulthood: first love, crushing heartache, wild rites of passage, playing pranks on friends, mocking authority figures, boozy parties, and everything in between. ""It worked against everything I learned and I loved it,"" Nechmad says of the unorthodox screenplay she co-wrote alongside Hadar Arazi and Yonatan Bar-Ilan. ""It freed me from the structure I was taught.""

To foster an organic sense of camaraderie that would show up on-camera, Nechmad made her cast spend as much time together as possible. ""I blamed Covid-19 and said, 'We need to be safe, so we need to just spend time with each other and nobody else,'"" she reveals. ""And they listened. Everybody was getting along so well and they became a core group. Because we spent a week-and-a-half filming on location [on the kibbutz], we all lived in the same cabins. Every night, we would sit together after filming and talk until someone came out of their room and shushed us.""

""It was a summer camp for grown-ups,"" agrees Or, ""which included a lot of going out and going to the beach and drinking and dancing. It was really fun.""

The key difference between this film and its genre predecessors, of course, is that these main characters are reluctantly forced to grow up before their time, having been born in one of the most embattled regions on the planet. It's something Nechmad hopes to impress upon viewers from countries lucky enough to avoid the specter of regular conflict.

""I grew up listening to my father's stories and, as child, I was like, 'Oh, another story from the army, another story of you growing up,'"" she recalls. ""But then I went to the army and I was like, 'Wait, all the stories he told me are resonating with what I'm going through.' This story of young people trying to find adulthood in Israel and maturity in the face of war is a multigenerational thing. You put your dreams on hold or process them in a different way and grow up and learn responsibility; learn there's something bigger than you -- for the good and the bad.""

To that end, Kissufim was always meant to be a timeless story. Despite its late '70s setting, Nechmad wasn't too worried about using period-specific lingo or music. ""I wanted the old meets the new to come to life in the film because it's telling a story that's outside of the timeframe in a sense. It could be anywhere, anytime. I think I could [set] it anywhere,"" the director adds. ""I think I could put it in 2050 -- I hope I'm wrong -- and it could resonate with that generation, [too].""

While it was originally filmed in 2021 amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, Kissufim retroactively took on a tragic significance following the Hamas terror attack in the south of Israel last October, not least of all because the eponymous kibbutz was among the affected communities. As a result, the movie's release was delayed from fall 2023 to summer 2024. ""It's been very strange to see how close to reality it came, especially in Kissufim itself,"" Nechmad admits. ""I kept waiting for a phone call [from Netflix saying], 'Listen, it's too political -- we can't do it.'""

""I think they're probably the bravest streamer in the market right now in terms of films and shows that they're buying and broadcasting,"" echoes Or, who hopes the film can broaden ideological horizons beyond the echo chamber of news networks and social media. ""You get so many different accounts telling you so many different things. But if you read a book or watch a film or listen to an album ... the effort [to make them was enormous]. It took so much work to create this thing, that it's probably a little bit more truthful than a short video on TikTok.""

""We consume art from people that might not think the same way we do,"" Nechmad concludes. ""Our opinion changes all the time. It's not like we're constructed to one thing."""
Gospel great Cissy Houston has died at the age of 91,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/1105956461/cissy-houston-has-died,2024-10-07T20:51:50Z,"Singer Cissy Houston performs onstage during the 2012 BET Awards in Los Angeles, California.

Cissy Houston, a singer whose career began in childhood and spanned generations and genres from gospel to pop, has died. As a child, Houston performed with her siblings, and she later sang backing vocals with Elvis Presley, Aretha Franklin, Van Morrison and more. She was also a renowned solo gospel artist and the mother of one of the biggest pop and R&B stars in the world, Whitney Houston. She was 91 years old.

Houston was born in 1933, as Emily Drinkard, in Newark, N.J., to a musically gifted family. As a child, she was expected to perform at local churches with her brothers and sisters.

""I was 5 years old and they had to put me on a stool in order to see me,"" she told WHYY's Fresh Air in 1998. ""Of course, at 5 years old, I wanted to be out playing with everyone else and it was difficult for me. There was no question. I didn't have a choice.""

Her family group, The Drinkard Singers, became one of the first groups to release a gospel album on a major record label. A Joyful Noise was released in 1959 by RCA Records.

In the 1960s, Houston decided she wanted to sing secular music and formed the group The Sweet Inspirations. Under Houston's leadership, it earned a reputation as one of the best background groups in the business, appearing on hundreds of songs and helping to shape classics ranging from Van Morrison's ""Brown Eyed Girl"" to Dusty Springfield's ""Son of A Preacher Man.""

The group's first album, the self-titled The Sweet Inspirations recorded in 1967, peaked at No. 12 on Billboard's Hot Soul Albums, and its crossover hit single ""Sweet Inspiration"" reached the top 20 of the Hot 100 singles chart.

Along with Sylvia Shemwell, Myrna Smith and Estelle Brown, Houston sang backup for Jimi Hendrix, Simon and Garfunkel, The Drifters, Wilson Pickett and Houston's niece Dionne Warwick, who was once part of the group with her sister Dee Dee Warwick, before each became a solo artist.

An innovative musician, Houston used four background voices rather than the standard three and doubled her top part to enrich the sound. She explained her process to Fresh Air using the song ""You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman"" by Aretha Franklin, as an example.

""'Natural Woman' was like ... you try to enhance what she's done. That's the gist of doing background,"" Houston said. ""A lot of times, backgrounds make songs and really sell them.""

Still, after spending a lot of time in the background, Houston was ready for the spotlight. ""I was becoming an artist in my own right and that's when I left The Sweet Inspirations and became a single artist,"" Houston said.

She was also torn between professional demands and being a mom. Long hours and touring across the country kept her from seeing her children as much as she desired. She had two sons, Gary Garland and Michael, and a daughter, Whitney, who would go on to be one of the biggest pop stars of all time.

Cissy and Whitney Houston were famously close. Their relationship was also one of mentor and protégé.

""She's my mom. She's my friend. She's my teacher,"" Whitney Houston explained on Entertainment Tonight in 1987. ""She's like a little gas station. When you need some strength, you just go to Mom, and she fills you.""

Whitney died when she was only 48, after years of battling addiction and a notoriously troubled marriage. In 2013, Cissy Houston wrote a book, Remembering Whitney: My Story of Love, Loss, and the Night the Music Stopped. The memoir upset her granddaughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, who would later also die tragically at the age of 22. In a since-deleted tweet, Brown expressed her anger. ""I find it 2b disrespect2mymother & me being her daughter won't tolerate it,"" she wrote.

The memoir's treatment of rumors about Whitney Houston's closeted lesbian relationship also led to a memorable moment with Oprah Winfrey.

""Would it have bothered you if your daughter, Whitney, was gay?"" Winfrey asked Cissy Houston in a 2013 interview on OWN's Next Chapter.

Houston stayed true to her roots in other ways. For more than 50 years, through triumphs and tragedies, Cissy Houston led the Youth Inspiration Choir at her hometown Baptist church in Newark."
"'Daryl Dixon: The Book Of Carol' Episode 2 Review  --  The Good, The Bad And The Kiss",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2024/10/07/daryl-dixon-the-book-of-carol-episode-2-review---the-good-the-bad-and-the-kiss/,2024-10-07T20:16:24Z,"When Norman Reedus is the focus of the show, it's pretty good. At times, it's even really good. When he is not the focus of the show, it's pretty bad. At times, even really bad.

This judgement is sweeping. When the focus of the series is on Carol (Melissa McBride) for instance, it's been pretty bad. That's not because I dislike Carol, though I'm not a Carol fan largely because of how she's been written for so long and is once again written in this show, but because of the goofiness of the plot so far.

Carol and Ash (Manish Dayal) flew out of the burning compound last week and this week land in Greenland. Here begins our adventures in absolute preposterous nonsense. As of right now, in the real world, about 56,000 people live in Greenland. It is an island over 836,000 square miles large. That's roughly one quarter the size of the lower 48 states. The likelihood of our intrepid flyers running into humans or zombies when they landed on an island over three times the size of Texas, with less than a percentage point of the population of that state is, well, just about as close to zero as you can get.

But within moments of landing, Carol spots zombies approaching. And moments after that, she's saved by a pair of scientists that happen to have a research station nearby. The zombies are as cool as ever, and I liked that they came out of the turf like snipers in the grass, but everything else around this subplot is just ridiculous -- Fear The Walking Dead levels of absurdity. ""But it's a zombie show, Erik! Why do you expect it to be plausible?""

There are two words we must discuss in today's review. The first is verisimilitude. This is an interesting word and one that I wish more people who consumed media understood, because I would get fewer complaints like the one above. What verisimilitude means, when it comes to storytelling, is that within a fictional world or story, the things that happen feel true to that fiction. We can accept, for example, dragons in Game Of Thrones. But if Jon Snow were to show up wearing a jetpack and blasting fools with a plasma rifle, that would be implausible -- even within a fantasy setting (or perhaps especially within that setting).

Likewise, if a group of survivors who have never flown a plane before, decide to fly one to help another survivor because for some reason they can't just drive across Texas and then they crash and have to fix the plane, despite not being engineers or knowing how to fix a plane, we might find this a bit ludicrous and unbelievable even though it takes place in a zombie apocalypse. I am describing one of the goofy plots in Fear The Walking Dead, by the way.

Every story is different, of course. And there are times when breaking verisimilitude can be an effective storytelling technique. For instance, in the excellent series Giri/Haji, toward the end we get a scene that completely changes the tone and approach of the entire show up to that point, when the characters suddenly begin dancing as if they're in a musical. It's almost dreamlike. Nothing up to that point in the series was at all like it, and I suspect some viewers were rather put off by it, though I found the segment quite beautiful and evocative.

But most of the time, there's a good reason why writers should make certain not to break a show's internal logic, and focus instead on presenting scenarios that feel plausible and true within the fictional world. The Walking Dead was always most effective when it was a gritty and plausible version of what a zombie apocalypse might be like. It eschewed the crazy over-the-top post-apocalyptic super-vehicles you might find in some zombie movies. Characters were flawed and vulnerable. Over time, efforts to maintain a sense of realism have fallen by the wayside.

Of course, Carol's saviors turn out to be bad guys but in the most convoluted way possible. One of the women thinks the apocalypse is Mother Nature's way of cleansing the earth and tells them this while making crazy eyes; I have no idea why Carol let's her load the crossbow instead of stopping her. The other seems nice. She hugs Ash when he tells her of his dead son. But wait! She's actually the crazy one. She tries to force the first woman to kill Carol so that they can . . . breed with Ash? Really? This is the best story they could come up with?

There's no tension here, of course, because Carol wears plot armor so thick it could deflect a nuclear bomb, and Ash -- while likeable -- has to survive because he's the pilot. I'm just not sure why they couldn't have had the pair land at an outpost they saw from above, making their encounter with these women more believable. Then, instead of making them crazy, have the two try to steal the plane -- a perfectly understandable motivation given their isolation and desperation. It's okay to give characters human motivations that don't involve some bizarre ""repopulate the earth"" via what can only be, eventually, incest.

Carol and Ash then fly to France (though logistically I believe they would need to refuel in Iceland and/or Scotland prior to making that far of a flight) and Carol makes Ash wait with the plane while she goes off to find ""her daughter."" In France.

France, I will just point out quickly, is a country roughly the size of Texas (about a quarter of the size of Greenland). In the real world nearly 68 million people live there. Finding Daryl in France would be enormously difficult, right?

No, it's super easy. Barely an inconvenience.

Within this very same episode, in fact, Carol is captured by Genet's soldiers and taken to her compound, and of course people there will know of Daryl. She hasn't found him yet, but it took her all of five minutes when landing in France to make serious headway. What great fortune that she and Ash landed a short walk away from Daryl's enemy! That might be bad news, if Carol didn't have her plot armor on, but since she's invulnerable from any real threats or harm, it's just a stroke of good luck.

The writers of this show do not have the patience or the skill to craft believable scenarios. The only consideration here is getting from point A to point B, and the details are simply irrelevant. I find this incredibly frustrating, because it very badly ruins my ability to immerse myself in the story when I'm rolling my eyes this much.

Back in France, at the Nest, Daryl Dixon returns with the people he rescued. Laurent continues to receive his education, learning language and science and philosophy as Losang and his acolytes attempt to fulfil this silly prophecy and make him some kind of New Messiah.

But my favorite parts are the quiet moments. Daryl teaching Laurent how to play baseball was really nice, and I wish they'd lingered on that longer. While I enjoyed this section of the episode, I still find all of it too rushed.

Losang (Joel de la Fuente) and his collaborator, Jacinta (Nassima Benchicou) need to get Daryl out of the way so they can ""test"" Laurent. Losang's plan is to make it appear as though Laurent has been kidnapped, sending Daryl off on a wild goose chase while they have Laurent bitten by a zombie to prove that he's immune (**waves at The Last Of Us**).

Jacinta has other plans. Behind Losang's back, she orders their men to kill Daryl, removing him from the equation permanently. What neither of them expected was for Isabelle (Clémence Poésy) and Fallou (Eriq Ebouaney) to accompany the expedition. This puts a bit of a wrinkle into the plan, and Daryl and the good guys manage to fight their way out of the trap. Unfortunately, Jacinta managed to turn their friend, Emile, against them and Isabelle is forced to kill him.

They return to the Nest, which is an island just off the coast that's unreachable based on the tides, and there's a very pretty shot of Daryl and Isabelle looking out at the setting sun. These are the best parts of the show, when it allows itself to slow down and give us some character moments and sweeping cinematography, giving us a richer sense of the world Daryl finds himself in.

It's here, when Isabelle tells him that she and Laurent will come with him, that we get the kiss. The two look at one another and then lean in, tentatively at first, before they kiss. There's a pause, but no words are spoken, and Daryl moves in for another. It's quite tastefully done, actually. Moments like this stand in such stark contrast to earlier bits, I get a bit of whiplash watching. This isn't a straight-to-bed type of kiss, but rather one of exploration and discovery. Daryl and Isabelle might become a thing, but they're in no hurry.

I'm glad it happened. And I'm glad the show has taken its time to make it happen. Historically, The Walking Dead has handled its romances very poorly, but hope springs eternal, and I hope that Daryl and Isabelle find solace in one another, and that Carol doesn't swoop in and ruin everything.

Yes, I worry more about Carol ruining things than our wine-slurping villainess, Marion Genet. While our heroes have plot armor, they also function a lot like ticking time bombs, ready to implode and take out everything around them, including innocent bystanders.

Speaking of innocents, it appears the vipers in the Nest -- the religious zealot counterparts to The Last Of Us's Fireflies -- are really going to try to test Laurent, which makes me feel bad for the kid despite really not caring for him or the storyline at all. Of course, it seems wildly unlikely that their evil plan will go through, now that Daryl and Isabelle are coming to save the day, but I'm honestly hoping it does and that Laurent is actually immune, and that this could lead us to a story I've been hoping for ever since Eugene revealed that there was not, in fact, a cure. I still believe that at its foundation, The Walking Dead suffers the most because there is no end-game. We need something to work toward beyond this endless cycle of survive, find community, destroy community, rebuild community, fight enemies, survive, rebuild, etc. etc. ad nauseum.

Overall, this was a much better episode than last week's, though I remain completely disenchanted with the Carol storyline and its wild conveniences and implausible, well, everything. With only the barest effort, just about every scenario Carol has found herself in could have been tightened up and made more believable, and I remain at a loss why the writers hand-wave so much when it comes to creating a more immersive and realistic world."
Down Syndrome Awareness Month: 5 key questions answered,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/health/down-syndrome-awareness-month-key-questions-answered,2024-10-07T20:13:52Z,"CEO of 21 Pineapples Nate Simon and co-founder of Candidly Kind Grace Key join 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to shine a light on businesses that have been founded by individuals with Down syndrome.

As October marks World Down Syndrome Awareness Month, it's an opportune time to learn and support those with the condition.

About 5,700 babies are born in the U.S. with Down syndrome each year, and more than 400,000 people in the country currently live with it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The life expectancy of those with the condition has increased dramatically over the years. In 1983, it was just 25 years old, but it is now 60, per the Global Down Syndrome Foundation.

LIFELONG BEST FRIENDS WITH DOWN SYNDROME TO ATTEND COLLEGE TOGETHER

Below is everything you need to know about Down syndrome and how you can help spread awareness about it.

Down syndrome is a condition in which a baby is born with an extra chromosome.

Chromosomes determine how the body forms and functions. Those born with an extra chromosome experience changes in the way the body and brain develop.

MY LITTLE GIRL HAS DOWN SYNDROME, AND SHE'S PERFECT

A baby is typically born with 46 chromosomes. A baby with Down syndrome has a full or partial copy of chromosome 21.

The most common type of Down syndrome is trisomy 21, which accounts for 95% of all cases.

Less common types of Down syndrome are translocation (caused by rearranged chromosome material) and mosaicism (when there is a mixture of two types of cells).

There are no known ways to prevent the condition during pregnancy and no known root causes, experts say.

NANNY AND 5-YEAR-OLD WITH DOWN SYNDROME SAY DAILY AFFIRMATIONS TOGETHER-'SO EMOTIONAL'

One risk factor associated with Down syndrome is the age of the mother -- for a 25-year-old pregnant woman, the odds are about 1 in 1,250. At age 40, they are 1 in 100, statistics show.

There are both physical and developmental symptoms of Down syndrome.

Physical symptoms include a flattened face; shorter height; short neck; small ears, hands and feet; and decreased muscle tone, according to the CDC.

Developmental symptoms include a short attention span, impulsive behavior, slow learning and delayed speech development.

While these are all common symptoms, not every child with Down syndrome will display each one of these traits.

National Down Syndrome Awareness Month is ""a month to raise awareness and celebrate the many abilities of our loved ones with Down syndrome,"" according to the National Down Syndrome Society, which created the occasion in the 1980s.

""Down syndrome is one of the most common types of intellectual disabilities,"" states the Special Olympics website.

""Down syndrome is one of the most common types of intellectual disabilities.""

""So, it's no surprise that each year in October, we recognize Down Syndrome Awareness Month to raise public awareness about the condition and advocate for acceptance and inclusion of people with Down syndrome.""

""People with Down syndrome still face stereotypes and myths, but they've shown time and again that the condition is just one part of who they are and doesn't define them or limit their abilities,"" the statement continued.

""That's why it's so important that during Down Syndrome Awareness Month and all year long, we help spread the message of love, acceptance, inclusion and respect.""

The Down syndrome awareness ribbon is blue and yellow. People can choose to wear a blue and yellow ribbon throughout the month to spread awareness.

Some also choose days to wear blue and yellow clothing to spread the word and support those with Down syndrome throughout the month.

World Down Syndrome Day is celebrated on March 21 each year - which stands for the tripling of the 21st chromosome (3.21) in people with the condition.

Educating yourself and others about Down syndrome is one way to honor the occasion throughout the month. You can educate yourself by reading books and articles and watching documentaries.

You can take your knowledge and spread awareness to others by sharing information on social media.

Through the month of October, there are plenty of events, fundraisers and walks around the country dedicated to Down syndrome awareness.

You can also choose to set up a fundraiser of your own or support a local business founded by or inspired by individuals with Down syndrome.

Sasha Cohen On Why U.S. Women Skaters Haven't  Medaled Since 2006,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimclash/2024/10/07/sasha-cohen-on-why-us-women-skaters-havent--medaled-since-2006/,2024-10-07T20:04:13Z,"It's been nearly two decades since an American ladies individual figure skater has stood on the Olympic podium. Given America's past dominance in skating, why?

Believe it or not, it's been 18 long years since an American individual ladies figure skater has stood on the Olympic podium. The last was Sasha Cohen, at the Torino Winter Olympics in 2006, where she won the silver medal. Given America's prior dominance in ladies figure skating - Peggy Fleming, Dorothy Hamill, Kristi Yamaguchi, Tara Lipinski, Sarah Hughes, Nancy Kerrigan and Michelle Kwan, to name a few - the omission is hard to understand.

Cohen is about to turn 40 this month. A graduate of Columbia University with a BA in general studies, and working now for a major investment house while raising two young children - Dash and Paloma - she maintains a very different lifestyle from her intense athletic regimen two decades ago. We thought it would be interesting to drop in on her to get some perspective on her current life, and on the American ladies figure skating program in general. Following are edited excerpts from a longer conversation.

Jim Clash: You're the last individual American ladies figure skater to stand on the Olympic podium, and that was way back in 2006. Surprising?

Sasha Cohen: It's definitely surprising. Things change, training programs change and different countries tend to dominate at different periods of time. The U.S. still has amazing talent, excelling tremendously in dance and men's single skating but, as you say, we haven't been able to put a woman on the podium since 2006. It's sad as a former athlete and someone who roots for the U.S.

Clash: It seems to me, as a layman, that the judging has become more about jumps, and less about style. Is that a fair assessment?

Cohen: You're not wrong. The sport has definitely shifted towards rewarding higher technical difficulty and certain types of moves, certainly quadruple jumps. Because of that, skaters don't have time to develop their choreography in a way that highlights their personalities and artistry. They have to pack in all kinds of technical things from the beginning to the end of their programs because that's what's reflected in the scores, which ultimately determines whether they are on the podium.

In the U.S. heyday, the whole package was considered, and the women had a chance to develop into mature figure skaters. It wasn't just about jumps, it was also the artistry on the ice that made it so much fun and dynamic to watch.

Clash: When you competed, how did you balance the attention that comes with fame - the autographs, photos and interviews - with the things you had to focus on - ie, the business of skating?

Cohen: It's helpful to have a coach or team leader that can be the one who says, ""No more autographs, let her focus."" Then you don't have to be the bad guy [laughs]. But it's hard because you see these people who have been following your career, and they finally have this chance to get an autograph or a picture.

When you're touring, the stakes are much lower, and it's really nice to have that one-on-one moment with someone who has been watching you since you were a young kid. What we do is not in a vacuum. It's not just a race, it's a performance to music with an emotional component. So it means a lot more to the audience and fans. It's a very dynamic experience.

Clash: Let's go back to the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in 2002. Didn't President George Bush sit next to you during opening ceremonies?

Cohen: After the ceremonial lap, all of the different countries began to take their respective spots on the benches to watch the opening ceremonies. Within two minutes of sitting down, two Secret Service agents came over, put down this blanket, and started telling people to scoot over. We're all like, ""What's happening?"" They said that the President was going to sit there. I called my mom and said, ""Mom, mom, President Bush is going to sit next to me!"" She laughed and said, ""Oh honey, I'm sure you're mistaken. I don't think so.""

Fifteen minutes later, when the President did sit beside me, I asked him, ""Can you talk to my mom, will you say hi? She doesn't believe that you were going to sit next to me."" He said, ""Sure,"" and actually chatted with her for a minute, minute and a half, saying how much he loved the opening ceremonies and how nice it was to chat with me. My mom later told me that she almost fell off of her chair watching from some restaurant bar in Salt Lake City. That was definitely a fun moment in those games.

Clash: You're a mom yourself now. How do you balance that with your job and doing things like this interview?

Cohen: You have to do things quickly [laughs]. I go to yoga, and that helps me re-center, have a little peace, because it's pretty hectic the rest of the time. One thing that's really difficult is to meet all of the demands but never being able to fully do anything well. There's a quote I once read about motherhood: ""You can be great at your job, great with your kids, great at this and that, but not all at the same time."" You have to choose. That's hard, but knowing that many other women are in the same spot is comforting. It's a privilege to be a mother and to be involved in the world - a give- and-take, a balance.

But as my kids are getting older, I'm realizing how fast time is passing. It's becoming increasingly important for me to be there to influence them, to play with them, to learn from them. You show up every day and try to be as present as you can, listening to that inner compass which tells you what's really important."

"Katie Grimes, Two-Time Olympic Swimmer, Commits To Virginia For 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/caseymurphy/2024/10/07/katie-grimes-two-time-olympic-swimmer-commits-to-virginia-for-2024/,2024-10-07T18:52:56Z,"Two-time Olympic swimmer Katie Grimes has recently announced her commitment to the University of Virginia for the NCAA 2024-2025 season. Based on her best times, Grimes, the youngest U.S. Olympic swimmer at the 2020 Tokyo Games, would have won both the 500 freestyle and the mile at last year's NCAA Championships. She will join Alex Walsh, Gretchen Walsh, and Emma Weber at Virginia, all of whom represented the United States in Paris. Regarding her commitment, Grimes wrote on Instagram:

""After much thought and consideration, I am more than excited to announce my commitment to University of Virginia!! Thank you to all of the coaches for your patience with me during this process. I am extremely grateful for my family, friends, and faith for guiding me to this point. Huge thank you to my team, Sandpipers, and Coach Ron for everything. I also want to give thanks to the team and staff at UVA and Coach Todd for all the support.""

Grimes is from Las Vegas and trained with the Sandpipers of Nevada. She is known to be a versatile swimmer with the potential to make an impact in several events. In fact, she held the top times for the 2024 class in the 200 freestyle, 500 freestyle, 1000 freestyle, mile, 200 butterfly and 400 IM. At just 15, she placed second behind Katie Ledecky in the 800 freestyle at the 2021 Olympic Trials in Omaha, Nebraska, and at the Tokyo Games, she finished fourth in that event.

At the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, Grimes became the first woman in U.S. history to compete in both pool and open water events during the same Olympics. She earned a silver medal in the 400 IM and placed tenth in the 1500 freestyle. In her 10 km freestyle open water race, she earned fifteenth. After her open water race in Paris, she said, ""That was the hardest thing I've ever done, ever, I think, with just the current.""

The University of Virginia's women's team has won four consecutive NCAA Championship titles since 2021. Last season, the University of Virginia, known as the Cavaliers, scored 527.5 points, while Texas finished second with 441 points. This makes UVA the third program in history to achieve four consecutive titles in NCAA swimming, and the first since 1996.

Virginia's head coach, Todd DeSorbo, was selected as the head coach of the U.S. women's swimming team for the 2024 Paris Olympics. Twenty-five percent of the women's roster consisted of swimmers from UVA, including Kate Douglass, Paige Madden, Alex Walsh, Gretchen Walsh and Emma Weber. This will be DeSorbo's eighth season coaching the Cavaliers.

The odds of Virginia earning their fifth consecutive NCAA title this season are strong. Claire Curzan, who helped secure a silver medal in the 4x100 medley relay at the Tokyo Games, is also on the roster this season. In 2023, Curzan won the 200 backstroke at the NCAA Championships while representing Stanford. Her best time in the 200 backstroke would have been the fastest at Virginia last season."
"October 7 hasn't ended. One year later, 101 hostages are still being held in Gaza",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/october-7-hasnt-ended-one-year-later-101-hostages-still-being-held-gaza,2024-10-07T18:18:28Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

While visiting her boyfriend's family for the religious holiday of Simchat Torah, a young Israeli woman, Sapir Cohen, was taken hostage on October 7, 2023. She spent 55 days in captivity in Gaza before she was released in a deal with the Hamas terrorists who took her and hundreds of other Israelis captive. Cohen's boyfriend, Sasha Troufanov, has been held captive with one hundred others for exactly one year, today.

Cohen visited my children's overnight sleepaway program this summer, telling campers about the plight of those still left behind in Gaza while sharing her own experience.

She shared, ""Down there [in the tunnels] there is no light. Sometimes a terrorist would use a flashlight, but even then, I couldn't see anything. There is also no air."" She went on to explain the lack of oxygen, the prevalence of humidity and mold, and the lack of food. She experienced this for less than two months; Sasha and 100 others have for twelve months.

She goes anywhere she can to share her story in order to raise awareness about the hostages who have spent a year of their lives wasting away in the tunnels of Gaza, because she knows the world has lost interest. There are no yellow ribbons lining the trees of America's small towns in honor of the four Americans still being held hostage; nor were there large memorials for Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a young American boy who was taken hostage and executed in the tunnels in Gaza one month ago.

ONE YEAR AFTER 10/7, IRAN IS LOSING THE WAR. NOW, ISRAEL MUST SECURE PEACE

Even Troufanov's own employer has forsaken him. Despite working as an engineer on a pivotal project for Amazon, the Seattle-based company has been silent about his plight.

Amazon isn't alone in their disinterest in their imprisoned Jewish employees. One year ago, PepsiCo's subsidiary, SodaStream, had one of its employees, Guy Gilboa-Dalal taken captive as well, and Pepsi have maintained their silence. Pepsi has had no issues speaking up and ponying up on other social issues, yet, when it comes to their own staffer kidnapped from a music festival, they can't be bothered to advocate for his immediate and unconditional release.

On the anniversary of October 7th, hostage Emily Damari's mother Mandy spoke out about her daughter, violently taken from a Kibbutz on the Gaza border, Kfar Aza.

ONE YEAR AFTER 10/7 ATTACKS AND DEMOCRAT-RUN STATES HAVE LET THE PROBLEM FESTER

In her British accent, Mandy pleaded, ""I would like to feel that the British public were behind her, and the British government were behind her, and they were saying there is a British hostage held captive in the terror tunnels by Hamas in Gaza. I want them to know she's there, and to advocate for her release, unconditionally and immediately. She's a young woman, and who knows what's happening to her. If there's a way to put her on social media, and see her out there. Remind people that she's there, [and] make sure she's not forgotten.""

The worst fears of their families and loved ones have been realized; Sasha, Guy and Emily have been forgotten. Put simply and bluntly: Hostages and their families feel alone and forsaken because they have been. Their employers have abandoned them, and their governments have, too. The world community and organizations, tasked with advocating for the most vulnerable among us, have clearly indicated that Jews don't count in their hierarchy of victims.

Not only are the victims of October 7th forgotten, they have been transformed into oppressors by evil individuals and organizations who have decided that Jewish lives simply do not matter.

Amnesty International UK, in the days leading up to the anniversary, justified the massacre and reminded their followers ""Don't let anyone tell you that this all started on the 7th of October 2023.""

In response to Amnesty, pro-Israel influencer Hen Mazzig asked, ""So when did it start? In 2002, during the Second Intifada, when I was almost killed in a terror attack? Or in 1951, when my family was expelled from Tunisia for being Jewish? Or in 1941, during the Farhud, when my family members were killed and expelled from Iraq? Or the Hebron massacre in 1929? When did it start? When did the world become so apathetic as to deny Jews the right to mourn our dead and post videos like this on the day we commemorate the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust? And October 7th hasn't ended for us, because 101 hostages are still being held in Gaza for 365 days.""

A year on, millions of Jews, both American and Israelis alike, are all still trapped in October 7th, but the year is still 2023, not 2024. Life has moved on as we have scrambled to try to beg for sympathy, relevancy and attention while the world marks holidays like Christmas and Hanukkah, Easter and Passover, all the while we struggle to remind the world that we are still trapped in October. And here we are, back in October.

In her famous book, ""Anne of Green Gables,"" L. M. Montgomery wrote, ""I'm so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers.""

For Jews, our world has been nothing but Octobers for the last twelve months. Finding ourselves back in October is a painful reminder that our hearts, all 101 of them, still lay captive in Gaza. It won't stop being October 7th until they're all home."
Missing woman found dead in suitcase at Seattle homeless encampment,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/missing-woman-found-dead-suitcase-seattle-homeless-encampment,2024-10-07T17:57:24Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Authorities have identified a body found stuffed inside a suitcase in Seattle this week as a woman who first went missing in 2023.

The woman, 37-year-old Shannon Marie Caslin Reeder, was reported missing in 2023, and her last confirmed sighting was in November of that year. Police say they are still trying to piece together what happened to Reeder.

The Washington State Patrol say Reeder's body was found in late September when state officials were clearing out a homeless encampment and smelled a strong odor coming from the suitcase.

""Ms. Reeder was known to reside in the area,"" WSP updates stated. ""Detectives are working with those who knew her to put together a timeline of her movements prior to her death and eventual discovery of her remains.""

""Detectives continue to investigate Shannon Reeder's death and are seeking information from anyone who has seen Shannon Reeder or had contact with her in the last 12 months. Anyone with information, that might be helpful in finding out what happened to Shannon, or who might have knowledge of who may have been involved in her untimely death and the callous disposal of her remains, are asked to call Detective John Ford at 425-401-7742 or Detective Ivan Sergeev at 425-401-771,"" police continued.

SEATTLE-AREA OFFICIALS WANT 'NO LOCKS, NO CELLS' FOR JUVENILE OFFENDERS AMID RISE IN TEEN CRIME

The incident comes as Seattle continues to struggle with homelessness and a lack of policing.

As of Oct. 1, the Seattle Police Department only dispatches officers to alarm calls that come with ""supporting evidence, such as audio, video, panic alarms or eyewitness evidence"" that someone is breaking into a home or business, according to a letter interim police chief Sue Rahr sent to alarm companies.

Advocates of the new policy say the vast majority of alarm responses do not result in an arrest.

'Will & Harper' navigate transition and friendship in a cross-country road trip,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5140106/will-ferrell-harper-steele-transition-road-trip,2024-10-07T17:33:32Z,"A few of years ago, Will Ferrell found out that his close friend and former Saturday Night Live writing partner was coming out as a trans woman named Harper Steele.

""It was a complete surprise, knowing Harper for as long as I did, ... I didn't see it coming,"" Ferrell says. ""And then you fall back on, What do I do? What's the right thing to say? How should I say it?""

The new Netflix documentary, Will & Harper, follows Ferrell and Steele as they drive from New York to California, talking about their friendship and Steele's transition. Along the way, they make various pit stops, including to a dive bar in Oklahoma, an Indiana Pacers basketball game and a steakhouse in Amarillo, Texas -- some places that Steele fears would be unsafe for her to visit alone as a trans woman.

""They're wonderful places where all kinds of humanity, all kinds of Americans exist, and I love 'em now as much as I did [prior to transitioning],"" Steele says. But, she adds, ""It's always a little bit more fraught [now]. And I don't know if it's because I'm a woman or if it's because I'm a trans woman. I can't quite discern that at this point.""

At the Texas steakhouse, a crowd gathered to photograph Ferrell, but the friends soon felt the energy in the room shift. Their discomfort was confirmed when they later saw hateful and transphobic social media posts from people at the restaurant.

""I just carried a little bit of the guilt and the burden of like, Why did we even go in there? There was no need to,"" Ferrell says. "" And yet I think it's a powerful part of the film. ... It turned out to be kind of valuable for me to feel that and to see that that kind of hate does exist out there for the trans community.""

For Steele, the film was less about the cross-country journey and more about her decades-long friendship with Ferrell and an exercise in vulnerability: ""I was just looking at [it as], this would be an interesting way to have a conversation about this subject with someone that I care about.""

On coming out as a trans woman later in life

Steele: It wasn't a decision about right timing. It was a decision about living in misery and not wanting to do that anymore. So it just took me a long time to finally give up -- and I do think of it as a giving up. I just collapsed into myself and found the other side and it's been so much better. ...

I've discovered that vulnerability is truly a really powerful superpower. I'm not calling that a feminine trait. ... For me personally, to walk out of my house in a dress was a very vulnerable and raw moment, and what became of that moment was pure joy. So trusting vulnerability more has been something that truly has been helpful to me.

On Ferrell's response to Steele's coming out

Ferrell: You get an email from a friend announcing this kind of dramatic news and I didn't really stop to think how much pain, how much anguish there was to get to that point, how much thought it took to write that email. ... This was something that obviously was a part of her this whole time, and the sadness of her kind of putting it aside, kind of squashing it down, but then the courage that it took to get to that point where she was like, ""Enough, I'm going to give up the fight."" I just learned how incredibly strong she is, how articulate she is. She's always made me laugh. ... And a lot of people have come up to us just saying, ""It's just nice to see friends stick up for each other."" I think that's what we're most proud of about this whole thing.

On correcting people who misgender her

Steele: When it comes to friends, I sort of feel out the situation, If people are misgendering me and it's annoying me, then I correct them. If it's friends, I correct them in my funny way. But I don't like my friends to feel on edge around me talking about my transition or talking about who I am now. I don't want them to feel that. So I'm not interested in nailing everyone around me.

Ferrell: What's happened with me, though, as I've become more comfortable with it and it's become second nature, I've found a certain vigilance when we're out together and someone by chance does misgender Harper, I'm like, ""Excuse me, no ... She. Her.""

On hugging

Steele: Will has pointed out many times that before I transitioned, hugging was not in the equation. Will would hug me knowing that I would go stiff as a board and just hate it and now I'm a hugger so I will accept all hugs from good friends between men and women, between anyone. ... It has meaning. It's touch, it's ""I care about you"" and that's wonderful.

On being aware of her face more now as a woman

Steele: Hollywood, in the business that I work in, we value faces. Somehow Will Ferrell slipped through.

Ferrell: Somehow. ... But I'm going to get some work done after this.

Steele: We value faces. And so I like the middle of the country because it's me. There's people out there, like real people.

Ferrell: You can be ugly. And we can look distinguished. ... I'm in comedy, so it's not critical for me to worry about that. But it's not my nature anyway. And, in fact, I remember doing a Q&A somewhere, and one of the questions from the audience was, ""Why are your eyebrows so white?"" I said, ""Because I have gray hair. It's called the aging process."" So I'm almost a poster child for not doing anything in that regard.

On not wanting to change her voice

Steele: I think it's important for me to tell people that I am first a human being and second, a trans person and third, a woman. So I'm not that overly concerned about passing. I like being gendered correctly, I do. But passing is something that a lot of trans people want and need and should have if that's what they want. But for me, it's not as important. I would love to be prettier, but I'm not sure I'm different than a lot of women in the world. And I wish I had been born with a different voice. But this is who I am. But these things are fluid, too. I could tomorrow start voice lessons. I doubt I will, but who knows? Your gender is a slippery thing for some people, and I'm happy about that."
'Love Next Door': 7 Things You May Have Missed In Episodes 9 And 10,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/reginakim/2024/10/07/love-next-door-7-things-you-may-have-missed-in-episodes-9-and-10/,2024-10-07T16:15:25Z,"The hit K-drama Love Next Door has come to an end, and yes, I know I'm behind on these explainers (apologies for the delay, and thank you for your patience!). If you haven't read my previous pieces where I break down some of the cultural references and wordplay found in the first eight episodes, feel free to check out the articles below:

To be perfectly honest, I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I started these explainers LOL. I'd simply noticed that there were some things in the series' first few episodes that I thought might be confusing or surprising to some viewers, so I decided to try explaining them as best as I could. And then when I received requests from readers to do similar explainers for the rest of the series, I thought, ""Well, why not?""

But the deeper I delved into the show, the more I realized just how smart and nuanced the script really is, with all its jokes, puns and historical and cultural references that would surely resonate with Korean audiences but might be lost on viewers who didn't grow up in Korea. And while it's certainly been a time-consuming endeavor to research, interpret and fact-check this information, I have to admit that this exercise has made me appreciate the show even more, and I hope that these explainers will do the same for you.

Below I've tried to explain some of the references and common Korean expressions found in episodes 9 and 10. I initially intended this piece to cover episodes 11 and 12 as well, but the list was so long that I decided to split it into two. (The link to my explainer for Episodes 11 and 12 will be added shortly to the bottom of this piece.)

Again, please keep in mind that this is nowhere near a comprehensive list -- I simply picked out some examples that I felt could benefit from a bit more context or that I thought might be particularly interesting for viewers.

1. As many K-drama fans already know, the expression 라면 먹고 갈래? (""Do you want to eat ramyun before you go?"") is often used as an indirect way of asking, ""Do you want to sleep with me?"" (i.e., basically the Korean equivalent of ""Netflix and chill""). The phrase was first popularized in the 2001 film One Fine Spring Day, where Lee Young-ae's character invites Yoo Ji-tae's character to spend the night at her place (though the exact phrase she used in the movie was ""라면 먹을래요?"" or ""Do you want to eat ramyun?""). Since then, ""Do you want to eat ramyun before you go?"" has appeared in a number of Korean films, shows and songs and has become a well-known meme among Koreans and K-culture fans.

Love Next Door pokes fun at this meme a couple of times, first in the above scene involving Seung-hyo's parents and then later in Episode 11 when, in a clever variation of the original phrase, Seok-ryu asks Seung-hyo, ""Do you want to go drink banana milk with me?""

2. When Seung-hyo notices that the pomegranate tree that Seok-ryu gave him is dying, he visits a florist and asks her, ""Can you save my tree?"" He actually says in Korean, ""우리 석류 좀 살려 주세요,"" which translates to ""Please save my Seok-ryu/pomegranate."" Since Seok-ryu's name means ""pomegranate,"" his plea can be interpreted as both ""Please save my pomegranate tree"" and ""Please save my Seok-ryu."" Later in Episode 10, we see Seung-hyo talking to the plant as if he were talking to Seok-ryu.

3. Many Korean viewers praised Jung Hae-in for his spot-on impression of the award-winning actor Han Suk-kyu, who -- besides being famous for starring in a number of classic Korean films -- is known for having a soft, low-pitched voice and a very distinctive cadence to his speech.

Here's a funny clip of his co-stars from the 2013 movie The Berlin File mimicking his manner of speaking (all in good fun, of course). Han tells them, laughing, ""You're imitating me, aren't you?"":

Here's a scene from the K-drama Dr. Romantic 2 where you can really pick up on Han's trademark vocal register and speech pattern (turn on the subtitles and notice especially the inflection in his voice when he says, ""Why do you keep giving me an irrelevant answer for my question?""):

And below is the moment in Love Next Door when Jung Hae-in nails his impersonation of Han:

As Seolran Won, a PR manager at Studio Dragon (the production powerhouse that co-produced Love Next Door) points out, the lines that Jung Hae-in says here are a reference to an iconic scene from the 2000 K-drama Autumn in My Heart (or Autumn Tale), in which Won Bin's character asks Song Hye-kyo's character how much it would cost to buy her love:

This famous scene was parodied many times in Korea over the years, explains Won.

4. In the closing title sequence, the Korean word for ""cancer"" (암, pronounced like ""ahm"") changes to 삶 (pronounced like ""sahlm"" or ""sahm""), which means ""life.""

The writer probably chose these words because the endings sound the same. Of course, the words ""cancer"" and ""life"" do not sound similar at all in English, which is likely why the subtitles display something entirely different.

5. When Mo-eum bursts into Seok-ryu's room, angry that her friend didn't tell her that she had stomach cancer, Seok-ryu admits that she kept it a secret from her. According to the English subtitles, Mo-eum later replies, ""What are you doing? Are you turning yourself in?"" Though the subtitles convey the gist of what she says, Mo-eum actually says in Korean, ""뭐냐, '자수하여 광명 찾자'냐?"" which roughly translates to, ""What, so you're turning yourself in to find a brighter future -- is that it?""

Here Mo-eum is referring to the saying, ""어둠 속에 떨지 말고 자수하여 광명 찾자"" (Don't tremble in the dark; turn yourself in and find a brighter future.), a slogan that was popular in South Korea for several decades. While a shortened version of the phrase has been used in different contexts -- for example, to urge criminals to turn themselves in and receive a lighter punishment -- in the past it was primarily directed at North Korean spies who had infiltrated South Korean society. In the 1960s and 1970s, flyers with this anti-communist slogan were plastered on electric poles and walls throughout South Korea and were meant to encourage North Korean spies to stop conducting espionage, turn themselves in and start a peaceful life in South Korea. (Fun fact: South Korea to this day has a hotline you can call to report suspected spies. Residents can dial 113 to report espionage -- including industrial espionage -- and acts of terrorism to the Korean National Police Agency.)

All this to say, Mo-eum is using this famous expression in a sarcastic way to imply that Seok-ryu is admitting her fault in the hopes that Mo-eum might go easy on her.

6. For Seok-ryu's belated welcome home party, her father makes her 궁중떡볶이 (pronounced like ""goong-joong tteok-bokki""), or Korean royal court rice cakes. Originally served during the Joseon Dynasty, gungjung tteok-bokki is the earliest form of tteok-bokki, the popular Korean dish that's now more widely known as a spicy street food. Unlike the fire-red modern version that's flavored with gochujang (Korean red pepper paste), gungjung tteok-bokki was prepared by seasoning meat, vegetables and rice cakes in soy sauce and was considered a delicacy served to the king (hence its name). Though it has ""tteok-bokki"" in its name, it's actually more similar to another rice cake dish called tteok-jjim (떡찜).

7. Remember the Korean legend of Ungnyeo (""Bear Woman"") that Seok-ryu alludes to in Episode 3? It makes a reappearance in the episode's closing title sequence, which starts with the words 동굴의 곰, meaning ""Bear in the Cave."" Then the last word in the phrase, 곰 (which is pronounced like ""gohm"" and means ""bear""), is turned upside down to spell 문 (pronounced like ""moon""), the Korean term for a door, gate or entrance (in this context, it's referring to the mouth of a cave).

The episode's final scene and closing title sequence are particularly powerful in their symbolism. Like the bear in Korea's creation myth who endured many days inside a dark cave but later emerged from it as a transformed being, Seok-ryu -- with the help of her family, Mo-eum and, of course, Seung-hyo -- is finally able to step out of the darkness and isolation that she's been trapped in for so long. And just like how Ungnyeo had to shed her former self when she left the cave, Seok-ryu closes a chapter of her life by bidding goodbye to her ex-fiancé and walking out of the airport with Seung-hyo."

Several high-profile volunteers with the group Women for Trump flew to Georgia to provide relief for victims of Hurricane Helene in the group's first mission before they crisscross the country to support communities in need.

RNC co-chair Lara Trump, former DNC vice chair and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, former Georgia GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler, former NASCAR driver Danica Patrick, and former ESPN anchor Sage Steele launched their ""Save America"" tour on Thursday in Austell, Georgia.

TRUMP SLAMS THE BIDEN ADMIN'S RESPONSE TO HURRICANE HELENE

The group traveled to Austell via commercial air. Their travel was paid for by the Trump campaign, the group said.

The group donated thousands of dollars of supplies to Sweetwater Mission - a social services organization in Austell that helps to prevent hunger and homelessness - with the assistance of Goya Cares.

""They put us on the map. We got a call from a woman in New Mexico wanting to donate to us. And we said, 'How did you know about us?' This woman was watching the rally with President Trump and the chyron on the screen read that Lara Trump was going to be visiting Sweetwater Mission with Goya Foods,"" Sweetwater Mission executive director Pat Soden said to Lara Trump.

""You've put us on the map, and I can't thank you enough.""

Lara Trump said, in turn, Women for Trump is ""incredibly grateful for Goya Cares,"" because they have ""allowed us to donate thousands of pounds of non-perishable food for the people of this community.""

""We're here in the wake of Hurricane Helene and honored to be able to give back,"" Lara Trump said. ""We've also been able to secure water, blankets, diapers, and items to meet the immediate needs of those impacted by Hurricane Helene.""

But Lara Trump said this is ""just the beginning.""

BIDEN, HARRIS INSPECT DAMAGE IN HURRICANE-RAVAGED SOUTHEAST IN WAKE OF TRUMP VISIT

""We're kicking off our Women for Trump tour in Georgia, and we'll be headed all over the country supporting communities across this great country,"" Trump said.

Reflecting on the visit, Gabbard told Fox News Digital that it was a ""privilege to shine a light on the incredibly inspiring impact local Georgia nonprofits like Sweetwater Mission are having on those who need help the most.""

""I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to join Lara Trump, Sage Steele, Danica Patrick and many volunteers to pitch in and thank the hardworking staff and volunteers, especially during a time of great hardship and desperate need in the wake of Hurricane Helene,"" Gabbard said.

Supreme Court denies Biden administration appeal over federal emergency abortion requirement in Texas,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-denies-biden-administration-appeal-over-federal-emergency-abortion-requirement-texas,2024-10-07T15:06:02Z,"Abortion Survivors founder Melissa Ohden breaks down how Governor Tim Walz has changed Minnesota's abortion laws during an appearance on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.'

The U.S. Supreme Court decided not to hear oral arguments about whether a Texas state abortion ban is at odds with a federal emergency care law - permitting the ban in the Lone Star state to be upheld.

Supreme Court justices, for now, are keeping in place a lower court ruling that hospitals in Texas can deny terminating certain emergency pregnancies that violate state law, despite the federal requirement.

The Biden administration had requested that the justices overturn the lower court's ruling, contending that federal law requires hospitals to provide abortions in emergency situations. They referenced last term, when the Supreme Court permitted emergency room abortions to continue in Idaho while a lawsuit continues in federal court. Texas is asserting that its laws are distinct from Idaho's because Texas has a health exception for pregnant patients.

TEXAS SUPREME COURT REJECTS CHALLENGE TO STATE ABORTION BAN'S MEDICAL EXCEPTIONS

In Texas, the central legal issue is whether the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which mandates hospitals to treat emergency conditions, overrides state laws that prohibit abortion in emergencies. The case focuses on whether a state can stop an emergency physician from performing an abortion if it's necessary to stabilize a pregnant woman's health.

Previously, the Texas Supreme Court ruled in June against a group of women who suffered serious pregnancy complications and became the first in the country to testify in court about being denied abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022.

In a unanimous ruling, the court upheld the Texas law after the women filed a lawsuit in March 2023 seeking clarity on when exceptions to the abortion ban are permitted, arguing the law was confusing for doctors who might turn away patients over fears of repercussions.

The court ultimately ruled that the law's exceptions are broad enough and that doctors would be misinterpreting the law if they decided not to perform an abortion when the mother's life is in danger.

With the SCOTUS decision looming just a month before Election Day, abortion has become a major focus for the Harris-Walz campaign.

"Miss Teen Rodeo Kansas, 19, killed in car crash; teammates injured",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/miss-teen-rodeo-kansas-19-killed-car-crash-teammates-injured,2024-10-07T14:35:07Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

A 19-year-old rodeo star, who won Miss Teen Rodeo Kansas in 2024, died in a single-vehicle car accident that left four of her teammates and a fifth person injured on Friday night in rural Kansas, according to officials.

Emma Brungardt, of Blue Rapids, was a passenger in a 2007 Ford F250 pickup truck traveling southbound on County Road 21 in Thomas County when the pickup ""left the roadway"" at the Y intersection and struck a tree row, Kansas Highway Patrol said in an online crash report.

Troopers said Brungardt was wearing her seatbelt at the time of the crash. The driver and four other passengers survived the crash, reporting possible injuries.

Colby Community College, where Brungardt was a sophomore, confirmed her death to Fox News Digital on Monday morning.

The unexpected joys of being single in your 50s,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/health-mindset/unexpected-joys-single-50s-rcna174128,2024-10-07T14:11:49Z,"Pattie Eshsaei - an attorney and financial services expert - uses her TikTok platform to teach financial literacy, social and workplace decorum, along with a focus on empowering women.Greg Crowder

As I approached my 50s, I found myself unexpectedly single. I was 46, with no prospects on the horizon, and wondering what was wrong with me. A year earlier, I had broken up with the man I thought I would marry, and here I was, single again.

One day, while visiting my cousin, her neighbor came over to pick up her kids. She casually asked, ""Why are you single?""

Within seconds, I was in the fetal position on the sofa, crying uncontrollably. You know, the ""ugly cry.""

My cousin and her neighbor rushed to comfort me, but their attempts felt feeble. For 15 minutes I cried, convinced I was cursed, destined to be deprived of love for eternity.

Eventually, I peeled myself off the sofa and rushed to my car, desperate to be alone in my misery. But as I glanced in the rearview mirror, I saw a reflection that stopped me in my tracks: a middle-aged woman with dark mascara streaks running down her face. It was a pathetic sight -- scary, sad and sickening.

At that moment, I realized what I had become: a desperate woman whose self-worth was entirely dependent on being chosen by a man. Without that validation, I felt like I was nothing and had nothing.

It didn't matter that I was healthy and attractive. It didn't matter that I had a fantastic career, great friends, a wonderful family, a packed social calendar, and more money than I could spend. None of it mattered if I didn't have a ""man."" And that realization disgusted me.

I despised what I had become and, in that moment, decided to choose differently. Instead of focusing on what was missing -- a man -- I resolved to embrace the benefits of not having one.

For some, this might seem like a daunting reality, but for me, it was the most empowering and liberating chapter of my life. I learned that being single in your 50s is often misunderstood. People may assume loneliness or loss, but what they don't see is the immense joy, freedom, and self-discovery that comes with it. Although I am in a relationship now, that time was, without a doubt, one of the biggest blessings I could have ever imagined.

Here's why:

In your 50s, you're more self-assured and confident than ever before. This period of your life has brought a deeper understanding of who you are and what you want. You no longer feel the need to compromise or adjust yourself for the sake of anyone else's expectations. You can live for yourself, fully and authentically. Because of this, you're less likely to put up with people who don't bring you joy or disturb your peace.

You also have the freedom to make decisions based solely on your desires, needs, and aspirations. Whether it's traveling on a whim, diving into a new hobby, or embracing quiet nights alone, you now have the autonomy to shape life on your own terms. There is a profound beauty in being the sole architect of your happiness. The freedom to prioritize myself has been one of the most empowering experiences of my 50s, and it's a gift that I deeply treasure.

One of the greatest misconceptions about being single later in life is that it must come with a sense of lack, as if being without a partner means missing out on something. But I don't see it that way. Instead, I now realize that the relationships I foster are those I truly want in my life, not those I need to fill a void or societal expectation.

You have the ability to develop deeper friendships. Connect with other women who share similar experiences and uplift each other in ways that feel genuine. It's been such a joy to spend time with like-minded women whose sole focus is not having a man or needing one. And should romantic love ever find you again, it will be on your terms. You won't settle for anything less than what you deserve, because you've learned that your happiness is not dependent on someone else. This self-reliance is both liberating and powerful.

Time has also become my greatest companion. In your 50s, being single means that you're no longer pulled in a dozen directions by the demands of a partner or children. Your time is yours to manage, and you get to decide where and how to invest it. This will allow you to nurture friendships, pursue passions and most importantly, invest in self-care. I've rediscovered the things that make me feel alive -- whether that's cycling, painting or volunteering -- and I now have the luxury of time to dive deeply into them.

This relationship with time will also allow you to reflect and grow. I've shed the insecurities of my 20s and 30s and embraced the wisdom that comes with life's experiences. In this quiet space, I was able to cultivate mindfulness and truly connect with myself, which made me a better person.

For decades, so many women pour themselves into others -- nurturing relationships, raising children or navigating the complexities of a marriage. Now, is the time to pour that same energy into yourself, and it feels incredible. Self-care isn't just a buzzword; it's a lifeline. You can finally put yourself first without guilt or the feeling that you're neglecting someone else's needs.

Time is about healing, too, whether that's physical, emotional or spiritual. I've learned to listen to my body, embrace my health and focus on what brings me peace, like my evening walks. I've curated a life that feels good to me, and that sense of well-being is the truest form of luxury.

You have the freedom to change course. Don't buy the delusion that you're past your prime or your best years are behind you. I reject that notion entirely. Being single at this stage allowed me to embrace change and growth with open arms. I was no longer afraid of reinvention or exploring new possibilities, and thus, started my TikTok channel at the age of 48, with almost 1 million followers today!

You have the freedom to pivot, whether that means shifting careers, moving to a new city, or simply reimagining what the next decade will look like. There is a tremendous sense of possibility in this freedom. You're not bound by the expectations of others or a relationship that defines you. Instead, you're constantly evolving, and that evolution is your own to navigate.

Ultimately, the greatest gift of being single in your 50s is the deep, unwavering love you will cultivate for yourself. For the first time, you don't look outside for validation. You don't seek approval from a partner or a society that tries to dictate who you should be. I have become my own best friend, my own cheerleader, and my own source of joy, because I understand that no one is coming to save me.

This self-love has been the foundation of my happiness. It allows me to wake up each day with a sense of peace and contentment, knowing that I am enough just as I am. This journey of self-discovery and empowerment is one that I would not trade for anything, and it is the ultimate blessing of being single in my 50s."

Basilotta, 72, says he has received multiple buyout offers but refuses to sell the family business, which now employs members of the third and fourth generation. The company produces almost 3 million sandwich cookies -- called alfajores -- per day and exports to the U.S. and Europe.

Onetime U.S. Open champion Dominic Thiem announced in May that he will retire from tennis by the end of the year. The 31-year-old, whose career earnings exceed $30 million, says he is ""full of energy"" for his career off the court. His business endeavors include a line of sunglasses, investment in a healthier chocolate brand called Neoh and ongoing sponsorship deals with Adidas and Rolex. He has also recently teamed up with solar energy startup Solah to start selling electricity generated from housetop solar panels via ThiemEnergy.

Kate Kallot, whose family hails from the Central African Republic, appears on the cover of Forbes Afrique for her Kenyan data-collection startup, Amini. Kallot, 34, has raised $6 million and hired a team of 24 since 2022 to gather and distribute reliable information that can inform and democratize decision making across the continent.

Coco Gauff Focused On Long-Term Goals After China Open 2024 Title,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/manasipathak-1/2024/10/07/coco-gauff-focused-on-long-term-goals-after-china-open-2024-title/,2024-10-07T12:14:28Z,"U.S. tennis star Coco Gauff said she is still evolving and won't let her recent China Open triumph distract her from her long-term goals.

Gauff won the WTA 1000 title in Beijing on Sunday after beating U.S. Open semifinalist Karolina Muchova 6-1, 6-3 in the final. It was Gauff's second WTA Tour title of the season after her successful title defense at the ASB Classic in Auckland, New Zealand in January.

According to the WTA website, Gauff is the first woman in the Open Era to win her first seven WTA hard-court finals.

Interestingly, Gauff had no plans of playing in the China Open after suffering a fourth-round exit during her U.S. Open title defense last month. But the 20-year-old, who made changes to her coaching team, believed she needed to compete instead of taking a training break.

The youngster, who became the second American champion in Beijing after Serena Williams' title runs in 2004 and 2013, took a relaxed approach to the tournament in Beijing and kept her expectations low.

Ultimately, that proved to be helpful.

""I think last year, I won U.S. Open and I was like, the rest of the season, I want to do well, but whatever -- just play and see what happens,"" Gauff told WTA Insider.

""And then this time it was like, well, I haven't done so well. The tournaments that I really wanted to do well in, the Slams, that was over. So it was kind of, let's just see what happens here.

""I always think that this part of the season will always just be more relaxed for me.""

Her route to the trophy wasn't easy as Gauff had to bounce back from a set down in three consecutive matches to make the final. But she was proud of sticking to her plan.

""I think the result is now reassurance that I am in the right direction,"" she added.

The world no. 6, who won the U.S. Open in 2023 and reached the French Open final in 2022, expressed pride in her journey so far and added that there is still room for improvement.

""A lot of times people forget that I'm still in the developmental phase of my career and nothing is going to be great,"" Gauff said. ""Most of the people doing well are 25 [years] and older in the Top 10, maybe with the exception of Iga [Swiatek].

""We have a long way to go and I still have a lot that I need to work on and I'm proud of myself thus far,"" she said.

""I didn't have a complete game at 15 and I don't have one right now, but I've been on tour playing every week almost, trying to be better. I'm just super proud of that."""
"How a year of Israel-Hamas war disrupted lives. And, key factors for Michigan voters",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/g-s1-26654/up-first-newsletter-october-7-anniversary-attack-israel-michigan-voters,2024-10-07T12:12:54Z,"Good morning.

One year ago today, Hamas launched an ambush attack on Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking hostages. This unleashed the deadliest war in Palestinian history. According to the Gaza health ministry, at least 41,000 people in Gaza have been killed by Israeli airstrikes and fire. Now, Israel is bombing Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Hear directly from people in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank as they describe how one year of this war has upended their lives. For more coverage marking this anniversary, check out NPR's special series page.

The war in the Middle East is personal in the swing state of Michigan. The GOP and Democrats are focused on the Arab and Muslim American voting bloc, and the state has the largest Lebanese American population in the country. Many in the state have families living in the areas of Lebanon that are being bombed right now.

A new report has found that both Harris' and Trump's economic plans would increase the national debt. According to the nonpartisan nonprofit Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, Trump's plan would add an estimated $7.5 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade, while Harris' proposals would cost the government an estimated $3.5 trillion. The committee has cautioned that there could be a future fiscal crisis if politicians do not take more decisive action on the national debt. Let's take a closer look at the details of both economic plans.

NPR is visiting six key swing states that will likely decide this year's historic election. This week, Morning Edition is in Michigan to listen to voters about what matters to them and how that will affect their vote.

Michigan, a ""blue wall"" state, is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House. But the victory won't be easy. Harris and former President Donald Trump remain in a close battle. Here are key factors that could decide which way Michigan swings:

This essay was written by Daniel Estrin, NPR's international correspondent in Jerusalem.

""The day still keeps surprising us,"" my colleague Anas Baba in Gaza texted me last Oct. 7, close to midnight.

I was at a hospital in southern Israel. The waiting room was full of parents in a daze, waiting for word about their children who had come under attack at an outdoor techno rave near the Gaza border. In Gaza, our producer Anas was taking photos of families fleeing their homes as Israeli airstrikes rained down.

It was the deadliest day in Israeli history. It sparked the deadliest war in Palestinian history. One year later, it has grown into a regional war. Every day keeps surprising us.

A year later, I find myself thinking about where the survivors and witnesses of this war draw strength.

I think about Batya Ofir, a woman my colleague Itay Stern and I met the other day at Kibbutz Be'eri, the Israeli village that suffered the greatest loss -- 102 people there were killed. Her brother was killed along with his family. She felt survivor's guilt, and she told us she asked herself whether she wanted to keep on living.

""I really thought about it. And then I decided that I wanted to continue to live,"" she said. Today, she is learning how to kayak in the sea to help her face her fears. ""I do everything to give some meaning to life now that they're gone.""

Our colleague Anas Baba in Gaza has been reporting for NPR in Gaza all year. Again and again, he has videotaped bodies brought into the morgue after Israeli airstrikes. He always trains his camera on young children, sheltering near the morgue, standing alone and watching silently as bodies are laid out.

What gives him strength, he said, is collecting biscuits and fruit to give to the children he meets. ""I can help them survive,"" he told me.

He often meets a young girl named Habiba at the hospital in central Gaza. She's been colorblind since birth. One day, she told Anas she saw a man drowning with water coming out of his nose. It wasn't water; it was blood.

""This girl does not know the color of blood,"" Anas told me. ""I wish all the children in Gaza were colorblind now."""

Why Society Never Put Self-Reliance On A Pedestal,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mahaabouelenein/2024/10/07/why-society-never-put-self-reliance-on-a-pedestal/,2024-10-07T11:10:28Z,"I wrote a whole book about practicing self-reliance. I didn't write it because I am a strong, independent woman, which I am; I wrote it because I feel society has gone soft, and too many people are waiting for permission from 'others.' The truth is, if you know the skills and have the tools to rely on yourself, not only will you be happier, but you will also become a valuable contributor to society, your family, your community and your relationships.

Parents are swooping in to save their children so much that not only are children not capable of doing things for themselves - they don't want to and have become entitled. Some younger generations lack the ability to make their own decisions and rely on mom and dad to save them instead of having to figure things out on their own. The reason? They haven't been taught the importance of self-reliance. They rely on their phones, on their parents, on social media instead of relying on themselves. And then they are entering the workforce, with skewed expectations of what they want their employers to do for them.

Too often:

Self-reliance is a superpower. It not only makes you valuable, but it also makes you indispensable to others. Society, however, has never put self-reliance on a pedestal and rarely celebrates it. The term often gets a bad rap, and is seen as synonymous with independence or selfishness, as though self-reliant people don't need anyone else. This misunderstanding is why self-reliance needs both a redefinition and a rebrand. My definition of self-reliance has nothing to do with independence.

It has everything to do with investing in yourself, betting on yourself, and trusting yourself. It's about making yourself the most powerful asset you can be a meaningful contributor to society. When you focus on your growth, and bring your best self and power to the table, you become a net positive to the world around you.

What if we all focused on improving ourselves first? Too often, we blame others for our unhappiness, when the truth is, we alone are responsible for our outcomes. It's time to recognize the value of our own potential and invest in it.

The new narrative of self-reliance is about:

Self-reliance breeds strong individuals, which in turn creates strong workplaces, communities, and a vibrant, self-actualized society.

Imagine a world where we are all programmed to trust ourselves, invest in our growth, and confidently take ownership of our decisions."
Influencers Are Telling Teens That Selling Their Eggs Is Easy Money. It's Not That Simple.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandralevine/2024/10/04/influencers-eggs-donors-money-teens-tiktok/,2024-10-07T10:34:32Z,"The United States has few rules governing egg and sperm donation, a Wild West being supercharged by influencers touting it as a cash-cow to millions of young followers. Americans conceived through donors are using social media to fight back.

few weeks ago, a 19-year-old influencer announced a new hobby to scores of TikTok followers: egg donation. Selling her eggs to women or couples looking to get pregnant was a fast and mostly painless way to make gobs of money, she thought.

""This girl just said she donated her eggs and got a quick $20,000 -- and I immediately started looking it up and decided that's going to be my next hobby,"" TikToker Gigi Juliana, holding a Starbucks iced coffee, told her audience of 137,000. She claimed the side effects from the invasive surgical procedure are no different than what she already feels after a trip to the med spa (where customers go for botox and filler), so why not? ""If you see like 30,000 of my children running around because I'm going to donate eggs like crazy... don't be alarmed,"" she quipped.

Posted on August 20, the video has been watched more than 24 million times, liked 4 million times, shared hundreds of thousands of times and drawn 18,000 comments -- many from others who say they, too, are eager to donate their eggs to buy that new car, fund a vacation or, like Gigi, just cash in. (Egg donors often make around $12,000 per cycle, though some can earn as much as $25,000. Repeat donors can rake in more than $70,000 for multiple rounds.)

""Basically a normal day for me...except that I will be richer...sign me up,"" wrote one commenter named Lizzy.

""Imma donate my sperm cuz I'm 6""2 and highly educated with no medical problems. Gonna make BANK,"" said a male follower. (Some cryobanks offer healthy men up to $1,500 a month.)

But the viral clip also prompted outcry from a vocal and growing online community of donor-conceived people -- those born from donated eggs or sperm -- who are increasingly using social media to push for laws to better protect kids conceived in this little-regulated space and sound the alarm on the issues that rhetoric like Gigi's can create.

For one, mass donors can put offspring at risk of accidental incest by donating many times in the same geographic area. Unlike several other countries, the United States has no federal laws limiting the volume of donations one person can make (there are only recommendations from the nonprofit American Society of Reproductive Medicine). Having dozens or hundreds of siblings can also be traumatic for parents and children -- issues highlighted in the recent Netflix documentary ""Man With 1000 Kids,"" about a serial sperm donor who lied his way into donating to hundreds of families around the world before a Dutch court last year barred him from ever doing so again.

There are also safety concerns and potential long-term health consequences for egg donors -- especially those who donate repeatedly and therefore inject themselves with high levels of hormones over a prolonged period of time -- that have not been thoroughly studied and are near impossible to explain in a seconds-long social media post, which can mislead the teens and 20-somethings who are often the target audience (Gigi was 18 when she made her viral TikTok). The American Society of Reproductive Medicine recommends egg and sperm donors to be at least 21, and that donors younger than that undergo a prior psychological evaluation.

Finally, big payouts may incentivize donors to lie or omit information on their applications, advocates argue, exploiting loopholes in a legal Wild West and lax screening processes where donors self-report any medical issues and are usually not fact-checked by the banks. (They do undergo basic genetic testing.)

""Not everything should be monetized. Not everything should be content.""

""All of these influencers -- including this person -- are looking at this as a money-making opportunity but not thinking about it long-term,"" Laura High, one of the most-followed donor-conceived creators on TikTok, with an audience of nearly 700,000, told Forbes. ""This is not an egg that's going to sit in a petri dish; this is going to become a full-fledged human being. That full-fledged human being is eventually going to see that video. And the fact that this person is treating egg donation, as they said, as a 'hobby' is not just dangerous, it's predatory.""

""I'm totally supportive of donor conception. ... I am for ethical donor conception, and that's the problem, and that's what we're not seeing, and that's what social media is helping perpetuate: the unethical side of it,"" High added. ""Not everything should be monetized. Not everything should be content."" A week after Gigi's viral TikTok, she followed-up with a video plugging an agency and egg bank in Southern California. The post was a paid collaboration.

""This was my first time speaking/pondering the topic so I didn't do any research before posting,"" Gigi said in an email.

""After reading through the comments I feel I have a deeper understanding for donating eggs,"" she continued. ""I didn't realize the qualifications were so strict, that realistically not even I would be accepted as a donor. While I do understand it is a very rigorous process that takes a huge toll on our bodies, I think that it is beautiful we can give the gift of families to other women that don't have that ability. While it definitely would not work for everyone, it's sweet that I could've possibly reached someone who helped create a family.""

ocial media is dramatically changing conversations around reproductive health and family-building in America, pushing once-private discussions about infertility into the open and normalizing alternatives like in-vitro fertilization (IVF), surrogacy and donors that can help those struggling, as well as singles and same-sex couples, become parents. They're topics that have become politicized in the post-Roe v. Wade era -- a flashpoint in the 2024 presidential race, a target for states like Alabama that have sought to designate unused frozen IVF embryos as human beings, and a partisan lightning rod for Republicans in Congress who've repeatedly blocked legislation guaranteeing the right to IVF nationwide. At the same time, the debates are raising awareness around the growing need for these services, protections for them and policies that would make them more accessible. (IVF, a process used with donors, where sperm and egg are mixed in a lab and then implanted in a woman's uterus to try to make a baby, is not an option for many Americans; a single round can cost more than $30,000 and is generally not covered by insurance.)

But while social media is helping to destigmatize these problems and procedures, it's also having an unintended consequence: Recasting a serious medical procedure that's not without risk as something that's no big deal -- even fun, glamorous and above all, highly lucrative. TikTok and Instagram influencers are making trendy ""get ready with me"" and ""day in the life"" videos about donating their eggs; sharing viral videos during the retrievals using hashtags like #rich and #money; and in some cases getting paid to post their journeys without disclosing it. The industry contributes, too, as agencies, clinics and egg and sperm banks recruit donors with marketing about the luxury cars and designer bags one can buy by selling their genetic material. (A TikTok from Fairfax EggBank, one of the country's largest, touted Chanel and Louis Vuitton purses that would be up for grabs with the $48,000 earned. The video, set to Britney Spears' ""Oops! I Did It Again"" and liked hundreds of thousands of times, has since been taken down. The bank did not respond to a request for comment.)

The intentions -- attracting donors to give more people the opportunity to have families -- are commendable. Donating can also open doors for some who use what they earn to help cover tuition or pay off student loans, and many do it altruistically. But some donor-conceived people and experts say the vast majority of social media content that lures donors with fat checks and fancy things is doing more harm than good to the fertility world, violating moral codes by downplaying what's at stake for donors, recipient parents and future children when creating a human life.

Egg donation is generally low risk, but the risks involved are nonetheless ""real and potentially severe,"" according to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine. Some donors suffer from ""ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome,"" when the hormone medications and retrieval procedures cause excessive swelling of the donor's ovaries, which can result in severe abdominal pain, shortness of breath, vomiting and rapid weight gain that may land them in the hospital. Acute complications like infection, bleeding, loss of an ovary or damage to another reproductive organ could also threaten that woman's own ability to get pregnant (and it's not always clear who pays for medical treatment if something goes wrong).

Beyond possible health effects, the get-rich-quick messaging being amplified by influencers and industry alike has also left many donors brushing off or outright ignoring the implications of one day being tracked down by their biological children -- a feat now made easier than ever with social media, and commercial DNA tests like 23andMe and Ancestry, that together have all but done away with donor anonymity.

Illustrating a fuller picture and disclosing the risks at the outset is vital to donors' informed consent, according to Jamie Spiers, director of LGBTQ+ family advocacy at the U.S. Donor Conceived Council, a nonprofit that advocates for the community and has been central to legislative efforts to protect it.

""We're not against [donor] compensation -- it's just there's a balance between how much somebody's getting compensated, and the course of nature, and the ethical concerns, so we just want to... make sure that that's not the sole thing being highlighted when people are being recruited,"" Spiers told Forbes. ""Especially early on, it needs to be a more balanced understanding of what they're getting into.""

Rachel Schiff, the council's director of marketing, added that the types of posts catching fire on social media prey not only on the donors, but also on the emotionally vulnerable recipients desperate to do whatever they can to have a family.

""There is a lot of misinformation that can get thrown around,"" they said. ""And just because people want a baby so badly, they'll read it and take it at face value.""

omi Slossberg and her wife used a sperm donor to become mothers. After finding Seattle Sperm Bank through Google, Slossberg chose the biological father of her future children based on a small file -- a short bio and audio interview, basic genetic testing, yes-or-no answers to medical questions as simple as whether anyone in his family had worn glasses, and a baby photo that she had to trust was really him.

She spent $10,000 on the donor -- on top of $80,000 on fertility treatment and surgery where she lives in Colorado -- to conceive, only for her daughter to be born deaf in one ear. Slossberg has since tracked down more than a dozen half-siblings, including one who has hearing loss and another who was born missing an arm. When she eventually found the donor through a DNA test, he disclosed that his own sister had the same condition as her daughter (microtia, a birth defect resulting in a malformed ear). Doctors said there was no way of knowing whether the donor was the cause without deeper investigation, and a perfect outcome is never guaranteed in any pregnancy. But the experience led Slossberg to question whether donors are fully and truthfully disclosing their histories.

""The medical records that I was sold did not match the actual medical history of the donor,"" the 32-year-old creator, now a mother of two, told Forbes. Today she uses Instagram -- where she's built an audience of 37,000 -- to advocate for the rights of donor-conceived people, demanding more regulation around donor transparency and verification of their health documents.

""You're spending money thinking that you're buying something, and the description of the product is accurate, and then years later, you find out that it wasn't,"" she added. ""Obviously, at the end, the result is you have your children. But if they're sending you something for that amount of money, they should give you accurate information.""

High, the popular creator who calls herself ""your donor-conceived person of TikTok,"" was born in 1988 through a sperm donor after both her parents struggled with infertility. At the time, couples didn't typically pick their donors; clinics would instead choose the sperm donor that most closely matched the father's hair and eye color, ethnic background and religion. The man who'd be raising her was Irish, Scottish, Norwegian and Catholic, and they were told the donor would be just like him.

When High was 26, she learned through an Ancestry DNA test that the donor was, in fact, 100 percent Ashkenazi Jewish. (She said she looks ""very Ashkenazi"" and had long been a target of antisemitism without understanding why.)

""If the clinic lied about this, what else could they have lied about?"" she said.

Contacted by High, the doctor, who is still practicing in New York City, told her the medical records from more than three decades ago were gone and that the donor had been healthy. But the host of health issues High has grappled with, which now include infertility, have left her skeptical and eager for answers.

""I don't know what I should be expecting for my life. I'm about to have a kid. I have no idea what could potentially be a quarter of them, and it's scary,"" she told Forbes. ""How susceptible am I to cancers? To Parkinson's? To Alzheimer's? To heart failure? And these are all things that, with proper screening, could be prevented. ... I don't even know if breast cancer runs in his family. I don't even know if I should be getting mammograms early, and an early mammogram wouldn't be covered by health insurance because I don't have a 'family history' of it.""

""Unless you've gone through medical emergencies like this, it's something that you don't understand,"" she added. ""And if you don't understand why having a complete medical history is imperative, consider yourself very privileged that you have not been put in that situation.""

At 29, using Ancestry and Facebook, High found her biological father. She wrote him a letter, asking for a conversation and some medical information, and hand-delivered it to his office in New York City. Seven years later, she hasn't heard back.

here are few laws governing how all this works in the U.S. And though the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, which represents the fertility industry, has issued ethical guidelines, whether and how to follow them is up to those providing services or care. (The Society declined to comment for this story, instead sending Forbes a link to its recommendations, which predate TikTok's explosion in the U.S.)

Still, creators' advocacy on and off social media has helped lead to the passage of a number of state laws, and the introduction of federal legislation, that would place guardrails on the space.

In 2022, the nonprofit donor-conceived council and Slossberg, the influencer and recipient parent from Colorado, helped the state become the first and only in the country to ban anonymous sperm and egg donations, granting donor-conceived kids the right to know their donor's identity at 18 (the United Kingdom and Sweden have similar mandates). It's also the first and only U.S. law to limit how much one donor can donate, preventing them from giving to more than 25 families and capping egg donors at six cycles. The Colorado law, which will also set the minimum donor age at 21 and create rules for accessing and updating their records and medical history, takes effect in January.

In 2023, High, the top TikToker, helped usher the introduction of a federal bill that would criminalize so-called ""fertility fraud,"" where providers misrepresent whose DNA they're using for IVF or assisted insemination. The issue drew national attention with the Netflix documentary ""Our Father,"" which tells the story of one of dozens of fertility doctors in the U.S. who've been accused of implanting their own sperm in their patients. The legislation is unlikely to move in an election year but has picked up 53 bipartisan cosponsors, and about a dozen states already have similar laws on the books thanks in part to influencers' advocacy.

And next weekend, for the second year in a row, donor-conceived advocates including Slossberg will gather at the largest meeting-of-the-minds in reproductive health, the Society's annual ""Scientific Congress & Expo"" in Denver. Their goal is ""advocating for the equivalent of seat belts to the fertility industry,"" said High, who protested outside last year's event with others from the community.

""This is not an industry that creates tables, creates shirts; they're literally making babies,"" she said. ""They should be held to the highest standard. And the fact that we don't have the equivalent of a seat belt should terrify everybody."""
Harris echoes debunked claim about Georgia abortion limits causing woman's death despite pushback from doctors,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-echoes-debunked-claim-about-georgia-abortion-limits-causing-womans-death-despite-pushback-from-doctors,2024-10-07T10:33:58Z,"Two Georgia doctors, one a congressman and the other a state legislator, weigh in on the tragic case of Amber Nicole Thurman and media claims that state laws regulating abortion led to her death.

Vice President Kamala Harris repeated the left's claim Sunday that a woman in Georgia died due to delayed care as a result of the state's abortion limits, despite doctors previously denouncing the narrative as false.

During an interview on the raunchy and often-sexually explicit ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, host Alex Cooper asked Harris about the impact of the overturning of Roe v. Wade, blaming the death of Amber Nicole Thurman on the Supreme Court ruling and the state's abortion limits after she received a chemically induced abortion in 2022.

""So, Amber was a young mother of a six-year-old son. She was a medical assistant who was so excited because she was just getting on her feet to be independent. She got her own apartment in a gated community with a pool that her son could play in. She got accepted to nursing school,"" Harris told listeners.

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

""She was, as described by her family, so excited and so ambitious, and she had plans. Then she found out she was pregnant, and she didn't want to go through with her pregnancy. And she was living in Georgia, and she couldn't receive care there because she was past six weeks. And so she ended up going to another state, and...she couldn't get there on time. And because the other state had been so overwhelmed by all these women coming from all these southern states who couldn't get treatment in their own state, her window for her appointment had closed and instead of having a surgical procedure, she had medication and basically went back home and then had some complications and went to the hospital because she was bleeding.""

""And they delayed 20 hours before they treated her,"" Harris continued, suggesting that Georgia's laws prevented her from receiving lifesaving care.

Her remark comes after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

Harris and other members of the Democratic Party, including her running mate Tim Walz, have cited their deaths as evidence for the need to expand abortion access after the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.

""Here's the thing that's so messed up about this,"" Harris told Cooper. ""Some of these people will say whoa, but I do believe in exceptions, I believe that there should be an exception in terms of the life of the mother. You know what that means in practical terms? She's almost dead before you decide to give her care. What, so we're going to have public health policy that says a doctor, a medical professional, waits until you're at death's door before they gives you care. That's outrageous...where is the humanity?""

Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

OB-GYNs have criticized the Amber Thurman narrative as a misleading story that is being pushed by the media and Democrats.

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Charlotte Lozier Institute Vice President and Director of Medical Affairs Dr. Ingrid Skop called out the ""fearmongering"" and ""lies"" of the media that are hurting women who don't understand new abortion laws.

""I was not surprised to see this pro-abortion media try to point the blame at Georgia's pro-life laws, but, in fact, Georgia's laws allow doctors to intervene to save the life of the woman,"" Skop recently told Fox News Digital.

""I think the focus of the Democratic Party upon abortion as an issue is only because the American people do not understand the laws. Many times, women are hurt by abortions. It is not necessary for women to live their best life. And, of course, it's the fearmongering and lies that have led us to this place where we are today, where people even think there would be a reason to point at the law.""

U.S. Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., and state Rep. Mark Newton have also come out to say they don't believe Georgia laws had anything to do with Thurman's death, alleging it was caused by complications from abortion pills because doctors may have waited too long to intercede.

""We never deny a woman an abortion because it's going to harm her in some way. She will always be protected,"" McCormick said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital.

""You have every right to an abortion, even with that heartbeat law,"" he continued. ""So, let's make that very clear right now. When they say there's no exceptions, there's never any law in any state where there's no exceptions. That doesn't exist. That's simply not the way it works. The mother's life is always protected. With that said, it doesn't mean it's easy to get an abortion just because you have a complication or because something goes wrong.""

Dr. Christina Francis, CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), made similar comments on ""Fox & Friends"" last month.

""We are seeing the direct results of spreading lies and misinformation about these laws. Women are being harmed by that because they are delaying in seeking care. And so I think it's really important, no matter where somebody stands on the issue of abortion, we should all want women to have accurate information so that they seek care immediately if they're experiencing complications from things like these high-risk abortion drugs,"" Francis said.

ProPublica previously defended their story in a statement to Fox News Digital, saying, ""We stand by our reporting. The state's committee of more than 30 experts concluded that the deaths of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller were preventable, a newsworthy finding. Our ongoing reporting is illuminating the challenges doctors face in caring for patients with pregnancy complications in states with restricted access to abortion.""

An attorney, who recently won a case involving a Virginia school board firing a teacher refusing to use a student's preferred pronouns, told Fox News Digital that the settlement has ""seismic implications.""

""We're grateful that, because of this decision, tolerance is now a two‐way street, not a one‐way ratchet for totalitarian ideology,"" Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) President and CEO Kristen Waggoner told Fox News Digital on Friday.

The Virginia-based West Point School Board agreed to pay a former high school teacher, Peter Vlaming, $575,000 in damages and attorney's fees after he refused to call a transgender student by their preferred pronouns.

""It protects all teachers in Virginia and its rationale should guide other courts addressing similar issues,"" Waggoner said.

She also said that the ADF represents many other teachers facing similar situations in other states and how ""no teacher should be fired for living according to their beliefs or protecting their students.""

The settlement stems from a lawsuit filed by ADF against the school board in September 2019. Vlaming, who taught French at West Point High School for 7 years, lost his job after the board made the unanimous 5-0 decision to fire him. A devout Christian, Vlaming said he could not comply with the school district's policy to refer to students with pronouns inconsistent with their biological sex.

According to the ADF, ""Vlaming tried to accommodate the student by consistently using the student's new preferred name and by avoiding the use of pronouns altogether.""

However, school officials were obstinate that Vlaming used the student's preferred pronouns and also to use them ""even when the student wasn't present,"" ADF claimed.

Several months before Vlaming's court victory, the Virginia Supreme Court reinstated the case after it was stuck down in a lower court. According to the Virginia Mercury, the King William Circuit Court ""did not believe Vlaming had any valid reasons for the law to accept his suit.""

""However, the Supreme Court determined in December that the school board violated Vlaming's rights,"" the outlet reported.

The board did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

""Peter's Christian faith prevented him from lying to his students about biological reality by using pronouns inconsistent with a student's sex,"" ADF attorney Waggoner told Fox News Digital. ""Since his victory in court, we have seen overwhelming gratitude and support on social media from people who, like Peter, teach or work in places that might punish them for living according to their beliefs.""

In addition to the cash settlement, Vlaming scored another win after the case.

The settlement agreement authorized that Vlaming's record be cleared, and that the West Point School Board's policies to ""respect free speech.""

The French teacher is allowed to go back to teaching and his former colleagues at West Point School can also do their jobs ""without fear of retribution for living consistent with their faith and biological reality,"" the attorney added.

""I am so relieved that our fundamental rights of freedom of expression and freedom of religion were upheld,"" Vlaming told Fox News Digital. ""However, it still bewilders me that a legal battle was necessary to reiterate that thought police and compelled speech are antithetical to the foundations of Virginian and American society; not to mention western civilization. How did we arrive at such a point today in America?"""
"North Carolina woman eats nothing but sardines, loses 35 pounds: 'This is not a diet'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/north-carolina-woman-eats-nothing-sardines-loses-35-pounds-this-not-diet,2024-10-07T09:24:31Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A North Carolina woman has spent the last three months eating nothing but sardines - and she said it has changed her life and improved her health.

""This is not a diet. To me, a diet insinuates a beginning and an end. This is my lifestyle and I have no intention of introducing plants back into it,"" Jane Crummett of Mint Hill, North Carolina, told Fox News Digital.

Crummett normally eats no carbohydrates whatsoever, calling it a ""zero carb/carnivore"" way of eating. She also eschews dairy, saying she ""finds it inflammatory.""

BEST AND WORST FOODS FOR PEOPLE WITH DIABETES TO MAINTAIN GOOD HEALTH

But for the last three months, she ate nothing but sardines and MCT oil, a supplement that helps the body get energy.

Each day, Crummett said she consumed four cans of sardines, plus MCT oil.

Crummett said she ended her experiment on Sept. 30 after 135 days.

Since switching to only sardines, she has lost 35 pounds in three months, she said.

Plus, she said, she feels she's experienced a host of other health benefits.

""My pain has resolved,"" she said, noting that she previously dealt with plantar fasciitis, a foot condition. Her inflammation, too, has decreased, she told Fox News Digital.

Despite her extreme dietary regimen, Crummett insists she's in good health and sees a doctor regularly.

""I have tested all kinds of things,"" she said. ""I'm a firm believer that if you don't figure things out for yourself, you'll never know.""

Crummett said she planned on gradually re-introducing various meats back into her diet - with the assistance and guidance of a doctor.

""My plan is to eat sardines with two tablespoons of MCT oil for breakfast and then will introduce about three ounces of beef with [a few] tablespoons of beef drippings for lunch, then sardines for dinner,"" she said.

""I will have to take things day by day and just see how my blood sugar reacts to the new food,"" she said, noting that she's noticed her blood glucose levels have increased if she eats too much protein at once.

FISH OIL SUPPLEMENTS LINKED TO GREATER FIRST-TIME HEART ATTACK RISK IN STUDY: 'NOT UNIVERSALLY GOOD OR BAD'

""My ultimate goal is to have sardines for breakfast every day with MCT oil and incorporate normal beef, pork and/or chicken back into my diet,"" she said.

A dietitian, however, raised concerns about the ""carnivore"" lifestyle.

Omega-3 fatty acids ""should be part of a balanced diet.""

""In the short term, I would imagine that any type of change she's making is going to show immediate results. And it sounds to me like she had some issues with her gut and that she's removed some of the foods that [may have been] causing inflammation,"" Kim Shapira, M.S., R.D., told Fox News Digital in a Zoom interview.

Shapira, based in Los Angeles, is founder of the Kim Shapira Method and author of the book ""This is What You're Really Hungry For."" (Shapira was not involved in Crummett's dietary choices.)

A zero-carb diet, Shapira said simply, is ""not a sustainable way to live.""

Crummett's choice of sardines is an ""amazing form of omega-3s - a really good fatty acid,"" she said.

""The Mediterranean diet - the type of diet that includes a balance of everything - is really what we need long term,"" she said.

""When you go on a low-carb diet, you're actually dehydrating your system. So when you say 'quick weight loss,' it is quick weight loss only in the fact that it's water loss. It's not actually fat loss,"" she said.

""If you would like to lose weight, you actually need a combination of so many things,"" Shapira continued -- ""including lifestyle changes, better eating habits, exercise, sleep, and water intake.""

She added, ""I wish people would see historically that any time there is a diet trend and people jump on it, it doesn't last, it's not sustainable."""
The borderless music of Gabriela Ortiz,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5081260/the-borderless-music-of-gabriela-ortiz,2024-10-07T09:10:33Z,"Gabriela Ortiz is occupying the Composer's Chair at Carnegie Hall this season. Marta Arteaga hide caption

Composer Gabriela Ortiz has paid some dues -- and now she's collecting. Earlier in her career, she walked out on sexist professors, rebuffed condescending musicians and once waited hours to meet with a conductor in hopes of simply hearing her own music performed. In 2019, she underwent treatment for colon cancer, which is now in remission.

Today, the 59-year-old Mexico City native is enjoying some well-deserved recognition. Ortiz has just begun a year-long composer's residency at Carnegie Hall, where her music and her programming will be heard in a variety of contexts. She's serving in similar roles this season at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia and the Castilla y León Symphony in Spain.

She's also cultivated a crushing schedule. In the past four years, Ortiz has premiered at least 10 major orchestral works, half of them championed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and its star conductor Gustavo Dudamel, who has called her one of the most talented composers in the world and who will lead Ortiz's new cello concerto, written for Alisa Weilerstein, at Carnegie Hall on Oct. 9. Revolución Diamantina, a recent album of her works performed with Dudamel and his orchestra, has earned glowing reviews for how deftly it combines an array of musical languages, from high European modernism to the roots of Latin American folk.

Music, and hard-won confidence, run in the Ortiz family. Her grandfather, a classical music enthusiast, moved to Mexico from Basque Country, Spain, and saw Gustav Mahler conduct in New York while living on the East Coast. Ortiz's parents co-founded Los Folkloristas, the celebrated band dedicated to Latin American folk music and research, and she learned to play instruments in the group's outreach learning center for children. With the piano as her primary instrument, Ortiz realized early on that the life of a concert pianist was perhaps beyond her reach -- but the idea of composing blossomed after an early encounter with Béla Bartók's music, and from there, nothing could stop her ambitions.

From her studio in Mexico City, Ortiz joined a video chat for a far-ranging conversation about the role folk music plays in her work, the importance of speaking your mind in your art, and what it really means to be a composer from Mexico.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Tom Huizenga: I first heard your music in 1998 at a Kronos Quartet concert, where the group played Altar de Muertos. In the final movement of that piece, there's a reference to an Indigenous music culture from Mexico -- a Huichol folk melody from the state of Nayarit. That same melody has now appeared in at least two more of your pieces, including the recent Kauyumari. What attracted you to this folk tune?

Gabriela Ortiz: I first heard it on a Huichol recording. Normally I never use direct quotations, but in this case, because the melody was very attractive, I just had to use it. The [folk musicians] play a violin that only has two strings, so I harmonized that melody and developed it rhythmically. The melody repeats and repeats -- and for the Huichol people, repetition is very important, because it's music you play in peyote ceremonies where hallucinations are a way to contact ancestors.

Your parents were founding members of the band Los Folkloristas, which specialized in Latin American folk music; was the use of that melody influenced by your childhood experiences?

No, I never heard Los Folkloristas play Huichol music. Normally, the folk music that we hear in Mexico is a mixture between European, Indigenous and African -- those are the three main roots. This came later, when I got the recording from the Institute of Anthropology, and I just fell in love with it.

What was it like growing up in a household steeped in folk music?

It was fun, because some of the rehearsals took place in our house. My father was an architect, so we had a big house, and in the basement was a studio full of instruments -- guitars, a charango and drums and different instruments, not only from Mexico but from Latin America. They had rehearsals in the evenings, and of course my parents said, ""Go to bed!"" But I never went to bed; I stayed in the hall trying to listen to the music.

I also met important musicians, like Atahualpa Yupanqui and Mercedes Sosa, who came to our house. Also Victor Jara, the Chilean singer -- the only time he came to Mexico, he stayed in our house. During the dictatorship of Pinochet, they captured him and cut off his hands. I remember my father crying when someone called to tell him that Victor Jara had died; he was shouting, ""No, no!"" and I didn't know what was happening. So yes, it was important for me not only musically, but also politically.

Did you ever play in the group with your parents?

Not in the group. Los Folkloristas had a school for people who wanted to learn folk music, so I played guitar and charango in the children's section. Sometimes I sat in with them for fun, but never in a concert hall.

Were you hearing any classical music in those early days?

Absolutely. My mother played piano for 18 years; she was a very good sight reader. And I remember my father took me to see a concert with Eduardo Mata, the conductor who was one of our greatest directors in the history of music in Mexico. He was conducting the London Symphony, and I remember that they played Manuel de Falla's El sombrero de tres picos and I was like, ""Oh my God!"" I just loved it.

My father was an architect, but he wanted to be a classical composer. He couldn't do it because my mother died very young, and he got depressed and said, ""Well, I don't know if I'm going to be a composer, but my daughter could be a composer."" So, suddenly he put all of his thinking into my career.

Whose idea was it for you to become a composer?

I remember when I was 7 or 8 years old, my mother said, ""I'm seeing that you love music and you play the guitar. Why don't you start learning the piano, and learn how to read music?"" So I started piano lessons. When I was about 13 years old I changed to a new teacher, and this woman was like a Mexican version of Nadia Boulanger. She was a very good teacher of harmony and solfège, and she introduced me to Béla Bartók. At the time, I was playing Mozart, Bach and Schumann, but when I first heard Bartók's music I said, ""Wow, what is this?"" I immediately had a connection, probably because of the rhythm and the modal language. It was a totally different thing. I said, ""I want to write little pieces for piano like Bartók,"" so I started composing for the piano. Then I realized, I'm not going to be a concert pianist -- that's not my goal. I want to be a composer.

I feel like Mexico is still rather under the radar in terms of people knowing about its rich history in classical music. Carlos Chávez or possibly Silvestre Revueltas are the only composers many people know, even classical fans. Why is that?

There is no interest. When I was studying in England, they didn't know who Revueltas or Chávez was. They didn't care about what was happening in Latin America. Also, in Latin American institutions, you learn Western European music, basically. It's part of the canon in all the universities. German Romanticism is strongly emphasized -- Beethoven, Bach. But do we really know all of the contributions by Villa-Lobos or by Ginastera, or even by Revueltas?

Many young Latin American composers move to Europe, because they want their music to be played. They compromise their language because they are composing in a very European style. For me, that's one of the other problems. I mean, of course, if they want to compose like that, it's OK. But many of them compose in the spectralism style, like that of Tristan Murail or Helmut Lachenmann.

You teach at the National Autonomous University in Mexico City. Do your students choose to compose in that European style?

Some of them. Of course, if they want to compose like that, there is nothing that I can do -- I have to respect their freedom, and I can only speak for myself. That style doesn't work for me; I don't belong to that. I was not born in Germany, so why do I have to compose like Lachenmann or Wolfgang Rihm? I'm totally different.

This leads me to wonder: What does it mean to you to be a Mexican composer? I think it was Virgil Thomson who was once asked how you define American music, and he said: ""It's music made by someone with an American passport."" Is it that simple for you, or is there more to it?

This is the most important thing: When I do my music, I write what I have to say. I'm not thinking, ""Okay, this is going to sound really Mexican"" -- never. If I use a Huichol melody, it's because I really like it. But if I find a melody from Bali, maybe I will use it as well. What's important is what you do with that.

It's very difficult to define Mexico, because Mexico is huge. It's not the same in the North as in the South or the center. One of the main problems is that people try to put a specific label on Latin American music, and that's totally wrong because Latin America is so different -- Argentina from Mexico, or from Venezuela, or the Caribbean countries.

I feel like your music has a singular language, but there are influences as well. First and foremost, I hear Stravinsky -- those stabbing rhythms in your ballet Revolución Diamantina, also in Téenek and Clara. What draws you to Stravinsky?

Stravinsky is one of my favorite composers. He's a genius. I still believe that The Rite of Spring is one of the most important orchestral pieces in the 20th century. There is a strong pulse and an irregularity in Stravinsky that I really like; you're always feeling that it's changing and giving you something new. Latin American music can be very regular, but if you analyze my music, rhythmically speaking, it's very irregular.

You change meters a lot.

Yes, and this is something that I learned from Stravinsky. But you have to understand that we have the right to absorb those composers. The [perception] is, ""Oh, you're a Mexican, so you cannot address Beethoven."" But Beethoven is universal. He's as important to me as he is to the German people. I also come from this European tradition; the Spanish were here in Mexico. It's a big problem when you talk about borders in music. There are no borders. Mahler belongs to me. Why not?

And so do György Ligeti and Olivier Messiaen -- I hear little essences of those modernist composers in your ballet, and in the violin concerto Altar de Cuerda. You're agile at blending avant-garde and European classical traditions with Latin American folk styles. Do you have a sense of what your own music sounds like?

It's difficult to explain in a rational way, but it comes very natural. I'm absorbing everything. It's just there, it's part of who I am, and Debussy is as important as Perez Prado or mariachi music. If I need to have that kind of influence for a specific reason, I will use it. For example, in the fifth movement of my ballet -- the protest section -- there is a samba. But it's not there because I want to sound Latin American by using a Brazilian samba. There's a political reason to use it.

I find the element of rhythm is so strong in your music. In works like Kauyumari, Yanga, Téenek and especially the trumpet concerto Altar de Bronce, the beats make you want to shake your hips.

I like to work with rhythm; it comes naturally. And I like to dance. Probably, in my past life, I used to be a flamenco dancer.

How did some of these rhythms get to Mexico in the first place?

From Africa. People forget that in the 16th century, there was a very strong African influence in Mexico, and immediately the African slave population mixed with the Indigenous populations and with the Spanish. All these cultures mixed together was very strong in Mexico -- a melting pot. If you go to Vera Cruz, you dance danzón. There are so many things that stem from Africa.

So you have all of these Afro-Cuban and Indigenous Latin American rhythms in your music. How hard is it to get orchestral musicians, steeped in Brahms and Beethoven, to play those grooves with soul?

If the music is well-written, it's going to speak. I mean, you don't have to be Russian to play The Rite of Spring. You don't have to be Hungarian to play Bartók. I remember hearing Beethoven by [Venezuela's] Simon Bolivar Symphony, conducted by Dudamel -- and wow, what a version of Beethoven. Music is a universal language.

By my count, since 2020 you have had 10 major orchestral premieres -- half of them conducted by Gustavo Dudamel -- and that's not counting the world premiere of your cello concerto for Alisa Weilerstein, or your non-orchestral premieres. That's a lot of music. What does that say about your career?

It's very exciting. If you had asked me this question 20 years ago, I would never have imagined that I would be in this position, especially here in Mexico. I don't know how I did it, really. But I can tell you that I worked very, very hard. It was a unique opportunity when I wrote Téenek for Gustavo -- that was my first piece for him, and I put all my effort into writing a good piece, because I knew that it was going to be something that would either open the door or close it.

Are you at the peak of your career right now?

I don't know, but I'm very happy right now, and I'll tell you why: All composers need good performers to play their music. It is the only way we can learn, by listening to our music. That's why I talk to Gustavo about the need for a pan-Latin American initiative, because believe me, the opportunities here are 10 times harder than in other countries.

Why is that?

Because we don't have as many orchestras as you do in the U.S., or as many opportunities. When I was a student, I wrote my first orchestral work under the guidance of Mario Lavista. And I was desperate to hear my piece. There was no orchestra at the university, so that was not an option. But you know what I did? I went to the Mexico Philharmonic Orchestra -- a professional orchestra -- with my score in hand and I said, ""I want to speak to the maestro."" They said, ""Do you have an appointment?"" I said, ""No. I will wait.""

I stayed for two hours to speak with Herrera de la Fuente. We met in his office and I told him, ""I want to hear my piece. That's all I need. I'm a student, I want to become a composer, and I want to hear it desperately."" He looked at the score and said, ""We'll call you."" Three months later, I received a call: ""We are going to play your piece."" That was the only way I could hear my music.

For me, the three pieces on your recent album with Dudamel leading the LA Phil mark a high point in your career. There's the short orchestral show piece Kauyumari, the diverse and deeply considered violin concerto Altar de Cuerda, and the expansive, politically charged ballet Revolución Diamantina, which translates as ""Glitter Revolution"" in English.

This is why I love the LA Phil and Gustavo, because they asked me what I would like to write. [I said,] ""I want to write a ballet."" And Gustavo said, ""Why don't you write something including choir, because we want to pair your piece with Beethoven's Ninth."" I told them it was going to have a very political theme, that I needed to express the femicide situation that is unbearable here in Mexico. And they said, ""Yes, do it.""

In the notes for the album, you mention that writing the ballet forced you to reach ""beyond the aesthetic languages I know, by experimenting with new tools."" Can you say more about the strategies you had to learn in order to write this piece?

I was exploring things like whispering and amplified voices, not just singing -- making noises, protesting and shouting slogans. Shouting things like, ""Con ropa o sin ropa, mi cuerpo no se toca"" [""With or without clothes, my body is not touched""]. It was totally out of my comfort zone; I never wrote music based on a street protest.

For example, the fourth movement -- it's very Stravinskian in some sections, but in others is the depiction of domestic violence. And I was trying to see how I could make the violence stronger and stronger in the music by raising the level of sound until you get to ""pa, tu, pa, ta,"" which represents the fighting. I was experimenting with the voices in a percussive way -- very different in the context of orchestral music, and in the context of a ballet.

The themes of gender inequality in the ballet make me think of your orchestral work Clara, inspired by the pianist-composer Clara Schumann, the overshadowed wife of composer Robert Schumann. You've said about this piece: ""Throughout history, women have had to overcome major obstacles marked by gender differences. There are many of us who have rebelled against these evident forms of injustice and struggled to gain recognition and a place in society."" That makes me wonder if you, yourself, have had to overcome similar obstacles as a woman composer?

Yes, sometimes. I remember I was very young, presenting a clarinet piece to a composition teacher, and the guy saw the score and he said, ""Think about Clara Schumann and Robert Schumann. Robert is better. Think about Fanny and Felix Mendelssohn. Felix is much better. Think about Alma Mahler and Gustav Mahler. Gustav is better. Don't you think women compose like they're cooking a recipe?"" When he said that, I took my score and I left the room and never came back.

Almost every woman composer I've talked to has a story. Kaija Saariaho told me about professors who didn't want to teach her because she was pretty and would get married and have children. Meredith Monk recalled men who made her feel like there was something wrong with her because she had a vision of what she wanted to do. But both of them also said there was no way anyone could stop them.

That's correct. I mean, I was very angry, but he didn't stop me from writing music. I always face the problem of being a woman composer, but also a Latin American composer. I remember when I was in Darmstadt, Germany [a hotbed of experimental music], one performer came to me and said, condescendingly, ""Oh, you're from Mexico -- so you're the kind of Mexican composer who works with melody and rhythm and harmony."" And I said, ""Yes. Is there a problem with that?"" I like music. And music is about melody, rhythm, harmony, chords -- not only about texture and noise.

You must feel a certain sense of pride, and responsibility, now that you're taking on the position of Composer's Chair at Carnegie Hall this season. What kind of freedom does this residency offer?

A lot of freedom. I proposed a series of concerts and they allowed me to collaborate with different ensembles, like the Ensemble Connect -- that concert will feature Latin American music. If I can help promote these incredible composers, I will do that. We're also doing an interdisciplinary project called Can We Know the Sound of Forgiveness, a collaboration with visual artist James Drake; the writer Benjamin Alires Sáenz from El Paso, Texas; Alejandro Escuer, the Mexican flutist; and The Crossing choir. I was able to propose that project, which was well received by the institution.

What kind of advice are you giving your students at the National Autonomous University in Mexico City who want to have a career as a composer?

I always tell them they have to work very hard and have a lot of discipline. Talent is important, of course, but it's not only about talent. You have to put all of your soul into your work. Every single piece has to be a winner, no matter if it's for solo clarinet or for orchestra. Another important thing is, they have to live their lives very intensely, because that's the fuel for your creativity, for life itself.

I have to tell you, I feel I made the right decision to stay in this country. When I finished my PhD in London, I was thinking maybe I should stay there because of the opportunities. I was also offered to teach at Indiana University and other places in the U.S. [But] I always thought that it was important for me to be here in Mexico. Because the Autonomous University is a free university -- it's tough to get in, but once you're in, you don't pay a single peso -- so people come from many different economic levels. For me, it's important, because I feel that I'm making a contribution to my country and to my own people. I feel like I'm putting a seed in each of them.

What kind of advice are you giving to yourself these days, given how busy you are writing music and navigating your rising reputation?

Sometimes I think: ""Why didn't this happen years ago? It's happening when I'm turning 60?"" So I have to be very wise with my time. I have to take care of myself. I exercise -- I'm wearing pants right now because I came from the gym. I have to live my life as well, every second. I have to enjoy the simple things. If I'm seeing a friend, I have to enjoy that moment. If I'm reading a book, I have to enjoy that.

Also, be sensitive about what's happening. Perhaps 10 years ago, I would have been more careful about the things I talk about, but not now. I'm in a position that if I need to talk about feminism, I will do it. If I need to talk about climate change, I will do it, because that matters to me. It's all a part of our life."
It's a close race for Michigan. These factors could decide it for Harris or Trump,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/nx-s1-5130163/michigan-2024-election-harris-trump,2024-10-07T09:06:21Z,"A Trump and Harris sign side-by-side in a neighborhood on Oct. 3, 2024 in Hillsdale, Mich. Sylvia Jarrus for NPR hide caption

Michigan is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House.

The state is part of the ""blue wall,"" along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, that she and Democrats need to hold to avoid a second Donald Trump presidency.

It's home to some of the key demographics that both parties are courting this election, from white voters without college degrees to the largest Black-majority city, Detroit, and one of the nation's largest Arab American populations.

But the path to victory is not easy this year. Harris and Trump remain in a close battle, as his populist message continues to resonate with white voters and union and blue-collar workers, particularly on the economy.

Dave Dulio, a professor of political science and director of the Center for Civic Engagement at Oakland University, says ""in places like Macomb County, with many blue-collar voters and union workers, Trump made inroads by pledging to get the U.S. out of bad trade deals and renegotiate NAFTA, which he did.""

""I think they still give him credit for that,"" he added.

Dulio underscores the state's significance by noting that small shifts could lead to substantial changes for candidates: ""If you take a small shift among the Arab American community and a small shift among union workers, those multiple small shifts could drive a very different result.""

Both candidates have heaped attention recently on the Wolverine State. On Oct 4, Harris visited a Redford Charter Township firehouse near Detroit, meeting union representatives. She met with Arab American and Muslim leaders then appeared with United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain in Flint and vowed support for Michigan's auto industry. Trump held campaign events twice in September and took his presidential campaign to Saginaw Valley State University in Kochville Township on Oct. 3.

Michigan also plays to the strengths of the vice presidential nominees, who hail from the Midwest. Both Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have stumped in the state in the last month.

To better understand the key issues shaping voters' decisions -- from the economy and immigration to abortion and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East -- we are in Michigan this week hearing directly from voters and political observers as part of our ""We, The Voters"" series.

A September poll by The New York Times and Siena College found that Michigan voters cared most about the economy, followed by abortion and immigration.

Economy

Michigan's unemployment rate is historically low, according to state data, but it has slowly ticked up in recent months. Meanwhile, inflation has eased, but high costs of living remain a concern.

The state continues to suffer from the decades-long decline of automobile manufacturing, and high interest rates have constricted sales of cars, according to a September study from the University of Michigan.

Both parties are trying to put focus on the economy. GOP attack ads argue that Biden and Harris are responsible for inflation, while the vice president's messaging focuses on plans to uplift the middle class and paint Trump-era tax cuts as benefiting the wealthy.

Meghan Wilson, an expert in public policy and urban development, said Harris could expand the Democratic position on economics by appealing to Black business owners and holders of student debt.

""African Americans in Detroit have a lot of small businesses, and so we're looking for capital for those kinds of small businesses. I think Kamala Harris is doing a great job of bringing the small businesses into the conversation,"" Wilson explained.

Organized labor plays a key role in Michigan's economy. Both parties are making a play for Michigan's union members, who accounted for 13% of workers in the state last year. Exit polls in 2020 showed Michigan's union voters favoring President Biden over Trump, and Biden pledged to be ""the most pro-union president"" in U.S. history, which he backed up with a visit to UAW workers striking in Wayne, Mich.

Michigan pollster Bernie Porn said Biden's visit to striking workers helped him bump up his union support, but his policies to advance electric vehicles with tax credits were unpopular with Independent and Republican voters.

""You have Harris leading among union members with 63% which is almost where Biden was in 2020 with 65%, so she's improving her lot among union members, but still, the EVs are a problem,"" he said.

Still, one encouraging sign for the Harris campaign could be Michigan's local Teamsters union backing her candidacy, breaking with the national union that declined to endorse any candidate for U.S. president, after they had supported every Democratic candidate for president since Bill Clinton.

Abortion

Two years ago, Michigan voters approved a landmark amendment to the state constitution, securing the right to abortion and other reproductive health services.

Democrats won control of all three branches of Michigan's governments since making abortion a central voting issue.

But that success may have made it a less influential issue in the 2024 election. A KFF poll in June found that women in Michigan saw abortion as ""decided"" and they were more concerned about inflation and the rising cost of living.

""The Democrats are putting an awful lot of their eggs in the basket of abortion,"" the pollster Porn said.

Dulio pointed out that Trump's main weakness stems from what has driven Democratic success in every election -- and not necessarily abortion since it's already decided in the state: ""His character remains a key weakness. He's deeply unpopular because of the Jan. 6 spectacle and doubling down on his claims that the 2020 election was stolen. That just turns off persuadable voters,"" he said.

Michigan is home to one of the largest Black populations in the nation, ahead of Louisiana, Alabama and South Carolina, and the largest Black-majority city, Detroit.

Harris would herself be the nation's first Black woman president, but some Black voters may not be as motivated to vote as they were in 2020.

""The main challenge is the enthusiasm gap,"" said Ronald Brown, a political scientist at Wayne State University. He said among Black voters in Michigan, those who were in the ""black leadership class"" -- meaning serving in government, churches, Black fraternities and sororities -- were highly likely to vote for Harris. However, those without deep connections to the party, especially working-class and poor Detroit residents, were susceptible to sitting out elections. In particular, he pointed to Detroit's recent voter turnout -- higher in 2020 than it was in 2016 -- as a key factor explaining the state's pick for Biden after it went for Trump four years earlier.

""What could occur is that among working class and poor Black voters, lack of interest could lead to fatigue and this may drive those voters not to vote. And in Michigan, you don't need many. You need enough,"" he said.

Democratic state Sen. Sarah Anthony has a different perspective. She had seen an encouraging gain among young people to help shore up Harris' base.

""The Biden coalition included many working-class white men, a group Vice President Harris has struggled to win over. While there may have been losses there, the data I've seen shows significant gains due to increased enthusiasm among young people and people of color,"" she said.

U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East

The Detroit Metropolitan area has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the U.S. Dearborn, often called the Capital of Arab America, is home to a majority of Lebanese residents who maintain strong ties to southern Lebanon.

Arab and Muslim voters here were largely supportive of Biden in 2020. However, many have since been alienated by his handling of Israel's deadly war in Gaza and the administration's ongoing military aid to Israel. Many now are similarly concerned about Israel's continuing bombardment of Beirut and ground invasion along the countries' shared border.

Abbas Alawieh, a Dearborn Democratic strategist and one of the co-founders of the ""uncommitted movement,"" backed Biden in 2020. But earlier this year, he and other organizers successfully secured more than 100,000 ""uncommitted"" votes in the Michigan primary to protest Biden's handling of the war in Gaza.

Alawieh, who had advocated for a Gaza ceasefire, told Morning Edition host Leila Fadel that he feels more despair now as the conflict spreads to his family's homeland, Lebanon.

""This is a grieving community. So, for us to give guidance to vote for Kamala Harris, when she is part of the administration that's actively killing their family members, it's like giving a campaign speech at a funeral.""

Professor Dubio said the uncommitted movement has the potential to ""have a huge impact,"" and while he believes many of them will ultimately vote for Harris, he added, ""it can't and shouldn't be ignored.""

Abbas mentioned sending letters to Vice President Harris's team, including her national security advisor, requesting meetings with those directly affected by the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. ""So far, the answer is still no.""

He added that Donald Trump visited the community, took photos with leaders, and invited them to his campaign rally.

Saeed Khan, an associate professor of Near Eastern and Asian Studies at Wayne State University, said Muslim and Arab voters were drifting toward Trump in 2016, and some continue to do so today, not only because of a push away from Democrats, but also a pull toward the Republican party's values. Many Arabs and Muslims, immigrant Muslims, voted for the Republican ticket at least until September 11 and then started to move toward the Democratic Party.

""The Republican message of self-reliance, smaller government or less government intrusion, lower taxes, social conservatism really appealed to many, especially immigrant Muslims and Arabs, because it epitomized the American Dream that they had internalized,"" Khan said."

Sammy Hagar was just given the key to the Las Vegas Strip, but the former Van Halen frontman also has the key to a successful marriage.

Hagar and Kari Karte will celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary next year, and the rocker says that amazing chemistry is the secret to their lasting romance.

During an interview with Fox News Digital, the Cabo Wabo Cantina founder said his biggest tip for couples trying to maintain their marriage is to ""have fun in the bedroom.""

""We still have fun in the bedroom, I tell you that. You know what I mean? I think I always say that, you know, when you guys are sleeping in separate beds and stuff, well, that's usually the end of it,"" Hagar said.

""It's not just that, you got to give and take and all that, but, that's such an undervalued or underestimated thing in a relationship is being physically attracted to each other and enjoying each other physically,"" the former Van Halen frontman continued.

Hagar and Karte tied the knot in 1995 and share two daughters: Kama and Samantha. The singer also has sons, Aaron and Andrew, from his first marriage to Betsy Berardi.

Hagar recently celebrated a big milestone. He was given a key to the Las Vegas Strip. The rock and roll star has some wild memories of his time in Sin City, and he compares the party town to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.

""You know that saying of what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Well, I use that in Cabo as what happens in Cabo never happened. Like, you don't even have to admit it,"" he said. ""Between those two things and being in a rock and roll band like Van Halen and being in rock for my whole life, it's been a lot of crazy stuff.""

""I want to stay married, and again, I don't want to embarrass my kids. They're old enough now. They say, 'Dad did what?' It's just a lot of things happen in that town. I guarantee you, anything you can imagine happens daily, multiple times in that town. Anything you can imagine,"" he concluded.

"Aging slowdown could be surprise benefit of existing medication, research shows",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/health/aging-slowdown-could-surprise-benefit-existing-medication-research-shows,2024-10-07T08:35:32Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A drug used to prevent organ rejection in kidney transplant patients is being touted for potentially slowing down aging.

The immune-suppressing medication rapamycin, also known as sirolimus, is being used off-label as a means of extending longevity.

""By targeting a key pathway (mTOR) in cells, this drug has been shown to extend lifespan in animals and could be beneficial to prevent age-related diseases in humans,"" Dr. Andrea B. Maier -- a professor in healthy aging and dementia research at the Director of the Centre for Healthy Longevity at the National University of Singapore -- told Fox News Digital.

AGING SPEEDS UP 'MASSIVELY' AT TWO POINTS IN ONE'S LIFETIME, STANFORD STUDY FINDS: 'ABRUPT CHANGES'

Maier was co-author of a recent review study that explored how rapamycin affected healthy humans.

The review, which was published in the journal Lancet Healthy Longevity, found that the medication improved the effects of aging on the skin.

""Rapamycin and its derivatives improve the immune and cardiovascular function of healthy individuals or individuals with aging-related diseases,"" Maier said in an email.

11 TIPS FOR ADULTS AGE 65 AND OVER TO 'LIVE WELL' OVER TIME, ACCORDING TO GERONTOLOGISTS

Daniel Tawfik, a molecular biologist and co-founder of Healthspan, a digital medical clinic that focuses on anti-aging and longevity-promoting therapies, said his team uses rapamycin to help slow down the rate of aging.

""We view this through the lens of reducing the accumulation of damaged senescent cells,"" Tawfik, who is based in Santa Monica, California, told Fox News Digital.

Senescent cells are cells that no longer function properly, but linger in the body and can contribute to tissue deterioration and inflammation, the expert said.

""By lowering the rate at which healthy cells transform into senescent cells, rapamycin can slow the aging process at the tissue level, helping to preserve organ function and overall health as we age,"" he added.

In the U.S., rapamycin is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its immune-suppressing properties in patients with kidney transplants and certain cancers.

It is not approved for use as an age-defying drug.

""Sirolimus (rapamycin) has not been evaluated by the FDA for safety and effectiveness as an anti-aging treatment,"" a press officer for the FDA confirmed to Fox News Digital.

""Rapamycin can slow the aging process at the tissue level, helping to preserve organ function and overall health.""

Despite this, rapamycin is being used ""off-label"" for anti-aging purposes, according to Elaena Quattrocchi, a registered pharmacist and an associate professor at Long Island University College of Pharmacy in Brooklyn, New York.

""Off-label means the FDA has not approved the drug for this use,"" she told Fox News Digital.

When prescribing a drug for off-label use, the provider must explain to the patient that the medication has not been approved for the indication for which they are prescribing it, Quattrocchi noted.

""People taking this medication must discuss with their primary care provider and pharmacist about the potential side effects and drug interactions,"" she said.

Tawfik's company currently treats more than 3,500 patients with rapamycin, he told Fox News Digital.

105-YEAR-OLD WOMAN GRADUATES FROM STANFORD UNIVERSITY 83 YEARS AFTER LEAVING CAMPUS: 'AMAZING'

His team has seen numerous benefits of its off-label anti-aging use, he said, including improved cellular health, reduced risk of age-related diseases and the potential for enhanced longevity.

""Under proper medical supervision, many of our patients experience a marked reduction in inflammation and improvement in conditions related to autoimmunity,"" Tawfik said.

""For example, patients with osteoarthritis often report significant relief from joint pain after starting rapamycin.""

The expert also noted that certain biomarkers linked to healthspan and longevity -- such as reduced inflammation markers and enhanced metabolic health -- were seen in the bloodwork of the patients using rapamycin.

Patients need a prescription for rapamycin, experts told Fox News Digital.

Individuals are screened to determine whether they are candidates for the treatment. If it is prescribed, patients are monitored carefully when taking the drug.

""It is essential that rapamycin use is overseen by a physician.""

""It is essential that rapamycin use is overseen by a physician to ensure that dosing is effective yet safe, as high doses can lead to unwanted immunosuppression,"" Tawfik warned.

Maier echoed that rapamycin and its derivatives are not for self-medication use.

""An important step is to first measure the patient's biological age and investigate why the pace of aging might be faster,"" she told Fox News Digital.

""Then a tailored approach to match the measures with interventions at need is required.""

Quattrocchi and Tawfik both emphasized the importance of working with an accredited pharmacy that sources the drug directly from a reputable manufacturer.

Rapamycin is not recommended for immunocompromised individuals or those taking immunosuppressant medication, Tawfik cautioned.

It is not typically used in younger adults, he added, since starting this regimen at such an early age is unnecessary.

There are limited studies on the effects of rapamycin on humans and organ systems, Maier noted.

In researching studies of the drug, Maier's research team found that adverse reactions in healthy individuals were classified ""as mild or moderate and were reversible after the discontinuation of treatment.""

However, the study authors stated, ""there were increased numbers of infections and increases in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in individuals with aging-related diseases.""

""Future studies should assess the remaining unexamined systems and test the effects of long-term exposure to rapamycin and its derivatives.""

The majority of studies exploring rapamycin's effects on aging have been conducted on mice and other animals as well as experimental models, researchers told Fox News Digital.

""The reason scientists are so interested in rapamycin is that in every species that's been studied to date - yeast, worms, flies, mice - when they are given rapamycin, healthspan and lifespan are extended,"" Tawfik noted.

""No other intervention has that degree of validation.""

Quattrocchi agreed that further research is needed into the drug's proper dosing, adverse effects, and potential anti-aging benefits in healthy individuals and those with medical conditions."

Lisa Phillips had big dreams of becoming a top model when she encountered Jeffrey Epstein.

The cover girl, who said she was abused by the late convicted sex offender on his private island, is speaking out candidly in a new podcast, ""From Now On."" It aims to raise awareness of human trafficking and how it can impact anyone.

""It took me many years to get to this point,"" Phillips, now a model scout and agent in Los Angeles, told Fox News Digital. ""I struggled with the confusion of what happened to me years ago.""

EPSTEIN GRAND JURY RECORDS RELEASED, DESCRIBE TRAFFICKER'S NETWORK FOR 'GROOMING' UNDERAGE GIRLS

""But as soon as I started speaking to other survivors, I started realizing that my story from so many years ago was the same as those - both the underage girls from Florida and the older girls that were 18-25,"" she shared.

Phillips began modeling when she was 16 years old. By 19, she was already heading to fashion capitals, like London and Paris, making her mark. At age 21, she found herself in New York City, where she had booked a photo shoot in the British West Indies.

It was there that a fellow model told her about an island nearby - Little Saint James.

""We had an extra day,"" Phillips recalled. ""She said, 'Let's get out of here. Let's do something. I have a friend, a really good friend. He's amazing. He owns an island close by. Let's see him. He said he would send us a boat, and we could hang out over there.'""

The women boarded a boat and headed to the island. When they arrived, there were other women already there swimming in a pool and ""enjoying themselves.""

At first, everything seemed ""fine,"" said Phillips. They had ""a wonderful dinner"" before Epstein approached them and introduced himself.

""He was very charming,"" she recalled. ""He was that type of man who just locked into you and made you feel very special, very safe and so interested in who you were as a person. I never had that attention from a man, not even from my father, expressing that much interest in everything that I was talking about, what I was doing, what my aspirations and goals were.""

""I always remember that he made me feel really special... That's what he did for everybody.""

However, things took a turn ""pretty quickly,"" she claimed.

That same night, a woman casually approached her, saying that Epstein wanted a massage. A confused Phillips said she did not know how to give one. The woman nonchalantly told her to ""just chill."" After assuring her, Phillips followed the woman's lead. She felt safe with her.

Phillips claimed that the massage turned into Epstein sexually assaulting her in the room.

""It wasn't a straight, 'Let me pull you into a room and abuse you,'"" said Phillips. ""He eases into things, like, 'It's just a massage, right?' The girl went along with it and brought me into the room to do this massage with him. It was a slow thing that escalated into abuse. The whole process was very confusing to me.""

""I was on an island,"" she said. ""I wasn't in a house where I could say, 'Excuse me, I need to leave,' and grab my stuff. I was far away from home on an island I should never have been on.""

Phillips later learned that multiple women, like her, alleged that they were assaulted by Epstein under the guise of a massage.

""After that, my life spiraled,"" Phillips admitted. ""I started doing drugs and drinking... I felt like I was tarnished, or something was wrong with me that I didn't stand up for myself... And everybody looked up to Jeffrey at the time.

""During those years, he wasn't a playboy who hung out in the scene. People talked about him highly. When I would bring up his name to people, they would say, 'We love Jeffrey. He did this for me. He got me a visa. He introduced me to my husband. He put me through school.' It was always these big things that he did for people. That was confusing for me.""

Phillips also pointed out that the incident occurred in the early 2000s, long before the #MeToo movement where victims of sexual abuse came forward publicly with their accounts. At that time, she said, ""You would never speak out about somebody like that with that kind of power.""

Phillips said she ""suppressed"" the shame and confusion she felt as Epstein portrayed himself as a mentor wanting to help.

""Nobody talked about the creepy massages and what was happening,"" she said. ""It was all hush-hush... He was influential, and he was manipulative. He groomed you to believe that he was your mentor.""

In 2006, Epstein was arrested over allegations that he had hired teenage girls to give him sexualized massages at his Florida home.

Two years later, prosecutors allowed Epstein to plead guilty to a charge involving a single victim. He served 13 months in a jail work-release program then quietly started rebuilding his network of influential friends, with the help of his socialite former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell.

After a series of Miami Herald stories about the plea bargain that deprived Epstein's victims of justice, federal prosecutors in New York revived the investigation and charged Epstein in 2019 with sex trafficking.

Epstein reportedly created and maintained a ""vast network"" and operation from 2002 ""up to and including"" at least 2005 that enabled him to ""sexually exploit and abuse dozens of underage girls"" in addition to paying victims to recruit other girls.

Prosecutors said that victims would be escorted to a room with a massage table where they would perform massages on Epstein.

At the time of Epstein's arrest, prosecutors said they found a trove of pictures of nude and seminude young women and girls at his $77 million Manhattan mansion. They also say additional victims have come forward since the arrest. He pleaded not guilty.

On Aug. 10 of that year, Epstein was found dead behind bars. He was 66. The cause of death was suicide.

When Epstein killed himself in jail, prosecutors charged Maxwell with facilitating his illicit sexual encounters and participating in some of the abuse. The 62-year-old was convicted and is serving a 20-year prison term.

Phillips said that while she hated her abuser, she cried after learning of his death.

""I didn't know why,"" she explained. ""He was a bad guy, but I had good thoughts about him too... I just had this emotional breakdown of confusion. But if he was still alive, I probably would've had way too much fear to speak out. I probably would have never spoken out. But... I was willing to finally talk about what happened to me. I needed answers.""

Phillips went on to testify in a 2022 civil case involving another Epstein accuser, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, USA Today reported. She also filed as a Jane Doe under the Adult Survivors Act, citing abuse by an Epstein associate. According to the outlet, she received a settlement in a case involving JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Epstein accusers.

""The pain is in the numbers,"" she explained. ""You can go through some type of abuse and deal with it on your own... but when you start hearing about other women who had the same experiences with Jeffrey and others, it does something to your psyche,"" she said.

""... And when I started speaking to the other survivors, that's where I felt validation... That's when I felt safe to talk about my experience without people shaming me. I wasn't alone.""

Today, Phillips hopes her podcast will provide a platform for other victims who are healing, like her.

""I want people to know that there's a place where you can come and be heard,"" she said. ""I also want to educate people on how to advocate for themselves, and look out for red flags while you're building your career. Because this can happen in any kind of business.""

"American father of Hamas hostage Itay Chen pushes US, Israel on 'Plan B' as negotiations falter",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/american-father-hamas-hostage-itay-chen-pushes-us-israel-plan-b-negotiations-falter,2024-10-07T08:16:30Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

""When was the last time you talked to your kid? Do you know where he slept last night? Do you know what he ate? Do you know if he had a blanket on him?"" Ruby Chen, father of Itay Chen who was taken by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, asked in a sit-down interview with Fox News Digital.

""All those types of questions are questions that we ask ourselves constantly,"" he said. ""The feeling is that we've been failed.""

Itay,19 years old when he was taken, has remained a hostage held in Gaza for 365 days after his unit in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was attacked in southern Israel when Hamas terrorists flooded the border in a series of mass assaults.

Chen, a New York City native, said he and his wife have been given ""unprecedented"" access to the White House, the CIA and other top agencies throughout the last year to discuss ongoing strategies to try and get the hostages out of Gaza.

ISRAEL SAYS TOP HAMAS RAFAH BRIGADE 'DISMANTLED' ON PHILADELPHI CORRIDOR, 2,000 TERRORISTS KILLED

The Chens have not only met with national security adviser Jake Sullivan a dozen times, as well as CIA Director William Burns and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, they also hold a weekly call with the White House.

But ultimately, these supportive efforts have fallen flat when it comes to the real needs of American families whose loved ones are still held hostage by Hamas.

""We have been failed by the Israeli government, we, as U.S. citizens, feel we've been failed by the Biden administration despite all of the access that they've provided us,"" he explained. ""They share as much as they can. But at the end of the day, it's... very black and white.

""Where is he?""

Chen explained that following the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, the Israeli government pushed a strategy to secure the release of the then 251 hostages by bombarding suspected Hamas positions in Gaza.

In the initial weeks following the deadly Hamas attacks, Israel began pounding northern Gaza - a move Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believed would bring Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar ""to his knees"" and make him be ""willing to release hostages.""

A week-long cease-fire in November saw the release of 105 hostages. Twelve other hostages have been freed following negotiations during the immediate aftermath of the attack, or because of IDF rescue operations between February and August.

YAZIDI WOMAN HELD HOSTAGE FOR 10 YEARS IN GAZA RESCUED IN ISRAEL, US OPERATION

None of the eight American hostages that were kidnapped have been released, and only seven continue to be held by Hamas after the body of Hersh Goldberg-Polin was discovered by IDF forces in late August, after he along with five others were killed by the terrorist group.

More than 100 hostages remain in captivity in the Gaza Strip - 97 of whom were abducted on Oct. 7, 2023.

The Chens, other American families and the international community have repeatedly urged Israel and Hamas to reach a cease-fire agreement and return all hostages to their families.

But disagreements over security corridors in Gaza have created a seemingly insurmountable hurdle as U.S., Egyptian and Qatari officials work to get Israel and Hamas to reach an agreement.

The father of the IDF soldier pointed out that so long as no one is discussing a ""day after"" plan for the Gaza Strip and the Palestinians there, Hamas will continue to hold tightly to its most powerful bargaining chip, the hostages.

""Where is Hamas in the day-after? And if no one is willing to talk about it, then Hamas believes that they are better off holding on to the hostages until something changes,"" he explained. ""It's a jihad organization. They wish to have chaos. They are looking for a regional conflict.

""When they see that there's now a conflict with Lebanon, that does not motivate them to get into a cease-fire agreement. On the contrary, they wish to belong, and have other players join in this jihad against Israel,"" Chen continued. ""So I question, what is the plan?""

""I am very critical of the time,"" Itay's father said. ""The last 10 months, I've been asking Mr. Sullivan, What's plan B?

""I haven't heard of a Plan B. And that's unacceptable,"" he added.

BLINKEN TRAVELS TO EGYPT FOR CEASE-FIRE TALKS AS ISRAEL ADDS NEW WAR GOAL

Securing peace in the region became even more precarious last week after Israel, against the objections of the U.S. and its international allies, launched an incursion into southern Lebanon with the expressed intent of dismantling the threat posed by Hezbollah.

Chen pointed out that this second front not only added another dimension to securing the release of the hostages, but it also seemingly pushed talks with Hamas on the backburner as concerns remain high over a broader regional conflict.

""If you could follow the news, you could see that the hostage issue has been less prioritized,"" he said. ""And that's a very difficult feeling for us and the families.""

Netanyahu has said his top priority is securing the release of the hostages, but his refusal to withdraw from the Philidelphi Corridor due to security reasons has created a negotiation impasse and questions have begun to mount over whether the prime minister is truly prioritizing the hostages over his push to ""eliminate Hamas.""

But the parents of Itay - who has been described as a ""fun-loving kid,"" the ""sandwich"" of the family with an older sibling and younger sibling, everybody's ""best friend,"" and a former Boy Scout turned a young man with a loving girlfriend - cannot allow for him, or the others still in Gaza, to be at the mercy of any political agenda.

""I'm a guy that comes from New York City - and we talk less, we look at actions. The actions of the last year show the opposite."" Chen said. ""He can say whatever he wants. I don't believe a thing that comes out of his mouth, I believe in what he does.""

The father of three also urged the Biden administration to question whether it is still in the U.S.'s strategic interest to unequivocally back Netanyahu.

""There is no accountability from either side for failed negotiation. You do not see any equation that says, 'OK, if you do not do A, then there's a consequence' on either side,"" Chen said in reference to both Israel and Hamas. ""There's no consequence associated with a negative action to a strategic interest of the United States.""

Chen also argued that ""effective pressure"" needs to be put on Hamas by reevaluating what other ""pressure points"" can be utilized.

The father pointed to the clear need for tougher economic and diplomatic involvement when it comes to international aid sent to Gaza - including tougher sanctions not only on adversarial nations but on partner countries that allow aid to flow into Gaza.

This includes stricter oversight of United Nations-provided humanitarian aid, which though intended for the Palestinian people, is falling into the hands of Hamas, a group that is not designated as a terrorist organization by the UN.

Hamas has long been accused of seizing basic goods in Gaza and then reselling them in a black-market scheme at exuberant prices.

Reports have further indicated that Hamas for years has had substantial access to monetary aid siphoned from funds provided by top organizations like the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which has been directly used for combatant operations against Israel, including tunnel building and access to arms.

But aside from the substantial need to address aid-based concerns, Chen also argued that diplomatic solutions are not being fully recognized by the U.S.

Nations like Russia and Thailand secured the release of their citizens taken by Hamas, and Chen argued Washington - which was able to negotiate with its biggest adversary just months ago to free U.S. citizens from Russian prisons - should be working to do the same to secure the release of those held in Gaza.

""So, it's possible,"" Chen said. ""Complicated, yep. Doable, yep.""

""The assumption that was put in front of us at the beginning was that U.S. hostages will come out via a larger deal that Israel will be a part of. And if that assumption is not working out after a year, then yes, we need to challenge the administration and look at that assumption."
Swiss probe into woman's voluntary death causing advocacy groups behind 'suicide capsule' to suspend its use,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/swiss-probe-womans-voluntary-death-causing-advocacy-groups-behind-suicide-capsule-suspend-its-use,2024-10-07T07:49:27Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Advocacy groups behind a ""suicide capsule"" announced Sunday they have suspended applications to use the device until authorities in Switzerland complete a criminal investigation into a woman's voluntary death from its first use.

The president of Switzerland-based The Last Resort, Florian Willet, is being held in pretrial detention, according to the group and Exit International, an affiliate founded in Australia. Both organizations advocate for the right to assisted suicide.

Swiss police arrested Willet and several other people following the death of a 64-year-old American woman who last month became the first person to use the device to voluntarily end her life, according to The Associated Press. The device, known as the ""Sarco,"" was used in a forest in the northern Schaffhausen region of Switzerland near the German border on Sept. 23.

Other people who were initially detained in connection with the woman's death were released from custody, according to authorities.

The woman was reportedly suffering from severe immune compromise.

Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland, with laws allowing so-called death with dignity as long as the person ends their life with no ""external assistance"" and people who assist the person do not do so for any ""self-serving motive.""

The advocacy groups said in a statement Sunday that 371 people were in the process of applying to use the Sarco in Switzerland as of Sept. 23, but that applications were suspended after its first use.

Exit International, whose founder Philip Nitschke is based in the Netherlands, is behind the device, which was 3D-printed and cost more than $1 million to develop.

The capsule was designed to allow a person to sit in a reclining seat inside the device and push a button that injects nitrogen gas from a tank underneath into the sealed chamber. The person would then fall asleep and die by suffocation in a few minutes.

Exit International has said Willet was the only person present for the woman's death, which the group described as ""peaceful, fast and dignified.""

On the day of the woman's death, Swiss Health Minister Elisabeth Baume-Schneider told parliament that use of the device would not be legal.

But Exit International pushed back on Baume-Schneider's statement, arguing that the group's lawyers in Switzerland believe use of the device is legal.

""Only after the Sarco was used was it learned that Ms. Baume-Schneider had addressed the issue,"" the advocacy groups said in the statement Sunday. ""The timing was a pure coincidence and not our intention."""
Sean 'Diddy' Combs' mother defends disgraced music mogul as he sits in jail on sex crime charges,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-mother-defends-disgraced-music-mogul-he-sits-jail-sex-crime-charges,2024-10-07T02:48:35Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Janice Combs, Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' mother, broke her silence Sunday and admitted she was left ""devastated and profoundly saddened"" by the allegations waged against her son, she said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.

Diddy was arrested Sept. 16 and charged the next day with racketeering conspiracy; sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution. He entered a not guilty plea hours after an indictment detailing his alleged sex crimes was unsealed. If found guilty, he faces a minimum of 15 years behind bars or a maximum sentence of life in prison.

""It is heartbreaking to see my son judged not for the truth, but for a narrative created out of lies,"" Janice Combs wrote. ""To bear witness what seems to be like a public lynching of my son before he has had the opportunity to prove his innocence is a pain too unbearable to put into words. Like every human being, my son deserves to have his day in court, to finally share his side, and to prove his innocence.""

She pleaded, ""My son is not the monster they have painted him to be, and he deserves the chance to tell his side. I can only pray that I am alive to see him speak his truth and be vindicated.""

""I am not here to portray my son as perfect because he is not,"" Janice Combs said. ""He has made mistakes in his past, as we all have. My son may not have been entirely truthful about certain things, such as denying he has ever gotten violent with an ex-girlfriend when the hotel's surveillance showed otherwise.""

She added, ""Sometimes, the truth and a lie become so closely intertwined that it becomes terrifying to admit one part of the story, especially when that truth is outside the norm or is too complicated to be believed. This is why I believe my son's civil legal team opted to settle the ex-girlfriend's lawsuit instead of contesting it until the end, resulting in a ricochet effect as the federal government used this decision against my son by interpreting it as an admission of guilt.""

""I am not here to portray my son as perfect because he is not. He has made mistakes in his past, as we all have.""

-- Janice Combs

Surveillance video taken from a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 allegedly showed the billionaire publicly assaulting his then girlfriend Cassie Ventura. In the footage, Sean Combs ""kicked, dragged, and threw a vase at a woman as she was attempting to leave,"" the indictment said. ""When a member of the hotel security staff intervened, Combs attempted to bribe the staff member to ensure silence.""

""It is important to recognize that none of us, regardless of our status, are immune to fear or mistakes,"" Janice Combs said. ""Not being entirely straightforward about one issue does not mean my son is guilty of the repulsive allegations and the grave charges leveled against him. Many individuals who were wrongfully convicted and later exonerated had their freedom taken from them not because they were guilty of the crimes they were accused of, but because they didn't fit the image of what this society considers to be a 'good person.' History has showed us how individuals can be wrongfully convicted due to their past actions or mistakes.""

TMZ PRESENTS: THE DOWNFALL OF DIDDY

She continued, ""Watching the world make jokes and laugh at my son's life crumbling before our eyes is something I can never forget. It is truly agonizing to watch the world turn against my son so quickly and easily over lies and misconceptions, without ever hearing his side or affording him the opportunity to present his side.""

Janice Combs believed people were seeking ""financial gain"" through telling lies about her son, and not pursuing justice. ""These individuals saw how quickly my son's civil legal team settled his ex-girlfriend's lawsuit, so they believe they can receive a quick payday by falsely accusing my son,"" she said. ""False allegations of sexual assault thwart true victims of sexual violence from getting the justice they deserve.""

Janice Combs accused the federal government of engaging in similar tactics ""to prosecute my son,"" and said the injustice has been ""unbearable"" on their family.

""The worst part of this ordeal is watching my beloved son be stripped of his dignity, not for what he did, but for what people choose to believe about him,"" she said before asking his supporters to not ""judge him before you've had the chance to hear his side.""

""I beg you to think about those who have been wrongfully persecuted, to remember that not everyone who has made mistakes in life deserves to have their entire existence judged by a single action or a few mistakes,"" she wrote.

Authorities alleged Diddy ran a criminal enterprise through his businesses, including Bad Boy Entertainment, Combs Enterprises and Combs Global, among others. He used ""firearms, threats of violence, coercion and verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse"" to fulfill his sexual desires, according to the unsealed indictment obtained by Fox News Digital.

Diddy and his employees would ""intimidate, threaten, and lure female victims into Combs' orbit, often under the pretense of a romantic relationship. Combs allegedly then used force, threats of force and coercion to cause victims to engage in extended sex acts with male commercial sex workers that Combs referred to as, among other things, 'freak offs.'""

Witherspoon, 48, joined forces with Laura Dern and Octavia Spencer during a panel discussion for her production company Hello Sunshine's annual Shine Away event, where she recalled having to ""make decisions"" both in business and at home.

When asked if there was a specific instance in life where she ""found"" her voice, Witherspoon admitted ""so many moments"" came to mind, and that she found inspiration from her Hello Sunshine banner.

One reason she loves the organization is that ""we look for stories that women saved themselves,"" Witherspoon said before adding, ""because every woman in this room has saved herself,"" whether from a ""financial situation, an education situation, a bad relationship, you had to save yourself,"" per People magazine.

"'FROM' Season 3, Episode 3 Recap And Review: A Murder Of Crows",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2024/10/06/from-season-3-episode-3-recap-and-review-a-murder-of-crows/,2024-10-06T19:18:22Z,"The latest episode of FROM is yet another banger in Season 3's gripping early run. It's honestly a bit tortuous to have to wait an entire week between episodes, though I'm still glad Amazon and MGM are releasing it this way. Good shows ought to have a chance to marinate, to get that glorious watercooler talk week after week. I'm old-fashioned like that, and FROM is the perfect show for discussion of fan theories, unpuzzling mysteries and occasionally griping about ridiculous character choices.

Let's go over what's happening with each of our primary characters / groups this episode beginning with . . . .

Jade, Kenny, Kristi, Dale and a couple other Fromvillians from the big house all head out to the little abandoned homestead with the creepy mannequins to gather more food from the lake, though snow has fallen and things are considerably less hospitable than they were before. It's a wonder any vegetables are harvestable at this point, though they also find berries.

Jade is in a bad mood, and after some squabbling stomps off on his own to relieve himself, when he comes across some strange red boulders. It's here that he sees his first vision: A man on a tree, his face mangled. When others show up, the man disappears, but Jade is at his wit's end and despite warnings that he'll never make it back to town before dark, he sets off on his own. Kristi follows, trying to stop him, and steps into a bear trap.

As darkness looms, the rest of the group scrambles to get her free. Jade and the always unpleasant Dale rush back to the mannequins, which were built with a combination of wood and metal bars. They grab the latter and are able to free Kristi, though her ankle has seen better days. As they work to reset her foot, Jade's vision reappears, gruesomely, only vanishing again when Kristi tells him to focus. They rush her back to the homestead to take shelter for the night. Meanwhile . . .

Perhaps the most dread-inducing storyline of Season 3 revolves around Fatima and her ill-fated pregnancy. We've already learned that she can't keep normal food down and has resorted to eating -- ravenously -- the rotten crops that have now been piled up outside the big house.

She does this in an almost feral manner, and while she doesn't want to be seen it's as if her hunger outweighs her need for secrecy. Tillie -- who I still find unsettling -- spots her and tries to talk to her about the oddities of pregnancy. She also offers a Tarot card reading, which Fatima at first rebukes.

When Tillie reassures her that it's not a game, but something that's helped her in life, she relents and the two sit down. But just as they're about to begin the reading a crow flies into the window. They're startled but continue to start the reading, when suddenly another crow smashes through the window and begins to fly around the house, bloodied and cawing. It's honestly terrifying -- as though the evil presence that rules the town was genuinely afraid of what they might discover in the cards. Will they return to this or have they been too unsettled to continue? What will the cards tell old Tillie about Fatima's baby? And is it even a baby inside her? I think it's clear that something is very, very wrong.

But things aren't going so well back in the real world, either.

In Maine, Tabitha has convinced Henry she's telling the truth. She's studied all the paintings, and still hasn't found anything helpful. Henry tells her about the bottle tree, and shockingly enough his wife had hung bottles from the tree in their yard, just like the Faraway tree she entered to get to the Lighthouse.

But this isn't the original tree, he tells her. Victor's mother did another one first, back in town. So they hop in the car and head to the park. This is really interesting because in Fromville there are also two bottle trees. There's the one Victor took Tabitha to, but there's another that Boyd found earlier in the series. I wonder, are they the same distance apart that these two trees in the real world are? This must be significant, but we're never shown the second tree. Tabitha and Henry never make it.

On their way to the tree, Tabitha finds a bracelet just like the one she gave Jim and suddenly she realizes -- or at least she believes -- that all of this is in fact a lie. She's not in the real world at all. She tells Henry to pull over, she needs to get out of the car, she's panicking. But Henry isn't willing to just give up after everything she's told him and he pulls the car out into the street without looking. A car crashes into theirs and the next thing Tabitha knows, she's in an ambulance. Henry is unconscious next to her.

And this is when things go from bad to worse. The ambulance has two medics and a police officer, and none of them will let her go. They've been looking for the mysterious woman who just walked out of the hospital the day before, and they're understandably worried that she isn't well. And then they come to a tree in the road. Tabitha looks on with horror.

Elsewhere, we have Boyd trying to come up with a plan. He wants to catch one of the monsters, and he goes to Randall's bus and offers to switch places for the night. Not everyone is onboard with this plan, but Boyd is tired of just waiting around. The creatures have changed. Things are getting worse, but there's nothing worse than just sitting around waiting for the next horror.

I'm genuinely enjoying this season a lot more than Season 2. It really feels like we're getting some forward momentum, and while we haven't gotten any big answers yet, you can almost taste them on the wind. Tabitha's journey to the real world is a big deal, and her return to Fromville -- along with Victor's dad -- will make waves among its residents.

I've also noted that we seem to be getting fewer F-bombs, and characters are communicating a little bit better than in seasons past. We'll see if that continues, but so far I'm just really hyped for this season and can't wait for each new episode. It's awfully grim, but it's really gaining steam and everything feels a bit less stuck in place narratively -- though our heroes remain as stuck as ever in this dreadful nightmare."
Melania Trump says former President Trump was aware of her abortion stance 'since the day we met',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/melania-trump-former-president-trump-aware-abortion-stance-since-day-met,2024-10-06T17:19:22Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Former first lady Melania Trump spoke with former President Trump before writing about her support for abortion in her self-titled memoir, she told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on Sunday.

""He knew my position since the day we met, and I believe in individual freedom. I want to decide what I want to do with my body. I don't want government in my personal business,"" she said in an exclusive ""Sunday Morning Futures"" interview.

""I think it's very important and, as I said in the book, and it's very well explained in the chapter, 'What does my body, my choice mean?' because timing really matters and also the restrictions, so I encourage people to read it because we live in a world that everybody should have individual freedom,"" she continued.

Trump is promoting her upcoming ""Melania"" memoir, which disclosed a shocking truth to many of her husband's supporters regarding her stance on the controversial issue, calling abortion a ""fundamental right of individual liberty,"" according to a report from last Wednesday.

MELANIA TRUMP'S ABORTION VIEWS IN NEW MEMOIR SPUR OUTRAGE FROM PRO-LIFERS: 'SHE IS WRONG'

She reportedly wrote, ""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government.""

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes. Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

MELANIA TRUMP'S PRO-CHOICE STAND ISN'T THAT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER REPUBLICAN FIRST LADIES

The revelation ignited a flurry of responses across the political spectrum, with pro-lifers slamming her for the view they argue fails to align with the Catholic faith, to which she subscribes.

Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America advocacy group, called the view ""anti-feminist"" and the ""opposite of empowerment.""

Others, including Lila Rose and president of pro-life advocacy group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Marjorie Dannenfelser, criticized the stance as well.

On the left, ""The View"" co-host Joy Behar accused Trump of lying about being pro-choice, calling her stance a ""big scam.""

Others have posed the question: why make the revelation just before the election?

""That was not written in the last week or the last month,"" Trump told Bartiromo.

""That book was written months before, and it was in print months before, so that was my belief, and it is my belief, and I wanted to put it in the book because I want to be authentic. I want people to read the book because they could find out a lot of things that were never discussed. I'm very selective in what I do, and when I'm doing interviews or not or where I am or not, and this is my story. This is my perspective and the truth, and there is a lot of misinformation about me and falsehoods written about me, so that book, 'Melania,' will bring out my truth.""

DAVID MARCUS: Pennsylvania's Gen Zers embrace Trump like Millennials never have,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-pennsylvanias-gen-zers-embrace-trump-like-millennials-never-have,2024-10-06T17:16:46Z,"Gen Z voters Jahmiel Jackson and Ranger Irwin discuss the deep divide between young male and female voters on 'The Story.'

Over the last two months, I have spent more time in Pennsylvania than any other state for the obvious reason that the outcome there will very likely determine whether our next president will be Donald Trump or Kamala Harris.

One increasingly clear phenomenon I have slowly seen, and it's backed up by some polling, is that Gen Z voters who are between the ages of 18 and 27 are far more open to supporting Trump than their Millennial elders, who are mainly in their 30s.

GROWING NUMBER OF GEN Z MEN SUPPORTING TRUMP REPRESENTS 'ONGOING CULTURE SHOCK' IN US POLITICS, VOTER SAYS

A recent poll from Harvard has Harris leading Trump 61 percent to 30 percent among Millennials, but an NBC News poll shows that with voters 18-29, that lead shrinks to 16 points at 50 to 34.

It tracks with what I have been seeing on the ground.

At a Trump rally in Harrisburg back in August, I met young, blue-collar Gen Zers who believed Trump would provide more opportunity, a JD Vance event in Hershey was overflowing with twenty somethings, and Saturday in Butler, I met dozens of first-time voters planning to pull the red lever.

It came into clear focus later on Saturday night at Jack Jolly's Holiday Bar in downtown Butler, a town which, unlike many of the hollowed out Ohio cities I've seen that are more rust than belt, is actually quite charming and seems to be thriving.

Jack Jolly's is one of those cocktail lounges where they infuse everything or put smoke in the glass, and the first people I met there were a trio in their late 30s; one married couple and their guy friend.

All were childhood buds from Butler who had moved away after college and recently returned to purchase homes in this lovely hillside hamlet. They were no fans of Trump, and they also weren't overly interested in politics.

GEN Z VOTER FLIPS FROM SANDERS TO TRUMP: HARD TO VOTE FOR THE PARTY PUTTING 'TAMPONS IN BOYS' BATHROOMS'

At one point, I asked them if the emerging well-to-do segment of the population and the longer-standing middle and lower classes mingled well. They looked at me quizzically and I said, ""I mean, your kids must go to school together, right?""

""Oh, we don't have kids,"" the single guy told me, though the woman is a teacher.

And they are a type of voter I have seen elsewhere, in San Francisco and Chicago -- good jobs, few responsibilities, and not terribly ill at ease with the state of their lives, the country, or the world.

About the time they took off, another trio took their place, this time, three dudes, younger, mid to late twenties. Two were Trump fans, and the other, a history teacher, supports Harris, but also said, ""I don't think Trump is a threat to democracy.""

What followed was a robust conversation about politics, America, and life. They were well-informed, avid social media users, and importantly, they all seemed to have a grasp on the best arguments of the other side.

Whatever is driving these young voters into the arms of the GOP, it will have profound implications not just on this election, but going forward for decades.

Earlier in the day, I had spoken to Johnny and Rocky at the Trump rally, who were also either Gen Z or close. They are buddies, but I was surprised when Johnny said, ""Rocky and I watched the VP debate together.""

When I was 27, we did a lot of things, but get together to watch a vice presidential debate was not among them. Then again, in the 1990s, we thought a bright future was inevitable. Unlike Gen X, Gen Z is very well aware that it isn't.

Part of the reason that I was slow to pick up on the reddening of Gen Z, especially, but not only, Gen Z men, is that I couldn't really explain it, and I still struggle to.

Are they less connected to and susceptible to the neoliberal pablum of the leftist media and entertainment industry? Is it because they grew up, in part, under a Trump presidency and so do not find it abhorrent or abnormal? Is it counter-cultural?

Whatever is driving these young voters into the arms of the GOP, it will have profound implications not just on this election, but going forward for decades. Ten years from now, they will start accumulating the power that Millennials have today.

And unlike Millennials, who seem quietly resigned to a country and society that isn't going to get any better, there seems to be flickering hope among our youngest voters, as if they dare to dream.

And we should all have such hope, because maybe, just maybe, the kids are alright."
Jennifer Aniston responds to tabloid romantically linking her and Barack Obama,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jennifer-aniston-responds-tabloid-romantically-linking-barack-obama,2024-10-06T17:11:16Z,"The ""Friends"" actress is one of several stars featured in Sarah Ditum's book, ""Toxic: Women, Fame, and the Tabloid 2000s.""

Jennifer Aniston's love life has been scrutinized and analyzed by the mass media for decades, but things recently took a weird turn when a tabloid published an article implying she and a former married president were romantically involved.

A guest on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!,"" late last week, Aniston explained how a picture of her working on set had recently been taken out of context to make headlines. Kimmel then pulled out a previous issue of In Touch Weekly, with the ominous headline: ""The Truth About Jen & Barack [Obama]!""

The caption below read: ""Michelle betrayed as Aniston steals her husband's attention.""

Kimmel was interested in if Aniston ever worried about stories like that.

Flabbergasted, Aniston responded. ""That's kind of - that was - of all the calls you get from your publicist where you're just like, 'Oh no, what's it gonna be?' or the email saying, you know, 'Some cheesy tabloid is gonna make up a story.' And then it's that. I was not mad at it.""

Aniston turned to the audience to reiterate that there was nothing romantic about her relationship with the former president, adding they'd only met once.

""I know Michelle more than him,"" she teased.

Kimmel took Aniston's honesty as an opportunity to ask her about more rumors written about her.

Aniston confirmed rumors that she'd had a salmon sperm facial, a fan had asked her for a photograph while she was nude in the sauna and that she travels abroad with a jar of olives. She was quick to dispel a rumor that said she'd had a $4,000 anti-aging water filter installed for her dogs. She also denied having a black belt in jiu-jitsu.

Aniston was horrified that Kimmel, her personal friend, asked that question.

KIMMEL: ""That one's a little bit true, right?""

ANISTON: ""It's a little true. Oh, I'm gonna sound like I really need a therapist after this.""

The actress tried to justify the response, saying she'd attended the woman's service, trailing off and calling it a long story.

Aniston also confirmed that as a child, she had artwork hanging at The Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) and that her family made her belly dance on Christmas Eve.

""Anytime, not just Christmas Eve!"" the ""Friends"" star quipped. ""You know the Greeks love any kind of a family dinner.... It's like when you say to your child, 'Play piano for everyone' or 'Let's sing for everyone.' I get such anxiety when my friends do that to their children... I have inner trauma from having to perform and belly dance in front of my great aunts and uncles and grandmothers."" she joked.

Tim Walz discusses Israel's right to defend itself and Kamala Harris' economic policies on 'Fox News Sunday.'

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz sought to distance Vice President Kamala Harris from laws he himself signed that granted benefits to illegal immigrants in Minnesota on Sunday.

Walz made the comments during a wide-ranging interview on Fox News Sunday with host Shannon Bream. Bream pressed Walz on his military history and his record on abortion in addition to questioning him on legislation he signed in Minnesota that allows illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses and receive state-funded tuition assistance, among other benefits.

""Are those not magnets to draw people here, many times on dangerous journeys for themselves? And why should your taxpayers in Minnesota or across the states pay for those programs?"" Bream asked.

""Well, that's not the vice president's position,"" Walz admitted, before going on to defend his leadership in Minnesota.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN PUSHES BACK ON 'SNL' SKIT ABOUT ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS: 'DISGUSTING'

""But I will say this, Minnesota ranks as a top five business state. We rank as a top three state for children living, and we're a top state for health care access,"" he said. ""Look, the Vice President has made it clear that she has policies that make a difference. Her border policies are the most strongest, the fairest we've seen.""

Bream also challenged Walz to clarify his ticket's position on abortion access. The exchange ultimately led to Walz flatly accusing former President Trump of lying when he said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law.

Bream began by pointing out that Minnesota's abortion law imposes no limits on abortion procedures through all nine months of pregnancy, something that goes far beyond the provisions of Roe v. Wade, which Harris and Walz said they support.

""You signed the bill that makes it legal through all nine months. Is that a position you think Democrats should advocate for nationally?"" Bream asked.

""The vice president and I have been clear the restoration of Roe versus Wade is what we're asking for,"" Walz responded.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN PLEDGES MORE MEDIA INTERVIEWS AS VOTERS STILL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HER POLICIES

""But that law goes far beyond Roe v. Wade,"" Bream pressed. ""Let's agree, in what you signed there's not a single limit through nine months of pregnancy. Roe had a trimester framework that did have limits through the pregnancy. The Minnesota law does not have that.""

""This doesn't change anything. It puts the decision back on to the woman, to the physicians,"" Walz responded. ""And we know that this is simply something to be brought up - to be very clear Donald Trump's asking for a nationwide abortion ban.""

""[Trump] has said repeatedly that he will not sign a national abortion ban. Are you calling that a flat out lie?"" Bream asked.

""Yes, of course, and Senator Vance has in the past said so too,"" Walz said.

Bream concluded the interview by giving Walz a chance to respond to criticism of his frequent ""misstatements,"" such as his claims about military service and his assertion that he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square massacre.

""Look, I speak passionately. I had an entire career, decades before I was in public office. They know, and I'm very proud of my 24 years in service and my record. I have never disparaged someone else in this, but I know that's not what Donald Trump does. They disparage everyone,"" Walz said.

"Dana White Slams Rival After UFC 307: 'They're Drowning, They Suck'",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2024/10/06/dana-white-slams-rival-after-ufc-307-theyre-drowning-they-suck/,2024-10-06T14:32:01Z,"During the post-event press conference following UFC 307, Dana White was asked about the Professional Fighters League using Kayla Harrison's fight on Saturday night at UFC 307 as an opportunity to hype Larissa Pacheco, the woman who handed the two-time Olympian her only professional loss as a mixed martial artist.

Harrison had defeated Pacheco twice before her loss in 2022, but the organization had hoped the former would re-sign for another fight with the latter and potentially Cris Cyborg. White didn't hold back his harsh opinions on the world's second-biggest mixed martial arts organization.

The UFC President said bluntly, ""They're drowning. They suck. They're not good at what they do.""

Here is a look at the clip.

White and PFL President Donn Davis have been engaging in a war of words over the past year that has gotten increasingly more consistent. White uses the promotion's name more than he used to, which could signify that the PFL is becoming a more formidable player in the mixed martial arts landscape.

I do not believe the PFL is a legitimate threat to the UFC yet. Still, the promotion's ability to sign solid young fighters like Paul Hughes, Dakota Ditcheva, and other top prospects speaks to their legitimacy.

Quite honestly, it all began with the PFL being able to pry Francis Ngannou away from the UFC. That move was monumental in combat sports, and we're still learning about its full impact.

As it is, UFC 307 was a significant financial success, according to the records that were shared following the event. The PPV drew more than 18,000 fans at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the gate exceeded $5 million.

Harrison won her fight and should be the next challenger in the women's bantamweight championship. The win over Ketlen Vieira pushed Harrison to No. 2 in the UFC's women's bantamweight rankings.

That title changed hands on the card as Julianna Pena dethroned Raquel Pennington in a hard-fought co-main event fight.

We'll see if the PFL has something cooked up for the next time Harrison fights. Here is a look at all of the results from the UFC 307 card."
"On Oct. 7 anniversary, we remember this betrayal of silence",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/oct-7-anniversary-we-remember-betrayal-silence,2024-10-06T13:05:59Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Reflections on the anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre in Israel must not only consider the tragedy itself but the silence that followed.

That day, Hamas militants unleashed unspeakable violence, deliberately targeting civilians. Among the victims were hundreds of women and girls who were subjected to sexual violence - an intentional strategy designed to terrorize and degrade.

Yet, despite the horrific nature of these acts, international bodies, including the United Nations, took weeks - if not months - to even acknowledge what had transpired. Leaders who claim to stand for women not only failed women with their words; it was a failure to act.

Silence is not neutral.

AS OCTOBER 7TH ANNIVERSARY APPROACHES, JEWISH STUDENTS BRACE FOR PROTESTS, VOW TO 'WALK PROUDLY'

The use of sexual violence as a weapon in conflict is not a recent phenomenon. It is an age-old, barbaric tool of war, used to humiliate, destabilize and traumatize communities. However, the global community's muted response to the sexual atrocities of Oct. 7 reveals a troubling double standard.

Israeli women did not receive the swift and vocal condemnation for gender-based violence that is often extended in other conflicts. While many leaders and organizations, such as UN Women, eventually condemned the violence, it took them over 50 days to issue a statement denouncing these acts. This delay occurred despite a significant body of credible and corroborated evidence available at the time.

Even without an official report, every woman who saw that video of a young woman, her sweatpants stained with blood, instinctively knew the devastating reality behind those marks. That unspoken understanding crosses every boundary -- cultural, political or religious. It's a truth embedded in the experience of being a woman, a shared recognition of the raw vulnerability to violence that so many of us have felt, feared or survived.

ISRAEL BANS UN SECRETARY-GENERAL OVER ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIONS: 'DOESN'T DESERVE TO SET FOOT ON ISRAELI SOIL'

Yet, the willful delay of condemnation, combined with the relative silence from many women's rights organizations, reflects a larger issue where political affiliations seem to overshadow the fundamental responsibility to stand against rape as a weapon of war.

Silence in the face of gender-based violence is complicity. When leaders delay or fail to acknowledge such atrocities, they send a message that the suffering of women, especially in complex geopolitical conflicts, can be overlooked. It is precisely this neglect that fuels cycles of violence, making it clear that women and girls are collateral damage, their dignity expendable.

It also reflects a profound unwillingness to confront uncomfortable truths about the nature of this violence and who it is perpetrated against.

There remains a persistent reluctance in the West to confront and criticize cultures that subjugate women through practices like stoning for adultery or forcing women to cover their faces. Political correctness has led to a loss of moral clarity, and an inability to confront harmful practices and values that undermine human rights.

END US FUNDING FOR UN AGENCY GIVING IMMUNITY TO ITS MURDEROUS HAMAS MEMBERS

This reluctance to offend has led to dangerous acceptance and moral relativism. Practices such as honor killings or female genital mutilation are undeniably violations of basic human rights. Yet, the guise of inclusivity shields these practices from criticism, framing them instead as cultural differences that must be respected.

Tacit acceptance has consequences. In fact, the United Nations, the same body that failed Israeli women so spectacularly, also reported a 50% increase in verified cases of conflict-related sexual violence from 2022 to 2023. When women are overlooked or targeted in this way, the global response must be swift and unequivocal. Whether in Israel, Ukraine, Sudan or elsewhere, we must demand accountability for those who weaponize gender-based violence.

Protecting women and girls requires a clear, unambiguous commitment to their dignity, safety and inherent worth. It means recognizing that sexual violence is not just an issue of war, it's an attack on the very identity of women.

We need leaders who are willing to confront these truths, who will stand up unequivocally against violence, and who will advocate for policies that protect the most vulnerable, not shy away from defining who they are.

This anniversary must serve as a call to action and a reminder that silence is not an oversight, it is a betrayal. If the international community continues to hesitate, it signals that the lives, bodies and dignity of women are negotiable.

Women and girls must not be sacrificed on the altar of political expediency, and none of us should remain silent when women and girls' bodies are turned into battlefields."
'Agatha All Along' Has Set A Marvel TV Series Record,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/06/agatha-all-along-has-set-a-marvel-tv-series-record/,2024-10-06T13:00:22Z,"This article was published on 10/4 and republished on 10/6.

Agatha All Along is a hit, thanks to decent viewership compared to an extremely low budget. But Disney is also celebrating its success in another way.

One important metric when it comes to the reception and renewal of streaming series is ""continuation rate,"" whether that's how far you get through a Netflix binge, or if you keep following along week-to-week. A low completion rate means people are less likely to show up for season 2, hence why it's a big factor in why shows get cancelled.

Well, Marvel TV's Brad Winderbaum has now confirmed to Variety that so far, Agatha has the best continuation rate of any Marvel show they've released after four episodes here. Meaning week to week, it has retained the largest percentage of viewers, though he does not get into specifics, perhaps because he doesn't want the other shows to look bad. As a reminder, here are all the Marvel series that have aired so far, and it's better than all these:

Marvel TV is pretty goofy considering out of every show on that list, only What If...? and Loki got a season 2. Falcon and the Winter Soldier, WandaVision and Secret Invasion were supposed to be miniseries. She-Hulk is for sure cancelled, but Moon Knight, Ms. Marvel, Hawkeye and Echo are in limbo. Moon Knight may be the closest to getting a second season, but it hasn't been announced.

So, a solid completion rate is great for Agatha? I mean yes, but it's...another miniseries, so it's not looking for a season 2 renewal anyway. However, the success of Agatha may mean the following:

This is all great news, and the show has also largely avoided the kind of culture wars you might normally see from a mostly-women-led, LGBTQ project like this. It's performing great, and hopefully the rest of the series continues to keep this quality bar.

Update (10/6): In this same interview about the retention rate, Brad Winderbaum spent a while talking about the budget, where he confirmed it has the lowest of any Disney Plus show, which puts it underneath the $40 million Echo. It's supposedly part of a new philosophy that leans away from high-budget spectacles starring (expensive) actors from the films, something that Agatha lacks (at least until Scarlet Witch shows up, perhaps). Here's Winderbaum on the future budgets:

""I think it's about how you use the effects, as opposed to the scale of the effects,"" he said. ""And we're responding to to our own recent history here, and how effective effects really are in increasing the value of a story.""

But Winderbaum is also quick to praise Agatha's showrunner as the driving force behind why the series, like WandaVision, is a hit:

""Jac is unbelievable,"" Winderbaum said. ""Any chance I get to walk around that woman's imagination is like a gift. She's an absolute genius storyteller. And I can tell you like there are so many twists and turns left to come in 'Agatha.'""

I feel like I know a few of those twists or turns already, but that doesn't mean the journey is still going to be fun for another five weeks here."
"Movie Flashback: 'Pillow Talk,' Starring Doris Day And Rock Hudson, Turns 65",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcberman1/2024/10/06/movie-flashback-pillow-talk-starring-doris-day-and-rock-hudson-turns-65/,2024-10-06T12:30:41Z,"The year was 1959. The stars were Doris Day and Rock Hudson. And the movie was Pillow Talk, the first of their three romantic comedies together.

Today the still irresistible Pillow Talk turns 65.

Pillow Talk tells the tale of a New York interior decorator named Jan Morrow (Doris Day) who, sight unseen, takes an enormous dislike to Brad Allen (Rock Hudson), a playboy song writer who shares her party-line phone. A party-line, of course, was a telephone line shared by multiple subscribers. And this song writer, who constantly ties up the line to woo his romantic conquests, learns by accident that his angry phone-sharer is the kind of woman he would like to know better. Being fully aware that his real identity will get him nowhere, Brad wangles an introduction under an assumed name and personality.

The set is now staged for some romantic hijinks, which as expected has a happy ending.

This was Hudson's first comedy following a slew of dramas on his film resume. And, for Doris Day, Pillow Talk transformed her image from ""the girl next door"" to sudden sex symbol.

The supporting cast of Pillow Talk includes Tony Randall, Thelma Ritter and Nick Adams. And the reviews were mostly positive, with five Academy Award nominations (resulting in a win for Best Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen). Day and Ritter, who played much the same role that she played in Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window -- the dour, wisecracking working-class woman - were nominated in the categories of Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, respectively.

Pillow Talk was a box office hit, grossing approximately $18,750,000 domestically (which translates to over $202 million today). It was number one at the U.S. box office for seven consecutive weeks. And, in 2009, Pillow Talk was entered into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being ""culturally, historically or aesthetically"" significant and preserved.

Fun factoid: Ross Hunter, who produced Pillow Talk, claimed that theater managers did not want to book it. Popular movie themes at the time were war films, westerns, and spectacles. They felt the ""sophisticated comedy"" format was out of style. And they were concerned that both Day and Hudson had already peaked."

The renowned festival hosts a month of photo-related celebrations that converts the medieval city in the heart of Tuscany, Italy, into the international capital of photography for participating professional photographers, amateurs, emerging talents and enthusiasts.

The festival offers exhibitions of the winners of the Drone Photo Award, the Creative Photo Award and the International Photo Award (SIPA) competitions, among others.

Tender images of animals, beautiful nature shots, gut-wrenching photos of human despair, fascinating faces and striking sport feats are among the great pictures on display at this year's Siena Photo Awards.

The Siena photo contests are open to professional, amateur and student photographers worldwide.

Lurdes Santander from Asturias, Spain, took the title for the Photograph of the Year at the Creative Photo Awards with her image ""Dreaming Above the Universe,"" a heartwarming photo depicting a mother bear and her three cubs nestled under the starry Milky Way.

Lurdes' captivating work, along with the other awarded entries from the Creative Photo Awards, will be showcased in the exhibition ""I Wonder if You Can"" at the Siena Awards Festival.

What Does The Future Of Leadership Acquisition Look Like?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rhettpower/2024/10/06/what-does-the-future-of-leadership-acquisition-look-like/,2024-10-06T11:06:12Z,"The stakes for securing top executive talent have never been higher. According to Gallup, companies get executive hires wrong an astounding 82% of the time. With this in mind, the role of executive search firms has evolved from merely filling vacancies to a more nuanced practice that combines the art of assessing character and the science of data-driven decision-making.

This strategic approach ensures that leaders meet technical qualifications and align seamlessly with an organization's culture and long-term objectives. In an increasingly competitive market, the key to success lies in securing leaders who are the right fit to drive organizational success.

Uncovering Hidden Potential Beyond the Resume

Evaluating a candidate's resume is only the beginning. The true challenge lies in uncovering the potential beyond bullet points and job titles. Shawn Cole, a seasoned expert in executive search, emphasizes the importance of understanding a candidate's character and leadership potential, which are often shaped by the environments in which they have worked.

""We believe strongly in the idea that 'the environment makes the man or woman,'"" says Cole. ""By closely examining where a candidate has worked and how they have navigated those environments, we can gain critical insights into their potential as a leader."" Top-tier firms look for patterns of success in candidates who have thrived in demanding environments, sometimes referred to as ""honey holes"" -- organizations known for producing exceptional leaders. These candidates bring a proven track record of overcoming challenges and achieving results in high-pressure situations.

This approach goes beyond qualifications, focusing instead on identifying the intrinsic qualities that differentiate a good leader from a great one. By leveraging tools like personality assessments, references, and behavioral interviews, search firms can gain a comprehensive understanding of a candidate's leadership potential, ensuring that they are well-suited to drive success in their new role.

Cultural Fit is The Secret Sauce of Success

In executive search, cultural fit is often the determining factor between a good hire and a great one. While technical skills and experience are crucial, they are not sufficient on their own. Successful placements require a deep alignment between the candidate's values, leadership style, and the organization's culture. This alignment ensures the leader can thrive within the company and drive the team toward shared goals.

Shawn Cole highlights the importance of an objective approach to assessing cultural fit, emphasizing that it's not about gut feelings but measurable factors. ""We start by thoroughly understanding the client's core values, mission, and work environment,"" says Cole. ""This allows us to identify the specific qualities a candidate must possess to succeed within that culture.""

To achieve this, firms conduct cultural alignment checks, comparing the candidate's past work environments with the client's organizational culture. Behavioral interviews are another indispensable tool, helping to assess how candidates have handled situations that reflect the client's cultural priorities, such as fostering collaboration or managing conflict. In some cases, firms may even use simulations or role-playing scenarios to observe how candidates interact in settings that mimic the client's work style.

An example of this is the successful placement of an executive in a complex, multi-billion dollar, employee-owned company. The candidate's ability to navigate the unique culture of employee ownership -- a long-term, employee-first approach -- was critical to their success. By ensuring a strong cultural fit, the placement not only met but exceeded the client's expectations, demonstrating the impact that cultural alignment can have on long-term success.

Future-Proofing Your Leadership is the Key to Sustainable Success

In a rapidly evolving business landscape, the ability to adapt is just as important as experience. Future-proofing leadership means identifying candidates who not only excel in their current roles but also have the potential to thrive amid industry changes and new challenges. This focus on adaptability ensures that organizations are led by individuals who can steer them through both anticipated and unforeseen shifts.

Shawn Cole explains that the key to future-proofing leadership lies in prioritizing candidates who have been ""battle-tested"" in dynamic environments. ""We look for leaders who have demonstrated resilience and success in fast-paced, ever-changing settings,"" Cole notes. ""These individuals have a proven ability to adapt, which is essential for long-term success in today's business world.""

To assess this adaptability, firms employ a combination of personality assessments, behavioral interviews, and an in-depth review of a candidate's past performance. By focusing on leaders who have already navigated significant industry changes, firms reduce the risks associated with hiring unproven talent. This approach minimizes potential setbacks and ensures the leadership team can guide the organization through future challenges.

In essence, future-proofing leadership is about looking beyond the immediate need and ensuring that the leaders of today can also be the visionaries of tomorrow, driving sustained success in an ever-changing environment."

The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has remained a mystery even as bitcoin has won over the likes of Wall Street giant BlackRock, Tesla billionaire Elon Musk and world leaders.

Now, as some fear Satoshi Nakamoto's unmasking could destroy bitcoin completely, a new documentary out this coming week is claiming to have solved the biggest mystery on the internet -- who created bitcoin?

A new HBO documentary titled Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery is set to air on Tuesday at 9pm ET, with producers claiming to have cracked the mystery of bitcoin's anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, it was this week reported by Politico.

In an email, a publicist drumming up press for the film claimed it will ""present a compelling case for who Satoshi Nakamoto may be"" without going so far as to claim any sort of proof of Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity or new evidence.

Interest in Satoshi Nakamoto's identity has increased along with the value of the 1.1 million bitcoin the anonymous man, woman or group is believed to control, now worth around $66 billion at current prices.

Speculators on the Polymarket betting platform think it's most likely that Len Sassaman, a cypherpunk who took his own life in 2011, will be named as Satoshi by the HBO documentary, attracting 38% of punters.

However, Twitter posts written by Sassaman from bitcoin's earliest days show he was unimpressed by the technology.

""Personally, I think bitcoin is overhyped, but the hype itself is interesting,"" Sassaman posted, adding in a separate post that ""digital cash experts I've talked to [say] that it's bunk.""

Other names tipped as possibilities include Hal Finney, who received the first bitcoin transaction before he died in 2014, bit gold developer Nick Szabo and Blockstream chief executive Adam Back.

However, the prediction market site is also putting an 90% likelihood of Satoshi's identity not being proven in 2024.

Adding the excitement, early bitcoin wallets from the Satoshi era -- when they were still posting on the BitcoinTalk forum -- have recently woken up and begun moving coins, it was recently reported by Bitcoin Magazine.

Some 250 bitcoin worth around $15 million have been moved from wallets over the last two weeks.

If any of the bitcoin believed to be directly linked to wallets used by Satoshi Nakamoto is moved, it's expected to trigger a market crash as traders scramble to sell ahead of what could be a tsunami of bitcoin flooding the market.

U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase warned ahead of its 2021 Nasdaq market debut that the unmasking of Satoshi Nakamoto is a major risk to its business.

""The identification of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous person or persons who developed bitcoin, or the transfer of Satoshi's bitcoins"" as a risk factor,"" the company's prospectus read.

Meanwhile, new research carried out by X user Wicked has suggested Satoshi Nakamoto conducted a 51% mining attack on the bitcoin network in its first year of existence, ostensibly to test what would happen if a single miner gained full control.

A 51% attack involves a bitcoin miner gaining majority control of the bitcoin network by ""out hashing"" other miners with sheer computational power. If a miner is able to do so, they would be able to reorder the network, triggering a likely fatal crisis of confidence"

""It's a stress hole there and, for some reason, Beatrice always gets stuck in the middle of things, playing peacemaker on behalf of her dad,"" claimed the insider, as reported by GB News.

""Princess Beatrice is no doubt still feeling devastated as she was in the room at Buckingham Palace during the negotiations [for the interview].""

-- Hilary Fordwich, British royals expert

""No one wants to be around [Andrew] when he's dealing with so much right now,"" the source claimed. ""Beatrice is brokenhearted, of course.""

In ""A Very Royal Scandal,"" actor Michael Sheen portrays the disgraced Duke of York in the days leading up to his interview on ""Newsnight"" with Emily Maitlis.

Following the disastrous sit-down in which he addressed the allegations made by Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, Andrew announced he was stepping back from royal duties.

""'A Very Royal Scandal' is a dramatized account of Prince Andrew's car-crash interview, which has caused ... irreparable harm to his public persona and to his daughters,"" royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital.

""Beatrice and [her sister] Princess Eugenie have always been very close to both of their parents,"" Pelham Turner pointed out. ""But obviously, Beatrice is pregnant and still lives in Britain, thus bearing the brunt of trying to keep all sides of her family and the rest of the royal family ... [calm].""

""[She's been] calming down the rhetoric on both sides,"" Pelham Turner claimed.

Pelham Turner also claimed that tensions between Andrew, 64, and his brother, King Charles, are at an all-time high.

""King Charles recently told Andrew he should move into a luxury townhouse in Belgravia, a very exclusive part of London, but he refused to do so,"" Pelham Turner claimed. ""Now, the king is [said to be] taking away most of Andrew's security detail while living at Royal Lodge in Windsor.""

""So for Beatrice right now, she is between a rock and a hard place with her father,"" Pelham Turner added.

Sources also claimed to New Idea magazine that Beatrice had been avoiding Royal Lodge, Andrew's lavish home that is said to be worth $38 million.

Pelham Turner noted that Beatrice's growing family had been welcomed by Andrew, who is described as ""a doting grandfather.""

""The arrival should also give him more to do,"" he said.

""A Very Royal Scandal"" isn't the only special on rotation about the news-plagued prince.

""Scoop,"" available on Netflix, is the film adaptation of former BBC Newsnight producer Sam McAlister's book, ""Scoops: Behind the Scenes of the BBC's Most Shocking Interviews."" In it, she detailed how the car-crash interview came to fruition.

McAlister previously claimed to Fox News Digital that Andrew was accompanied by Beatrice for his final negotiations before the interview took place.

""It was a curveball,"" McAlister claimed. ""He went, 'I hope you don't mind, I've brought someone with me.' I was expecting a lawyer, someone who was going to close this down. Instead, his young daughter came around the corner. You can only imagine what it was like to have a conversation as delicate as this one involving the allegations that were against him ... in front of his daughter.""

""She was exactly as you would imagine, a concerned daughter who is protective of her father,"" she continued. ""I appreciate these are extraordinary circumstances, and the allegations against him are exceptionally grave. But when it comes down to it, she's a young woman who clearly loves her father and is looking to protect him.""

""The dynamic between them, despite the extraordinary circumstances, was a protective daughter ... listening to us, concerned about what he might be doing,"" said McAlister. ""She is very receptive, polite, clever and interested in the process itself. A daughter is the same, whether you're a prince or a pauper. And that's exactly who she was.""

British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard previously told Fox News Digital that the king wants Andrew to leave his palatial 31-room home where he resides with ex-wife Sarah Ferguson.

""King Charles realizes that Prince Andrew living in Royal Lodge is not a good look,"" Chard explained. ""Prince Andrew's reputation is at an all-time low. He lost the respect of the nation. And yet, his ego is at an all-time high. He does not see sense. He has dug his heels and refuses to leave the home he loves, the prestigious Royal Lodge.""

""King Charles has been covering him financially. I feel now he has no alternative but to freeze this support, which in turn will freeze Prince Andrew out of Royal Lodge.""

According to the U.K. Times, Andrew has lived in Royal Lodge since 2004 after he signed a 75-year lease agreement the year before. The property requires an estimated $503,000 annually for upkeep.

QUEEN ELIZABETH II HAD 'BLIND SPOT' FOR PRINCE ANDREW AS JEFFREY EPSTEIN FRIENDSHIP IMPLODED: EXPERT

It was reported that the duke, who is ""at the brink of eviction,"" was expected to downsize after his ties to Epstein.

The outlet noted that the king would cover his brother's living expenses if he moved into Frogmore Cottage, the former U.K. home of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. The king would also provide for Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York.

Frogmore Cottage remains empty more than a year after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were asked to vacate.

However, Andrew is reportedly ""refusing"" to downsize. A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace told Fox News Digital they won't comment on ""security matters.""

Following his interview, Andrew was also stripped of his honorary military titles. Before Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022, she removed his honorary leadership of various charities, known as royal patronages, and barred him from using the title ""His Royal Highness"" in official settings.

The council in the northern city of York voted unanimously to withdraw the prince's ""freedom of the city."" The honor was awarded to Andrew in 1987 after the queen made him the Duke of York. He is the first person to be stripped of the status, an honor that dates back to medieval times.

Local leaders have since argued that Andrew should also lose the title of Duke of York. A spokesperson for Andrew declined to comment at the time.

In a lawsuit filed in 2020, Giuffre accused Andrew of sexually exploiting her on three occasions in 2001 when she was 17. Andrew has vehemently denied any wrongdoing.

In 2022, a U.S. judge dismissed the sex abuse lawsuit against Andrew, who settled with Giuffre. The prince made a substantial donation to his accuser's charity and declared he never meant to malign her character.

Andrew was named in previously secret court documents related to Epstein that were unsealed in the new year. It was part of a 2015 lawsuit filed against Maxwell by Giuffre.

The records, including transcripts of interviews with some of Epstein's victims and old police reports, contained reminders that the millionaire had surrounded himself with famous and powerful figures, including a few who have also been accused of misconduct."

The victory featured a challenging moment in the second round for Harrison, but the win positions the former Professional Fighters League champion for a shot at the UFC women's bantamweight title.

Harrison's wrestling and the skills she has honed from her years as a two-time Olympic gold medalist in judo were the difference. Vieira had some success in the second round, as she stayed off the ground for prolonged periods.

Vieira opened a cut on Harrison's forehead in the center of a golf-ball-sized hematoma with an elbow. Harrison said it was the first time she'd ever bled in a fight as a professional mixed martial artist.

Harrison solidified her dominance in the third by taking Vieira down and controlling the Brazilian on the ground. Harrison delivered tons of damage from the top position and removed any doubt about which woman was the better fighter.

After the fight, Harrison warned Raquel Pennington and Julianna Pena. Pennington is defending her title against Pena in the co-main event, and Harrison announced she was coming for the winner in search of her second title in as many promotions.

If Harrison completes her mission, she will be the first fighter to win a UFC and PFL title. Last week, PFL owner Donn Davis expressed his disappointment in Harrison's decision to head to the UFC rather than stay with the promotion where she started her career.

The promotion had fights against Larissa Pacheco and Cris Cyborg lined up for Harrison. However, Harrison said in her post-fight interview with Joe Rogan that she came to the UFC because it was the best organization with the best fighters. She'll get a chance to prove she belongs in her next fight."

An off-duty officer with the Atlanta Police Department was shot and killed by one of his neighbors after he allegedly broke into a house near St. Andrews Golf Club in Douglas County, Georgia, early Friday morning, officials said.

The officer, identified as Aubree Horton, had been with the Atlanta Police Department since 2015 and was most recently with the Fugitive Unit, the department told Fox News Digital.

Horton was also just honored with an Investigator of the Year award late last month, according to FOX 5 Atlanta.

'Snow White' reboot star responds to backlash over her comments criticizing original 1937 film: 'Made me sad',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/snow-white-reboot-star-responds-backlash-over-her-comments-criticizing-original-1937-film-made-me-sad,2024-10-05T20:26:57Z,"Actresses Lina Godouse and Brittney Guzman give their take on the controversial remake of the classic tale on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'

The star of Disney's live action ""Snow White"" reboot, Rachel Zegler, is defending herself from backlash she received after calling out the ""weird"" love story in the original animated film years ago.

In a new interview with Variety, Zegler accused her critics of taking her comments ""out of context"" after interview footage from 2022 featured her chiding the original movie as old-fashioned in its depiction of romance between Snow White and the prince that saved her.

""In all honesty, it made me sad that it was taken in such a way, because I believe that women can do anything. But I also believe that they can do everything,"" she told the Hollywood outlet.

RESURFACED VIDEO OF 'SNOW WHITE' ACTRESS SPARKS CONTROVERSY OVER CHANGES IN DISNEY REMAKE: 'NO LONGER 1937'

In the 2022 clip from the Disney D23 Expo that year, Zegler commented on her film adaptation of the classic fairy tale being more modern.

""I just mean that it's no longer 1937,"" she said at the time, adding, ""She's not going to be saved by the prince and she's not going to be dreaming about true love. She's dreaming about becoming the leader she knows she can be and the leader that her late father told her that she could be if she was fearless, fair, brave and true.""

Elsewhere, she commented that some parts of the original film were ""weird"" and that said the prince ""literally stalks"" Snow White.

Fans of the original Disney ""Snow White"" and other cultural commentators slammed Zegler's desire for a version of the classic story with modern gender norms shoehorned into it. The actress has since become the subject of mockery and Disney's upcoming film - out in 2025 - has been written off by many movie fans online.

In her recent interview, Zegler explained that she never intended her comments to be offensive, stating that she just meant the classic Disney character has goals in addition to falling in love with the prince.

She said, ""I would never want to box someone in and say, 'If you want love, then you can't work.' Or 'If you want to work, then you can't have a family.' It's not true. It's never been true. It can be very upsetting when things get taken out of context or jokes don't land.""

The actress also denied allegations that Disney was going to update the love story for the modern era. ""The love story is very integral. A lot of people wrote that we weren't doing [that storyline] anymore -- we were always doing that; it just wasn't what we were talking about on that day.""

As she continued, Zegler suggested that her comments were taken out of context by people who want to tear down famous women. Variety stated, ""Zegler's not surprised by what she sees as people's willful misunderstanding of her comments. It's par for the course for an outspoken young woman in the public eye.""

The actress added ""I've watched women get torn down my whole life, my whole career. We'll watch it in the election that's upcoming. We're gonna witness that for a long time, I fear. Sometimes it can feel like we're going back; it certainly felt that way when that was happening.""

In addition to the ""Snow White"" controversy, Zegler also sparked outrage for an anti-Israel statement she shared to X in August.

After thanking her fans for tuning into the first trailer of the ""Snow White"" film online, she added, ""and always remember, free palestine."""
Sydney Sweeney slams financially fueled preconceived notions about her relationship with 40-year-old fiancé,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sydney-sweeney-slams-preconceived-notions-about-her-relationship-40-year-old-fiance,2024-10-05T19:10:23Z,"'The Five' discuss how the Left is demonizing 'Euphoria' actress Sydney Sweeney over family pics she posted of them wearing 'MAGA-like' hats and a Blue Lives Matter shirt.

Though a notably private person, Sydney Sweeney was eager to ""set the record straight"" when it came to her relationship with fiancé, Jonathan Davino.

In a new interview with Glamour magazine, the ""Euphoria"" star, 27, opened up about the preconceived notion surrounding her decision to be with a man 13 years her senior.

""I'm a very successful, independent woman who's worked really hard,"" Sweeney, who has been sating Davino since 2018, said. ""I've accomplished and bought everything myself, and I provide for myself and my family.""

SYDNEY SWEENEY WANTS TO 'PUSH THE BOUNDARIES' IN ACTING, DOESN'T LIKE TO REHEARSE

""I would love to set the record straight,"" she added. ""You can be in a healthy relationship with someone and also be very successful without needing the man. We're teammates. We're in it together. And we want to see each other succeed.""

The actress told the publication that she is secure in her decisions and proud of her financial accomplishments, which include paying off her mom's mortgage, flying her grandparents to Italy to visit her on set, and buying her uncle's dream boat for the family lake.

However, because of her upbringing, Sweeney is not naive when it comes to maintaining financial stability.

""I come from a family where I saw my parents lose everything, and I am terrified of that. That fear will always be instilled in me. I'm a huge saver. I don't just go and spend money. I like to invest. I like real estate. I like making, hopefully, smart choices with the money I'm making. But I don't think I'll ever actually feel comfortable.""

Though the couple have been engaged since 2022, their relationship faced questions as rumors surrounding Sweeney's relationship with ""Anyone but You"" costar Glen Powell circulated online.

The actress addressed the romance rumors last spring when she hosted ""Saturday Night Live.""

""[The rumors are] obviously not true,"" she said. ""Me and my fiancé produced the movie together, and he was there the entire shoot, and I just want to let everyone knows that he's the man of my dreams, and we're still together and stronger than ever.""

She said that Davino had come to ""Saturday Night Live"" to support her, but when she asked for the camera to cut to him, in a pre-planned joke, Powell was in the audience, to the delight of the crowd.

Jokes aside, Sweeney tells Cosmopolitan magazine in a recent interview that her reasoning for keeping her relationship out of the spotlight is intentional.

""I think that it's really important to keep my personal life personal,"" she told Cosmo. ""I became an actor because I loved playing characters. I loved creating stories and jumping in and learning everything that I could about other people. I never really thought that people would be interested in Sydney. I thought that they'd want to see my character, and so I want to keep it about the work.""

Last month, the actress shared how she manages to stay grounded despite mega fame.

""I have a really amazing friend group where there are a few who are in this industry, but most of them are not,"" the 26-year-old told Cosmo. ""You get to step out of what I call 'the bubble,' and you see what's important in life. You see reality, and it grounds and humbles you.""

Country music legend Garth Brooks and longtime wife Trisha Yearwood opened up about their strong marriage days before he was accused of sexual assault.

""My favorite thing about getting to be Ms. Yearwood's partner is the good times, but also going through the bad times together, because that makes you one and it tests your mettle,"" Brooks shared with People magazine.

Brooks and Yearwood made their comments days before the ""Friends in Low Places"" singer was accused of sexual assault.

'Willful coverup': Democrat in key House race hit with ethics complaint that could derail campaign,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/willful-coverup-democrat-key-house-race-hit-ethics-complaint-could-derail-campaign,2024-10-05T18:38:15Z,"FIRST ON FOX: A Democratic House candidate in one of the most closely watched races in the country was the subject of an ethics complaint alleging that she had failed to act on allegations of sexual harassment and assault against a man working with her campaign.

Fox News Digital obtained a complaint filed with the state's Legislative Equality Office against Janelle Bynum, running for Congress in Oregon's 5th Congressional District, alleging that Bynum had failed to be a mandatory reporter of allegations against a man working for the PAC that staffed her State Representative campaign in 2022.

The complaint also alleged that when confronted about the alleged actions, Bynum was dismissive and even threatened the individual who had reached out to her.

""During the 2024 primary election, I was contacted by an informant with information about Rep. Bynum and her willful coverup of a sexual assault of a minor volunteer who worked for her during the 2022 cycle,"" the complaint reads.

DEM HOUSE CANDIDATE INTRODUCED 'SOFT-ON-CRIME' BILL BACKED BY DEFUND-POLICE GROUPS: 'SLAP IN THE FACE'

The complainant claims to have ""personally spoken"" with two former staff members who alleged that they had reported inappropriate sexual behavior by a field organizer ""directly"" to Bynum, along with two others associated with the campaign, ""only for nothing to be done.""

""For me, the primary issue here is that all Legislators are mandatory reporters,"" the complaint says. ""Bynum received credible information regarding one of her campaign staff sexually harassing and assaulting young volunteers, and not only did she not report it, but she also threatened to report the person who blew the whistle. . . .""

In a statement to Fox News Digital, a Bynum campaign spokesperson said, ""This attempt to smear Rep. Bynum is not based in reality. As a mom of two young women and a legislator who has spent her career advocating for others, Rep. Bynum takes this subject personally -- which is why she flagged these accusations directly to the accuser's employer, Future PAC, as soon as she was made aware of them after the 2022 election.""

""It's also why she's openly aided the Legislative Equity Office's investigation into the matter. Rep. Bynum expected Future PAC to deal with these accusations fairly and swiftly and to ensure their employees' well-being and safety. If Future PAC did anything less, that is unacceptable.""

The Bynum campaign shared an email exchange between Bynum and the Legislative Equity Office on September 20 in which the office told her she is ""not being investigated"" by the office.

However, two sources familiar with the situation told Fox News Digital that state police have conducted interviews regarding the complaint which was recently forwarded to them in the last couple of weeks. The nature and scope of that investigation is not known at this time.

Fox News Digital obtained text messages between a former Bynum campaign manager and Bynum in which Bynum appeared to show little interest in bringing attention to the alleged impropriety against her former staffer.

""I asked you not to send me anything and I meant that,"" Bynum says in a November 17th text in response to a warning from a former campaign manager about the staffer harassing women associated with the campaign. ""I really can't take anything else on my plate.""

The former campaign manager continued pressing the issue a few days later.

""While as unfortunate as this may be for you or [redacted] I am NOT siting (sic) by while someone like this gets off scott free treating young women abusively like that,"" the former campaign manager texted Bynum on November 21, 2022. ""If he gets a job down there this won't be the last you hear of it I promise.""

Bynum responds by asking, ""Are you threatening me?""

""Woah, easy there,"" the former campaign manager responds. ""I am promising you and anyone else that I am not OK with someone treating young women like that.""

""I'll consider reporting your actions,"" Bynum responded. ""Thank you for letting me know.""

In another text thread on November 14, 2022, a FuturePAC staffer says, ""It's best we handle telling Janelle"" and says we will ""certainly flag"" the concerns.

It is unclear the exact date that Bynum flagged the concerns through the appropriate channels, but two sources familiar with the situation told Fox News Digital that the accused staffer has continued to be associated with FuturePAC in the last couple of years and held a position with the Oregon State Legislature after the 2022 campaign. FuturePAC did not respond to an inquiry related to this allegation shared with Fox News Digital.

OREGON DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PRIORITIZES LOOPHOLES OVER COMPENSATION, ADVOCATES ARGUE

Fox News Digital reviewed text messages between Bynum and a FuturePAC staffer between November 22, four days after the text exchange with the former campaign manager, and November 30 where she attempted to get him on the phone about an unspecified matter.

Two sources familiar with the situation told Fox News Digital that multiple staffers at FuturePAC, a campaign arm of Oregon House Democrats that staffs local campaigns, were aware of concerns and allegations against the individual during the campaign but told staffers it would be addressed after the campaign concluded. A spokesperson for FuturePAC denied these allegations.

""To our knowledge, during the 2022 cycle no official complaints that would have triggered [an] investigation under the contract were made regarding the staff assigned to Rep. Bynum's campaign,"" a FuturePAC spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""FuturePAC hires and manages the campaign staff working on campaigns that we are supporting -- as such, campaign staffers are FuturePAC employees, not employees of individual candidates. We take all allegations regarding staff conduct during campaign work seriously.""

""Our union contract agreement with the Campaign Workers Guild requires official complaints and investigations to be handled through FuturePAC -- campaigns and candidates are not allowed to be responsible for investigations of any workplace conduct. To our knowledge, during the 2022 cycle no official complaints were made that would have triggered investigation under the contract.""

Rule 27 of the Oregon State Legislature says, ""Members of the Legislative Assembly ... are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that is free of harassment and to discourage all harassment in the workplace and at professional meetings, seminars, or at any event at which the Legislative business is conducted.""

Multiple state laws on the books in Oregon deal with state legislators being required to report allegations of sexual assault, specifically related to children and minors, and legislators are commonly understood to be mandatory reporters of such allegations.

Bynum drew criticism in 2019 from sexual assault survivors for voting against a bill that would have given more time for victims to sue by expanding the statute of limitations for rape.

""It's not popular to protect the accused, but it is our job,"" Bynum said at the time.

A spokesperson for the Oregon State Police confirmed they have ""received an initial complaint"" regarding the July complaint against Bynum but would not comment ""in regards to the status or scope of an investigation"" or on where the complaint they received originated.

""Janelle is the only person in this race who has been a consistent champion for the underserved and underrepresented, and she'll do what's best for Oregonians in the halls of Congress,"" DCCC spokesperson Dan Gottlieb told Fox News Digital. ""Lori Chavez-DeRemer has no business lecturing anyone about standing up for victims and survivors.""

Congressional Black Caucus PAC Senior Advisor, Chris Taylor told Fox News Digital that Bynum is not to blame for the complaint.

""Future PAC and Oregon Speaker of the House Julie Fahey ought to take responsibility for the alleged HR failures in their organization - We won't tolerate politically convenient blame shifting on the only Black woman in the State House,"" Taylor said. ""As a mother, small business owner and dedicated public servant, Janelle has a track record of delivering for Oregon and we know she'll do even more good for Oregonians when she gets to Congress.""

A spokesperson for EMILY's List told Fox News Digital that Bynum ""is a mother and a state representative who has been a steadfast advocate for Oregonians throughout her entire career.""

""Throughout this election, Republicans have shamefully tried to smear Bynum's record and this is just their latest attempt to distract from the extremist agenda Lori Chavez-DeRemer and her MAGA allies are pushing. We are proud to stand by Bynum and we are confident she will continue to stand up for Oregonians against Republican extremism.""

A source familiar with the situation told Fox News Digital that Bynum ""would have received annual training on her duties as a mandatory reporter"" making her certain of her ""obligation to report this to law enforcement"" and not to FuturePac.""

""Her dereliction of duty is not on Fahey or anyone else.""

Bynum is running against Republican Congresswoman Lori Chavez-DeRemer in a race that some experts believe could tip the balance of power in the House."
European Court Of Justice: Gender And Nationality Sufficient To Grant Afghan Women Asylum,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2024/10/05/european-court-of-justice-gender-and-nationality-sufficient-to-grant-afghan-women-asylum/,2024-10-05T17:54:31Z,"On October 4, 2024, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that gender and nationality alone are sufficient for a country to grant asylum to Afghan women. The ECJ, the supreme court of the European Union, rules on matters of European Union law. The case, brought before the ECJ, concerned Afghan women who were seeking international protection in Austria, and their asylum applications were rejected in 2015 and 2020.

The ECJ was asked to provide clarification in relation to two important questions. First, the referring court sought to establish whether the measures taken by the Taliban in respect of women are sufficiently serious to be classified as an ""act of persecution"" within the meaning of Article 9(1) of Directive 2011/95. The measures considered by the court included that women ""are denied participation in political office and political decision-making processes; are provided with no legal means to be able to obtain protection from gender-based and domestic violence; are generally at risk of forced marriages; (...) are not allowed to engage in gainful employment or are allowed to do so only to a limited extent, mainly at home; have difficulties in accessing health facilities; are fully or largely denied access to education; are not allowed to be or move about in public without being accompanied by a man (who must be of a certain family relationship) or, at most, are permitted to do so only a certain distance from home; must completely cover their bodies and veil their faces in public; may not take part in any sports."" Second, the court further sought clarification whether it is sufficient, for the granting of [refugee] status, that a woman is affected by those measures in the country of origin merely on the basis of her gender, or is it necessary to assess a woman's individual situation in order to determine whether she is affected by those measures.

The ECJ found that the directive ""must be interpreted as meaning that an accumulation of discriminatory measures in respect of women (...) adopted or tolerated by an 'actor of persecution' within the meaning of Article 6 of that directive comes within the concept of 'act of persecution', since those measures, by their cumulative effect, undermine human dignity as guaranteed by Article 1 of the Charter.""

It further added that in the case of Afghan women, ""the competent national authorities are entitled to consider that it is currently unnecessary to establish, in the individual assessment of the situation of an application for international protection, that there is a risk that she will actually and specifically be subject to acts of persecution if she returns to her country of origin, where the factors relating to her individual status, such as her nationality or gender, are established.""

The ECJ further found that the directive must be interpreted as not requiring the competent national authority to take into consideration, in the individual assessment of her application, factors particular to her personal circumstances other than those relating to her gender or nationality.

This judgment aligns with the responses to the first Taliban regime, namely between 1996 and 2001. At the time of the first Taliban regime, the court ""held that the overall situation of those women in Afghanistan had to be deemed sufficiently serious to find that the discriminatory measures targeting them constituted, in themselves, persecution under the Geneva Convention. Therefore, at that time, an applicant for international protection was granted refugee status on the sole ground of being an Afghan woman."" This approach was changed after the fall of the first Taliban regime and the individual circumstances had to be considered. However, the return of the Taliban in August 2021 meant that this approach was not adequate anymore and similar responses as those to the first Taliban regime were needed.

The ECJ judgment also reflects the UNHCR 2023 statement concerning the concept of persecution on cumulative grounds in the light of the current situation for women and girls in Afghanistan - that there is a presumption of recognition of refugee status for Afghan women and girls, given the acts of persecution carried out against them by the Taliban solely on account of their gender.

As it stands, Sweden, Finland and Denmark already grant refugee status to all Afghan women seeking asylum, recognizing the severity of the persecution of women in Afghanistan - because of their gender.

The ECJ judgment is an important assessment of the nature and severity of the persecution of women in Afghanistan - persecution that requires adequate responses, including international protection."

The 10 Best New Movies On Netflix In October 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbean/2024/10/05/the-10-best-new-movies-on-netflix-in-october-2024/,2024-10-05T16:07:09Z,"My favorite time of year is upon us: Halloween season. Not only do I embrace the festivities involved with the year's spookiest time, but I absolutely love watching nothing but horror movies for the entire month. But I do know horror movies aren't everybody's cup of tea, which means this list I compile each month needs to pack lots of different options. Luckily, Netflix provided subscribers with an eclectic array of films in October 2024, including an outrageous multi-character body-swapping experience from the Sundance Film Festival, an Oscar-winning biopic about one of the our most accomplished thespians, and a sequel to one of Netflix's most-watched movies of all time. No matter your movie taste, Netflix has something for you this month.

So which movies should you be watching? Below, I've compiled a list of ten films that should be on your radar in October. And at the end of the article, you can find a full list of every single movie coming to Netflix this month. Hopefully my notes on each movie can help you decide what to watch on your next movie night.

Note: this list covers all releases leading up to Oct. 6, 2024.

Just when we thought we had escaped the grim and brutal world of ""the pit,"" the hellish prison outfit came back with a vengeance. A sequel to one of the most-watched films on Netflix, with its cult status secured thanks to its outrageous dystopian setting appealing to the confined audience of the COVID-19 pandemic, The Platform 2 continues the story of the ""Vertical Self-Management Center,"" an underground prison that houses a cruel food distribution system in which a platform descends daily, filled with food for hundreds of floors of inmates. As the platform goes lower and lower, there's less and less food available, creating for survival-of-the-fittest environment driven by our deepest primal instincts. This sequel finds its characters -- specifically, Milena Smit as Perempuan and Hovik Keuchkerian as Zamiatin -- driving a rebellion against the Pit's oppressive system, confronting the rise of a totalitarian ruler who imposes strict rules on the inmates. Directed once again by Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia, The Platform 2 builds on the unsettling and dystopian atmosphere of its predecessor in grim-yet-absorbing fashion.

Body-swapping movies are a dime a dozen in Hollywood, with their stories often feeling stale and uninspired, following the same beaten path over and over. But that's exactly what makes It's What's Inside so intriguing: this Sundance Film Festival hit explored the formula in a new, irreverent ways that are both hilarious and thought-provoking. The film starts off with a seemingly normal pre-wedding party, but before long descends into pure chaos thanks to a mysterious suitcase that contains a ""body-swapping game."" What starts as a casual experience quickly unravels into an existential nightmare as this ""game"" becomes a reality and characters are forced to navigate a psychological maze burdened by an atmosphere that first-time director Greg Jardin would describe as ""anxiety chic."" The cast of It's What's Inside features Brittany O'Grady as Shelby, James Morosini as Cyrus, Alycia Debnam-Carey as Nikki and Devon Terrell as Reuben. It's What's Inside wants nothing more than to entertain you, and boy does it ever.

There are a lot of great horror gems hidden throughout Netflix, and See for Me sits at the top of that list. This tense thriller follows our main character, Sophie (played by Skyler Davenport), a young blind woman who finds herself trapped inside a remote mansion during a home invasion. With her safety compromised, she relies on a phone app called ""See for Me,"" through which a remote assistant named ""Kelly"" (voiced by Jessica Parker Kennedy) guides Sophie through the house using the phone's camera. Adopting a minimalist style that employes lots of tight framing, director Randall Okita and his cinematographers (Jordan Oram and Jackson Parrell) use the camera to mirror Sophie's impairment, creating for a claustrophobic and disorienting aesthetic. And because our protagonist is blind, the film heavily relies on its intricate sound design to convey information and build tension, resulting in a full sensory experience that places you directly in Sophie's shoes. The result is a film that keeps you feeling enveloped by its terror throughout.

I tried my best to choose movies that were less well known for this list, but it's hard to pass up including Bridesmaids on any sort of ""best of"" list when it's available. This classic ensemble comedy directed by Paul Feig and written by Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo revolves around the misadventures of Annie (played by Wiig), a single woman whose messy, directionless life further unravels as the stresses and absurdities of being the maid of honor for her best friend's wedding mount. The biggest complication? The bride, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), has another good friend named Helen (Rose Byrne) who is possibly scheming to steal the maid of honor duties away. You'll come for the incredible supporting cast, which includes Melissa McCarthy (in her first big breakout role), Endy McLendon-Covey, Ellie KEmper, Chris O'Dowd and Jon Hamm, enjoy the endlessly quotable quotes (""I'm glad he's single because I'm going to climb that like a tree""), and stay for the raunchy and outrageous humor that isn't afraid to shy away from genuinely affecting heartfelt moments. This movie hasn't aged one bit since its release.

I might catch some heat for this one, but I'm not afraid: I love the Point Break remake. Don't get me wrong, I love the original more, as touches the chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze. It's one of the movie's I'm most nostalgic for. But the 2015 version of Point Break is a completely different experience that can be enjoyed for trying something much different. In this update, directed by Ericson Core, FBI agent Johnny Utah (Luke Bracey) still infiltrates a crime-committing outfit ran by Bohdi (Édgar Ramírez). But instead of local bank robberies, Bohdi's team of extreme sports enthusiasts commit incredibly high-stakes crimes that involve wingsuit flying, snowboarding and rock climbing, all in an effort to raise awareness about man's relationship with Mother Earth. While the original Point Break adopted a more playful and rebellious spirit, using a central romance to drive the story, the remake takes on a much more serious, philosophical tone, capturing how one overcomes existential trauma and finds freedom spiritually. Plus, the movie performs some of the most impressive practical stunts you'll see in modern filmmaking. It's all part of its exhilarating aesthetic built around searching for one's purpose.

As the years have worn on, several horror movies have lost their touch, their pizazz, their ability to excite a modern audience that's seen everything there is to see from the genre. But every time I watch Psycho, I can't help but think, ""Man, this movie's still got it, and still feels refreshing and different."" This unmatched psychological horror film follows Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), who, after stealing money, encounters the enigmatic Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) at the eerie Bates Motel. What follows from there in this meticulously crafted black-and-white thriller is anything but an ordinary cinematic experience. Director Alfred Hitchcock creates this voyeuristic effect that aligns viewers with the characters' perspectives, often making them complicit in the narrative's tension. The story seamlessly shifts between quiet, mundane moments of everyday conversation that reveal the psychology of the characters and explosive moments of stylistic flourish that capture the sheer potential madness of the human mind. These abrupt transitions create a rhythm of tension and release, constantly keeping you on the edge of your seat. In the end, the movie questions our relationship with psychosis -- what it means to be ""mad"" and how we understand those that have lost touch with reality.

While a lot of the movies on this list, as would be expected from Netflix's usual October lineup, contain horror and high-octane action, there are much more graceful, exquisite experiences to be found in wonderful movies like Being Julia. A drama-comedy set in 1930s London, the film focuses on life of celebrated stage actress Julia Lambert (Annette Bening). Currently in the midst of a mid-life crisis, Julia loses touch with her husband, Michael (Jeremy Irons), and embarks on a whirlwind love affair with a younger man named Tom (Shaun Evans), sparking a journey of self-discovery and reinvention. Director István Szabó crafts an elegant aesthetic that feels very reminiscent of 2000s period pieces, flush with fluid camera movements and long, sweeping shots that capture the opulent settings of London's theaters, grand homes and lavish parties. The tone of the movie is both sophisticated and playful, delivered with a sense of self-awareness that echoes the high-spirited nature of theatrical comedies. This great mix of comedy and drama is bolstered by the all-star acting being performed by some of the movie industry's best thespians of the time.

My instinct was to just recommend the first 21 Jump Street, but if you haven't seen this movie's sequel as well, then you really should take this opportunity to watch one of the best comedic duologies ever. Because 22 Jump Street isn't just a sequel -- it's a mega-meta dissertation of what we come to expect from sequels, with the characters themselves essentially realizing they're in a movie that follows all the patterns expected from the Hollywood machine. These action-comedy films reinvigorate the buddy cop genre with a self-aware, irreverent style through its two bumbling police officers, Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum), who go undercover as students in both high school (21 Jump Street) and college (22 Jump Street) to bust drug rings. Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller adopt a colorful, high-energy style that not only has fun with the formula, but is exhilarating to watch, balancing moments of impressive choreography with laugh-out-loud jokes. To boot, the story is genuinely affecting, as Schmidt and Jenko's relationship builds and morphs into a bona fide life-affirming friendship. As a pair, these movies collectively result in one of the best comedic experiences Hollywood has offered in the 21st century.

I know there's temptation to roll your eyes when the genres ""found footage"" and ""horror"" come together, especially since half of these types of movies are budget-constrained cash-grabs are filled with cheesy jump scares and bad acting. But As Above, So Below is one of those found footage movies that transcends, that feels as though it's carrying the genre's aesthetic to new immersive grounds. The story follows a group of explorers (played by actors Perdita Weeks, Ben Feldman, Edwin Hodge and François Civil) as they navigate the treacherous catacombs beneath Paris in search of the legendary Philosopher's Stone. The Parisian catacombs are central to what makes the film transcend what's typical from the genre, with the narrow, winding tunnels captured in tight, confined shots that evoke a heightened sense of claustrophobia that eclipses what found footage movies are typically capable of. The characters' lack of lighting furthers this suffocating aesthetic, as many scenes are cloaked in darkness and deep shadows that restrict our field of vision, leaving much of what's happening shrouded in mystery -- a bizarre experience for a movie. The story beats might be typical of your average found footage flick, but the technical achievements are anything but. If you're looking to be scared this Halloween season on Netflix, this is your chance.

There was no actress quite like Judy Garland -- a mesmerizing vaudevillian who rose to international stardom for both her musical and dramatic talents, from her childhood prodigy days on the stage to her award-winning performances on screen in movies like Meet Me in St. Louis, A Star is Born and The Wizard of Oz. The biopic Judy centers on the final year of the legendary singer and actress's life as she performs a series of concerts in 1969 London, all while detailing Garland's personal struggles with addiction, loneliness and the burden of fame as she showcases her enduring talent and charisma. The cast is outstanding in this one, with Garland played to perfection by Renée Zellweger, who won her second Academy Award for her performance (the first win was for Cold Mountain), as well as other great showings coming from Jessie Buckley, Finn Wittrock, Michael Gambon and Rufus Sewell. Interspersed with flashbacks to Garland's early years in Hollywood, this raw, nuanced examination of the legendary actress's character is both celebratory and bittersweet, highlighting the contrast between Garland's moments of triumph on stage and her personal battles behind the scenes."
WWE Bad Blood 2024: Roman Reigns Losing And 5 Smart Booking Decisions,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakeoestriecher/2024/10/05/wwe-bad-blood-2024-roman-reigns-losing-and-5-smart-booking-decisions/,2024-10-05T15:34:10Z,"WWE Bad Blood 2024 will mark the culmination of the long-running feud between CM Punk and Drew McIntyre as well as the latest storyline twist in The Bloodline saga.

Headlined by Punk vs. McIntyre and an unlikely tag team match pitting Roman Reigns and Cody Rhodes against Jacob Fatu and Solo Sikoa, Bad Blood in Atlanta is expected to be yet another sellout for WWE as the company looks to extend its streak of stellar pay-per-views. August's Bash in Berlin was the highest-grossing arena event in company history while just a few weeks prior SummerSlam had its largest crowd of all-time.

Perhaps just as importantly, both shows delivered strong in-ring performances from top to bottom and featured major storyline occurrences, such as Reigns' return at SummerSlam or Punk's first singles victory in a decade at Bash in Berlin.

And Bad Blood? Well, The Wrestling Observer's Dave Meltzer (h/t Wrestling Inc) said the show nearly sold out immediately and ranks ""among the most in-demand tickets in pro wrestling history,"" after the secondary market ""exploded."" WWE's tried-and-true formula of five-match pay-per-view cards has been a hit, with fewer matches but, overall, more bang for your buck. Bad Blood should be no different.

As one of only three PPVs left in 2024, Bad Blood will also have many major storyline ramifications heading into Survivor Series and Royal Rumble season. With just five matches yet again, the booking of those bouts is even more important.

Here are five smart creative decisions WWE must make at Bad Blood 2024.

Even as a former Universal and NXT Champion, Finn Balor hasn't been pushed all that well as a single star in WWE over the past few years, largely losing to other stars slightly above him on the card.

Now, he finds himself in a similar situation with Damian Priest, his former Judgment Day stablemate who's now his archnemesis. Priest, settling in nicely as one of Raw's top babyfaces, currently appears to be a bigger priority than Balor in the eyes of the creative team, but there is still plenty of time left in this storyline.

In lengthy feuds between bitter rivalries that extend for months and result in numerous matches, the best and most logical booking is to stack the odds against the babyface. That's why at Bad Blood there isn't much logic behind Priest beating Balor clean as a sheet in their first major match. If that happened, where would WWE go from there? Exactly.

The best scenario here is for the Judgment Day's advantages in the numbers game to get the best of Priest, with outside interference costing the one-time World Heavyweight Champion the win.

Liv Morgan has held the Women's World Championship since May's King and Queen of the Ring, and yet, the timing simply isn't right for a title change.

Morgan's feud with Rhea Ripley is carrying the Raw's women's division, which has struggled to create compelling storylines outside of their wildly entertaining rivalry. With marquee names like Asuka sidelined while Becky Lynch remains a free agent, WWE needs to continue Ripley vs. Morgan for the foreseeable future.

And why not? The feud, despite going on for most of the year, is still red hot, and truth be told, there aren't many other options right now for either woman as champion. The best way to keep Ripley and Morgan as relevant as they are is to have them continue their rivalry.

The ultimate climax of Ripley vs. Morgan is clearly going to be Ripley's big win, and with both Crown Jewel and Survivor Series taking place just next month, WWE can easily extend this rivalry by holding off on Ripley's win. Similarly to Priest vs. Balor, booking the heel to win via help from Judgment Day is a sensible booking move that could lead to another match in the near future.

Nia Jax has been a dominant WWE Women's Champion on SmackDown, and her biggest potential rivals are currently in the tag team division.

It's clear that Jax is being built up as such an unstoppable champion in order to set the stage for a blockbuster match with Bianca Belair or Jade Cargill. Beyond those two stars, there really isn't much depth to the SmackDown women's division, save for a potential return from Charlotte Flair.

Still, the biggest rivalries lying ahead for Jax don't involve her Bad Blood opponent Bayley. This instead feels much more like a stopgap rivalry before something bigger down the road, which necessitates a win for Jax at Bad Blood, where she will enter as the overwhelming favorite.

That's the way it should be, too. Jax has been great as SmackDown's top titleholder, and there's no need to take the title off her until the time is just right.

CM Punk vs. Drew McIntyre is one of those historic rivalries that can easily be revisited down the road, but with their Hell in a Cell match also serving as the rubber match, Bad Blood is almost assuredly going to serve as the end of this feud.

An argument could be made that both stars could use the win, but who needs it more? Consider this: Punk is in the midst of his first major rivalry in WWE more than a decade, and the former WWE Champion is reportedly in line for a potential World Heavyweight Championship feud with Gunther at Survivor Series.

Then, it becomes clear that Punk needs to win at Bad Blood. McIntyre, after all, has been absolutely tremendous as a heel, and after recently re-signing with WWE, his strong performances as Raw's top villains figure to keep him in a prominent role at or near the top of the card. What's more, a loss at Hell in a Cell could also force McIntyre to become an even more detestable heel in the weeks and months ahead.

Punk, on the other hand, is the beloved babyface who is likely going to be involved in a significant match at Survivor Series and, long-term, will play a sizable role during WrestleMania season. He needs the win at Bad Blood and the momentum boost it will give him more than McIntyre, a tremendous villain who can become a bigger one with an ""L"" in Atlanta.

Roman Reigns and Cody Rhodes have formed an unlikely alliance as a 2024 version of The Mega Powers, but given their long and storied history, how much will they really get along at Bad Blood?

It was initially suggested that Punk vs. McIntyre would headline Bad Blood, but the latest report is that Rhodes and Reigns vs. Fatu and Sikoa will main event the show instead. Thus, it should come as no surprise if the placement of this match on the card plays a role in the outcome of the bout.

If this Bloodline tag team match indeed closes out Bad Blood as expected, there is likely going to be a major cliffhanger-type angle at the top of the show. That could range from a shocking return, like Jimmy Uso, Paul Heyman or even -- gasp -- The Rock, or maybe a heel turn from Kevin Owens. Regardless, the question here is: who needs the win the most?

The answer? Fatu. The clear star of the new-look Bloodline, Fatu will be participating in the biggest match of his young career, and given the star power involved on the babyface side, the easiest possible decision would be to have Reigns and Rhodes win in resounding fashion.

But how about taking a risk? Fatu has been an immediate hit so far, and WWE needs to ride that wave, which means that Reigns and Rhodes need to suffer a rare loss at Bad Blood -- one that can easily be booked in a way that protects both stars, especially if someone like Heyman or even The Rock shows up in shocking fashion."
What are New York's squatter laws? Legal expert shares thoughts on what more can be done to protect landlords,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/what-new-yorks-squatter-laws-legal-expert-shares-thoughts-what-more-can-done-protect-landlords,2024-10-05T15:02:30Z,"Flash Shelton, founder of Squatter Hunters in California, shared with Fox News Digital his solution for helping to solve the issue.

New York's 2024 state budget signed into law in April included a clear definition of a ""squatter,"" but a New York City attorney believes more can be done to protect homeowners and landlords.

Several states across the country have passed laws to prevent squatting. One was Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation in March 2024 that went into effect July 1.

""You are not going to be able to commandeer somebody's private property and expect to get away with it. We are in the state of Florida ending the squatter scam once and for all,"" DeSantis said during a press conference.

ADVICE FROM PROFESSIONALS ON PROTECTING YOUR HOME AGAINST SQUATTERS

In part, the law made it easier for law enforcement to intervene in squatter disputes in the state of Florida.

The law ""will give the homeowner the ability to quickly and legally remove a squatter from a property, which will increase criminal penalties for squatting. Now, we have not had the same type of issues here, as you've seen in California or New York. Nevertheless, our laws were really geared towards this not necessarily being a fad,"" DeSantis added.

True stories from those affected by squatters helped the law get passed in the Sunshine State. A woman named Patti Peeples, who had squatters in her home for 36 days, was asked to provide testimony before Florida Senate and House committees when the bill was still under consideration.

MENTAL, PHYSICAL AILMENTS CAN DEVELOP AMONG HOMEOWNERS OVERTAKEN BY SQUATTERS, ACCORDING TO EXPERT

""I'm amazed, surprised and really, really encouraged that this particular case of mine showed me and I hope shows others that our legislatures can listen to everyday citizens and sometimes actually seek to efficiently make new laws to address common everyday problems,"" Peeples previously told Fox News Digital.

After many squatter stories emerged from New York, particularly New York City, lawmakers defined a squatter in the 2024 state budget signed into law by Gov. Kathy Hochul in April in an attempt to make it easier for police to intervene.

The language defines a squatter as ""a person who enters or intrudes upon real property without the permission of the person entitled to possession, and continues to occupy the property without title, right or permission of the owner or owner's agent or a person entitled to possession,"" according to the New York Senate's website.

'PROFESSIONAL' SQUATTERS MOVE HOUSE TO HOUSE, RETAIN STATE-BY-STATE KNOWLEDGE ON THE LAW

This law came out at the same time as the Good Cause Eviction Law.

That law states ""that fair market tenants who are not regulated, such as rent-stabilized and rent-control tenants, but free market tenants, cannot be removed from possession of an apartment unless the landlord can establish either that they are exempt from the law or that they have what's called good cause, which is defined in the law to remove the tenant from possession,"" said Daniel Phillips.

Phillips is a real estate litigation partner at Belkin, Burden and Goldman who specializes in landlord-tenant disputes.

Phillips told Fox News Digital defining a squatter ""didn't change anything with laws pertaining to squatters at all.""

""All it did was give a definition of what a squatter is, basically saying that they're not tenants, which already existed,"" Phillips added.

Phillips spoke about ways he believes New York could help protect homeowners against squatters, including a clear description of what can be done if a homeowner or landlord has a squatter living on a property, such as removal by the police or utilizing self-help methods, like changing locks or turning off utilities.

""Even creating a special courtroom designated for these types of cases with an accelerated court date so that landlords can go through the judicial process faster,"" Phillips suggested. ""The law didn't do any of that."""
What Does Abortion Look Like In Your State? An Alphabetical Guide,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/evaepker/2024/10/05/what-does-abortion-look-like-in-your-state-an-alphabetical-guide/,2024-10-05T13:36:04Z,"In exactly one month, voters across the United States will cast their ballots - and for residents of 10 of those states, those ballots will include questions about the future of abortion. For nearly 50 years, the U.S Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade established that a person's individual right to an abortion was protected by the U.S Constitution. The U.S Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization in 2022, however, overturned that prior ruling, leaving states with the power to regulate abortion.

Since then, 20 states have banned or restricted abortions, seven states have already voted on abortion rights, and multiple states have abortion-related laws and guidelines that simply aren't clear. For example, four states (Arkansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and South Dakota) allow abortions only to save a pregnant person's life but not to improve her health. Healthcare professionals then have to decide - sometimes in the middle of a medical emergency - whether an abortion would qualify as life-saving or, in other words, legal or not. They are then liable if they have found to have broken the law and could face punishments such as fines, jail sentences, loss of license, or a combination of the three.

This state-by-stage guide aims to clear up some unknowns about abortion, such as where it is legal, what exceptions might exist, what lawsuits or laws are pending, and what voters - and the rest of the U.S population - should know in advance of Election Day.

Alabama: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life or health: both physical and mental. Alabama is actually the only state that explicitly includes mental health concerns as an exception to its abortion ban but requires that a psychiatrist both to diagnose the pregnant individual with a ""serious mental illness"" and to document that her mental health condition could cause her to engage in behavior that might threaten her life or that of the fetus.

There are no exceptions to the abortion ban for fatal fetal anomalies or in cases of rape and/or incest.

Alaska: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Arizona: Abortion is legal up to 15 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person counseling from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission before the abortion.

In September 2024, Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs signed the legislature's repeal of an 1864 near-total abortion ban.

Arizona residents will be also be voting on Arizona Proposition 139, the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" will amend the state Constitution to provide the fundamental right to abortion before the point of fetal viability (which is usually between 22 and 26 weeks and marks the point where the fetus has a high chance of surviving outside the uterus without any significant medical intervention) unless ""justified by a compelling state interest"" (such as improving or maintaining the health of the individual seeking an abortion). Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment.

Arkansas: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exception to this ban is to save a pregnant person's life. There are no exceptions for risks to the pregnant person's physical health, for fatal fetal anomalies, or for rape and/or incest.

Arkansans for Limited Government tried to get an abortion rights amendment on the ballot in 2024. If passed, the amendment would've legalized abortion up to 18 weeks and protected abortion access after that time period in the cases of risks to the pregnant person's life or health, for fatal fetal anomalies, and for rape and/or incest. In August 2024, the Arkansas Supreme Court ruled that Arkansans for Limited Government had failed to file the paid canvasser training certification and had failed to comply with state law so the amendment wouldn't appear on the 2024 ballot.

California: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

In 2022, California residents passed California Proposition 1, the Right to Reproductive Freedom Amendment, which supported amending the state Constitution to prohibit the state from interfering with or denying an individual's reproductive freedom, including the right to an abortion. The Proposition passed with 67% support.

Colorado: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian or adult relative (if the minor lives with that relative and not with one or both parents) must be informed at least 48 hours before the abortion.

Next month, residents will vote on Colorado Amendment 89, the Right to Abortion and Health Insurance Coverage Initiative. Voting ""yes"" would both enshrine a right to abortion in the Colorado Constitution and allow the use of public funds for abortion. Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment and would uphold a current constitutional provision that bans the use of public funds for abortion.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, there is no parental/guardian involvement required.

Delaware: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors under 16, a parent/guardian, grandparent, or mental health professional must be notified.

Florida: Abortion is legal up to six weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person counseling from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian must be notified at least 48 hours before and must give permission.

Next month, residents will vote on Florida Amendment 4, the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" would both enshrine a right to abortion in the state Constitution up to fetal viability (or when necessary to protect a pregnant person's health, as determined by their healthcare provider) while maintaining the current law that requires that a parent/guardian be notified if a minor is seeking an abortion. Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive information from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. (They do not have to receive that information in person; it can be mailed to them or read over the phone to them.) For minors, a parent/guardian must be notified.

In September 2024, Georgia Judge Robert C.I. McBurney struck down the prior state law, which prohibited most abortions after six weeks. Georgia's Republican attorney general has already appealed this ruling, though, and the Georgia Supreme Court will likely make the final decision.

Hawaii: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Idaho: Abortion is illegal as of August 25, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life and physical health or for rape and/or incest.

The Idaho Supreme Court ruled in 2023 that there is no constitutional right to an abortion in the state. Since then, two consolidated court cases (Idaho v. United States and Moyle v. United States have argued that healthcare professionals should be able to perform emergency abortions to preserve a pregnant person's physical health - not just save her life. The Supreme Court received this case but dismissed it in June 2024, sending it back to the federal appeals courts for further litigation. Until a decision is made, the exceptions to the abortion ban do currently include preserving the pregnant person's physical health.

In cases of rape and/or incest, an abortion can be legally performed up to 14 weeks but requires a police report or report from child protection services.

There are no exceptions to the ban for fatal fetal anomalies.

Illinois: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Indiana: Abortion is illegal as of September 15, 2022.

In 2023, the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that the state Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion with three exceptions. Abortions can be performed at any time to preserve the life and health of the pregnant person; up to 20 weeks for fatal fetal abnormalities; and up to 12 weeks gestational age for rape and/or incest .

Four residents and the group Hoosier Jews for Choice have argued that abortion is an exercise of religion; banning abortion thus violates Indiana's 2015 religious freedom law. The Indiana Supreme Court is expected to hear the case soon.

Iowa: Abortion is legal up to six weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian or grandparent must be notified at least 48 hours before.

Kansas: Abortion is legal up to 22 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, both parents/guardians (or a singular parent/guardian if that individual has sole custody) must give permission.

Kansas was the first state to vote on abortion rights following Dobbs. In November 2022, its residents rejected the Value Them Both Constitutional Amendment, which would have ruled that there was no right to abortion in the state Constitution, subsequently enacting a near-total ban on abortion. 53% of voters rejected that proposed amendment.

Kentucky: Abortion is illegal as of June 15, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life or physical health (with affirmative defense). There are no exceptions for fatal fetal anomalies or for rape and/or incest.

In November 2022, Kentucky residents rejected Kentucky Constitutional Amendment 2, the No Right to Abortion in Constitution Amendment, which would have amended the state Constitution to say explicitly that it doesn't protect the right to abortion. 52% of voters rejected that proposed amendment.

In February 2023, the Kentucky Supreme Court rejected a request to block the state's abortion ban, ruling that abortion providers lacked the standing to challenge the state's abortion ban. The Kentucky Supreme Court, though, didn't elaborate whether or not the state Constitution secured abortion rights, and abortion remains banned in the state as a result.

In late February 2024, Republican Rep. Ken Fleming of Louisville introduced House Bill 711 that would make abortions legal up to six weeks in cases of rape and/or incest, of fatal fetal anomalies, or of fetuses who died in the womb. No action has been taken on the bill since then.

Louisiana: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life or physical health or in limited cases of fatal fetal anomalies. There are no exceptions for rape and/or incest.

Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment and would oppose allowing the state legislature to enact laws that regulate abortion only after fetal viability.

Montana: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required. In August 2024, Montana's Supreme Court ruled that the law requiring parental/guardian permission for a minor seeking an abortion was unconstitutional.

In 2022, Montana residents rejected Legislative Referendum No. 131 which would've required medical care for ""infants born alive"", such as those born prematurely or those who were born due to a botched abortion. 53% of voters rejected that proposed referendum.

Next month, residents will vote on Montana CI-128, the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" supports amending the Montana Constitution to provide the right to ""make and carry out decisions about one's own pregnancy, including the right to abortion"" and allowing the state to regulate abortion only after fetal viability.

(Credit: KDFW)

An Uber driver was captured on video punching a 68-year-old passenger in the back of the head in Dallas after he complained about a lack of legroom inside his vehicle, a report says.

The incident involving Suleman Gauba unfolded Wednesday in the city's Design District as he and his wife called for an Uber to take them to a local Walmart, according to Fox4 Dallas.

""I cannot sit in the back seat,"" Gauba told the station, which reported that he complained to the driver about not having enough legroom in the rear of the car. ""Very small place, you know?""

Gauba told Fox4 Dallas that the driver then informed him that he was canceling his ride and asked him to get out of the vehicle.

""At that time, my wife told him, 'I'm calling the cops,'"" he said.

Surveillance footage recorded by a hotel in the area then shows Gauba and the rideshare driver stepping out of the car at the same time.

As Gauba begins walking around the rear of the car, the driver punches him in the back of the head.

""I was thinking, you know, what's happened with me? Why [did] he hit me?"" Guaba told Fox4 Dallas.

The Dallas Police Department tells Fox News Digital that a preliminary investigation has found that the victim first ""entered the suspect's vehicle, a ride share driver.

""The victim and suspect got into an argument and the suspect hit the victim in the head,"" police added. ""The suspect left the location.""

As of Saturday, the suspect - who in the footage appears to be a Black male last seen wearing a red shirt and dark pants -- has not been tracked down.

A controversial but effective treatment for meth addiction gains ground,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/05/nx-s1-5140166/meth-cocaine-addiction-treatment-contingency-management,2024-10-05T11:04:00Z,"Bernard Groves has spent five years trying to quit methamphetamine.

He lost his job. He lost his car. He nearly lost his apartment. Worse than that, he says, his addiction has hurt his family.

""I went [to lunch] with my auntie and I saw such sadness in her eyes,"" Groves said.

The 35-year-old checked himself into several rehab programs in San Diego and San Francisco hoping ""to be that Bernard I used to be for the people that I love.""

But each time, Groves felt the progress he made in therapy morphed into people talking at him, telling him what to do. Eventually, he would always return to meth.

""My best friend was like, 'I don't get it, Bernard. You put your mind to something, you've always been able to achieve it. Why can't you get over this meth?' "" Groves said. ""I don't know why. And it feels awful.""

Unlike opioid addiction, there are no FDA-approved medications for the more than 3 million Americans addicted to stimulants like meth and cocaine. Instead, the most effective treatment is low-tech -- and more controversial: Give people retail gift cards usually worth less than $30 in exchange for negative drug tests. Research shows that it works, and after more than three decades of resistance, policymakers are finally giving that strategy a chance.

Offering people small rewards for not using drugs -- known as contingency management -- dates back to the 1980s. Patients are tested for drugs regularly over several months. They receive a gift card for every negative result, and payouts grow with each test.

The treatment is based on a well-established concept that positive reinforcement is an effective motivator. Animals pull levers when rewarded with food. Students' behavior improves by letting them watch TV after class. Compared to traditional counseling, researchers have found people are twice as likely to stop using meth or cocaine if they receive gift cards.

Studies suggest the immediate excitement of getting a gift card after a negative test replaces the dopamine rush people get from using drugs. Scientists hypothesize this activity effectively rewires our brains.

But the approach has failed to catch on in spite of the evidence.

Rick Rawson, a professor emeritus of psychology at UCLA and early proponent of contingency management, says many addiction care providers historically dismissed the treatment as a form of bribery.

""You would hear things like, this isn't treatment, this is just paying people not to use drugs,"" Rawson said. ""It wasn't a medicine. It wasn't talk therapy. It was this sort of transactional thing.""

Concerns of fraud have also stymied contingency management's growth. Rawson persuaded California health officials to fund a pilot program in 2005. But the work stopped abruptly after federal health officials warned participating clinics that the project ran afoul of rules designed to prevent doctors from luring patients into their offices and then charging Medicaid for care they never provided.

""I'd pretty much given up,"" Rawson said after Medicaid shut down the pilot. ""I figured this just isn't going to happen.""

Outside of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has offered contingency management since 2011, the treatment lay dormant for nearly a decade. But attitudes began to shift after the synthetic opioid fentanyl fueled a rise in overdose deaths in the U.S., Rawson said.

""People started to recognize that a lot of these people are buying cocaine or methamphetamine and dying of fentanyl overdoses because fentanyl is mixed into the drug supply,"" said Rawson.

In the last four years, some states have relied on federal grants or court rulings against opioid manufacturers to fund their contingency management programs. In California -- where overdose deaths involving meth have skyrocketed -- health officials asked the federal government to allow the state to become the first in the nation to pay for contingency management with Medicaid dollars.

The Biden administration greenlit the plan along with a broader package of non-traditional health care services California is testing called CalAIM. Under the state's contingency management program, which launched last year, gift cards after each stimulant-free urine test start at $10 and climb up to $26.50. A patient who tests negative every time over six months can earn up to $599, which can be paid out individually or in a lump sum.

It's unclear if that is enough money to persuade people to quit. Most studies show contingency management works best when patients can make upward of $1,000. California picked a lower amount to avoid triggering tax problems for patients or compromising their eligibility for other public benefits like food assistance.

The value of the gift cards have worked for Bernard Groves. He's been off meth since the first week of July, one of his longest stretches since he started trying to shake the habit.

He's used the gift cards to buy exercise weights at Walmart and food for his pet bird London at Petco. He's also used the money to pick up donuts or a movie night with his mom, sister and grandma.

""Being able to treat my family and do things for them is special,"" Groves said. ""It brought some joy back in my life.""

He's surprised at how much pleasure he's gotten from the program.

""Like, how could you say you're excited to pee in a cup? But I was, every week.""

Groves hopes this approach will help him finally kick his meth use. Recent studies have found people are more likely to stay off stimulants for up to a year after these programs, compared to counseling and 12-step programs.

Nearly 4,000 people have participated in California's new program as of September 2024. Researchers at UCLA say at least 75% of urine samples submitted by patients in the program have been negative for stimulants, and clinics say many of their patients have gotten into housing, gone back to work and reconnected with their families.

But California has an estimated 210,000 people on Medicaid who are addicted to meth or cocaine. Medicaid in California generally only covers addiction treatment through specialty addiction clinics, so most people who get their treatment from primary care doctors, community health clinics or hospitals are unable to access contingency management.

Ayesha Appa is an addiction specialist who runs an HIV clinic at San Francisco General Hospital, where most of her patients are homeless, using meth and on Medicaid. She offered contingency management through a private grant until funding ran out in June, and she's ineligible to offer it through CalAIM.

""It feels both incredibly frustrating and just heartbreaking as a provider,"" Appa said, to know a powerful treatment exists that she can't offer. ""It feels like I have a patient living with diabetes, and instead of being able to offer them insulin, all I can do is talk with them about diet and exercise, even though I know there's a better option out there.""

She thinks often of one patient, a 45-year-old woman, who ""desperately wanted to stop using"" meth, but who struggled to quit. Appa urged her to visit a CalAIM clinic to get contingency management treatment, but the woman didn't trust other doctors. Ultimately, the woman overdosed and died.

""What if we could have offered her contingency management in the clinic that she was coming into already?"" Appa said. ""When I think about her, it's an equal mix of guilt and regret because it truly felt like we could have done more.""

California Medicaid Director Tyler Sadwith believes in the power of this treatment, but has taken a careful approach as the state attempts to scale this work because of the stigma contingency management still has among some health providers and lawmakers.

Sadwith said he appreciates that more people could benefit right now, but starting small gives proponents their best chance of convincing state and federal leaders to extend and expand the program beyond its current end date of 2026.

""We need to prove that this works and that this works well,"" Sadwith said. ""We feel the importance and the weight of getting this right"" as the first state in the nation to cover this sort of treatment under Medicaid.

To make sure programs deliver the treatment effectively and minimize the chance of fraud, California requires clinics go through extra training and inspections, and makes clinicians enter their results into a central database. Clinics also have to dedicate three staffers to the program, a workforce requirement that has forced some providers to delay starting the treatment or not participate at all.

So far, state officials have set aside $5.6 million to help clinics stand up their programs, and Sadwith is eager to reach more patients.

""We want to use this opportunity to prove to the public, to the field, to our federal partners, and to other states that this works,"" Sadwith said. ""People get better, and there is a role for contingency management in Medicaid.""

At least three other states -- Montana, Washington and Delaware -- are now running their own programs through Medicaid, and four others are seeking federal approval."
This horror genre is scary as folk - and perfect October viewing,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5138373/folk-horror-movies-the-wicker-man-midsommar-hereditary,2024-10-05T11:01:43Z,"It's October. Some of your neighbors will spend this, the official first weekend of spooky season, going all-out with inflatable yard skeletons and ghosts. They will embark upon the annual attempt to make candy corn, aka high-fructose ear wax, a thing. They'll adorn their front porches with those cotton spider webs that look nothing like real spider webs and instead just make it look like they went and ritually murdered a white sweater so they could hang its dismembered corpse across their doorway as a grisly warning to all other knitwear.

For me, it's a more simple, elemental formula: Hot cider, cider donuts, folk horror.

The appeal of cider and donuts is universal, but folk horror might need some defining. Essentially, it's horror set in remote, isolated areas where nature still holds sway. Well, nature paired with the superstitious beliefs of the locals, who tend to treat unwary outsiders with suspicion (if the outsiders are lucky) or malice (if they're not).

The classic example is 1973's The Wicker Man, in which an uptight, devout, and veddy veddy British policeman (Edward Woodward) visits a remote Scottish island to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. Turns out the locals have embraced a form of Celtic paganism, which doesn't sit right with him. He says as much to the island's aristocratic leader, a mysterious and charismatic sort played by Christopher Lee. Things don't end well for our poor British bobby - though presumably the island will enjoy a bountiful harvest, so, you know: Big picture, it's still a win.

Other founding classics of the genre include 1968's The Witchfinder General and 1971's The Blood on Satan's Claw, which of the three films has the least going for it, apart from its title, which is, all reasonable people can agree, metal AF.

I love me some folk horror, and am never happier than when I can while away a damp, foggy (and thus obligingly atmospheric) October afternoon mainlining new and old examples of the form like Kill List, You Won't Be Alone, Viy, The Ritual, Häxan, The Medium, Apostle, Midsommar, The Witch, Hereditary, Night of the Demon, A Field in England, Robin Redbreast, and Men. (Looking for more examples? Check out the documentary Woodlands Dark and Days Bewitched: A History of Folk Horror.)

Some folk horror involves supernatural elements, but I confess a particular fondness for those stories that don't - stories where it's the folk themselves (read: the locals, and their beliefs) who are the true and only source of the horror. (I won't spoil which of the above films traffic in human vs. supernatural evil, in case you haven't seen them.)

The Wicker Man was the first folk horror film I saw as a kid, which is maybe why I harbor a deep love of folk horror set in '70s Britain, a time and place when an interest in the occult became faddish, inspiring a wave of folk horror specifically inflected with Satanic panic. Many of these films were set in the past, but those like The Wicker Man were set in the then-present, a time when men wore wavy hair and tight bell bottoms. Christopher Lee's Lord Summerisle, for example, sported a kicky tweed leisure suit topped off by a burnt-orange sweater.

It's why I think of this very specific subgenre of '70s folk horror as Talismans and Turtlenecks.

I just came across a new-to-me example of T & T last Sunday afternoon, which was suitably cold and wet and misty: 1970's The Dunwich Horror. A stiff-haired Sandra Dee, desperately attempting to shake her goody-goody image, plays a woman who falls under the sway of a young and hilariously intense, wide-eyed Dean Stockwell. (Seriously, you keep waiting for his character to blink, but instead he just keeps goggling fixedly at the world around him. At one point he makes a pot of tea, staring at it so fiercely through every stage of the process you start to wonder if he's trying to convince it to hop into bed with him.)

Don't get me wrong: It's a cheesy film, filled with crummy dialogue and hammy acting and cheap sets and one fight scene so wildly inept that has to be seen to be disbelieved. I won't reveal if the threat hanging over the film is human or supernatural (though the fact that it's based on an H.P. Lovecraft short story should tip you off). But I will say that Stockwell sports a thick, curly hairdo, a cravat, two count-em two pinky rings, and a huge mustache that curls under itself at either end, in the process effectively turning my guy's mouth into a parenthetical statement.

You can watch it for free, with commercials, on Pluto TV, which I swear is a real streaming service and not something I made up. The Dunwich Horror is not remotely scary, but it does have something to say, I suppose, about the madness of crowds and what, back in grad school, we used to call ""othering."" (The Stockwell character is the scion of an eccentric family that the local community has shunned for generations, you see.)

And that, of course, is the abiding appeal of folk horror: It takes those universal feelings of alienation and isolation that make us all feel like outsiders in our own communities and gives them flesh. When the supernatural is involved, sometimes that flesh pulses and oozes. Sometimes it's furry and clawed.

But whenever the story is about our collective tendency to cling to belief in the supernatural, the flesh involved is all too human, and probably gets stabbed with a sacrificial dagger in the final reel. Happy spooky season, y'all."
A coal power plant demolition serves as a poignant historical moment for the Navajo,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/05/nx-s1-5076973/coal-power-plant-demolition-navajo-new-mexico,2024-10-05T09:04:15Z,"In a small plane flying west out of Farmington, N.M., America's energy transition appeared to be proceeding in an orderly fashion -- a sea change measurable in megawatts, acreage and emission particle parts per million.

Mike Eisenfeld of San Juan Citizens Alliance was our tour guide, his voice crackling over the intercom.

""We're heading toward the San Juan Solar Project,"" he said. ""It's the biggest project going right now, economically.""

Rows and rows of black rectangles planted in bone-dry earth stretched out below us.

Then the plane headed south, where two enormous coal-fired power plants crouched on the landscape.

""At one point San Juan Generating Station and the Four Corners Power Plant, according to Los Alamos National Lab, were the largest source of point-source pollution in the United States,"" Eisenfeld said.

But on this day, the San Juan Generating Station sat dark and inert -- it shut down two years ago. As we flew over the Four Corners Power Plant, puffs of white smoke told us it was still producing energy.

""This is the last coal plant up here,"" Eisenfeld said of Four Corners. ""All the others have been retired. Gone.""

When Eisenfeld first moved to the area nearly 20 years ago, coal mining and coal power were on the rise in northwest New Mexico. Today, several large-scale solar projects are in the works.

He'd scheduled these tours with EcoFlight on Aug. 24 to showcase these big changes but also to witness the demolition of the San Juan Generating Station. That was the day its long, slender smokestacks collapsed into dust.

From the air, the coal and solar power facilities look like pieces like a gameboard. On the ground, the emotional weight of the energy transition is heavy and the complexities are palpable. Public Service Company of New Mexico, signaled years ago that it would decommission San Juan Generating Station; the plant burned its last load of coal in 2022. But the smokestacks are visible from hundreds of miles away. They have been a monumental presence on this landscape since the 1970s, and they've become powerful symbols to the people who live in the region -- especially Navajo people.

The Aug. 24 demolition was a poignant moment in the Navajo Nation's long and complex history with energy development. Over seven decades, coal and the energy made from it have become entwined with the Navajo's cultural beliefs, community life and the Navajo Nation economy.

On the morning of the demolition, employees of Public Utility of New Mexico transported visitors in a passenger van to a dirt lot on site. We drove past the massive concrete block of a building, weaving between heaps of scrap metal slated to be recycled.

There was a whiff of post-apocalypse in the air.

Dozens of contract laborers arrived in trucks and cars to watch the industrial carnage. Elsewhere on site, where former plant employees and local elected officials were gathered, the mood was somber. Still more spectators -- those without an invitation -- parked on the road outside the gates.

For the demolition team, a California contracting company called Integrated Demolition and Remediation, which has demolished dozens of smokestacks at coal power plants all over the U.S., this was business as usual.

""I'm going to do a loud '10, 9, 8, 7, 6,' "" said Rodrigo Roman, an explosives expert with the demolition team. ""Then I'll do a silent, '5, 4, 3, 2, 1.' He's gonna yell, 'Fire in the hole.' You're gonna hear a click. And then it's game on.""

Another member of the crew instructed me to lean back against one of the trucks.

""You're going to feel a shock wave,"" he said. ""It'll push you back a bit.""

Everyone gazed up at the 400 concrete cylinders, bathed in yellow morning sunlight for the last time.

But for at least one Navajo woman, the moment was too heavy to bear.

""I didn't attend the demolition because I'd probably cry,"" Christina Aspaas told me when I met with her in the nearby town of Kirtland, N.M. ""Knowing all that I know of how many jobs lost, the impacts that I'm seeing as a school board member to our district. Going to this demolition? I don't think that would have been good for my whole being.""

Aspaas' family history is embedded in the coal economy here. Her earliest memories of San Juan Generating Station date back to when she was a child.

""It was just some place we dropped my dad off at work,"" she said. ""He was a welder, but he helped build that power plant.""

Grandfathers, uncles and aunts worked at power plants and coal mines across the region, and eventually, Aspaas joined them as a utility worker in one of the mines.

""I worked two jobs before,"" she said. ""Both those checks put together, did not even come near the first check I got as a utility worker. And when they told me how much I was making, I thought I was rich.""

Decades later, she's a journeyman electrician at Navajo Mine and a union member. Her income supports dozens of family members.

""It provided for me and my daughter,"" she said. ""And I'm connected to four different clans and my wealth is not accumulated to myself. When I hear of ceremony or other things going, I help with food, groceries, cash.""

In the span of a decade, thousands of middle-class Navajo people have lost jobs connected to the coal economy; many have moved out of state. When utilities decommissioned the Navajo Generating Station near Page, Ariz., in 2019, the Navajo Nation lost more than $40 million in revenue. New Mexico labor data shows that displaced energy workers are making nearly $30,000 less a year on average since the San Juan power plant closed in 2022.

As a school board member, Aspaas is concerned that in five years, student enrollment has dropped 25% and student homelessness has tripled.

""What industry do we bring in here immediately to make up the tax revenue that's lost?"" she asked.

On the morning of the demolition, Elouise Brown drove more than an hour to park her car outside the gates of the San Juan Generating Station.

""I wanted to witness this with my own eyes,"" she said. ""We've been working on this for a long, long time, and I was very, very excited to see this.

Brown also has memories of the plant from childhood, driving in the car with her grandparents.

""It looked like a huge stove,"" she recalled. ""When my grandma said they burn coal, I was thinking, 'Jeez, how much coal would you burn to make all that smoke come out of those smokestacks?' ""

As an adult, she became concerned about the haze of air pollution all over the reservation.

""It didn't look safe!"" she said. ""How could you have a healthy life if you have a lot of smoke?""

Brown became an anti-coal activist in December 2006, after she learned that former Navajo Nation President Joe Shirley was backing a new coal-fired power plant in the region. The so-called Desert Rock project would have put a third coal plant within a few miles of the other two.

Brown sleuthed around online and discovered that construction was already underway. She drove to the site and started ripping out survey flags. When a semitruck hauling construction materials arrived, she maneuvered her car to block the driver.

""I went off the road, and I went right in front of him,"" she said. ""He had to stop, he had no choice.""

It was the beginning of her journey as an activist.

""He was a huge guy,"" Brown said of the driver. ""He was looking at me and just yelling at me. And I said, 'I don't care what the Navajo Nation president told you. He has no right to do what he did without informing us. So you're not coming through.' ""

Later, Brown blockaded the road with other activists. She picketed in the New Mexico Capitol building in Santa Fe for 60 days straight, and she fought the project until it fizzled in 2009.

""In our Navajo way of life, you don't mess with Mother Earth. You don't mess with the resources inside,"" she said.

For more than 75 years, Navajo people, who call themselves Diné, have forged a complex relationship with coal. Since the 1960s, utilities have burned coal on or near Navajo land, sending electricity to Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, San Diego and Albuquerque.

For some Navajo people, this story is simply a modern kind of colonialism, according to Diné sociologist and historian Andrew Curley.

""How these non-Native communities, especially white communities prey upon Diné people and resources, replicating a pattern of colonial marginalization and dispossession that goes back more than a hundred years,"" Curley said.

Curley's book Carbon Sovereignty explores the Navajo relationship with coal. Many Diné workers he interviewed said their labor in the coal industry was intrinsically and even culturally meaningful.

""[Coal work] became a form of empowerment,"" he said. ""It was a form of identity-building between workers at a site.""

In the 1970s, with the rise of the Red Power movement, Navajo workers and elected officials began to leverage their sovereignty.

""Our tribal leaders started to negotiate royalty rates with extractive companies operating in Indian Country to give more money back to the tribe and give more rights to Diné laborers,"" Curley said.

As coal declines and new resources power the grid, those replacement industries are not supporting Navajo workers the way coal did.

""Oil, gas, solar, wind -- we're not seeing the same type of benefit to workers within any other kind of energy,"" Curley said. ""And they're not getting that social mobility through coal work that we in the social sciences were able to demonstrate existed.""

On the morning of Aug. 24, as the clock ran down, the demolition team shouted out a five-minute warning, then a one-minute warning, followed by the shrill sound of a siren.

For activist Elouise Brown, the demolition was a long time coming.

""I felt chills come down my whole body,"" she said. ""I was telling my family, what a great way to start your morning. What a blessing.""

Coal mine electrician Christina Aspaas watched a video of the implosion later that day on social media.

""It just brought back memories,"" she said, as she wiped away tears. ""My childhood, my dad, my mom.""

Aspaas posted a few words online to honor the generations of Navajo workers who have labored in coal.

""We took them for granted,"" she said. ""I just wanted them to know that I remember you.""

The detonation and shock wave pushed spectators backward, and then, in slow motion, the columns seemed to fall, concrete dissolving into air.

It takes less than a minute to demolish smokestacks.

It will take years, maybe decades, for Navajo communities to come to terms with what they've gained and what's been lost."
Rachel Morin's mom comes face-to-face with illegal immigrant murder suspect for first time in court,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/rachel-morins-mom-comes-face-to-face-illegal-immigrant-murder-suspect-first-time-court,2024-10-05T08:12:13Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The mother of a Maryland jogger who prosecutors say died at the hands of an illegal immigrant with a long history of attacks on women and girls came face-to-face with the suspected killer for the first time in court Friday.

Victor Antonio Martinez-Hernandez, 23, is accused of abducting and brutally assaulting Rachel Morin, a 37-year-old mother of five, on a running trail near her home before hiding her body in a culvert.

Martinez-Hernandez, wearing a striped jail jumpsuit, handcuffs and shackles, leaned into a Spanish-language interpreter throughout the proceedings, according to Randolph Rice, the lawyer for Morin's family. It was his first in-person court appearance after attending the others virtually.

RACHEL MORIN'S MOM CALLS OUT BIDEN-HARRIS FOR IGNORING FAMILY AFTER MIGRANT MURDER

""Seeing Victor Antonio Martinez-Hernandez enter the courtroom with a flat, emotionless expression only deepens the anguish felt by Rachel Morin's family,"" Rice told Fox News Digital. ""This is the man accused of taking Rachel's life in such a brutal and horrific manner, yet his demeanor suggests no remorse.""

He avoided eye contact with the grieving mother, Patty, other members of the family and even prosecutors.

""It's infuriating to think that if our borders had been properly secured or the DNA Fingerprint Act had been followed, this family would not be enduring this nightmare,"" Rice added. ""This tragedy was preventable, and today's court appearance is a painful reminder to America of the failures in our current immigration system that allowed this individual to remain undetected until it was too late.""

The murder suspect's arrival ""brought an overwhelming sense of grief and sadness to Patty Morin,"" who teared up as he took his place at the defense table, Rice said.

BIDEN-HARRIS OPEN BORDER POLICY FREED ILLEGAL 3 WEEKS BEFORE JOCELYN NUNGARAY MURDER, MOTHER SAYS

Martinez-Hernandez revealed in court he dropped out of school after seventh grade. When he first arrived in the U.S. illegally in 2023, he was already suspected of killing a woman in his home country of El Salvador.

Before making his way to Maryland, the border ""gotaway"" allegedly raped a California mother and her 9-year-old daughter in their home.

Martinez-Hernandez waived his right to a speedy trial and also waived a potential conflict of interest that arose due to Morin's boyfriend having once been represented by the same public defender's office.

TRUMP MEETS WITH RACHEL MORIN FAMILY AT BORDER

""Today's postponement was not unexpected. We've been preparing the family for a lengthy legal process,"" Rice said. ""The family is strong and taking this in stride, knowing that justice will take time. We remain committed to ensuring that Rachel's memory is honored and justice is served.""

After the waiver, the judge set a series of new hearing dates -- a motions hearing for Jan. 31, 2025, a pretrial conference on March 31 and a new trial date for April 1. It is expected to last two weeks.

Patty Morin traveled to Capitol Hill last month in a bid to get lawmakers to take the border crisis more seriously.

Morin told the House Judiciary Committee that if routine protocols had been followed -- like taking a DNA swab and a photo of Martinez-Hernandez when he was stopped at the border -- her daughter could still be alive.

Interpol already had a warrant for his arrest when he came to the U.S.

""I realize some of you are disinterested in this because you just think it's a partisan thing, but these are American people,"" Morin told lawmakers at the hearing. ""We need to close the borders. ... These people that are coming over the border, if they're coming over illegally, it's because they have something to hide.""

""What I would really like to come across is that I really want the American people, members of Congress, senators, presidents ... I want everyone to actually listen to our voices, listen to our words, listen to what we have to say and take it to heart,"" Morin told Fox News Digital later.

""It's hard to verbalize the message to them because they already have the mindset that this is a political thing, that you're either for immigration or you're against immigration. I don't think Americans are against immigration if it's done correctly."""
Ohio woman's viral videos about rug buried in her yard led to search for potential body,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/ohio-womans-viral-videos-about-rug-buried-her-yard-led-search-potential-body,2024-10-05T06:43:02Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

An Ohio woman shared videos on her TikTok account in which she was concerned that a body may have been buried in her yard, resulting in a police investigation of her property.

Katie Santry first shared a video early in the week that showed her and her family digging up a rug buried in the yard at their home in Columbus, and she made subsequent videos updating her followers on the situation, including that she called police to her home.

The videos racked up millions of views, and many people in her comments speculated why a rug would be buried in her yard.

Columbus Police responded to the property later in the week to investigate, but did not locate a body, according to Fox 59.

OHIO 'DANGEROUS' CHEMICAL SPILL CAUSED BY OPEN VALVE ON TRAIN CAR LEADS TO EMERGENCY EVACUATION

Santry described the events in a TikTok video as ""the most absurd, insane experience of my life.""

The investigation, which featured K-9 units and an excavation, concluded on Friday afternoon, and police collected pieces of the rug buried in the yard.

""The pieces all tested negative for human or animal remains and, at this time, there are no plans for further testing,"" police said.

An officer said it is common when homes are built for people to bury items instead of moving them to save effort. The officer said K-9 units are not always correct, but when they alert them to a spot, police have to dig to confirm if something is there.

It is also possible someone had suffered something as small as a nosebleed years ago that the dogs picked up on, an officer said.

Santry, in multiple videos, detailed her first phone call to the police. Officers who came to her home said at that time they did not plan to investigate any further.

""The entire world was telling me to have the police come,"" Santry said. ""When I called the police and asked them, 'Hey, do you want to come to my house to look at a rug?' I felt insane.""

In a video posted Thursday, Santry said homicide detectives called her and said they would be sending out investigators with cadaver dogs. She said in a video later that day that two different cadaver dogs on two separate attempts sat at the hole."
'It all added up': Daily Mail reporter details allegations against second gentleman,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/it-all-added-up-daily-mail-reporter-details-allegations-against-second-gentleman,2024-10-05T02:12:00Z,"The Daily Mail senior reporter Josh Boswell outlines his process of investigation on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'

Second gentleman Doug Emhoff's representative called a Daily Mail report detailing three unnamed sources who accused him of having slapped a former girlfriend during a 2012 trip to the Cannes Film Festival ""untrue.""

Fox News Digital has not been able to independently confirm the allegations.

""This report is untrue,"" an unnamed representative for Vice President Kamala Harris' husband told news outlet Semafor. ""Any suggestion that he would or has ever hit a woman is false.""

Daily Mail reporter Josh Boswell appeared on ""Jesse Watters Primetime"" and outlined the claims that Emhoff slapped his then-girlfriend in 2012.

""The process that I went through was extremely thorough and careful about this, because you're right, we're on the eve of an election, but the thing that made these sources come forward is not because there's an election, but because the Kamala Harris campaign was using Doug Emhoff, showing him as this feminist ally, baking up his credentials as an ally to women and that just enraged them,"" Boswell said.

""I quoted one of them in the piece saying this, that she thought that it was disgusting, that they were portraying him this way, when in fact, these friends knew what had really happened.""

TRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: 'INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED'

The woman who was allegedly slapped is described by the Daily Mail as a successful New York attorney and is identified only by the pseudonym ""Jane.""

The incident was alleged to have occurred in 2012 while Emhoff and Jane were in a valet line at a Cannes Film Festival in Nice, France.

""Jane got into a cab. The valet, either with €100 that she slipped him or the fact that there was this domestic dispute going on apparently, ushered her into a car, but then Doug forced his way in too,"" Boswell recalled the alleged story. ""That's what the friends told me. That's when she got really scared. Jane called her male friend who was in New York at the time. So, it was kind of bedtime for him, but he took this call, and she told him what had happened. The next day she questioned Doug about it, and he seemed to be completely nonchalant about it. He used some tennis metaphor because he's into tennis. So, Jane slapped him back when he slapped her, and she slapped him back twice like this, one with each hand. Doug said, 'You got one down the line and across the court. So, it's no big deal.' That's all he had to say about it, and so Jane, of course, immediately broke up with him and never saw him again. They left. They went home separately. ""

The allegation was made to the Daily Mail by three people who described themselves as Jane's friends and who shared their recollections of the incident, along with travel itineraries and correspondence between Jane and Emhoff to corroborate the story. All three requested anonymity out of fear of potential retaliation from Emhoff.

""Those sources were each independently talking to us and their accounts closely corroborated each other,"" Boswell said. ""So, that's part of what gave me the confidence in this story. ""

One friend said Jane told her about the alleged incident at the time.

""He hauled up and slapped her so hard she spun around,"" the source is quoted as saying. ""She said she was in utter shock. She was so furious, she slapped him on one side, and then on the other cheek with the other hand.""

Another friend -- described by the Daily Mail as a New York businessman -- also gave his recollection of the alleged slap.

""It was very clear what she was telling me,"" that source said, according to the Daily Mail. ""She said she was with a guy, her date, she was at the Cannes Film Festival, and he hit her. She was in the car with the guy at the time.""

A third friend, described as a female executive, told the Daily Mail that she learned of the alleged incident in 2014, and purportedly found out new details from Jane in 2018, when Harris, then a senator from California, made headlines with her questioning of a Supreme Court nominee who had been accused of sexual assault.

The third source said that she had asked Jane if Emhoff had ever apologized and was told that he had not, but that ""he commented about the hit she gave him. It was a tennis metaphor. But no apology at all.""

According to the Daily Mail's sources, Jane and Emhoff had been dating for about three months before the reported trip to France. Emhoff allegedly cut the trip off early and returned to LA for his daughter's 13th birthday.

""Documents were very important,"" Boswell said. ""They helped prove that firstly, the relationship, you know, we've got this photograph of them together. We had other material like that. Then, the email actually references the fact that Doug had to leave early because he had to get back to L.A. in time for his daughter's birthday. Her birthday is May 29th. Their flight was scheduled to leave on May 29th. So, you can see that matched up. We got the flight details, and you can see they took a layover flight to take them to Nice. It all added up with what each of the sources were saying. Those sources were each independently talking to us and their accounts closely corroborated each other. So, that's part of what gave me the confidence in this story.""

Emhoff was married to his first wife from 1992 to 2009. The marriage ended following his affair with their children's nanny, who he got pregnant. Emhoff met now-Vice President Kamala Harris in 2013 when she was serving as California attorney general, and they were married in 2014.

The Harris campaign, the Office of the Vice President and a representative for Emhoff's ex-wife, Kerstin Emhoff, did not comment despite repeated requests from Fox News."

Minutes later, after the flight landed, an officer arrived and passengers were asked if any of them had seen him assault her. He began taking statements from those who said they'd seen the attack.

The alleged aggressor and the woman were escorted off the plane, according to the New York Post.

Will Ferrell regrets awkward Texas restaurant visit after co-star booed for trans rights toast,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/ferrell-regrets-awkward-texas-restaurant-visit-after-co-star-booed-trans-rights-toast,2024-10-05T00:09:44Z,"Will Ferrell joked that his look for the 2024 Critics Choice Awards red carpet came from Sears.

Actor Will Ferrell said he regrets his visit to a Texas restaurant after his trans co-star, Harper Steele, received an awkward response from diners.

It happened while Ferrell and Steele, a former ""Saturday Night Live"" head writer, were filming their new Netflix documentary, ""Will & Harper,"" which follows their 17-day road trip across the country ""to bond and reintroduce Harper to the country as her true self"" after Steele came out as transgender in 2022.

They received what they described as an unexpected and uncomfortable response from diners at a Texas restaurant after Steele mentioned the state hadn't done enough for trans rights, the New York Times reported.

""I'm from Iowa, but I will raise a glass to your great state of Texas,"" Steele said to a receptive audience of diners at the Big Texan Steak Ranch in Amarillo, where Ferrell and Steele planned to attempt the restaurant's famous 72-ounce steak challenge.

""I wish you guys would do more for trans rights in this state,"" Steele added, which silenced the cheers and was met with a few groans from the audience, Chron reported.

""Cheers to Texas and trans rights, right?"" Ferrell added. The toast didn't make it into the documentary, but Steele and Ferrell shared their responses to the moment afterward.

""The room started to feel very wrong to me,"" Steele said in the film. ""I was feeling a little like my transness was on display, I guess, and suddenly that sort of made me feel not great.""

""The saddest part for me is ... I just feel ... I feel like I let you down in that moment,"" Ferrell said in response.

""I didn't really have a grasp on how intense it was going to be and felt responsible for not properly vetting the situation we were putting ourselves in,"" Ferrell told The New York Times. ""That felt like it was going to be this benign place where you eat a big steak in the amount of time, and then you walk in and it's a thousand people seated in this room and I was like, 'Oh, why are we here?'""

Steele described the feeling of being ""on display"" in that moment.

""We gave a little toast, and I said something about passing a trans bill, and the room did a kind of reversal and a little bit of a boo and a woman shouted out, 'We still love you.' I hate the phrase,"" Steele said. ""I could be misinterpreting this woman completely, but this is the feeling I had in the room: The 'still' is conditional. You still love me when I finally give up being trans and give my life over to Christ. They still love me even though I'm some kind of sinner or something. I felt that.""

'SUCCESSION' STAR BRIAN COX DISMISSES WOKE 'SHAMING' CULTURE: 'USUALLY A BUNCH OF MILLENNIALS'

""I wished I'd walked in and said: 'No. This is going to be terrible. Let's just go,'"" Ferrell said in response. ""I was feeling that remorse and guilt of even going there.""

Steele had previously criticized the New York Times in an interview with The Independent as ""generally left-leaning, but also sometimes very anti-trans. It's odd...""

""It's why I first tend to ask reporters who interview me if they believe in me,"" Steele added in that interview. ""Do they believe that I exist? That I'm valid? Because that's not always part of the conversation. I like to start there. Because there are many people in the liberal community who can't seem to get their heads around it for one reason or another.""

CANCEL CULTURE: DAVE CHAPPELLE AND OTHER COMEDIANS WHO HAVE TAKEN SIDES

Ferrell also said that ""transphobia"" comes from people ""not being confident"" in themselves.

""There is hatred out there,"" Ferrell told The Independent. ""It's very real, and it's very unsafe for trans people in certain situations.""

""It's so strange to me, because Harper is finally... her,"" he added. ""She's finally who she was always meant to be. Whether or not you can ultimately wrap your head around that, why would you care if somebody's happy? Why is that threatening to you? If the trans community is a threat to you, I think it stems from not being confident or safe with yourself.""

"Georgia mom, newborn twins killed sheltering from Hurricane Helene; twins are likely storm's youngest victims",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/georgia-mom-twin-newborns-killed-sheltering-from-hurricane-helene-twins-likely-storms-youngest-victims,2024-10-04T22:49:41Z,"Annie Meadows, whose uncle Bruce Tipton was swept away by floodwaters from Hurricane Helene, tells 'Fox & Friends First' about the catastrophic conditions that devastated communities.

A Georgia woman died alongside her twin newborn boys while hunkering down for their safety as Hurricane Helene ripped through their rural town.

Obie WIlliams discovered his daughter, Kobe Williams, 27, and her sons, Khyzier and Khazmir, after a tree fell on top of their trailer in Thompson, 120 miles east of Atlanta, causing her to fall on top of the children.

Williams said he received a call from his daughter last week as Helene battered the area. She heeded his advice and sheltered in the bathroom with her month-old babies until the storm passed. When she stopped answering her family's phone calls, Williams dodged power lines and downed trees to check on her and the boys.

""I'd seen pictures when they were born and pictures every day since, but I hadn't made it out there yet to meet them,"" Williams told The Associated Press, days after the storm ravaged eastern Georgia. ""Now I'll never get to meet my grandsons. It's devastating.""

Williams' grandsons were born Aug. 20 and are the youngest known victims of Helene, which has claimed the lives of at least 230 people throughout the Southeast.

The death toll is expected to rise as search and rescue continues to comb through new areas.

Williams described his daughter as a lovable, outgoing and strong young woman who always had a smile on her face and loved to make people laugh. She was studying to be a nursing assistant but had taken time off from school to give birth to her sons.

""That was my baby,"" he said. ""And everybody loved her.""

Williams, who lives in Augusta, said many of his 14 other children are still without power in their homes across Georgia. Some have sought refuge in Atlanta, and others have traveled to Augusta to see their father and mourn together.

What's The Hubbub About Racism Around The WNBA?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanmshaw/2024/10/04/whats-the-hubbub-about-racism-around-the-wnba/,2024-10-04T21:01:53Z,"If you pay attention to sports news at all, you've probably heard the recent outcry about the racist comments, posts, and treatment that's been aimed at many of the WNBA's top Black players this season. You may wonder how a league that's prided itself on its commitment to diversity has ended up here, but as someone who studies intersections between gender, race, and sports, I'm not terribly surprised.

The league has been growing in popularity and attendance the past few years, but most of its fan based until very recently has been longtime, diehard women's basketball fans. As the league's visibility grew, so did media attention and sponsorships, especially for white players.

In 2022, Las Vegas Aces star Kelsey Plum pointed out how white players received preferential treatment. Meanwhile unanimous 2024 Most Valuable Player A'ja Wilson of the Aces tried to compliment Plum and UConn player Paige Bueckers earlier this year by noting their awareness of their privilege as white women. The recently resurfaced video has generated a load of hate toward Wilson, accusing her of downplaying achievements in favor of race and attacking her for turning to ""victimhood."" In reality, Wilson was, as she explained later, just saying they were good allies.

Much of the current uptick in overt racism has come with Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark's entry into the WNBA. Clark, who is white, was the league's most touted player coming out of college. The racism toward Clark's competitors started then as Clark and LSU's Angel Reese, who is Black, faced off in NCAA tournaments. What both Clark and Reese saw as intense and entirely appropriate competition and trash-talking became promoted on social media by racist fans as Reese's ""thug"" behavior. This approach to seeing Clark play against other Black players has continued into the WNBA as Clark's presence has grown the league's fanbase, creating sellout crowds and record-breaking attendance wherever Clark plays.

As retired Seattle Storm superstar Sue Bird pointed out recently, racism isn't new to the WNBA, but it has become much more blatant and threatening. Bird suggests racists have used Caitlin Clark as a pawn, and that's become a distraction from talking about the great basketball woman are playing. By pitting Clark against Black players and relying on traditional racist tropes, racist fans have created a narrative of Clark as somehow targeted and persecuted by Black players and a ""woke"" white league. Clark herself repudiates this narrative, but racists aren't listening.

What has happened to Black players has been a litany of name-calling and threats, to the point that some teams have had to increase security.

Connecticut Suns star Alyssa Thomas commented after her team eliminated the Fever from the 2024 playoffs, ""I think that in my 11-year career I never experienced the racial comments like from the Indiana Fever fan base.""

A'ja Wilson said that many days she hated being herself because of all the racist cruelty hurled her way.

To understand how Clark got pitted against Black players in the league and how racists have used their rivalry as an excuse for racist behavior toward Black players, we have to understand how certain process of racism work.

In societies that are hierarchical and binary (divide people into two groups such as white and Black, gay and straight, women and men), the group that is dominant is ""unmarked."" What that means is that the dominant group's characteristics are the society's norm, to the extent that these characteristics are practically invisible because they are assumed to be inherent and natural.

So, for example, men are an unmarked category. Women, then, are a ""marked"" category. In other words, they are defined primarily by their inclusion in the category, and we interpret their behaviors as a characteristic of the category. We have the National Basketball Association (notice how men are unmarked) and the Women's National Basketball Association (notice how women are marked). We have the PGA and the LPGA. We don't have to say the Men's NBS or the Men's PGA. We assume these are for men. We have to say WNBA and LPGA to distinguish that these are for women.

Certain behaviors become attributed to marked and unmarked categories. In terms of race, we call this process racialization, or the attributing of characteristics to race.

For example, Suns' guard Marina Mabrey is a very physical and aggressive player. When we see her throw a shoulder into an opposing player or knock an opposing player to the ground, our first thought isn't ""thug."" But when Angel Reese or Alyssa Thomas do the exact same behaviors, many white people do think, ""thug."" ""Thug"" is a word that has become racialized. Many white people apply that word in derogatory ways to behaviors by Black players but not white players, and, in fact, when many white people hear the word ""thug"" in any context, the image that first comes to mind is a Black person.

So, when racists saw Clark and Reese trash-talking or when they saw Black players and Clark playing each other aggressively, they did not see two basketball players doing the same thing. They saw a ""thug"" victimizing a white woman. Notice how these same people are not bothered by rough play by Black players against other Black players.

These racists were then able to spin a narrative about how Black players were picking on Clark, relying on all the racist stereotypes of Black people as dangerous, violent, and treacherous. That narrative then, to them, justified their name-calling and threats as a way to defend Clark's virtue and put ""uppity"" Black players back ""in their place.""

All white people can fall into the trap of seeing Black players through these racialized lenses if we're not attentive to how our own subconscious ideas of race have been shaped by white supremacy. Even if we're not overt racists who would ever engage in name-calling, we might, without even realizing it, judge Black players' behavior differently than white players or like Clark better than Reese because she's a ""cleaner"" player and not a ""dirty player"" like Reese. Notice how even those notions of ""clean"" and ""dirty"" draw on longstanding racist notions of Blackness. Racism doesn't have to be over to be racism.

Having used Clark, as Bird suggests, racists have heightened overt acts of racism in the WNBA. They've done harm to individual Black players, and they've tried to implicate Clark in their racism even as she rejects their framing of her rivals. In fact, Clark calls racists ""trolls"" not ""fans.""

These racist trolls have also taken the focus off women's basketball. We may not be talking about how pretty players are or aren't anymore or how feminine they look even though they're physical and strong. But we're still not talking about basketball, about their amazing shots or they're impenetrable defenses or their brilliant teamwork.

Bird laments that players aren't valued for their play. That's not surprising either. After all, in our society, they are women first. And, if they're Black, they're at even greater risk for mistreatment at the intersection of race and gender.

In one of their playoff games, the Suns' Dijonai Carrington hit Clark in the face leaving her with a black eye. Later, a USA Today reporter asked Carrington if she did it on purpose. Carrington responded, ""I don't even know why I would intend to hit anybody in the eye. That doesn't even make sense to me . . . I didn't know I hit her, actually. I was trying to make a play on the ball and I guess I followed through and I hit her, so obviously it's never intentional. That's not even the type of player I am.""

Many of the Fever's white fans didn't believe her. The hate was immediate and ugly. Carrington shared one vile post that used racist and sexist epithets and added, ""I hope someone rapes you and cuts your head off.""

The WNBA issued its own response on social media, decrying the abuse of its players. Yet when league commissioner Cathy Englebert had a chance to speak out against racism, she bungled her response, moving instead into talking about rivalry and financial benefits.

The WNBA has to do better defending and protecting its players and being proactive in educating fans. White fans also need to speak out and speak to other white fans about racism, whether it's subtle or overt. Maybe then we can finally start to talk about basketball."
Doja Cat Takes On Claymation In A New Chapter Of Artistic Expression,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kennethjwilliamsjr/2024/10/04/doja-cat-takes-on-claymation-in-a-new-chapter-of-artistic-expression/,2024-10-04T21:01:46Z,"Doja Cat may be one of the fiercest musicians with the discography and live performances to match, but more than that, she's an innovator. The entertainer's ability to write chart-topping hits while transforming them into visual masterpieces is an art form in itself. The rapper's affinity for visual storytelling is something she's leaning into alongside Brisk Iced Tea as part of the revival of its iconic claymation ads. As the first woman artist to be transformed into a clay state for the brand, this was the artist's first stint with claymation as well.

""I had full creative control over my character's clothing and found that intriguing. It's been a fun, creative process getting into that part of it. I have no experience with claymation or anything like that, but they were pretty quick and understood what I wanted, and the process was fairly smooth in the beginning. I was just very interested in seeing myself in that form and having the opportunity to voice act for the first time in my career, so that was an honor and a very exciting opportunity.""

Doja Cat's career continues to be a foundation in which self-expression is directly linked to her artistry. The musician feels that this campaign aligns with that due to its message of standing up for oneself.

""When you watch the commercial we've been putting together, it's about looking out for yourself and standing up for yourself. I noticed in the commercial that I asked for a sip of this tea, and then I kind of demanded it by magically summoning the forest. I think that is the poetry behind it: discovering the magic you have inside of you to achieve the things you wish for and the things that make you feel whole.""

Regarding the campaign itself, the Grammy-award-winning artist hopes her fans learn more about her and draw inspiration from it.

""I hope that it inspires the youth. I hope my fans can understand where I'm coming from and where I stand and maybe take a piece of that with them. I think it's important to express yourself, but sometimes people get caught up in the monotony and rigidity of adulthood and life. It's important to embrace the inner child and the creative aspect of your life in any way you can. It doesn't have to be as profound as picking up a guitar and learning to play it in five minutes. It doesn't have to be so demanding creatively. It's the little things that stimulate your brain in a way that doesn't make you feel like a hamster on a wheel.""

As the multihyphenate expands her portfolio of passion-driven projects, she assures that her future work will continue to align with her creatively and spiritually.

""I'm definitely interested in doing more projects in the future that involve acting and voiceover work. Choosing what fits right with my spirit is important, but those opportunities don't usually come that easily. I'm more artistically driven in a direction where I can be a little picky. I can be a bit picky with what I want to do, and I want to make the right decisions creatively. So it has to really be true. And I think I found that with Brisk, and that's something I'm definitely interested in in the future."""
Renegade Game Studios Welcomes Night Vale To Tabletop Gaming,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robwieland/2024/10/04/renegade-game-studios-welcomes-night-vale-to-tabletop-gaming/,2024-10-04T20:54:03Z,"Spooky radio dramas have a long history of influencing pop culture. Shows like The Shadow featured a main character who used fear as a weapon to scare criminals into confessing or giving up. Modern shows like Evil or Interview With The Vampire can trace their lineage back to Lights Out and Inner Sanctum

Welcome To Night Vale revitalized the form in 2012 with a potent mix of surreal imagery and dark, absurd humor. Fans fell in love with the weird tales coming out of the small desert town and helped turn it into a pop culture sensation. The show is a foundational aspect of the narrative podcast genre and has become a brand that tours the world and sells merchandise to fans.

Renegade Game Studios is crowdfunding a new chapter in Night Vale's pop culture influence. Welcome To Night Vale: The Roleplaying Game hope to bring players together to tell their own strange stories about The Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home while also never, ever mentioning the Dog Park. The company gave me an advanced look at the game for this article.

The first book in the boxed set is The Citizen's Guide which illustrates how Renegade's Essence20 Roleplaying System was adapted for this setting. As the podcast is about exploring the mysteries surrounding the town, the game focuses on investigation over combat. Players can take on the roles of their favorite characters or create new citizens to get wrapped up in the strange goings on.

Game Masters will enjoy The Host's Guide thanks to its advice on how to tell stories that feel like the ones on the podcasy. It also has good general advice together such as how to run a fulfilling Session Zero that maks every one excited to play. The book finishes up with game mehcanics for some of the famous residents of Night Vale that can be used as allies, rivals or enemies in the stories told by the game.

The Visitor's Guide highlights many of the weird, memorable locations in and around the town. Fans will love the details on their favorite places and organizations, while players and Game Masters will find a lot of inspiration for their stories here. There are event ads, tickets and coupons that could get printed out and used as props in the pages of this book.

I won't get into too many spoilers for The Skeleton Gorge Incident, which is the full adventures included in the boxed set to kick off a campaign. It lets players interact with some of the most famous parts of the setting...even if that interaction might put them in mortal danger. The story gives fans a chance to experience one of the most dangerous jobs in the world: an internship at Night Vale Community Radio.

I really like how self contained this boxed set feels. This seems like it could be the perfect gift for someone that loves the show regardless of whether or not they are already into RPGs. It also is a great way to get Dungeons & Dragons players to branch out and try something different.

I like who quickly the boxed set moves to get players in the game. There are 11 pre-generated characters that are built to get into The Skeleton Gorge Incident quickly. While building your own character is fun and deeply rewarding, something picking up a character and making it your own is just as satisfying.

The materials were written by folks who have a clear passion for the show. Finding the balance between important game information and interesting media tie-in trivia can be tricky. The creators have nailed that here as I enjoyed reading it as a potential Host and as someone who enjoys the show.

Welcome To Night Vale: The Roleplaying Game is on BackerKit through October 30th, 2024. Backers get priority access to the game before it hits retailers as well as art prints and other Backerkit exclusives. The game is slated for a May 2025 release."
"TikTok User Goes Viral For Finding Buried Rug In Her Yard, Sparking Police Investigation -- But No Body Was Found",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/10/04/tiktok-user-goes-viral-for-finding-buried-rug-in-her-yard-sparking-police-investigation-but-no-body-was-found/,2024-10-04T20:29:03Z,"Columbus, Ohio resident Katie Santry posted a viral series of TikToks this week documenting how she found a rolled-up rug buried several feet below the ground in her backyard, prompting thousands of users to encourage her to try and dig it up and urge police to investigate -- though police said Friday afternoon there was no body found in the rug.

Santry said in a TikTok over the weekend she thinks her house is haunted, stating she woke up in the morning and found her home office disorganized and her laptop broken, around the same time she found a rug buried underground in her yard while she and her husband were building a fence. At the behest of TikTok users, Santry called the police about the rug, who initially dismissed the situation. She posted another video days later stating police called her back, telling her they had heard about her situation, and wanted to send more officers to investigate. Santry said the police would send cadaver dogs, and if the dogs seemed to detect something, the police would dig up the rug, but would otherwise leave it. Santry livestreamed their investigation and later posted a TikTok video of two different cadaver dogs sniffing the scene, both ultimately sitting at the hole she had dug containing the rug. After both dogs sat down, Santry audibly gasped. She said later in her video police told her the dogs sitting by the hole doesn't necessarily mean there's a body buried there and could instead indicate something else, like traces of blood. Police sent excavators to dig up the rug the following morning.

How Santry's laptop broke. Now that Santry knows there isn't a body buried in her backyard, that's her main question, she said in her Friday afternoon TikTok.

Santry's series on TikTok, which contains more than 30 parts, garnered millions of views per video, the latest example of TikTok users' appetite for longform, multi-part series. Other lengthy series have captivated users in recent months, like Tareasa Johnson's 50-part ""Who TF Did I Marry?"" series, which recently landed a television adaptation, and social media influencer Brooke Schofield's 14-part series about her breakup. Santry compared her situation throughout her video series to a true crime documentary. Thousands of users commented on each of Santry's videos, offering advice and creating their own theories -- with many trying to explain why the cadaver dogs stopped by the hole if there was no body.

Newly revealed emails show senior military officials raised concerns with the White House within days of Israel commencing its operation in Gaza.

Reuters obtained and examined emails between senior State Department and Pentagon officials between Oct. 11-14 that showed concern and alarm as Israel started hitting the Gaza Strip with missile strikes.

The emails specifically focused on the mass evacuation of Palestinians as a potential legal issue. Dana Stroul, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East at the time, wrote to senior Biden aides Oct. 13 and warned that Israel could face war crime charges for its actions.

The emails also include pressure to include messages of sympathy for the Palestinian people and to allow more aid into Gaza while seeking to remain in solidarity with Israel.

ISRAELI MILITARY KILLS 250 HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS SINCE START OF LIMITED GROUND OPERATION IN LEBANON

Israel's invasion of Gaza has proven polarizing and painful for the Democrats. The progressive wing and younger voters are trying to hold the Biden administration to account for its support of Israel as tens of thousands of Palestinians die.

The invasion also made it difficult -- if not impossible -- for aid groups to help the displaced residents of Gaza who fled their homes to avoid getting caught up in Israel's operations.

Stroul outright alleged that Israel could be ""close to committing war crimes"" after the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) dropped leaflets over northern Gaza urging residents to flee their homes ahead of the military rolling into the territory as part of the early ""targeted incursions.""

""Their main line is that it is impossible for one million civilians to move this fast,"" Stroul wrote. One official said that such an operation was not possible without creating a ""humanitarian catastrophe.""

Three senior U.S. officials argued the White House was slow to address these problems, with Biden's team at one point arguing that the U.S. was ""leading international efforts to get humanitarian aid into Gaza,"" which would remain a ""top priority.""

Bill Russo, at the time an assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of Global Public Affairs, attempted to drive home the long-term impact of the U.S.'s ""lack of response on the humanitarian conditions"" in Gaza, calling it ""ineffective and counterproductive"" while also harming relations with Arab nations.

""If this course is not quickly reversed by not only messaging, but action, it risks damaging our stance in the region for years to come,"" Russo wrote in one email, according to Reuters. A colleague forwarded his emails to White House officials and warned that ""otherwise would-be stalwart"" Arab partners might think twice about relations with the U.S.

YAZIDI WOMAN HELD HOSTAGE FOR 10 YEARS IN GAZA RESCUED IN ISRAEL, US OPERATION

Russo eventually resigned from his post in March 2024, citing personal reasons for his decision.

Far-left voters have placed the fate of Gaza front and center of their concerns approaching November's election. The voters of Michigan started an ""uncommitted"" protest vote during the Democratic primary as a means of venting frustration at the Biden administration's handling of the crisis.

Those same voters shredded Harris for her DNC speech in August, calling it ""horrible"" and accusing Harris of ""downplaying"" U.S. complicity in the Gaza invasion by providing Israel funding and weapons.

ou're forgiven if you missed it amid the barrage of news about escalating violence in the Middle East, the vice presidential debate, the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Helene and a historic dockworker strike that could have had significant economic implications, but this week marked the release of the annual Forbes 400 list, the definitive ranking of the richest of the rich in the U.S.

As my colleagues on the wealth team note, America's 400 richest individuals are ""having a rollicking time in the roaring 2020s; in all, they are worth a record $5.4 trillion, up nearly $1 trillion from last year."" And while the gender wealth gap among this cohort remains wide -- there are only 67 women among these 400 people -- it is narrowing, at least a little. Women now account for 17% of the list, up from 15% last year, and they hold 15% of the 400's total wealth, up from 14% in 2023. They are worth a combined $839 billion, up from the $621 billion that the 60 women on last year's list held.

The richest woman on the 400 is Alice Walton, a spot she's held for nine out of the last ten years. What IS new and notable about Walton is her charitable giving. According to a recently-released tax return -- which showed that her foundation distributed $390 million in the year ending on September 30, 2023 -- Walton reported her largest known philanthropic gift to date, $249 million in funding for a new medical school to be built in her name. This medical school is still seeking accreditation, but if all goes to plan, the school will open in 2025 and welcome an inaugural class of 48 students.

Cheers!

Mrs. Trump's response to all of this -- she ignores all but the most egregious attacks -- is not surprising to those who truly know her as a woman of tremendous strength, grace and resilience, a loving and devoted mother, wife, daughter and friend.

MELANIA TRUMP OPENS UP ON RELATIONSHIP WITH HUSBAND, WHAT PREPARED HER TO BECOME FIRST LADY

Their vitriol is only likely to reach a more fevered pitch in coming days, ahead of the Oct. 8 release of Mrs. Trump's memoir, ""Melania."" Yet I remain hopeful that, with the book's publication, the public will finally have a chance to learn her story, firsthand, and come to understand the remarkable woman I am so fortunate to call my friend.

In my role as one of Mrs. Trump's advisers in the White House, I was in many of the rooms and witnessed many of the moments that have since been drastically recast in books, tweets and interviews by former staffers -- and I am aghast at the disparity between the truth I witnessed and the skewed narrative that is widely promoted.

Consider the ongoing rants of one of her former staffers, and self-proclaimed close friend, who has since worked indefatigably to promote herself while bashing Melania. After her contract with the White House was terminated, (full disclosure: my contract with the White House was also terminated at the same time) she wrote a one-sided book about her former boss. She admitted to secretly taping personal phone calls with Mrs. Trump, who was first lady at the time. An unprecedented breach of trust and civility if not ethics.

MELANIA TRUMP ON WHY THE 2024 ELECTION IS DIFFERENT: 'WE ARE DEALING WITH MUCH MORE DANGER'

Further, after leaving the White House, she began her campaign to criticize Mrs. Trump at every turn, apparently not only to sell her book but also to settle imagined personal scores. Like other former Trumpians, she apparently was positioning herself to be the go-to expert about a woman to whom she has not spoken now in more than seven years.

Examine her ongoing hateful tweets, such as opining about why Melania was not on the campaign trail with her husband last fall. When Mrs. Trump told reporters to ""Stay tuned"" about her plans to campaign, this former staffer predictably chimed in with a supposedly all-knowing tweet: ""Let me interpret this for you: DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATHE! [sic]""

How, exactly, would she know that -- or anything else about the former first lady? She was clearly so far out of the loop that she was unaware that Mrs. Trump was caring for her dying mother at the time. So much for expertise.

MELANIA TRUMP OPENS UP AFTER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS ON HER HUSBAND: SURVIVING BOTH WERE 'REALLY MIRACLES'

Then there is Mrs. Trump's onetime White House press secretary, who also appears to be competing to become the Left's Melania expert. This, after writing a self-aggrandizing book that attacked her former boss while auditioning for the never-Trump ""conservative"" seat on ABC's ""The View.""

This former ""insider"" is the same person who, embarrassingly, could not correctly explain to reporters in 2018 why the first lady wore a now-famous Zara designer jacket with its bold logo -- ""I Really Don't Care, Do U?"" -- on a flight to visit migrant children detained at the Texas border. This press secretary told reporters: ""It's just a jacket. There was no hidden message.""

How did she not know that the first lady was intentionally signaling to her critics with that jacket and not referring to the children? And if she had no understanding of Mrs. Trump then, while working for her, how can she possibly be considered an expert on her now when she has had no access to Mrs. Trump in years?

It took the former first lady herself to clear up the confusion and repair the damage. Melania told an ABC News interviewer that the jacket was ""kind of a message, yes,"" but one directed at her critics: ""I want to show them that I don't care. You could criticize whatever you want to say, but it will not stop me to do what I feel is right.""

Sadly, we have rarely seen any positive reporting on Melania's achievements because Mrs. Trump has seldom been recognized or credited for the important initiatives she undertook and supported during her four years as First Lady and in the years since.

As first lady, she worked to focus attention on the opioid crisis and its toll on families when visiting Lily's Place, a treatment center in Huntington, W.Va. She championed ""Be Best,"" her campaign which aimed at building children's wellness and emotional intelligence in education which included her work against cyber-bullying in schools.

Since leaving the White House, she has created ""Fostering the Future,"" to raise college scholarship funding for former foster children. Since its inception, ""Fostering the Future"" has given out scholarships to many students. You have probably heard little about it.

When consuming news, as with any other commodity, the old adage of ""let the buyer beware"" has perhaps never been more relevant. It is essential for media consumers to approach information about politics with a critical eye, to seek out reliable sources, and to question the credibility of self-proclaimed experts. Otherwise, we may learn that it was our freedoms and our very way of life that were actually for sale all along."
Melania Trump's pro-choice stand isn't that different from other Republican first ladies,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/melania-trumps-pro-choice-stand-isnt-different-from-other-republican-first-ladies,2024-10-04T17:11:57Z,"Former first lady Melania Trump opens up about her life before, during and after the White House in a sit-down interview on 'Fox & Friends.'

Melania Trump is not the only first lady to express pro-choice views. She joins several former Republican first ladies who have shared similar perspectives, often in their memoirs, despite this stance historically contrasting with the GOP platform.

Other spouses of Republican presidents, such as Pat Nixon, Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Laura Bush, have been recorded either during or after their husbands' tenure in office expressing pro-choice views.

""I feel very strongly that it was the best thing in the world when the Supreme Court voted to legalize abortion and, in my words, bring it out of the backwoods and put it in the hospital where it belongs,"" Betty Ford said in a CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" interview in 1975, two years after Roe v. Wade was handed down.

MELANIA TRUMP'S ABORTION VIEWS IN NEW MEMOIR SPUR OUTRAGE FROM PRO-LIFERS: 'SHE IS WRONG'

Following Ford's comments on premarital sex, marijuana and abortion during the CBS interview, then-President Gerald Ford reportedly joked that she had cost him votes.

As a more conservative first lady, Nancy Reagan avoided taking a public stance against abortion that would put her at odds with former President Ronald Reagan. However, she later revealed her personal position on the issue.

""I'm against abortion, I don't believe in abortion,"" Reagan said at George Washington University in 1994, five years after her husband left the Oval Office. ""On the other hand, I believe in a woman's choice. So, it puts me somewhere in the middle, but I don't know what you'd call that.""

Barbara Bush, former President George H. W. Bush's wife, was more reserved in her public statements about abortion and was at odds with her husband's anti-abortion stance. While she was not as outspoken as Betty Ford, she wrote in her 1994 memoir, ""I hate abortions, but I just could not make that choice for someone else.""

Former first lady Laura Bush, wife of former President George W. Bush and daughter-in-law to Barbara Bush, also differed with the former Presidents Bush on abortion.

""I think it's important that it remain legal, because I think it's important for people for medical reasons and other reasons,"" she said in an interview with Larry King Live in 2010.

Pat Nixon, then-President Richard Nixon's wife, told reporters during a 1972 press conference - as Roe v. Wade arguments were being considered by the Supreme Court - that she supported the right to choose an abortion, but opposed ""wholesale abortion on demand.""

Trump, wife of Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump, wrote the memoir entitled ""Melania"" that is scheduled to come out on Oct. 8, per the Amazon release date. In the book, according to a preview by The Guardian, she expresses a viewpoint closely aligned with that of former first ladies before her.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,"" Trump reportedly wrote.

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.

""Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

The former first lady drew criticism from pro-life advocates on social media after the excerpts were published just a month away from Election Day. This year, the Republican Party's official platform also softened its language on abortion, as former President Trump also said he would not support a federal abortion ban."
"'Lies throughout': Trump-backed challenger, longtime Dem senator face off in heated battleground debate",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lies-throughout-trump-backed-challenger-longtime-dem-senator-face-off-heated-battleground-debate,2024-10-04T14:14:11Z,"Lackawanna County, Pa., has emerged as a key battleground county this election cycle, with voters on the streets of Scranton speaking with Fox News Digital about their top issues.

Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger Dave McCormick squared off in their first debate Thursday evening, less than five weeks ahead of what is expected to be one of the most closely watched races this election cycle.

Casey and McCormick took the debate stage Thursday at 8 p.m. in Harrisburg, where the two traded barbs over issues such as the economy and inflation, immigration, abortion. The race, which is rated as ""leans Democrat"" by the Cook Political Report, is expected to be one of the tightest Senate races across the country, with Casey himself acknowledging earlier this year that it will be a ""close, tough race.""

Casey has long been a Pennsylvania Democratic stalwart, first winning his election to the U.S. Senate in 2007. The Casey name also has deep roots in the state, with Bob Casey Sr., the senator's father, serving as the Keystone State's governor from 1987 to 1995, following years of serving in various other elected roles.

McCormick is an Army combat veteran and former CEO of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, who served as the Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security as well as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs under former President George W. Bush's administration. Former President Donald Trump endorsed McCormick in April, lauding him as a ""a good man"" who ""wants to run a good ship.""

MCCORMICK SEIZES ON PENNSYLVANIA SENATE RACE GAP, LAYING BORDER BLAME ON CASEY

The Senate race comes as the federal election spotlights Pennsylvania once again as a key battleground state that will likely determine the outcome of the presidential election. Former President Donald Trump narrowly won the state in his successful 2016 election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while President Biden declared victory in the Keystone State in the 2020 election.

As the pair squared off for the first of two debates ahead of Nov. 5, Fox News Digital compiled the top five moments of Thursday's event.

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

Casey and McCormick both weighed in on the federal election, including Casey lauding Harris following his staunch support of Biden before the president ultimately dropped out of the 2024 race as concerns about his mental acuity and age mounted over the summer.

""From your perspective, who is the better candidate for Pennsylvania? Biden or Harris?"" moderator and ABC27 anchor Dennis Owens asked Casey.

""I think Vice President Harris, who's running a strong campaign, I think she'll carry Pennsylvania. It's going to be very close, just like the Senate race will be close. But she's running a strong campaign. But the people of our state have to make two basic decisions - in addition to other statewide races. They have decided in the presidential race, and they have to decide our race, and this race is very clear,"" Casey responded.

When asked whether he believes Biden or Harris would be a better president for Pennsylvania voters, Casey brushed off delivering a direct answer.

""Oh, I don't know, Dennis. I mean, we'll never know the answer to that, but the voters are gonna make a decision,"" he said.

McCormick, on the other hand, was asked if he could offer one example where he does not agree with Trump after slamming Casey during the debate for overwhelmingly voting with Biden over the last three and a half years.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS, TRUMP LOCKED IN TIGHT RACE IN BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

""[Trump] recently said that he wanted to get rid of the ban on SALT taxes, which Sen. Casey supported, too"" McCormick responded. ""Listen, that's a that's a tax break for millionaires in New York and California at the expense of PA taxpayers. So I wouldn't support that.""

""But listen, Senator Casey stood next to Joe Biden when he could hardly finish a sentence. We saw this on the debate stage, he said 'he's ready to go,'"" McCormick continued, referring to Casey's support of Biden remaining in the presidential race until Biden ultimately dropped out. ""Then Sen. Casey said, 'Kamala Harris is great. You're going to love her when you get to know her.' This is a woman who, in the last few years, says she wanted to ban fracking, legalize illegal immigration, give them federal benefits, take away our guns, defund the police. This is her position, so she's flip-flopped on everything, and Bob Casey standing there by her.""

Both candidates accused the other of ""lies"" throughout the debate, including McCormick touting a new website called CaseyLies.com, and Casey accusing McCormick of misrepresenting himself as a Pennsylvanian.

""For your viewers tonight, I have a website that's been established today, it's just been launched, CaseyLies.com. You can go and see the actual facts by third-party sources of all the things he's saying. There will be lies throughout. But you should ask yourself, 'Why is a senator with an 18-year track record, who should be able to run on his record, running his entire campaign with a negative set of attacks on me, most of them lies?'"" McCormick said towards the start of the debate.

McCormick claimed that Casey often launched ""lies"" at him during the debate because he ""doesn't have a track record"" in the Senate to run on.

Casey shot back during the debate that McCormick has misrepresented himself as a full-fledged Pennsylvanian.

""We've heard a couple of times tonight about telling lies, but probably the biggest lie told in this whole election, that probably most Pennsylvanians have never heard a bigger lie, was the lie when my opponent said he lived in Pennsylvania, when he was living in Connecticut. The Associated Press on August the 14th, 2023, did a story that proved that he was living in Connecticut,"" Casey said.

McCormick defended that he was born in Pennsylvania and has spent ""the majority of my life"" there, but also lived in Connecticut for years when he served as CEO of Bridgewater Associates.

PENNSYLVANIA SURVEY FINDS HARRIS LEADING TRUMP NARROWLY, IDENTIFIES HER 'BIGGEST WEAKNESS,' POLLSTER SAYS

The economy is among the top concerns for voters in Pennsylvania, as well as the nation at large, with both candidates outlining how they would tackle spiraling inflation if re-elected or elected to the Senate, and what they believe is behind the rise in consumers' costs.

""Prices are too high, especially when you go to the grocery store to buy food or household items, items that people need every week, or at least every other week. And these big conglomerates, these big corporations, rig those prices and jack them up to levels we've never seen, all while they're getting record profits,"" Casey said, while defending his efforts targeting corporations he has accused of ""greedflation.""

So-called greedflation is understood as corporations allegedly exploiting inflation woes by increasing prices on consumers to produce greater profits.

""We can take it on by passing a price gouging bill to go after those companies, hold them accountable,"" Casey said.

The Democratic senator also addressed his campaign against ""shrinkflation,"" which he explained as corporations shrinking products for consumers while not lowering prices.

""We did a report on shrinkflation, which covered a lot of companies around the country. And if that's happening with regard to a Pennsylvania company or any other company around the country, they should be held accountable. When they take a product, shrink the contents of the product, or what's in a bag, and don't shrink the price, that's deceptive. That's ripping people off,"" he said, adding that such companies should be held legally accountable.

McCormick shot back that higher costs on Americans in recent years is due to ""out of control spending"" at the hands of Casey and other Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris and President Biden.

""When you've spent your entire life in public service, elected office, 30 years, you're like a hammer looking for a nail. The cause of inflation is the policies, the out-of-control spending of Biden, Harris and Casey. Bob Casey voted 100% of the time for that $5 trillion of new spending. The experts at the time, Larry Summers, the San Francisco Fed, said this would create inflation,"" McCormick said.

""Bob Casey doesn't understand how the economy works. That's why he's trying to do all this economic voodoo stuff with price controls,"" he later charged.

Casey and McCormick were both grilled about their current abortion stances during the debate, as abortion once again sits atop many voters' list of election concerns following the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Casey positioned himself as a pro-life Democrat earlier in his career, but he voted to codify abortion protections nationwide following the overturning of Roe.

""In 2022, when the Supreme Court overturned a 49-year right, it overturned Roe v. Wade, I think everyone had to make a decision, including senators. I made a decision to support the Women's Health Protection Act. I don't support Republican efforts to ban abortion across the country,"" Casey said.

BATTLEGROUND STATE DEM DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM DEFUND MOVEMENT, BUT POLITICAL RECORD SHOWS DIFFERENT STORY

McCormick was questioned about his remarks in 2022 that he supports rare exceptions for abortion, such as when the health of the mother is at risk, and has since said that he supports additional exceptions for abortion.

""This is an extremely polarizing issue. As you know, I have six daughters, so this is something we spend time talking about. I believe this should be a state's right. I believe states should decide. Pennsylvania has had a law. It's been supported by Democrats and Republicans, like was signed into law by the Senator's father, Governor Casey. I support the three exceptions. I would not favor an abortion ban of any kind,"" McCormick responded.

Casey recently came under fire from a Pennsylvania sheriff who slammed the Democratic senator's border policies for the influx of fentanyl into the U.S., which the dad said had led to his son's death.

""We can't bring back the people we've lost. But we can get rid of the weak politicians like Bob Casey who let it happen,"" Blair County Sheriff Jim Ott said in a recent McCormick campaign ad.

Casey was asked about the sheriff's remarks during his debate Thursday.

""Mr. Casey, the Blair County Sheriff, blames you for the fentanyl death of his son, saying you have not done enough to secure the border. What is your response to that,"" Owens asked.

""I met so many families across the state, and whether it's a sheriff in Blair County or a mom in Allegheny County, Janet that I met, who talked about her daughter, Brianna, this is an awful, awful tragedy for those families. That's why we need to invest in the strategies that we know work. [McCormick] won't do that, because he's weak in the face of the political pressure from his own party. . . . We can solve this problem by investing in the technology, hiring thousands more Border Patrol, so we can inspect every single vehicle coming across the border,"" he said.

Amid the immigration debate, McCormick blamed the Biden-Harris administration and Casey for the immigration crisis at the southern border.

""The border crisis is the direct result of the weakness of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And Bob Casey supported them every second. What chutzpah to run an ad on how tough he is on the border, when he voted against funding for the Border Patrol. He ran an ad in front of the wall that he voted against. He voted for sanctuary cities, he voted for federal benefits for illegal immigrants. And the fentanyl crisis that's come across our border is the direct result of the weakness of Bob Casey not standing up to these terrible cartels,"" McCormick argued.

The pair have agreed to another debate, next taking the same stage in Philadelphia on Oct. 15."

A number of the biggest names in Hollywood came out in support of Biden before he dropped out of the race, before turning their support to Harris. Olivia Rodrigo, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris by sharing a video of a speech the vice president gave promising to ""stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans."" Major Democratic fundraiser George Clooney, who used a New York Times essay to call for Biden to drop out of the race, lent his support to Harris and Barbra Streisand said she would support Harris because of her vow to fight for reproductive rights. Musician John Legend, who performed at the Democratic National Convention in 2024, posted he was ""so ready"" for a Harris presidency. Director Spike Lee, ""West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin and director Ken Burns hrew their support behind Harris, along with actresses Rosie O'Donnell and Jamie Lee Curtis. Robert De Niro, who narrated an advertisement for the Biden campaign, praised the president's ""selfless patriotism"" in a statement that did not mention Harris but said ""there is nothing more important for our country than defeating Donald Trump at the ballot box."" British pop artist Charli XCX brought Harris into the Gen Z fold by tweeting ""kamala IS brat,"" an endorsement that was met by Harris' team changing the background photo on her X account to the ""brat"" green color and using the same font used on Charli XCX's album of the same name. Rapper Cardi B, who in May said she wouldn't be endorsing Biden, tweeted ""AHAHAHAHA LETS GOOOOO I TOLD YALLL KAMALA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 2024 candidate...."" Pop musician Kesha said she plans to support Harris in November and, when asked how she felt about Vance, responded ""f -- - that man."" Beyoncé has not made a public endorsement but did give the Harris campaign permission to use her song ""Freedom"" in a video of her first official visit to her campaign's headquarters, a rare approval from the superstar musician. Beyoncé's mom and businesswoman Tina Knowles endorsed Harris with an Instagram post. Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle and former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have also thrown their support behind Harris. Former President Jimmy Carter, 99, reportedly told his son last week he was trying to make it to his 100th birthday so he could cast his vote for Kamala Harris. ""Sex in the City"" actress and former New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon threw her support behind Harris and her Vice Presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, in a post that read: ""I'm Walzing on air!"" Billionaire Mark Cuban, who previously said he was committed to voting for Biden, has also supported Harris and endorsed Walz as her running mate, calling him someone who ""can sit at the kitchen table and make you feel like you have know him forever."" Actor Tony Goldwyn, Republican political commentator Ana Navarro, comedian Mindy Kaling and actress Kerry Washington each supported the Harris-Walz campaign by hosting one evening of the Democratic National Convention. Nick Offerman, Jane Fonda, Ben Stiller, Kathy Griffin, John Stamos, Ed Helms, Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz were among those who appeared on a ""Comics for Harris"" virtual rally via Zoom, which reportedly raised close to half a million dollars for the Harris campaign. Over Labor Day weekend, a fundraiser for the Democratic ticket in Southampton, New York was hosted by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and fashion designer Tory Burch, among others. Actors Matt Damon and Lin-Manuel Miranda will attend fundraiser in New York City in September -- for which tickets are listed at $25,000 per person -- to support the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket, Bloomberg reported. Actress Aubrey Plaza posted a photo of herself on Instagram holding Grumpy Cat -- the face of a famous meme -- with the caption ""HARRIS 🇺🇸 WALZ. Mel Brooks said he was ""all in"" for the Harris and Walz ticket in a post to social media holding his dog, adding ""I don't have a cat, so a dog will have to do!"" Stevie Nicks did not name a particular candidate when she encouraged her followers to vote in an Instagram post this week, but signed her message ""Childless Dog Lady."" Billionaire pop star Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris in an Instagram post minutes after a debate between Harris and Donald Trump wrapped up, with a photo of her holding her cat that has since been recreated by several other celebrities. After declining to endorse a candidate in 2020, Martha Stewart said at the Retail Influencer CEO Forum she will supporting Kamala Harris in the election because she wants a president ""who doesn't hate New York"" and ""doesn't hate democracy,"" the Daily Beast reported. Pop star Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas, a songwriter and producer, made a video about National Voter Registration Day and Billie said they would both be voting for Harris and Walz ""because they are fighting to protect our reproductive freedom, our planet and our democracy."" Famous television scientist Bill Nye, in a video posted to the Kamala HQ TikTok account, called Trump a ""climate change denier"" and encouraged viewers to ""vote with the climate in mind."" Nye participated ""Geeks & Nerds for Harris"" fundraiser on Sept. 28 hosted by ""Wonder Woman"" star Lynda Carter that will also feature ""Star Trek"" actors LeVar Burton and Anthony Rapp, actor Misha Collins of ""Supernatural,"" Star Wars actor Mark Hamill and others.

Former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan ripped off his shirt while on stage at the Republican National Convention last month to reveal a Trump-Vance campaign shirt underneath, and called Trump his ""hero"" and the ""greatest president of the United States."" Musician Kid Rock has been vocal about his support of Trump in the past and at the RNC revamped his song ""American Bad Ass"" to include references to Trump. UFC President and personality Dana White called Trump the ""toughest, most resilient human being."" Rapper and reality TV star Amber Rose gave a speech at the RNC in support of Trump. Country music stars Chris Janson and Jason Aldean also appeared at the convention. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy in January said voting for Trump over Biden was a ""no-brainer.""

Actress Rosanne Barr, a longtime conservative supporter of Trump, clapped back at Cuban's endorsement of the Harris-Walz ticket and called the VP pick ""another reason Harris is a disaster."" Rapper Azealia Banks last year said she would vote for Donald Trump in Novemebr and she appeared at a rally in Florida this summer. Actor Jon Voight has defended Trump on multiple occasions. 50 Cent's 2023 song ""Many Men (Wish Death)"" started trending online after the assassination attempt of Trump last month. The rapper responded by putting Trump's face on the cover of his ""Get Rich or Die Tryin.'"" While it's hard to call the response an official endorsement, he did appear to support the president in 2020 before apparently backtracking. Other celebrities who have supported Trump in the past, but not outright endorsed him yet this election season, include Lil Wayne and ""Happy Days"" star Scott Baio. Trump thanked Brittany Mahomes, wife of NFL superstar Patrick Mahomes, for her ""defending him"" after she lashed out at social media users who criticized her for liking several pro-Trump posts last month (Mahomes has not formally endorsed a candidate). At a rally in Las Vegas, Trump thanked reggaeton star Nicky Jam for his endorsement, but apparently thought he was a she -- saying: ""Do you know Nicky? She's hot. Where's Nicky?"" -- before correcting himself after Jam climbed to the stage, saying, ""Oh, look, I'm glad he came up.""

Notable names missing from the list of public supporters include billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who called the decision ""too important to rush."""

The San Jose State women's volleyball team is getting added security in the form of police protection amid a national controversy over a transgender player on the team, according to a university spokesperson.

""I can confirm that we are using university police to provide extra security for the team at their home and away games,"" San Jose State's Senior Director of Media Relations Michelle Smith-McDonald told Fox News Digital on Thursday.

The university's police department annually documents about 60,000 incidents, arrests between 800 and 900 suspects and writes about 2,500 reports. The Police Communications Center dispatches personnel to more than 50,000 calls for service each year, according to the station's website.

However, Smith-McDonald said the department's resources are now necessary for the volleyball team due to the scale of national media attention the team has garnered in recent weeks.

""The safety of our students is our top priority. The team has been a subject of significant attention, not all of it positive, and we are ensuring their security,"" Smith-McDonald said.

The team is coming off of a loss against Colorado State on the road on Thursday, in which Blaire Fleming, a transgender female, took the court for San Jose State. Fleming transferred to San Jose State in 2022 from Coastal Carolina. As a biological male, Fleming previously set a high school record at John Champe High School with 30 kills in a match and a single-season record of 266 kills for the school's girls' volleyball team.

Footage on Fleming's Hudl page of the school-record 30-kill match in September 2019 shows how hard and fast Fleming's spikes came down at the high school level against girl opponents.

The National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) requires transgender women to submit documentation including testosterone levels before a decision is made on their eligibility to play. San José State has said they are in full compliance with NCAA rules.

However, the program is still facing resistance in the form of a lawsuit from one of its own players over Fleming's presence on the team and in the locker room. Four other competing programs have also forfeited matches against San Jose State without providing a specific reason, after news of the lawsuit began to spread.

Brooke Slusser, a member of San Jose's women's volleyball team, joined 18 other athletes in suing the NCAA over its current gender identity policies. The lawsuit alleged Slusser, who transferred to San Jose, felt concerned for her safety after realizing one of her new teammates was transgender.

Slusser joined in the lawsuit that former NCAA swimmer and OutKick contributor Riley Gaines began earlier this year over having to share a locker room with and compete against transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, a biological male who tied with Gaines at the 2022 NCAA championships.

Slusser claimed she was not aware that Fleming was transgender despite sharing rooms together on team trips, per the court documents. Slusser also expressed safety concerns for opponents playing against Fleming.

""Brooke estimates that Fleming's spikes were traveling upward of 80 mph, which was faster than she had ever seen a woman hit a volleyball,"" Slusser's complaint read. ""The girls were doing everything they could to dodge Fleming's spikes but still could not fully protect themselves.""

GOP GOVERNOR REVEALS WHY HE ORDERED SCHOOLS TO BAR TRANSGENDERS FROM GIRLS SPORTS

The four teams that have forfeited matches against San Jose State in recent weeks are Boise State, Southern Utah, Wyoming and Utah State.

Colorado State, however, opted to play their match against San Jose State on Thursday. It just so happened to be Colorado State's annual inclusive excellence game. The University of Nevada also preemptively committed to playing San Jose State on Oct. 26, Nevada announced in a statement on Thursday.

The controversy surrounding whether Fleming should be allowed to compete and share locker rooms with women's volleyball players has resulted in impassioned arguments on both sides of the issue.

Idaho Gov. Brad Little and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox have each commended the universities in their respective states, Boise State in Idaho and Utah State and Southern Utah in Utah, for forfeiting their matches against San Jose State.

""It is essential that we preserve a space for women to compete fairly and safely. Our female athletes are left grappling with this difficult issue because the NCAA has failed in its responsibility to protect female athletes and women's sports. It's time for the NCAA to take this seriously and protect our female student athletes,"" Cox wrote in a post on X.

Meanwhile, Little, who passed an executive order in his state on Aug. 28 aimed to oppose transgender inclusion in girls' and women's sports, commended his order for playing into Boise State's decision to forfeit.

""I applaud Boise State for working within the spirit of my Executive Order, the Defending Women's Sports Act,"" Little's post on X read. ""We need to ensure player safety for all of our female athletes and continue the fight for fairness in women's sports.""

Little previously told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that there were no incidents of transgender athletes competing in women's sports that occurred in his state that factored into his executive order prior to him passing it. Now, Boise State has ensured that trend continues.

""Obviously, a person with those kind of advantages, somebody that had competed previously in male sports and then transitioned over to compete in women's sports, that's what I'm certain the good people of Idaho think is wrong and shouldn't happen,"" Little said.

""From a national standpoint, there are radical little groups that want to implement changes in the rules that we have already. I'm confident in what we have, and we will aggressively (act), as the state of Idaho, both legally and legislatively to protect women's athletes and the great advances they've made because of Title IX.""

However, LGBTQ rights groups have advocated for Fleming's right to compete as a women's volleyball player.

LGBTQ advocacy group Wyoming Equality communications coordinator Santi Murillo released a statement on Wednesday saying, ""Athletics should be about fostering teamwork, growth and healthy competition -- not about discrimination and exclusion."" The statement was in response to the University of Wyoming canceling its match against San Jose State when it became the third program to do so on Tuesday.

New Jersey Democrat congressional candidate Sue Altman went so far as to say that women athletes in locker rooms ""aren't worried"" about transgenders competing in their sports and that biological men should be able to compete in girls' sports at the youth level.

""I promise you that in the locker rooms of women's sports teams, we're not super worried about this,"" Altman told the New York Post.

""If we decide as a society that making rules about who is and who isn't female is more important than giving young children a chance to be on teams and compete and to be part of something bigger than themselves, especially young people who are more susceptible to suicide and bullying, then I think we've lost our way a little bit."""
Inside The Superyachts Of America's Richest People,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2024/10/04/inside-the-superyachts-of-americas-richest-people/,2024-10-04T10:39:42Z,"For the first time ever, Forbes dug into how many superyachts are owned by America's 400 richest people and how much they're truly worth. Turns out it's a bigger share of all superyachts around the world, even though they are not necessarily the most valuable.

ometimes, the trappings of a multi-billion dollar fortune get old. Forbes 400 member Shahid Khan of auto parts supplier firm Flex-N-Gate decided in 2020 that his superyacht, Kismet, needed an update. So he splurged nearly $390 million on building a new 400-foot superyacht -- also named Kismet, which was delivered in April. The new floating pad features fireplaces, floor-to-ceiling glass windows and a bow shaped like a jaguar (presumably a nod to Khan's Jacksonville NFL team) plus all the usual yacht trimmings, from a helipad to a mosaic-lined swimming pool.

But first, he had to make room. Last September, he sold his previous yacht -- also named Kismet -- for $159 million to Eric Schmidt, the former Google CEO. Schmidt had been in the market for a new boat after his planned $67 million purchase of the 269-foot Alfa Nero fell through, reportedly due to concerns that the yacht's alleged owner, a sanctioned Russian oligarch, would sue to regain control. (The yacht, which had been frozen by U.S. authorities in 2022 and was sitting idle in the island nation of Antigua and Barbuda, eventually sold in July for $40 million to an unnamed buyer.)

Khan and Schmidt aren't the only American billionaires with a passion for yachts. While the largest -- and most valuable -- yachts in the world are owned by Middle Eastern royals and Russian oligarchs (in fact, all 17 of the longest yachts are owned by individuals from these two groups), Americans own the most, with roughly one out of four of all superyachts -- commonly defined as those larger than 40 meters (131 feet) -- belonging to an American. That's three times as many as Russians, the second-largest yacht owners, according to industry publication SuperYacht Times.

For the first time ever, Forbes has compiled a list of all of the yachts owned by America's 400 richest people. Collectively, Forbes estimates that 40 members of the Forbes 400 own at least 60 yachts worth more than $6 billion, according to yacht valuation experts VesselsValue. Some own multiple, while others focus on one extravagant build, which can cost in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

These ships range from the modest -- Igor Olenicoff's 118-foot, $2 million Rusalka -- to the grandiose, such as David Geffen's Rising Sun. The 18th largest yacht in the world at 453 feet and the biggest one owned by an American, it comes with a basketball court that converts to a helipad and has hosted celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and fellow billionaire Oprah Winfrey. The most valuable American-owned yacht is Jeff Bezos' Koru, a custom-built 417-foot sailing yacht that's worth an estimated $500 million.

While Geffen owns the biggest and Bezos the most valuable, it's Gabe Newell -- the cofounder of video game company Valve -- who owns the most. His six ships (plus several submarines), which he manages through his maritime research organization Inkfish, make up the largest fleet among America's richest people.

Newell is not the only American whose love of floating mansions seems to stem at least in part from a passion to better understand the ocean. Ex-Google CEO Schmidt bought the Falkor Too, a $75 million research vessel owned through the nonprofit Schmidt Ocean Institute, in 2021. Ray Dalio, founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, owns the $82 million OceanXplorer, a souped-up research vessel that has its own TV show on National Geographic.

Sometimes owning a superyacht can be a liability, or worse -- deadly -- as the August tragedy involving onetime billionaire Michael Lynch's yacht Bayesian illustrates. Lynch and six others perished when the yacht sank off the coast of Italy. That same month, Laurene Powell Jobs' 256-foot, $81 million yacht Venus collided with Lady Moura, a yacht owned by Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego. Fortunately, no one was hurt. In early 2020, hedge fund billionaire Daniel Loeb's 197-foot, $45 million yacht Samadhi damaged a coral reef in Belize, spurring an apology from Loeb, who committed to working with a local conservation group to restore the reef.

Here are the yachts owned by America's 400 richest people:

The custom-built sailing yacht is the second-largest of its kind in the world (behind Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko's SY A) Based on the word Koru in the Māori language of New Zealand, which means the spiral shape of an unfurling silver fern frond, it is a symbol of harmony and eternal movement. The yacht briefly stirred controversy when its Dutch builder, Oceanco, proposed partially dismantling a historic bridge in Rotterdam to allow it to sail through. (After local protests, the yacht was instead towed elsewhere.) It comes with its own ""support vessel"" named Abeona, worth $53 million, and the bow features a sculpture of a woman who many believe is modeled after Bezos' girlfriend, Lauren Sánchez -- a claim she has denied, stating it depicts the Norse goddess Freyja.

The third yacht named Kismet (which means fate or destiny) built for Khan, this newest version was codenamed Project Jag before it was delivered in 2024. (Previous iterations of Kismet hosted musical guests including Charli XCX and Oasis' Noel Gallagher.) The yacht is built for comfort, featuring a ""7-star wellness suite"" that comes with a hammam, sauna and cryotherapy chamber, plus a private treatment room with a massage table and a chromotherapy bathtub, according to the builder, Lurssen. The aquatic theme continues in the lower deck, which boasts a ""Nemo cinema"" with a 150-inch TV and an underwater seating area.

While Zuckerberg is relatively new to the yachting world, he started big. Feadship, one of the world's most popular superyacht builders, called Launchpad the largest yacht it had ever built when it was delivered in early 2024. (Originally named Katusha, the yacht was apparently intended to be built for Russian metals tycoon Vladimir Potanin.) With a dark navy hull and curving shapes, it has all the typical luxuries of a superyacht: two helipads, a swimming pool with a movable floor and a private outdoor deck with a jacuzzi.

The yet-to-be-delivered Project Y722 is the crown jewel in Gabe Newell's fleet of ships, a custom craft built by Netherlands-based Oceanco. The ""future-proofed"" megayacht comes with its own diesel-electric power plant and a battery energy storage system, allowing for ""extended periods of emission-free silent running"" according to the company. It is expected to be delivered in 2025.

Norn, a Lurssen-built yacht, resembles a U.S. Navy destroyer more than the typical superyacht, with sharp, angular corners and a military-style bow. Still, the builders didn't skimp on luxury for its owner Charles Simonyi, an early Microsoft employee who later sold a startup to his old firm: Norn has an outdoor cinema and a swimming pool with a liftable floor that turns into a dancefloor.

One of four ships in WhatsApp cofounder Jan Koum's fleet, Moonrise is a striking yacht with all-teak decks -- including the helipad -- drawing a sharp contrast with its white steel hull and aluminum structure. Its support vessel, Nebula, is the largest ever produced by its builder, Astilleros Armón, and features an air-conditioned helicopter hangar. When Koum gets bored, he can always step onto his $68 million, 241-foot yacht Mogambo with its own support boat, Power Play.

Kaos was famously defaced with graffiti by activists (twice) in Ibiza and Barcelona. Still, that hasn't stopped its owner, Walmart heiress Nancy Walton Laurie, from enjoying it. One of the largest superyachts built in the Netherlands at the time of its delivery in 2017, Kaos can fit 30 guests and features ""visual tricks"" in the shape of unusable deck areas and overhangs, which give a better sense of proportion, according to its builder, Oceanco. It was delivered to Laurie already outfitted with her own fine china, silverware, and even loose furniture.

The Dallas Cowboys owner's yacht, named in tribute of his wife, was considered a ""pioneer"" by its builder, Oceanco, for its sustainability and fuel efficient attributes when it was delivered in 2018. With ""waste heat recovery"" and ""integrated battery systems,"" the yacht floats ahead of its gas-guzzling sisters with (slightly) cleaner operations, consuming 30% less fuel than a standard vessel of its size, according to Oceanco's website. Part of that design is to help Jones accomplish a goal he told Yachts International in 2019: ""to see as much of the world as possible from the perspective of the sea."" More than 14 guests can coast efficiently in style, enjoying its sundry amenities like a sauna and movie theater. The yacht has gotten its moment in the spotlight, too, when in 2020, Jones called into the NFL draft from an ornate room on the yacht, as ESPN reporter Don Van Natta posted online.

Built in 2004, Rising Sun is much older than the rest of the yachts owned by America's richest, one reason its value has depreciated so much since Geffen bought it for a reported $590 million from fellow Forbes 400 member Larry Ellison in 2010. Still, it was refitted in 2011 and has more than enough features and amenities -- including a spa, beauty salon and specially built glass panels with heat-insulating foil -- to make Geffen and his celebrity guests comfortable. In March 2020, Geffen famously posted photos of a sunrise over the yacht on Instagram, telling his followers that he was isolating aboard Rising Sun while sailing in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. (He later deleted the posts after being criticized for being tone-deaf.)

With Viva, Frank Fertitta, who made the bulk of his fortune through mixed martial arts promoter UFC, sought a yacht that was as efficient as possible. The pearl-white ship, delivered in 2021, boasts an ""advanced hybrid propulsion system,"" or diesel-electric power system, that's more efficient than the standard yacht. Another Feadship creation, the vessel has a slim, sophisticated look that's only made clearer by its all-white coloring, with pops of teak on its fold-out beach club deck, poolside and decks."
How To Start A Successful Business At 50+,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissahouston/2024/10/04/how-to-start-a-successful-business-at-50/,2024-10-04T10:04:58Z,"It's no secret that women over 50 are redefining what it means to be an entrepreneur. More than ever, Gen X women are leaving behind traditional jobs, trading in the corporate ladder for the excitement and control that comes with owning a business.

In fact, women in this age group are starting businesses at an unprecedented rate, bringing experience, confidence, and a fresh perspective to the entrepreneurial world. It's time to harness your years of wisdom, skills, and drive to launch a business that's not just successful but fulfilling.

The entrepreneurial journey requires a specific mindset, especially if you're starting a business later in life. It's easy to feel intimidated by younger entrepreneurs who seem to have grown up in the fast-paced world of tech, but your age is your advantage. You've built resilience, adaptability, and problem-solving skills over decades.

What's key at this stage is to adopt a growth mindset. This means seeing every challenge as an opportunity to learn, grow, and evolve. You've got experience and wisdom, but business landscapes shift fast. Be prepared to learn new things and embrace change.

The best way to set yourself up for success is by starting a business in a niche where you have experience, skills, or a deep interest. You likely have decades of professional experience and you must leverage that! Whether it's consulting, coaching, or a product-based business, focus on a niche where your expertise gives you a competitive advantage.

At the same time, be mindful of market demand. Make sure your business idea solves a specific problem or serves a gap in the market. This blend of personal expertise and market demand is a winning formula for a thriving business.

One of the greatest assets you have at 50+ is your network. After years of working in various industries, you've likely built relationships with colleagues, mentors, and peers. Use these connections to spread the word about your new business, gain valuable advice, and even secure your first clients.

Don't hesitate to reach out and let people know what you're working on. You never know who might be looking for exactly what you're offering.

You don't need to have everything figured out from day one. Starting a business at 50+ can feel like a huge leap, but you can make the process less overwhelming by starting small. Consider launching as a side hustle while you're still working or starting with a simplified version of your business that can grow as you gain traction.

By starting small, you can test your ideas, learn what works, and refine your business without too much financial risk. Then, as your confidence and client base grow, you can scale your business into something more substantial.

A successful business isn't just about passion; it's also about making money. In your 50s and beyond, you likely don't have as much time to ""figure it out"" as younger entrepreneurs, so your focus should be on profitability from the get-go.

This means being strategic about your pricing, costs, and business model. Make sure you understand your financial goals and how your business will meet them. For example, you can use value-based pricing to ensure you're charging what you're worth and focus on offering services or products that people are willing to pay for.

While technology might feel intimidating, it's an essential part of running a modern business. From building an online presence to managing client relationships and marketing your services, digital tools are your best friend.

Thankfully, you don't have to be a tech expert to get started. There are countless user-friendly platforms to help with everything from setting up a website to automating marketing and managing finances. Don't let the fear of tech hold you back -- there are simple solutions out there to help you manage your business effectively.

Starting a business is a journey filled with ups and downs, and failure is part of that journey. Many successful entrepreneurs, regardless of age, will tell you that they learned their biggest lessons from their failures.

As a woman over 50, you've likely faced and overcome challenges in your personal and professional life, and starting a business will be no different. Keep going, and don't let the fear of failure stop you from building something incredible.

The bottom line is that starting a business after 50 is not just possible; it's a fantastic opportunity to create something that aligns with your values, skills, and experience. With the right mindset, a solid plan, and a focus on profitability, you can launch a business that not only thrives but also fulfills you."
How early support and systematic change can help close STEM gender gap,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/drkathmackay/2024/10/04/how-early-support-and-systematic-change-can-help-close-stem-gender-gap/,2024-10-04T09:58:22Z,"In recent years, the conversation around gender disparity in entrepreneurship and STEM has gained momentum, especially when data continues to show that only 18% of high-growth enterprises have at least one woman in their founding team, highlighting the urgent need for systematic change. A notable development in this ongoing discourse is Innovate UK's recent decision to honour its original commitment of awarding 50 grants for its 'Women in Innovation' funding competition. This decision reflects a broader acknowledgement of the necessity to support women in innovation, while also shedding light on the dynamic nature of public funding. However, this development is just one piece of a larger puzzle, revealing the complex and multifaceted nature of achieving gender equality in the sector.

Missed opportunities for female entrepreneurs often underscore the broader systemic challenges within the funding landscape. When grants or resources fall short, it reflects not just a financial setback but also highlights the enduring obstacles women face in accessing support and recognition. Such situations reveal the need for a more robust system that addresses these gaps and provides equitable opportunities for all entrepreneurs, regardless of gender. Ensuring consistent and fair access to resources is crucial for fostering a more inclusive and balanced entrepreneurial environment.

The importance of early-stage support

Addressing the gender disparity in STEM requires a deep dive into the roots of the issue. Despite advances in recent years, women remain underrepresented in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics workforce. The gender gap begins early in education and becomes more pronounced after GCSEs, with a noticeable decline in female participation in STEM subjects. This persistent imbalance is not merely a numbers game but a reflection of broader societal attitudes and structural barriers that continue to deter young women from pursuing these fields. It's something I've mentioned before, but getting engagement with schools back up and running this academic year is welcome, though only just the beginning of what needs to be a sustained effort.

Efforts to close this gap have often centred on increasing awareness and providing role models, but these approaches alone have not been sufficient. To effect meaningful change, we need comprehensive strategies that address both the immediate and systemic challenges faced by women in STEM. For example, tailored programmes that offer mentoring, funding opportunities, and skills development to women at various stages of their careers, such as incubators for early-stage entrepreneurs, form a crucial part of this broader approach.

Expanding from successful initiatives in Leeds and Manchester, the Female Founders Incubator at Alderley Park aims to bridge the gender gap in tech and entrepreneurship by offering tailored support to early-stage female founders. Such programmes are vital, not only for the practical support they provide but also for the message they send - that women's contributions to innovation are both valued and necessary.

Closing the gender gap

These initiatives highlight a crucial aspect of fostering gender equality in innovation: the importance of early-stage support. Research has consistently shown that women face unique challenges in securing funding and resources in STEM. Females often raise significantly less capital than their male counterparts. For instance, one study revealed that women researchers received an average of about £274k in grant awards, compared to £537k for men. This disparity reflects a broader trend of gender-based funding inequalities that affect women across various fields. Women were also less likely to secure second grants, with 9% fewer women receiving approval for re-applications compared to their male peers.

Support networks and programmes designed for women in science and technology are crucial in addressing these disparities and ensuring women have the opportunity to compete on a more level playing field. By providing targeted resources, mentorship, and opportunities for growth, such initiatives help level the playing field and promote a more equitable environment for innovation.

Yet, supporting female entrepreneurs is just one piece of the puzzle. True progress requires addressing the systemic issues within STEM education and beyond. Enhancing this education from an early age, showcasing female role models, and ensuring equitable access to opportunities are essential components of a broader strategy to close the gender gap.

Efforts to reform education in science and technology should focus on generating excitement and interest among young girls by debunking myths about these subjects and highlighting their relevance to real-world issues. Providing hands-on learning experiences and creating opportunities for girls to engage with technical fields from an early age can also play a significant role in closing the gender gap. Furthermore, showcasing successful women in STEM and providing mentorship opportunities can inspire and encourage the next generation of female innovators.

As we move forward, it is crucial to view initiatives like the Female Founders Incubator not as standalone solutions but as part of a comprehensive effort to drive systemic change. By addressing both the immediate needs of women in STEM and the broader structural issues within education and funding, we can work towards a more inclusive and innovative future. This holistic approach will not only benefit women but also enrich the entire field of innovation, leading to a more diverse and dynamic landscape of ideas and solutions."
Wildlife lover facing charges after allegedly assaulting passersby while attempting to capture a baby seagull,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/wildlife-lover-facing-charges-after-allegedly-assaulting-passers-by-while-attempting-capture-baby-seagull,2024-10-04T09:45:17Z,"Seagulls were caught on camera trying to steal McDonald's fries through the windshield of a car in Sweden. See their desperate but failed attempts.

A Belfast woman was in court for allegedly attacking good Samaritans who attempted to free a baby seagull she captured Aug. 14.

Angela Wildman, 58, allegedly used a milk carton and a long-handled mop to attack passersby who tried freeing the waterfowl from her sports bag.

Wildman denied charges in court of common assault, possessing an offensive weapon in public, disorderly behavior and resisting a police officer, according to the BBC.

Wildman's defense attorney, Damien Trainor, said in court the 58-year-old denies being diagnosed with any mental health conditions.

""[Wildman] explained to me that she feeds birds, takes birds home and looks after wildlife,"" said Trainor. ""She keeps herself to herself, feeds her birds and cleans her house, does her shopping and comes and goes.""

According to officers' testimony in court Tuesday, people who attempted to liberate the seagull from Wildman ""were assaulted by the defendant with a long-handled mop and a large carton of milk"".

One unlucky passerby was allegedly struck with both the mop and the milk carton during the Aug. 14 incident.

When officers responded in south Belfast, Wildman was allegedly aggressive and uncooperative when they tried to handcuff her.

The arresting officer argued against Wildman's application for bail in court, saying, ""I don't know that this obsession is with wanting to capture wildlife.

""The public were drawn to her attention because she had managed to capture a baby seagull and was looking after it.""

Wildman was granted bail due to the six weeks she spent in custody ahead of her court date Tuesday.

Garth Brooks is accused of rape and sexual assault in a lawsuit,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5139950/garth-brooks-sexual-assault-accusation-lawsuit,2024-10-04T09:13:40Z,"Country music star Garth Brooks is being accused of rape and sexual assault in lawsuit filed Thursday.

An unnamed woman says she was repeatedly harassed by Brooks while working as his makeup artist and in 2019 was raped, adding that he tried to paint himself as a victim when he filed his own lawsuit against her last month.

In a statement provided late Thursday, Brooks denied the allegations. ""I have been hassled to no end with threats, lies, and tragic tales of what my future would be if I did not write a check for many millions of dollars. It has been like having a loaded gun waved in my face.""

According to the lawsuit filed by the woman's attorneys in a California Superior Court, the woman, identified only as Jane Roe, had been contracted to do makeup for Brooks' wife, Trisha Yearwood, since 1999. She began experiencing financial difficulties in 2019, and she says Brooks helped by offering her more work.

The woman claims Brooks took advantage of her need for work. She says later in 2019 Brooks exposed his genitals to her. In another instance, Brooks allegedly raped her in a Los Angeles hotel suite while Brooks was preparing for a Grammy tribute.

""With cold disregard for Ms. Roe, when Brooks was finished, it was business as usual,"" the complaint says. ""Ms. Roe worked quickly to style his hair and do his make-up for the event so he was on time.""

The woman says Brooks claimed to get a cryptic text message after the alleged rape that said Brooks ""ruined his life.""

At that point, she had not worked for Brooks for several months, leading Brooks to suspect the woman's husband may have sent the text, the complaint says.

Brooks allegedly told the woman, ""That's what I thought. Oh crap! So, I was trying to seek you out to come talk ... or whatever I needed to do, but just, uh, I don't want to hurt anybody, man. And just ... I just felt bad.""

Throughout her time working for Brooks, from 2017 to 2021, the woman claims he additionally sent her sexually explicit text messages, frequently changed clothes in front of her and groped her regularly while she worked on his hair and makeup.

She is suing for sexual battery and assault, and is requesting monetary and punitive damages, attorney's fees and a jury trial.

Brooks filed a federal lawsuit against the woman last month, claiming she is trying to extort him for money and defame his character, in response to him not making her a salaried employee or paying for medical benefits.

He says the woman sent him a letter in July claiming she was sexually assaulted and that Brooks was plotting to kill her, according to his lawsuit.

Brooks claims he received another letter the next month, in which the woman said she would not go public with her filing if he paid her millions of dollars.

In his statement, Brooks said, ""Hush money, no matter how much or how little, is still hush money. In my mind, that means I am admitting to behavior I am incapable of -- ugly acts no human should ever do to another.""

He is also requesting monetary and punitive damages, attorney's fees and a jury trial, as well as a declaration from the court that the woman's claims are false.

""I trust the system, I do not fear the truth, and I am not the man they have painted me to be,"" he said."

""I really like Kamala Harris because she's got a lot more compassion. It's not about yourself. It's about everybody,"" he explained further.

""I think it's time for history to be made,"" Mandela said.

""I just think that it's going to be a woman president,"" he added.

A new poll released by the New York Times and Siena College found Harris had 48% support in Michigan and Trump had 47%.

Hillary Clinton narrowly lost Michigan to Trump in 2016 despite consistently leading in the polls there, making her the first Democrat to lose the state since Michael Dukakis in 1988. Joe Biden won the state in 2020.

The Trump and Harris campaigns have prioritized Blue Wall states in campaign stops throughout the summer. Trump's 2016 victory was powered by his surprise wins in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, which all had lengthy Democratic winning streaks until then. The winners of the past four elections have won the three states.

Michigan residents also weighed in on which presidential candidate they think would be a stronger leader.

Mandela admitted he thought it was Trump despite his support for Harris.

""I think Trump is [stronger] because I think that Trump is not going to let anybody run over us,"" he said.

When asked who was the stronger leader, Keandre said it was Harris.

""They're going to lean toward Trump because he's already been president,"" he predicted of other Detroiters.

""Not even a question. Donald J. Trump is the best leader we have to lead this nation forward,"" Jeff, a Detroit native, said.

""All of us can become better off financially under Donald Trump. Kamala has no clue about fiscal policies in this country,"" he said, before pointing to rising costs of groceries.

"As October 7th anniversary approaches, Jewish students brace for protests, vow to 'walk proudly'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/october-7th-anniversary-approaches-jewish-students-brace-protests-vow-walk-proudly,2024-10-04T09:11:16Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

With the first anniversary of October 7 fast approaching, universities and college students are bracing for renewed anti-Israel demonstrations on campuses across the United States.

The anniversary of the devastating attacks by Hamas against Israel is likely to exacerbate already inflamed tensions at colleges - further heightened by Iran's unprecedented missile attack against the Jewish state.

Many anti-Israel groups are already planning demonstrations. In particular, the National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) is orchestrating a nationwide ""Week of Rage"" on campuses beginning on the October 7 anniversary.

Cornell undergraduate student Amanda Silberstein suggested that while many students are focused on honoring the memory of innocent lives lost throughout the Israel-Hamas war, SJP is ""choosing to celebrate the day and glorify violence under the guise of resistance.""

JEWS PREPARE TO OBSERVE ROSH HASHANAH AS GROUP STEPS UP TO SECURE COMMUNITY AMID HUGE RISE IN ANTISEMITISM

""This overt dehumanization of Jews not only disrespects all of the victims but also incites Jew hatred on campus,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""It is disheartening to witness such a lack of empathy and understanding on a day that should be reserved for solemn reflection and unity - not for promoting hate and conflict.""

NSJP did not return Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Bela Ingber, a student at NYU, also expressed concern about her local SJP chapter. The group is staging a walkout in Washington Square Park before joining larger protests throughout the city.

She noted that NYU has an open campus, meaning student protests can snowball into much more significant events. Not only do the protests attract students, but outsiders can agitate and take advantage of students to support a larger platform.

Ingber said that she is hopeful the NYPD, in conjunction with NYU campus safety, will attempt to keep the situation under control. Still, she is ""angry, frustrated and sad"" that fellow students will ""continue to justify the murder, rape, and kidnapping of Jews.""

However, Ingber stressed that she is also empowered and motivated.

NEW YORK ANTI-ISRAEL RALLY AT UN FEATURES SIGN SUPPORTING TERROR GROUP HEZBOLLAH

""We are not going anywhere,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""We will not cower in fear and we most certainly will not be intimated. This October 7, as I mourn the innocent lives lost and pray for the brave men and women of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) who continue to fight, I will walk proudly and be a tribute, a public voice of remembrance, for all those beautiful souls who were stolen from us too soon.""

Other students at campuses across the country told Fox News Digital they are preparing for the worst.

University of Pennsylvania student Noah Rubin said that campus leaders are putting together a vigil for the victims of October 7. But many peers, he said, are preparing for professors and fellow students to ""glorify and eulogize"" Hamas terrorism.

He recalled how last year, an anti-Israel encampment at UPenn shouted, ""They should do it again"" while playing footage of the October 7 terrorist attacks.

Just last week, after Israel eliminated Hezbollah's terror organization leader Hassan Nasrallah, Rubin claimed that students and professors at the school organized a vigil for him and other ""martyrs"" in Lebanon.

""There absolutely should be no place on college campuses to mourn the death of terrorists - and yet that is what we expect will continue on October 7 this year,"" he said.

Harvard University student Shabbos Kestenbaum revealed to Fox News Digital that Jewish students at schools like Harvard, including Berkeley, Binghamton and the University of California-Los Angeles, have already hired and coordinated significant security operations to protect their October 7 commemorations.

While Berkeley has not released a statement on October 7 in particular, a school spokesperson told Fox News Digital that campus safety and inclusivity were addressed at the start of the semester in a video message from Berkeley's chancellor and UC's systemwide President, Michael Drake.

The spokesperson also told Fox News Digital that the school has been engaged in scenario discussions and planning.

""Student activism is nothing new on the Berkeley campus and we have established processes for planning and preparation,"" he added.

Kestenbaum called the need for security measures at several schools a ""damning indictment on the state of contemporary American higher education.""

""Many Jewish students don't feel safe because they are objectively not safe,"" he said.

For example, he pointed to the University of Pittsburgh, where five physical assaults against Jewish students have occurred in the last month. He also highlighted a recent attack against a Jewish student at the University of Michigan and a physical assault at Harvard Business School.

Columbia University was one of the major schools rocked by protests over the last year. These protests led to more than 200 arrests on campus and an incident in which agitators stormed into and occupied the university's Hamilton Hall for nearly 24 hours.

Garth Brooks accused of sexual assault in latest controversy to plague country music superstar,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/garth-brooks-accused-sexual-assault-latest-controversy-plague-country-music-superstar,2024-10-04T08:33:35Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Garth Brooks is a country music icon and performer with dozens of hits and millions of albums sold, but he's now facing shocking new allegations, adding to a list of controversies he's faced over the years.

A former makeup artist for Brooks filed a lawsuit Thursday, accusing the singer of sexual assault and battery.

Brooks, 62, allegedly raped ""Jane Roe"" in 2019 during a work trip, according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital. Per the documents, the woman was first hired in 1999 to do the makeup and hairstyling for Brooks' wife, Trisha Yearwood. She began working for Brooks doing makeup and hair in 2017, a few years before the alleged events took place.

Brooks shared a statement with Fox News Digital on Thursday, denying the allegations. ""For the last two months, I have been hassled to no end with threats, lies, and tragic tales of what my future would be if I did not write a check for many millions of dollars. It has been like having a loaded gun waved in my face,"" the statement began.

Brooks continued, ""Hush money, no matter how much or how little, is still hush money. In my mind, that means I am admitting to behavior I am incapable of -- ugly acts no human should ever do to another. We filed suit against this person nearly a month ago to speak out against extortion and defamation of character. We filed it anonymously for the sake of families on both sides.""

GARTH BROOKS ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND BATTERY BY HIS MAKEUP ARTIST IN NEW LAWSUIT

""I want to play music tonight. I want to continue our good deeds going forward. It breaks my heart these wonderful things are in question now. I trust the system, I do not fear the truth, and I am not the man they have painted me to be,"" Brooks' statement concluded.

""I trust the system, I do not fear the truth, and I am not the man they have painted me to be.""

-- Garth Brooks

According to the complaint, Brooks and the makeup artist traveled to Los Angeles in 2019 for a Grammys tribute to R&B singer Sam Moore. Instead of having separate rooms, ""Jane Roe"" claimed only one room was booked for the two of them to share.

""After they arrived, suddenly Brooks appeared in the doorway to the bedroom, completely naked,"" the complaint read. ""He stood there and flexed his muscles. Ms. Roe immediately had a sick feeling in her stomach, knowing she was trapped in the room alone with Brooks, with no one to help and far away from Nashville.""

The country star then allegedly raped her.

Jane Roe's complaint also accused Brooks of openly talking about sex in front of her, exposing his genitals, sharing sexual fantasies with her, texting her explicit messages and groping her breasts. He is also alleged to have taken advantage of her financial hardship at the time, with the frequency of the sexually charged interactions increasing after the 2019 alleged rape.

""We applaud our client's courage in moving forward with her complaint against Garth Brooks,"" attorneys for ""Jane Roe"" said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital. ""The complaint filed today demonstrates that sexual predators exist not only in corporate America, Hollywood and in the rap and rock and roll industries but also in the world of country music.

""We are confident that Brooks will be held accountable for his actions and his efforts to silence our client through the filing of a preemptive complaint in Mississippi was nothing other than an act of desperation and attempted intimidation. We encourage others who may have been victimized to contact us as no survivor should suffer in silence.""

The new allegations against Brooks are by far the most shocking, but he's had his share of controversy throughout his multidecade career.

In 2023, Brooks drew backlash after he entered the fray about Bud Light and its partnership with transgender activist and TikTok star Dylan Mulvaney.

Brooks opened The Friends In Low Places Bar & Honky Tonk in Nashville, Tennessee, and spoke about his plans for the bar in an interview with Billboard, which include selling ""every brand of beer.""

""I want it to be a place you feel safe in. I want it to be a place where you feel like there are manners and people like one another. And, yes, we're going to serve every brand of beer. We just are. It's not our decision to make,"" Brooks said during a panel for Billboard Country Live. ""Our thing is this: If you [are let] into this house, love one another. If you're an a--hole, there are plenty of other places on lower Broadway.""

While some fans were supportive of Brooks, others were vocal in their disapproval of his comments and decision to sell Bud Light.

""If you live in Tennessee, I recommend you never go to @garthbrooks new bar. They're going to sell Bud Light and apparently he thinks we're 'a -- holes' if we don't like it. Make sure all your friends know that,"" one person wrote on Twitter.

Another spoke of getting rid of a collection of Brooks' music, noting, ""My trash bin is full...I threw out everything that had Garth Brooks name on it.""

""I was a huge fan of yours back in the early nineties, before you fell into the trap of being a star...,"" a third wrote. 'It was always about your fans. Now, we're, 'a--holes' for boycotting Budweiser? Welcome to the boycott.""

Brooks has been happily married to fellow country icon Trisha Yearwood for nearly two decades but has admitted he wasn't always the ideal partner.

""I sucked at being a husband. I was horrible at it. I was horrible at being a dad. I had to get my s--- together,"" Brooks told Billboard in 2023.

Before his marriage to Yearwood, Brooks was with his first wife, Sandy Mahl, from 1986 to 2001. They have three daughters together: Taylor, August and Allie.

""I was on the front page of the USA Today for being a bad husband and man,"" Brooks recalled. ""I'd have never survived that if there had been social media, ever.""

In his ""Garth Brooks: The Road I'm On"" documentary, Mahl spoke about the toll the singer's career took on their marriage.

""He'd be gone eight to 10 weeks at a time. He'd come home, [and] there would be No. 1 parties, or shows, or CMAs, or ACMs, American Music Awards. So, it was constantly going. But we both grew apart really, really quickly,"" Mahl said.

""I don't think either of us had stopped to think about how this would change our lives,"" she later added.

In a 2020 interview with Fox News Digital, Brooks said Mahl's perspective surprised him but gave him a greater understanding of their past.

""I heard things from her that she told me our whole life, but I didn't hear them until now,"" he said. ""And so my respect and love for her is through the roof for what she went through and how she's handled it as well.""

Brooks and Mahl finalized their divorce in 2001, and the ""If Tomorrow Never Comes"" singer married Yearwood in 2005.

The couple initially met in the late 1980s but were married to other people and did not pursue a relationship until they were both single.

""I was lucky enough to get to marry my best friend,"" Brooks told Fox News Digital. ""So, here you go. We've known each other since 1988 or '87, and so we've kind of been through it all together. And we've talked about this a long time. If we would have gotten married back in the late '80s, I don't think our marriage would have survived the '90s or our careers would not be what they were.

""So, I think everything happens right at the right time,"" he added. ""And if she was the mother of the children, our three children wouldn't be who they are either. They got the right amount of their mom in them, the right amount of me in them and the right amount of Trisha's influence in them as well. So, I think everything happens for a reason at a time. And I think she would probably tell you the same thing.""

GARTH BROOKS, TRISHA YEARWOOD'S NASHVILLE HONKY-TONK PUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE TEST WHILE WORKING TOGETHER

Brooks released his song ""The Thunder Rolls"" in 1991, with lyrics alluding to cheating and abuse. An additional verse, omitted from Brooks' version but later added by country star Tanya Tucker in her version, also alludes to the wife in the story seeking revenge through murder.

For the music video, Brooks played the part of the cheating and abusive husband, with scenes that hint at the fourth verse's contents. According to the 2009 book ""The Garth Factor: The Career Behind Country Music's Big Boom"" by Patsi Bale Cox, Brooks' label screened the music video for a group of women who approved of the content and considered it a powerful statement against domestic violence.

The violent nature of the music video got it banned by The Nashville Network (TNN) and CMT. A representative for CMT at the time said the network was ""in business to entertain, not to promote or condone gratuitous violence or social issues,"" according to the book.

At the time of the video's controversy, Brooks told Entertainment Weekly, ""This is real life. Where I'm from, people aren't afraid to talk about it.""

Despite the controversy, Brooks won the CMA video of the year award later that year.

In 1992, in the wake of the Los Angeles riots, Brooks released ""We Shall Be Free."" The song imagines a world where people are free from hunger, homelessness, homophobia and racism and have both freedom of religion and speech.

The following year, Brooks was set to perform the national anthem at that year's Super Bowl. He also had an agreement with NBC to air the music video for ""We Shall Be Free"" before the game.

The network initially refused to air the video, which included intense imagery, such as the KKK burning a cross, flag burning, violent incidents, starving children, as well as positive imagery of people coming together.

Brooks reportedly left the stadium 45 minutes before he was to perform. According to his 2019 A&E documentary, ""Garth Brooks: The Road I'm On,"" Brooks felt the network was making excuses for not airing the video.

NBC reportedly looked for a last-minute replacement but ultimately agreed to air the video, and Brooks performed ""The Star Spangled Banner"" as planned, accompanied by Oscar winner Marlee Matlin performing the song in American Sign Language.

According to former NFL Executive Director Don Weiss' book, ""The Making of the Super Bowl: The Inside Story of the World's Greatest Sporting Event,"" Brooks' walking out resulted in the requirement that all Super Bowl renditions of the national anthem be prerecorded.

Brooks celebrated the 25th anniversary of the song in 2017 with an updated music video released on his Facebook page.

""I didn't think it would be controversial, but when this song first came out, it was not welcomed with opened arms,"" Brooks told People in 2017. ""I guess I'm always surprised because, I guess, I'm just one of those ignorant guys who thinks that everybody kinda feels the same and, man, we don't.""

GARTH BROOKS PERFORMING AT BIDEN'S INAUGURATION, JOKES HE'LL BE 'ONLY REPUBLICAN' THERE

After 10 years of dominating the charts, Brooks unexpectedly presented his alter ego, Chris Gaines.

Gaines was a fictional rock musician from Australia with dark hair and a soul patch. The character appeared in a mock episode of VH1's ""Behind the Music,"" and there was even a potential Chris Gaines biopic. When Brooks hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" that year, he appeared as himself but performed as Gaines as the episode's musical guest.

An album was released, ""Garth Brooks in...The Life of Chris Gaines,"" put together as a greatest hits of Gaines' previous (and nonexistent) five albums. Despite the confusion created by the character, Brooks scored a Billboard Top 40 pop single with the song ""Lost In You.""

In a recent interview during Billboard Country Live, Brooks said he still loved the character and was interested in doing more with Gaines.

""The Gaines project was a lot of time put in because it's not natural. You're acting on a record, but I want to do it simply for people who love the Gaines project,"" the 61-year-old said.

""And, selfishly, I love the Chris Gaines record. So, I want to do it for me. It challenged me as a vocalist,"" added Brooks. ""So I don't know when we're going to get to it, but it's on the list."""
"Serial killers hide as long-haul truckers to terrorize America's highways, expert says",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/serial-killers-hide-long-haul-truckers-terrorize-america-highways-expert-says,2024-10-04T08:24:04Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Serial killers could be working as long-haul truckers in the United States.

The FBI launched its Highway Serial Killings Initiative in 2009 after analysts noticed a pattern of murdered women - most living transient lifestyles involving drug abuse and prostitution - who had been killed and dumped along the Interstate 40 corridor in Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to its website.

Using the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program, which is a national database between law enforcement branches that contains information on homicides, sexual assaults, missing people and unidentified human remains, analysts amassed a list of hundreds of victims along highways nationwide and hundreds of suspects, predominantly long-haul truckers.

FBI'S 'FLAWED' CRIME DATA HIGHLIGHTED BY CHICAGO'S 118 'MISSING MURDERS': EXPERT

Frank Figliuzzi, a former assistant director of the FBI who spent 25 years with the agency, released a book this year on the subject, ""Long Haul: Hunting the Highway Serial Killers.""

In the book, he writes that there have been approximately 850 murders along America's highways since 1980, and that about 200 of them are unsolved.

""Oftentimes, the people who are at the highest risk for being kidnapped or harmed by a serial killer are the people who are the most invisible, the least likely to have connections to their families and may or may not have a trafficker,"" said Dominique Roe-Sepowitz, the director of Arizona State University's Office of Sex Trafficking Intervention Research.

""The casual reference [to a woman selling sex at truck stops along interstate highways] is a 'Lot Lizard.' They are often very transient and often suffer from substance abuse disorders. They are very likely to not be missed, to be easily lured in by a truck driver with some money,"" she said. ""It's a low level of screening and a low level of personal safety.""

ALABAMA PLUMBER ALLEGEDLY TRIED TO HIRE HIT MAN TO KILL WIFE, 6 ADULT KIDS: 'TAKE YOUR TIME'

There are between 300,000 and 500,000 long-haul truckers in America, NPR reported, and the majority of them are upstanding workers committed to keeping the supply chain moving.

But the mobile nature of truckers' lifestyles and the multiple jurisdictions that they travel through lends itself to a scarcity of witnesses and a lower chance of getting caught should they pick up, murder and dump vulnerable sex workers and transients.

""There are 25 long-haul truckers already in prison for multiple murders,"" Figliuzzi told NewsNation. ""There have been cases in the greater Cincinnati and the larger Ohio area.""

DOJ INSPECTOR GENERAL DOES NOT DENY FBI INFORMANTS WERE AMONG JAN 6 CROWD

The program led to the capture and arrest of suspects believed to be responsible for homicides across the country, according to the FBI's website.

Supervisory Special Agent Richard J. Kolko of the FBI's National Press Office told Fox News Digital last week that the program is ""no more,"" but he did not divulge specifics of the program's results or what led to its closure.

Roe-Sepowitz said the halted program is ""just one more cut in a very bleeding situation where women who are vulnerable are simply not being seen.""

""It's one more way that people can take advantage and participate in violence against girls and women,"" she said. ""There is no national tracking of traffickers.""

GET REAL TIME UPDATES DIRECTLY ON THE TRUE CRIME HUB

""Without that unit at the FBI level, that interstate level, there is nothing that is connecting those crimes,"" she continued. ""This is a loss for intelligence. They won't see the patterns because who else is looking for them? The answer is no one.""

Roe-Sepowitz noted that most long-haul truckers are certainly not serial killers or sex traffickers. In fact, one group called Truckers Against Trafficking has trained 235,329 truckers to spot and intervene in human trafficking situations, according to its website.

""Truckers are not always villains,"" Roe-Sepowitz said. ""They can be part of the solution. They can look out for victims. They can help rescue people. They can be part of our caring, loving community. But something needs to change."""
"South Carolina killer mom Susan Smith, who drowned sons, up for release as experts sound alarm",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/south-carolina-killer-mom-susan-smith-who-drowned-sons-up-for-release-experts-sound-alarm,2024-10-04T08:14:07Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Susan Smith, the South Carolina mother who drowned her two young sons in a lake in the 1990s, is up for a parole hearing in a month.

Smith, then 22, strapped her sons, Michael and Alexander Smith, into the back seat of her car in October 1994, and watched as she let the car roll into John D. Lake in Union County. It took six minutes for the two boys, one 3 years old and the other just 14 months, to drown.

""She spent nine days claiming that the carjacker had taken the kids and asking for help, so the search was going on,"" former Union County prosecutor Tommy Pope, now a South Carolina state representative, told Fox News Digital. ""Truthfully, I believed she probably had [the kids] hidden somewhere just because, based on my law enforcement experience, I didn't think that a carjacker would take children.""

Specifically, Smith lied to investigators and the press after killing her sons, falsely claiming a Black man had carjacked her with Michael and Alexander inside the vehicle.

""She was on every major station, 'Good Morning America,' you name it, she was doing it, and she was pleading for the kids,"" Pope recalled. ""The one thing I saw from the beginning - I had some video footage from a local TV station that actually went to the house that she went to that night when she claimed she was carjacked. And [Smith's] husband, David, was called to the scene. And of course, he looked like someone who was just told his kids had been kidnaped. And Susan was kind of giddy about being on television. I think she really loved the attention.""

SUSAN SMITH, NEARING PAROLE AFTER MURDERS OF YOUNG SONS, SAYS SHE'D BE 'GOOD STEPMOM': REPORT

As far as a motive, Pope said Smith was having an extramarital affair at the time with Tom Findlay, the son of a local, wealthy business owner, who wrote Smith a letter a week before the murders telling the 22-year-old woman that while he was interested in her romantically, he was not suited to raise children, as the Birmingham News reported in a 2005 interview with Findlay.

And I think she took it to heart because she envisioned a life of luxury with a rich person,"" said Andrea Peyser, a New York Post columnist who reported on the murders in 1994 and authored a book about the case called ""Mother Love, Deadly Love: The Susan Smith Murders.""

Meanwhile, over the course of her 30 years in prison, Smith, now 52, has reportedly engaged in a sexual relationship with prison guards, a prison source said in an interview with People in 2020.

""She's not having a horrible time behind bars.""

-- Andrea Peyser

Pope sought the death penalty for Smith during her trial in 1995, and he does not think she should be eligible for parole today.

""Some of the jurors, after the fact, even said they gave her life under the theory she would be remorseful and spend her time thinking about Michael and Alex. Well, she has proved from her conduct in prison that she's had sexual relations with guards, she's got Facebook friends and sugar daddies waiting for her to get out,"" Pope said. ""She is focused on what's best for Susan, not what happened to Michael and Alex.""

Peyser also does not believe Smith should be eligible for parole, given her lack of remorse or ownership for her actions during her three decades behind bars.

""She had caused so much damage, she led to the investigation of all kinds of innocent men. It's unfair in every way. She's just a really sad and horrible person,"" Peyser said.

Peyser described the town of Union as ""slightly insane"" at the time she was covering the case.

""She was, of course, a woman who grew up there, lived there most of her life, and the town kind of embraced her while blaming her husband, who is really blameless in this situation. So the whole thing was really horrible,"" Peyser recalled.

'About Mannequin' Short Film Qualifies For Oscar Consideration,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomteicholz/2024/10/04/about-mannequin-short-film-qualifies-for-oscars/,2024-10-04T07:22:16Z,"Last year I traveled to the Republic of Georgia in November where my friends Giorgi Rtskhiladze and his wife Ayanat Ksenbai renewed their wedding vows in a beautiful ceremony in a 6 Century monastery. I returned shortly after, but Giorgi and Ayanat, who were originally scheduled to return after a brief visit to Ayanat's native Kazakhstan, stayed on for the next eight months.

Turns out what they were doing is making an almost 40-minute short film, About Mannequin, directed by 34-year-old director Aruzhan Dossymoka, and that was shot in Almaty, Kazakhstan's former capital with a Kazakh crew. The film, which has just opened in San Francisco and will soon be shown in New York and Los Angeles, has qualified for Oscar consideration in the short film category. And it could well win.

Produced by Ayanat Ksenbai and Marvin Peart in partnership with Foresee Films' Carr Bettis and Giorgi Rtskhiladze and WonderHill Studios, the film stars Ayanat, who is one of Kazakhstan's most beloved actors. As a teenager she worked with such revered directors as Milos Forman, Sergei Bodrov and Ivan Passer in Nomad, and Volker Schlondorff in Ulzhan. About Mannequin is Ayanat's return to the screen after raising her three young children and she delivers a mature and masterful performance that is as heart-wrenching as it is haunting.

About Mannequin is a striking film in many ways. From a story and script written by Ayanat and Giorgi, About Mannequin is a Black and White film with very little dialogue. It is a modern silent film that tells a mysterious story about a cursed wedding dress and the woman, played by Ayanat, who comes under its spell and must marshal her strength to break free and get revenge.

A drama, the film has surrealist moments where the viewer is not sure of what is real and what a dream. There are leaps of logic in the narrative which, as viewers, we come to accept. We never know what country, or what time period the film is set, and even what language is being spoken (this is actually one of the first films in the US to feature the Kazakh language). Strangely enough, this makes the film universal and able to be understood by people all over the world. The film resonates with echoes of Old Hollywood, while marrying them to Kazakh traditions of storytelling.

The moving score by Giorgi and Beka Gochiashvili and the haunting main song, sung by Lucia, add to the film's eerie spell as does Stephanie Michelle Bettis' production design and the stunning wedding dress designed by Aydana Omorova.

What is transcendent about the film is that at its core, About Mannequin is a story about a mother and the power of women to believe in things greater than themselves. It is a film whose power stays with you long after the credits end."

(FOX 13 Seattle)

A Washington state woman was stalked and robbed at gunpoint at an ATM amid a continued crime crisis raging on the West Coast.

Surveillance video, obtained by FOX 13, showed the robbery taking place by a Bank of America in Parkland, Washington, a suburb of Seattle, on Thursday, Sept. 26.

The footage captured a figure in a ski mask hiding in the shadows as an unsuspecting woman arrives at the bank and goes about withdrawing money from the ATM.

After the woman had withdrawn her money, the suspect emerged from the bushes and approached the woman, holding her up at gunpoint and demanding her money.

SEATTLE BUSINESS OWNERS WARN VIOLENT CRIME IS HAPPENING ON A NEAR HOURLY BASIS: 'THIS IS MADNESS'

The Pierce County Sheriff's office said that the ski-masked suspect retreated - along with the $1,000 and the victim's passport.

""It's a random act of violence,"" Sergeant Darren Moss of the Pierce County Sheriff's Department said.

""That makes him extremely dangerous to our community,"" he said. ""We want to get this person in custody because we don't want him to do this to someone else.""

The ATM robbery comes after local business owners have voiced their continued concerns about the crime crisis.

Pat Callahan, the CEO of Urban Renaissance Group, told the Business Journal that while there has been some improvement, the crime problem is still yet to be solved. He claimed that many tenants at his downtown property are considering leaving the area.

""Really, what's happening now is all the fentanyl use is bringing consistent crime to the area, and it's festering,"" he said.

URG Executive Vice President Shawn Jackson echoed his sentiments and told the outlet that conditions have become ""somewhat extreme."" He revealed that one individual recently started a garbage truck fire near the company's Joshua Green Building.

""These are property damage events that happen quite frequently,"" he said. ""We can't let the challenges of several concentrated blocks in our downtown define our identity.""

Commercial real estate broker Tom Graff said the current approach to crime is not working and is ""not sustainable.""

The business leader's sentiment comes as the number of violent crimes in downtown Seattle fell by 10% in 2023 from 2022. It was the lowest number since 2018.

CAJUN NAVY ACTIVATES IN HURRICANE HELENE AFTERMATH, SAYS DEVASTATION COMPARABLE TO KATRINA

JESSE WATTERS: Over 220 Americans dead from Hurricane Helene. Hundreds still missing and loved ones crying in agony. Cadaver dogs have joined search and rescue crews to sniff out bodies stuck under structures. One North Carolina woman lost her parents and her seven-year-old.

Helene is the third-deadliest hurricane in American history, right behind Katrina and Sandy. If you survived, you're living without food, power, a roof over your head, and you're begging for help.

Sources say over a thousand troops in North Carolina are just sitting around doing nothing, waiting for orders that haven't come. They haven't heard from the North Carolina governor and the Biden administration's blocking ongoing rescue operations.

The hurricane left thousands homeless and the federal government is saying, sorry, can't stay here, no vacancy. This is like when FEMA plopped down at the Four Seasons during the Maui fires. Remember that? And Mayor Pete won't let anybody fly drones to scout for survivors."
Utah State is fourth school to forfeit women's volleyball match amid San Jose State trans player controversy,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/utah-state-becomes-4th-school-forfeit-womens-volleyball-match-amid-san-jose-state-trans-player-controversy,2024-10-04T00:53:14Z,"Macy Petty, a Concerned Women for America legislative assistant and an NCAA college volleyball player, discussed the controversy with San Jose State University's volleyball team.

The Utah State Aggies are the latest women's volleyball team to choose not to participate in a scheduled match against San Jose State University due to a biological male playing on its women's team.

The university issued a statement saying it would not be participating in its Oct. 23 volleyball match at SJSU.

""The University will abide by Mountain West Conference policy regarding how this match is recorded,"" the statement said.

A San Jose State spokeperson also confirmed to Fox News Digital that the Aggies informed the team the match has been canceled, and Utah State will be assessed a loss due to forfeit.

Utah State would be the fourth team to forfeit a match with SJSU if it's made official. Southern Utah, Boise State and the University of Wyoming all did so. None of the three schools previously provided a reason behind the forfeit other than understanding the consequences to their win-loss records.

When Boise State forfeited its match with SJSU, the NCAA provided OutKick with a statement in response.

""College sports are the premier stage for women's sports in America, and the NCAA members will continue to promote Title IX, make unprecedented investments in women's sports and ensure fair competition for all student-athletes in all NCAA championships.""

FEMALE ATHLETES 'BLINDSIDED' ON VOLLEYBALL COURT WITH TRANS PLAYER PROMPTS CIVIL RIGHTS COMPLAINT, LAWSUIT

Blaire Fleming, a transgender redshirt senior at SJSU, has been at the center of the controversial forfeits. SJSU is undefeated this season, and Fleming, at 6-foot-1, has helped the Spartans in their efforts.

Brooke Slusser, Fleming's teammate, joined former NCAA swimmer Riley Gaines and other female athletes who are suing the NCAA over policies regarding transgender athletes, claiming the current system is compromising the fairness and integrity of women's sports and putting women at risk.

Gaines said she commended Boise State's athletic department and everyone involved in the decision to forfeit its match, and she praised Utah State when seeing the statement before it was taken down.

""This kind of unity is what I (and many others who have worked far longer than me) have been pushing for over the past two years,"" Gaines tweeted. ""The gender ideology house of cards is crumbling, and it's a glorious sight.""

Speaker of the Utah House of Representatives Mike Schultz also commended the Utah State and Southern Utah women's volleyball teams.

""We stand behind you and are cheering you on!"" he wrote on X. ""Thank you for standing up for not only yourselves, but for women across the country - current and future generations! It's time for the NCAA to take action to protect our female athletes and preserve women's sports. Thank you to the athletes and the universities for doing what's right!""

Macy Petty, a Concerned Women of America legislative assistant and NCAA volleyball player, spoke with Fox News Digital's Sarah Rumpf-Whitten about how players are feeling ""blindsided"" because the NCAA has not informed teams of the presence of transgender players on opposing squads.

""There's no informed consent for the schools or for the female athletes here. They're totally blindsided when they walk up to the court, and they see that there's a male athlete on the other side,"" Petty said.

""Female athletes were put in this odd position of showing up on the court and looking at the other side and realizing that something was different about this game. I've never seen an athlete play like this before, which makes total sense considering that this athlete, first of all, is not female, but the net is seven inches shorter than it should be for male players.""

Slusser said she joined Gaines and others in the lawsuit against the NCAA because she was not aware Fleming was transgender despite sharing rooms together on team trips.

""Brooke estimates that Fleming's spikes were traveling upward of 80 mph, which was faster than she had ever seen a woman hit a volleyball,"" Slusser's complaint said, via the Cowboy State Daily. ""The girls were doing everything they could to dodge Fleming's spikes but still could not fully protect themselves."""

Latina Equal Pay Day is a reminder that we can't afford to be humble,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/career-growth/latina-equal-pay-day-reminder-cant-afford-humble-rcna173928,2024-10-03T20:51:59Z,"Daniela Pierre-Bravo, author of ""The Other: How to Own Your Power at Work as a Woman of Color.""Anthony Scutro / MSNBC

As a Latina who reports on women in the workplace, I've learned gains for women do not happen equally. Despite Latinas being highly ambitious and part of the fastest growing demographic in the U.S., their lack of advancement in the workplace has remained stagnant and continue to be an incredible cause for concern.

Latinas are undervalued at work, and they come in dead last in terms of equal pay compared to other groups. In fact, Oct. 3 marks the day in the calendar year when Latinas finally catch up to what a non-Hispanic, white man earned last year. In 2024, Latinas working full time and part time, make -- on average -- 51 cents for every dollar paid to a white, non-Hispanic male (down from 52 cents last year).

This inequity starts early. Latinas enter their careers as the most underrepresented group in corporate America, and this year they faced the steepest drop in early career promotions compared to their male counterparts.

And according to new research from Lean In and McKinsey, for every 100 men who received their first promotion, only 65 Latina women did. This is what's called the ""broken rung,"" and Latinas face not one, but two of them. After being overlooked for management roles, they are again passed over for senior leadership roles. And then, by the time they reach the C-suite, they are the least represented (at just 1 percent), followed by Black women and Asian women (both at 3 percent). With a cumulative loss of over $1.2 million in lifetime earnings, the stakes have never been higher for Latinas.

The driving forces behind these inequalities are complex and multilayered.

We know by now that external factors like unconscious biases are to blame. Many of the Latinas I've interviewed said they've felt sidelined at work. They cited examples of being told by their managers that they are not a ""cultural fit,"" that they feel ""overlooked,"" or that they have ""mistaken for the secretary in meetings.""

Those biases by themselves can create harmful repercussions for Latinas and can further hinder their ability to self-advocate -- a key component in moving up the ladder.

In my book ""The Other,"" I share the stories of Latinas grappling with factors like guilt, a pressure to assimilate (therefore downplaying their identity), and being prone to risk aversion as they navigate their careers. Being a Latina immigrant myself, and having been the first in my family to go to college and earn a 401K, I relate to other Latinas who have cited feeling guilty when it comes to asking for more pay or advancement at work; worried we'll look ungrateful. As immigrants and children of immigrants we're acutely aware of the sacrifices that afforded us a chance at the American Dream. In turn, that self-imposed accountability can leave us ""playing it safe"" at work for fear of ruffling feathers and losing out on professional opportunities -- even when we are being undervalued. It can confine us into a loop of reactivity and keep us stuck in a ""customer service"" mentality.

I've heard time and time again from Latinas that they're reminded by their mothers and abuelitas of the importance of being humble. Yet the biggest fallacy we've assumed about corporate America is that our employers will notice our hard work when the time is right.

This is one of the many reasons Latinas need more career sponsors, not just mentors. We need more women, and yes men, advocating for Latinas in rooms they're not in, while helping provide access to spaces of power. We need more leaders to speak up and credit Latinas when ideas originate from them, and to be aware of conscious biases and push back on them in real time. Latinas also need pay transparency and allies who are committed to help grow their negotiating power by disclosing the real numbers behind the pay they deserve.

It's not only in the interest of Latinas to advance up the ladder, but also in the companies that hire them. Data shows that Latinas are highly committed to their growth -- Nearly 90 percent of Latinas say they're interested in getting promoted to the next level at work, compared with 78 percent of white women and 81 percent of women overall. It is a collective responsibility to lift up and change this bleak trajectory for Latinas. The time for commitment on advancement and sponsorship for Latina women is now."
The 'Hawk Tuah' Creator's Podcast Ranks No. 5 On Spotify -- Here's How She Kept The Meme Going For Months,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/10/03/the-hawk-tuah-creators-podcast-ranks-no-5-on-spotify-heres-how-she-kept-the-meme-going-for-months/,2024-10-03T20:46:39Z,"Haliey Welch, the woman who achieved internet fame this summer for her sexually explicit ""hawk tuah"" catchphrase, has turned her viral moment into a successful podcasting venture as her new ""Talk Tuah"" show ranks in the top five on Spotify's top podcast chart.

Welch's ""hawk tuah"" phrase became an instantly viral meme in June when she was interviewed by TikTok user @DMarloww, who asks questions to passersby on the street. He asked her what ""move in bed makes a man go crazy,"" prompting Welch to say: ""You gotta give him that 'hawk tuah.'"" The phrase was instantly mimicked and remixed by users on TikTok, and the #hawktuah hashtag has been used in more than 250,000 posts to date. Within two weeks of her viral interview, Welch said she had already sold thousands of hats bearing the ""hawk tuah"" phrase.

Welch, a 21-year-old from the small town of Belfast, Tennessee, maintained her fame in the weeks since her viral TikTok moment, with a series of high-profile appearances and social media activity. She created an Instagram account in July, which now has 2.6 million followers, and has posted pictures with Matt Rife and JoJo Siwa. She appeared onstage with country singer Zach Bryan in June, threw out the first pitch at a New York Mets game in August and was parodied in a Saturday Night Live sketch last weekend, in which she was portrayed by Chloe Fineman. She signed to an agent in Nashville and founded a company, 16 Minutes LLC, under which she has registered trademarks for merchandise. Welch also sells ""Talk Tuah"" merch, including hoodies and hats with phrases like ""'Talk Tuah' Changed My Life"" and ""'Talk Tuah' '24."" Welch also said on Instagram she launched a foundation, Paws Across America, to raise funds and awareness for animal welfare charities. She has since posted several Instagram videos at various animal shelters, urging followers to make donations.

Marquette University journalism professor Patrick Johnson told Fast Company that Welch may be benefitting from a boom in the conservative podcasting space, even though Welch's podcast is not about politics and she has not stated her political views. He said she is a ""southern belle who is very visibly someone that conservatives would code as one of their own,"" and she has a ""shock jock edge to her that conservatives love.""

Melania Trump's abortion views in new memoir spur outrage from pro-lifers: 'She is wrong',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/melania-trumps-abortion-views-new-memoir-spur-outrage-from-pro-lifers-she-wrong,2024-10-03T20:43:32Z,"Former first lady Melania Trump opens up about her life before, during and after the White House in a sit-down interview on 'Fox & Friends.'

Former first lady Melania Trump is drawing heat from pro-life advocates over an excerpt in her memoir where she suggests a woman's right to choose an abortion is a ""fundamental right of individual liberty,"" according to a report Wednesday.

Melania Trump wife of Republican presidential candidate and former President Trump, wrote the memoir entitled ""Melania"" that is scheduled to come out on Oct. 8, per the Amazon release date. In the book, according to a preview by The Guardian, Melania expresses a viewpoint that has historically been at odds with the Republican Party's platform.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,"" Melania reportedly wrote.

TRUMP RISKS LOSING SOME PRO-LIFE VOTERS UNLESS HE CHANGES 'HIS TUNE' ON ABORTION, ACTIVIST WARNS

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.

""Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

The excerpts quickly drew the ire of pro-life advocates who have already been disgruntled by some of Trump's seemingly ambiguous comments regarding abortion.

""Melania Trump's support of abortion is anti-feminist and clearly outside the teaching of our Catholic faith. She is wrong,"" wrote Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America advocacy group.

PRO-LIFERS BLAST TRUMP 'BETRAYAL' WITH SHIFTING ABORTION STANCE, ANSWER ON FLORIDA AMENDMENT 4

Lila Rose, founder of leading pro-life advocacy group Live Action, also responded to a promotional video Melania posted for her memoir in which she states, ""Individual freedom is a fundamental principle that I safeguard... what does my body my choice really mean?""

""Who is this Melania Trump, or Kamala Harris? Functionally the same exact position on abortion,"" Rose wrote on X.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

President of pro-life advocacy group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Marjorie Dannenfelser, wrote on X: ""The women of America are capable of great strength and creativity. They are naturally inclined to speak for those who are powerless. Abortion is not the source of their freedom and liberation.""

In August, Trump sparked confusion among pro-life supporters about where he stood on an amendment that would upend Florida's ban on abortions after six weeks' gestation. Trump, after saying ""I think the six-week is too short, there has to be more time,"" to an NBC reporter when asked how he would vote, later walked it back and said he would vote against the amendment.

Other spouses of Republican presidents, such as Pat Nixon, Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Laura Bush, have been recorded either during or after their husbands' tenure in office expressing pro-choice views.

Veteran in subway vigilante case wasn't told he killed madman threatening passengers during interrogation,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/veteran-subway-vigilante-case-wasnt-told-he-killed-madman-threatening-passengers-during-interrogation,2024-10-03T20:37:02Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

An NYPD detective testified in court Thursday that the New York veteran accused of manslaughter in connection with the death of an erratic man who barged onto a subway car and threatened passengers had not been told the man had died when he waived his Miranda rights and agreed to speak with detectives.

Lawyers for Daniel Penny, a 25-year-old Marine Corps veteran, told Fox News Digital there is ""overwhelming evidence that Danny was justified in the actions he took to protect the commuters on that train."" They are questioning whether police had probable cause to detain him and whether statements prosecutors plan to use against him at trial were properly obtained.

Penny was charged after he appeared on cellphone video placing Jordan Neely, 30, in a chokehold as other passengers helped restrain him in May 2023.

The defense called NYPD investigators to the stand Thursday to grill them about whether there was probable cause to arrest their client to begin with.

KEY WITNESSES IN DANIEL PENNY, JORDAN NEELY CASE REFUSE TO COOPERATE WITH DA BRAGG'S OFFICE: REPORT

Penny had not been told that Neely was dead during his questioning, NYPD Detective Michael Medina testified. He and a colleague let Penny go after interviewing other witnesses. They initially dubbed him a ""good Samaritan.""

Medina, a 23-year member of the NYPD, was the first of five officers involved in the investigation to testify Thursday.

Penny was treated as a witness during the interview and was not placed in handcuffs, he said. Their conversation was recorded on video. Penny waived his Miranda rights. There was another detective, whose last name is McCarthy, in the room with them.

Prosecutors played video from the interview in court Thursday.

It shows Penny calmly cooperating with the detectives, explaining that he's a Marine veteran and studying to be an architect. He said he was on his way to the gym after class at the time of the altercation.

US MARINE VET DANIEL PENNY PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO MANSLAUGHTER IN CHOKEHOLD DEATH OF JORDAN NEELY

According to testimony at the Thursday hearing, Neely barged onto the train after the 10th Street station, ripped his jacket off and threatened to ""kill anybody,"" he said.

""He was acting like a lunatic, like a crazy person,"" Penny told detectives. He said after Neely tossed his jacket, he shouted something along the lines of, ""If I don't get this, this and this, I'll go to jail forever.""

There were women and children on the train, and Penny perceived a threat. When Neely walked into him, he said, he put him in a chokehold.

""I'm not trying to kill the guy,"" he told detectives. ""I'm just trying to de-escalate the situation.""

He said that two other men on the train helped him hold Neely down as they waited for police to arrive.

""People do this all the time, but this guy, he was actually a threat,"" he told the officers. Medina and McCarthy told him he would be detained for the time being, and he asked for a lawyer.

A public safety officer testified that when he arrived at the train, he saw Neely unconscious on the ground and asked what happened. The witnesses pointed to Penny, he said, identifying the defendant in the courtroom.

He said witnesses told him that Neely boarded the train, began making threats, and Penny ""took him out."" Bodycam video showed Penny remained at the scene and cooperated with responding officers.

Neely was unconscious when police arrived but had a pulse, the public safety officer testified. However, responding officers later tried giving him CPR and administered Narcan, a heroin antidote used to revive people during overdoses.

The next witness was Officer Dennis Kang, a 5-year veteran who also responded to the train car and met Penny at the scene. He said witnesses described Neely as ""erratic"" and said Penny was ""stopping"" him. Other people on the train appeared to be supportive of Penny, he said.

The judge said he would not be releasing video played in court Thursday to the media because the trial has not yet begun.

Penny's lawyers are arguing that police had no cause to arrest him, and they are questioning whether any statements they intend to use against him were improperly obtained.

""The Government must demonstrate that any statements they intend to use at trial were not obtained through coercion or threats,"" one of his attorneys, Steve Raiser, told Fox News Digital earlier. ""In addition, they will need to prove that probable cause existed to believe that a crime was committed. Our position will be that despite the low level of evidence necessary to demonstrate probable cause, the police did not have sufficient evidence. This is especially true considering the overwhelming evidence that Danny was justified in the actions he took to protect the commuters on that train.""

Witnesses said the homeless Neely was threatening subway riders and behaving aggressively. He had a history of mental illness and violence, including the 2021 assault of a 67-year-old woman.

Police questioned and released Penny on the day of the incident, but 11 days later, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office announced an indictment on charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. He has pleaded not guilty.

Critics of Bragg's decision to prosecute Penny have called the move political and believe that the veteran acted in self-defense and to protect other passengers.

""I don't care if I have to kill an F, I will,"" Neely had allegedly ranted. ""I'll go to jail, I'll take a bullet.""

Prosecutors said last year that they had obtained at least five eyewitness videos of the encounter and surveillance video they planned to introduce as evidence.

Penny faces up to 19 years in prison if convicted. His trial was slated to begin before the end of the month."
"One Year In, Amy Pope's Plan To Reshape The Conversation on Migration",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephaniefillion/2024/10/03/one-year-in-amy-popes-plan-to-reshape-the-conversation-on-migration/,2024-10-03T19:55:25Z,"When Amy Pope became director of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) one year ago, she took an unconventional route to leadership.

A Biden administration official, Pope had been IOM's deputy director general for management and reform and since 2021. When the time came to choose the organization's next leader, she decided to run against her boss, António Vitorino, a high-level Portuguese lawyer and politician

""I feel like within our organization, there was a real interest in having someone bring fresh ideas and fresh perspective made from silly things,"" Pope said in an interview on the sideline of the UN General Assembly in September, ""like bringing a style of leadership that's more inclusive, seeking the input of various IOM workers from around the world wherever they are... Being unafraid to be human, doing things like dancing with migrants when we go out and they're presenting to us or showing us things they've learned, or sitting down and talking to people one to one.""

Vitorino had been leading the organization since 2018, but in her campaign, Pope insisted IOM needed a new type of leadership because Vitorino had an ""older generation approach."" She also said the organization's leader should spend more time traveling to talk to communities served by IOM.

But in her campaign, Pope was not only bringing a new generation of leadership to the organization, she was also returning a top job to American hands. At the UN, some leadership jobs are dominated by specific, powerful countries, and in the case of the IOM, the United States had occupied the top job for 50 years until the Trump administration brought forward Ken Isaacs, a Christian charity executive with a history of anti-Islam comments. Vitorino then got the job, and Pope joined IOM as a deputy director shortly after Biden took office. With the support of the Biden administration, Pope ran a six-month campaign while on unpaid leave, visited over 40 countries, and ended up getting the job.

One year in, Pope said she has executed on many of her campaign promises. On the organizational front, she has pushed for more visits on the ground and closer work with IOM teams around the world. ""I felt it was really important to demonstrate to our workforce and to our member states that IOM work is out in the world,"" she said. ""It's not in Geneva.""

Pope has also appointed a new executive team; the organization's leadership is now mostly women, ""all representing different parts of the world, all who travel, and all who I hope will amplify the work we're doing,"" she said.

Pope herself has also implemented her campaign promise to spend more time in the field. So far, she's traveled to over 40 countries in a year and said she has visited 90 countries overall since campaigning for the top job. She believes that her leadership and generation are already proving successful in the organization's ""new"" culture. She also believes that being the first woman to lead IOM brings something different to the table.

""Wherever they are, from being unafraid to be human, doing things like dancing with migrants when we go out... they're presenting to us or showing us things they've learned, or sitting down and talking to people one to one,"" Pope said. ""So, I feel like what was maybe missing, or what has been welcomed, is just this very human perspective, which I think is more typical of a new generation of leaders. I also think, frankly, being a woman means I'm not afraid to be emotional.""

More than anything, Pope wants to focus on communications. With hard-right political parties becoming increasingly popular around the world, the topic of migration is often at the forefront of political debates and scapegoated by those parties.

In her own country, former President Donald Trump controversially repeated in the presidential debate a baseless story about Haitian migrants eating pets. While she won't get involved in specific political debates, Pope wants to emphasize the benefits of migration in many U.S. cities and throughout the world.

""If you look at the election politics, you would think migration is just this huge problem, and it has to be stopped,"" she said, ""but if you widen the scope a little bit, and you look, for example, at post- Covid economic recovery, the United States' strong economic recovery is in large part due to the fact that there has been a continued number of migrants who are coming in.""

Pope is also trying to change the way people talk and think about migration and wishes to make it more central to policy discussions.

""I think the mistake has always been to keep migration as an afterthought, as opposed to really bringing it into the strategic conversation,"" she said. ""That's what we're trying to do, whether it's how do we build more sustainable solutions to climate change, how do we deal with the demographic changes that are happening around the world. How do we deal with globalization of skills and labor?""

A year in, Pope feels good about how she's carried out her vision, but she's unsure if she can maintain the same pace for the rest of her term.

""It was really critical to just get out and hear from the members, to hear from the migrants themselves, to talk to our workforce, and it was critical in terms of setting my own agenda and priorities and the organizational reform,"" she said, ""I don't know that I need to do another 40 next year."""

""Sixty-two percent of Americans oppose overthrowing Roe v. Wade, 62%, the Republican Party knows this. I think they put her up to this. I think it's a big scam. They put her out there, you know, as the face of, like, the American population that wants to have abortion rights,"" Behar claimed.

Melania reveals in her new memoir that she is pro-choice, according to reports. The former first lady doubled down on what she wrote in a video posted to social media on Thursday and said, ""Without a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth.

Co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin agreed that it was a ""strategic"" move.

""I think she hates him. Okay, so we can all agree that. That's a given. I also think that she wants to take him out. She does not want to be the first lady anymore.

Emhoff denies report he slapped ex-girlfriend outside ritzy overseas movie event,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/emhoff-denies-report-he-slapped-ex-girlfriend-outside-ritzy-overseas-movie-event,2024-10-03T19:27:11Z,"MSNBC host Jen Psaki asked Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff about redefining the view of masculinity by openly supporting his wife Vice President Kamala Harris.

Second gentleman Doug Emhoff denied the veracity of a Daily Mail report in which three unnamed sources accused him of having slapped a former girlfriend during a 2012 trip to the Cannes Film Festival.

Fox News Digital has not been able to independently confirm the allegations.

""This report is untrue,"" an unnamed representative for Vice President Kamala Harris' husband told news outlet Semafor. ""Any suggestion that he would or has ever hit a woman is false.""

The Daily Mail's exclusive story on Tuesday quoted a trio of unidentified sources who claim Emhoff slapped his then-girlfriend while the couple waited in a valet line following an event in Nice, France, in 2012. The alleged altercation was purportedly sparked when the woman - identified only by the pseudonym ""Jane"" and described as a successful New York attorney - flirted with a valet, according to the article.

The Harris campaign, the Office of the Vice President and a representative for Emhoff's ex-wife, Kerstin Emhoff, did not comment despite repeated requests from Fox News.

Several media outlets, including Semafor, noted they had been unable to match the Daily Mail's reporting and legacy media companies such as the New York Times have yet to report on the claims.

The Daily Mail's article hinged on the recollections of three people described as being Jane's friends. The outlet said its sources requested anonymity due to fear of retaliation from Emhoff. The three friends reportedly provided the outlet with a photo of the pair when they were still a couple, as well as itineraries and correspondence between Emhoff and Jane to substantiate that they made the trip to France in May 2012.

One of the sources is described by the Daily Mail as a female New York attorney who learned about the alleged incident from Jane.

""He hauled up and slapped her so hard she spun around,"" the source is quoted as saying. ""She said she was in utter shock. She was so furious, she slapped him on one side, and then on the other cheek with the other hand.""

Another friend, described by the Daily Mail as a New York businessman, told the outlet Jane called him sobbing following the alleged incident.

""It was very clear what she was telling me,"" that source said, according to the Daily Mail. ""She said she was with a guy, her date, she was at the Cannes Film Festival, and he hit her. She was in the car with the guy at the time.""

The male friend said he learned more details about the alleged episode after the initial phone call.

""It was something like 3 a.m. They were trying to get out of there and they both had been drinking. There was a gigantic line for taxis,"" he told the outlet. ""She went up to one of the valet guys, offered him 100 euros or whatever, to get to the head of the line. She told me she put her hand on his shoulder. Doug apparently thought that she was flirting, and came over and slapped her in the face.""

A third friend, described as a female executive, told the Daily Mail that she learned of the alleged incident in 2014, and purportedly found out new details from Jane in 2018, when Harris, then a senator from California, made headlines with her questioning of a Supreme Court nominee who had been accused of sexual assault.

""[She] is a gorgeous, strong woman and you would never expect somebody to hit her,"" the third friend told the Daily Mail. ""When he hit her she hit him back, like, 'Don't you ever do that again,'""

The third Daily Mail source added: ""I asked her if he ever apologized. She said 'no,' but he commented about the hit she gave him. It was a tennis metaphor. But no apology at all.""

All three friends told the outlet that Jane hit Emhoff back after the alleged initial slap. They also claimed that Jane tried to leave the valet area after the alleged slap, but that Emhoff got into a cab with Jane.

Jane and Emhoff had been dating for about three months before the reported trip to France, according to the friends. Emhoff allegedly cut the trip short and returned to the U.S. for his daughter's birthday at the end of May, and never saw Jane again, the friends told the outlet.

Emhoff's alleged relationship with Jane unfolded after his 2008 divorce from his first wife and before his 2014 marriage to Harris.

The New York Post on Wednesday slammed Emhoff as ""Worst Gentleman"" in its cover story detailing the Daily Mail's article.

Emhoff is fresh off of a Sunday sit-down interview on MSNBC during which Jen Psaki celebrated him as having reshaped ""the perception of masculinity.""

""There is also an important, interesting part about how people have talked about your role is how your role has reshaped the perception of masculinity,"" Psaki said. ""I'm not sure you planned on that, but you are an incredibly supportive spouse. Has that been an evolution for you? Do you think that's part of the role you might play as first gentleman?""

Emhoff responded: ""It's funny. I've started to think a lot about this. I've always been like this. My dad's always been like this. To me, it's the right thing to do, support women. It is mutual with Kamala and I. We support each other, we have each other's back.""

DOUG EMHOFF'S EX-WIFE RESPONDS AFTER SECOND GENTLEMAN ADMITTED TO AFFAIR WITH NANNY

He added: ""I've said many times when we lift up women, we support women, whether it's pay equity, child care, family leave, and all of these issues in this post-Dobbs hellscape. Women should not be less than. Women should not have less rights and be treated differently. That's not the American way.""

Clips of the exchange spread like wildfire on social media as critics noted that, in August, Emhoff admitted to having an affair with his family's nanny during his first marriage years ago.

Emhoff's admission came shortly after the Daily Mail published a separate report in August claiming that he got his daughter's nanny pregnant.

The affair occurred before Emhoff's relationship with and eventual marriage to Harris.

""During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions. I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side,"" Emhoff said over the summer, acknowledging the affair, but not naming the nanny.

Emhoff and his first wife were married from 1992 to 2008 and share two adult children. Harris married Emhoff in 2014, and helped co-parent his children, who call their stepmom ""mommala.""

Arizona man sentenced after setting fire to Grand Canyon National Park cabin where ex-girlfriend stayed,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/arizona-man-sentenced-setting-fire-grand-canyon-national-park-ex-girlfriend-stayed,2024-10-03T19:23:07Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here.

An Arizona man who set fire to a cabin in the Grand Canyon National Park where his ex-girlfriend was staying was sentenced last week to nearly two years in prison.

Dahntay Dunbar, 21, a Flagstaff resident, was arrested in May after he broke into her locked cabin and set a fire inside, the Department of Justice said Tuesday.

Federal prosecutors said that Dunbar had found a bottle of clear liquor and dumped it on a bed before igniting a shirt belonging to his former girlfriend. She was not in the cabin at the time.

""The bed started to burn, and Dunbar left the cabin,"" a DOJ statement said. ""The fire caused scorching, burn damage, and smoke damage to the walls, ceiling, and other parts of the cabin.""

The cabin was owned by the resort company Xanterra. The blaze caused more than $40,000 in damage, authorities said.

Dunbar was arrested by park rangers a short time later. On July 8, he pleaded guilty to arson of a dwelling.

'Joker: Folie A Deux' Review Scores Crash Ahead Of Release,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/03/joker-folie-a-deux-review-scores-crash-ahead-of-release/,2024-10-03T17:51:15Z,"While originally the new Joker sequel, Joker: Folie a Deux, seemed to be tracking a little bit behind the original, 61% critic scores compared to a 69% score, that has now changed drastically with more reviews pouring in for the sequel.

The film's scores have crashed all the way down to a 44% on Rotten Tomatoes one day ahead of its official release on October 4. It's rare to see scores fall that much as more reviews come in past the initial batch, but critics are really not enjoying what they're seeing, it seems.

The film has been criticized for its story, musical numbers and extremely controversial ending, but mainly that it doesn't feel like it needs to exist at all. Here's a sampling of that criticism:

This low of a score means that it is far, far below that majority of DC offerings over the last decade or so. Here's the bottom ten list in that regard:

So yes, that makes it the sixth worst film in recent DC memory, behind some of the worst offerings of the DCEU like Shazam: Fury of the Gods and Wonder Woman 1984. And behind both the original Joker (69%) and The Batman (85%) which are DC ""Elseworlds"" projects now.

When the Joker sequel was announced with Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn, it just didn't seem like it was necessary. Now, that seems to be explicitly clear, and it will get a lower box office result in turn, despite costing four times as much. It seems obvious this should not have been greenlit at all."

""There's no question the discussion around family life, childbearing and pronatalism has gotten a lot more popular and gotten media attention because of JD Vance,"" Brad Wilcox, the director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, told the Associated Press.

The total fertility rate in the United States fell to 1.62 births per woman last year, a 2% decline from the year before and the lowest recorded rate since at least the 1930s. Reasons for the declining birthrate are varied and plentiful -- women are getting married later and pushing off having children as they pursue careers and higher education; the rising cost of living has impacted the economic realities of starting a family; and the U.S. lacks affordable child care and universal paid family leave policies, to name a few. Both Democrats and Republicans have supported policies that encourage family growth -- Republican senators have drafted a plan for monthly cash benefits for working families and Vice President Kamala Harris has proposed a $6,000 tax credit to parents of newborns, for example -- though conservatives tend to be more vocal about the goal of boosting birth rates. Economists have warned that a declining birth rate, and aging population, could spell disaster for the nation's Social Security program -- without enough young, working people to counterbalance the number of Social Security dependents, the existing system isn't sustainable. The same is true of other economic institutions that need to continue to replace retiring workers with those of the next generations. Experts also say that a low birth rate demonstrates an overall decline in American stability -- people aren't expressing a desire to have fewer children, research shows, but they are more worried about the economic and social impacts that they are excited to start a family.

The United States isn't the only developed nation experiencing a decline in birth rates, and it's not the only one to be encouraging reproduction at the government level. France in 2023 had the lowest number of babies born in the country since 1946; the Japanese government has described the situation ""critical"" after years of a declining birth rates; and Italy's birth rate has declined more than 34% since 2008. Each country has implemented new policies to address the situation, including an Italian parental leave that can be taken until a child is six years old and Japan extending public insurance coverage to maternity expenses. Hungary's birth rate, once the lowest in the European Union, has started to increase over the last decade as the country implements policies like exempting women who have more than three children from income tax providing home buying and building subsidies that increase based on their marital status and the number of children per household.

Flora: Revolutionizing Fertility Coverage With Individually-Owned Insurance Policies,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/josipamajic/2024/10/03/flora-revolutionizing-fertility-coverage-with-individually-owned-insurance-policies/,2024-10-03T17:22:54Z,"Reproductive health and family planning are becoming the forefront of social discourse, and a promising InsurTech startup just closed a fresh $1.5M pre-seed funding round - led by Highline Beta with co-investment by Cartography Capital and Everywhere Ventures - bringing them a step closer to transforming the landscape of fertility coverage. Flora, co-founded by Laura McDonald and Dr. Christy Lane, is introducing the first individually-owned fertility insurance policy, aiming to bridge the significant gap in fertility treatment funding.

The fertility market has been a hotbed for private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) investments in recent years. Dr. Christy Lane, one of Flora's Co-Founder, observes, ""We're seeing clinic roll-ups, particularly in the US, where PE is going in and rolling up those clinics. In some cases, it's a good thing where you're seeing better services, better access to care.""

However, despite these investments and advancements in fertility science, a critical issue persists: the funding gap for fertility treatments. According to the World Health Organization, infertility is a global health issue, affecting one in six to one in five people who may need some form of fertility treatment.

Laura McDonald, Flora's Co-founder, explains ""Depending on where you are, 60 to 80% of people still have no coverage through their work or health plans, or limited coverage."" This lack of coverage is particularly pronounced for individuals working in small to medium-sized businesses or those who are self-employed.

Flora's innovative approach centers on creating the first individually-owned fertility insurance policy. Lane elaborates, ""We've spent decades really understanding the clinical research and the claims patterns for infertility treatment. That's what's allowed us to be able to develop these individual risk underwriting models and actuarial or pricing models.""

This individual risk model sets Flora apart from traditional group insurance plans, which don't perform individual underwriting. As a result, Flora can provide more affordable coverage for individuals and small groups, a market segment previously underserved by existing fertility coverage options.

Flora is initially targeting women aged 20 to 34, a demographic increasingly concerned about their future fertility. Lane shares a striking statistic: ""50% of young women are concerned about their future fertility before even trying to conceive.""

This concern is particularly prevalent among women who are prioritizing career development or other life goals before starting a family. As McDonald notes, ""They don't want their biological clock to necessarily dictate their life journey. They want to focus on their career and other things.""

Flora's innovative approach extends beyond its insurance model to its technological infrastructure. Lane explains, ""What we're building is very unique, even in the InsurTech space, which is called a digital MGA (Managing General Agent)."" This digital platform allows for wide distribution through channels such as health apps and small to medium businesses.

The company has developed a proprietary underwriting engine that enables real-time quoting and fast coverage approvals. Moreover, the data collected through this process opens up exciting possibilities for AI and machine learning applications. McDonald adds, ""There are huge opportunities for AI, large language models in improving our ability to better understand risk, but also enable us to better understand how to help women mitigate their own risk through things like lifestyle changes.""

Dr. Christy Lane brings a wealth of experience to Flora's innovative approach to fertility. With a background that includes founding the Wearable Health Lab at Stanford, Lane has spent years investigating the intricate connections between lifestyle factors and fertility. ""Part of our value is our deep understanding of what predicts infertility, particularly lifestyle,"" Lane explains. Her research has delved into how physical activity, sleep patterns, nutrition, and even data from wearable devices and IoT can impact fertility. This expertise forms the foundation of Flora's unique offering: personalized lifestyle journeys for women. By collecting and analyzing data, Flora aims to provide tailored, non-clinical recommendations to improve natural conception chances. For women already on a fertility journey, the company offers practical advice on sleep optimization, physical activity, and nutrition. Lane emphasizes, ""We're not just providing insurance; we're offering a holistic approach to reproductive health."" This data-driven, lifestyle-focused strategy sets Flora apart in the fertility market, promising a more comprehensive and personalized approach to family planning.

Flora's coverage is designed to be comprehensive, including diagnostics, drugs, intrauterine insemination (IUI), and in vitro fertilization (IVF). But the company's vision extends beyond mere financial coverage.

Lane, drawing from her personal experience with fertility treatments, emphasizes the importance of community support: ""Part of what we want to do is create community within women who become members of the Flora community and policyholders to make sure that these women understand infertility, understand their potential risks, and also lifestyle changes and things that they can do to reduce their risk of infertility.""

The company plans to provide personalized lifestyle recommendations to help women improve their chances of conceiving naturally. They're also establishing partnerships with sexual health platforms, menstrual tracking apps, and clinics to create a holistic reproductive health ecosystem.

Flora positions itself as an alternative or an addition to egg freezing, a procedure that has gained popularity but comes with its own set of challenges and uncertainties. McDonald shares an anecdote that encapsulates their value proposition: ""This young woman came up to me... She said, 'We're being told that we have to freeze our eggs, that that's our insurance policy for our future fertility. But what you made me realize is that I actually just need an insurance policy, literally, I just need an insurance policy.'""

McDonald illustrates the cost-effectiveness of their approach with an example: ""My daughter Molly, who plans to go to law school, can freeze her eggs in her 20s for, say $10,000 or she can buy a Flora policy, and depending on the ages she buys it, it might be $20 a month.""

When addressing the common questions surrounding their fertility insurance product. ""Many people ask why this hasn't been done before, and why established insurance companies don't simply adopt our model,"" McDonald explains. The answer lies in the complex landscape of insurance and the unique challenges of fertility coverage. Traditional insurance relies heavily on established mortality tables and risk models for areas like death, disability, and natural disasters. However, fertility insurance requires the creation of entirely new models. ""We've spent over 18 months building out these risk models,"" McDonald reveals, highlighting the extensive work involved. This process combines decades of expertise from team members like Dr. Christy Lane, who has studied the field for over 20 years, with innovative approaches to data analysis and risk assessment, and Somil Jain, a leading actuary for transformational digital insurance models. McDonald points out that the insurance industry often relies on InsurTech companies like Flora to pioneer such new models and bring innovative products to market. The challenges extend beyond model creation to navigating regulatory environments and securing capacity partners for claim payouts. Despite these hurdles, Flora has succeeded thanks to their team's diverse background and support from partners like InsureTech NY. McDonald emphasizes the importance of domain expertise in finding and utilizing new data sets to create novel underwriting, risk, and pricing models. Additionally, Flora's strategic advantage in distribution positions them to rapidly reach millions of women, increasing their odds of becoming a pioneer in this untapped market of individual fertility insurance.

Flora's ambitions extend beyond fertility treatment coverage. The company envisions a long-term model that supports women throughout their reproductive journey and beyond. As McDonald explains, ""We can ideally stay with you before the baby, when you have the baby, whether you need treatment or not, and after.""

Future plans include expanding coverage to areas such as postpartum depression treatment, pelvic floor treatment, and even perimenopause and menopause support. This comprehensive approach aims to address the full spectrum of women's reproductive health needs.

Flora represents a significant shift in how we approach fertility and reproductive health insurance. By offering individually-owned policies based on personalized risk assessments, the company is making fertility treatment more accessible and affordable for a broader demographic.

As reproductive health continues to gain prominence in public discourse, innovations like Flora's individually-owned fertility insurance policies may well become a cornerstone of comprehensive healthcare coverage. With its blend of InsurTech innovation, data-driven risk assessment, and community-focused approach - Flora is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of fertility coverage and women's health support.

In a world where reproductive autonomy and financial stability often seem at odds, Flora's approach offers a promising solution. By providing women with the financial tools to take control of their fertility journey, Flora is not just selling insurance - it's offering peace of mind and expanded reproductive choices to a generation of women balancing health challenges, emotional and career needs with family planning."
The Harpole Treasure includes one of the most valuable pieces of ancient jewelry found in Britain,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/harpole-treasure-includes-one-most-valuable-pieces-ancient-jewelry-found-britain,2024-10-03T16:38:39Z,"Archaeologists from the University of Aberdeen recently found an over 1,000-year-old ring during a volunteer dig near Burghead, Scotland. The university believes the Pictish ring means the ""painted ones.""

The Harpole Treasure refers to a collection of relics that was discovered in Harpole near Northampton in 2022. Among the treasures discovered was a unique gold necklace that archaeologists called ""the most ornate of its kind ever found,"" according to The Museum of London Archaeology's (MOLA) July 2022 news release.

The necklace was one of many finds that came out of an ancient burial site. The gorgeous necklace dates back between 630 and 670 A.D., according to MOLA.

The unique piece features many different pendants, which includes beads, glass pendants and Roman coins.

At the center of the necklace sits a rectangular pendant, decorated with a cross motif. While pendants in female burials aren't particularly uncommon, according to the press release, the variety of pendants adds to this particular find's uniqueness.

""Suddenly we had a rubbish pit that turned into a burial beyond burials,"" Paul Thompson, MOLA project manager, said, per the BBC in 2023.

""It's a once in a lifetime experience to be working on something like this,"" he went on to say.

Other finds unearthed from the ancient burial site were two decorated pots, as well as a shallow copper dish and a large ornate cross.

The necklace, paired with the other grave goods that were found, label the find as ""one of the most spectacular female Early Medieval burials ever discovered in the UK,"" per MOLA's press release.

""It wasn't just one or two items. That would have been incredible in its own,"" Thompson told The Washington Post in 2022. ""We have here the only complete example of this type of necklace excavated in modern archaeological standards.... It's an asymmetrical set-out of the gold coins, and the precious stones mounted in gold, which we haven't seen before.""

Though the identity of the woman who was buried with these goods remains an untold story, archaeologists do believe that the person was of high status, possibly an early Christian leader.

""Christianity provided a way for women to gain independence and power in their own right, by enabling them to run monastic houses, so we see an increase in elite women using Christianity as a means of increasing their status,"" Emma Brownlee, an archaeologist at the University of Cambridge, told The Washington Post in 2022. ""In this burial, we're seeing a particularly fine example of that process.""

In December 2023, MOLA released a second news release about the incredible find, sharing that the 30 pendants and beads making up the necklace had been cleaned and, at the time of writing, continued to be examined by specialists to learn more about their origins.

There have also been further developments regarding the human remains at the site.

When the grave goods, including the necklace, were found in 2022, it was believed that only a few fragments of the woman's teeth remained, according to the press release, but further investigation has led to the finding of more fragments, including the upper part of a femur, some vertebrae, part of a hand and wrist, plus part of the pelvic bone, per the press release."

In her forthcoming self-titled memoir, Melania Trump espouses an unflinching belief in abortion rights -- a view on one of the biggest issues of the election that is entirely antithetical to that of her husband and her political party.

In reviewing an early copy of her book, The Guardian reports that Melania Trump says it is ""imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy"" in deciding whether to have children, ""free from any intervention or pressure from the government.""

""Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body,"" she adds.

On Thursday morning, she also posted a video to social media that references her position on abortion rights. ""Without a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth: individual freedom,"" Melania Trump says in the video. ""What does 'my body, my choice' really mean?""

According to the Guardian, Melania Trump's book acknowledges the extreme circumstances in which some people make such decisions, including rape, incest or severe medical conditions in the fetus. But she also defends abortion access later in a pregnancy, which her husband has repeatedly demonized and misrepresented as a ""radical"" Democratic view.

She writes:

The former first lady's revelation is astonishing, given how out of step she is with her party, and in light of her husband's singular role in rolling back the right that she professes is essential to women ""from birth.""

And the timing of her declaration is no less circumspect: Melania Trump chose not reveal that she is pro-abortion when Roe v. Wade was overturned, or after Republican legislatures imposed draconian state abortion bans, which have caused preventable deaths and forced women to travel out of their states for the procedure. Rather, her apparently unwavering belief in abortion rights comes just ahead of a closely contested election in which Republicans are trying desperately to rebrand their extreme abortion views -- and in a memoir she is selling for upwards of $40."
The Perfect Weekend Getaway:  A Guide To The Mystical  Energy Vortexes Of Sedona,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericawertheimzohar/2024/10/03/the-perfect-weekend-getaway--a-guide-to-the-mystical--energy-vortexes-of-sedona/,2024-10-03T16:27:20Z,"Sedona has been a dream destination of mine for years, and its allure goes far beyond just being a scenic getaway. Positioned between Phoenix and Flagstaff, this Arizona town has earned its reputation as a spiritual haven, revered for its dramatic landscapes, serene atmosphere, and its healing powers. The drive from Phoenix takes roughly two hours, but the final stretch is truly unforgettable. As you approach Sedona, the terrain changes from rolling hills to a stunning panorama of towering red rock formations, each more striking than the last. It's the kind of view that takes your breath away -- almost like entering another planet. If anywhere on Earth feels like Mars, Sedona might just be it.

The red rocks themselves are a marvel, their colors shifting through deep oranges and reds as the day goes by. It's a living canvas that is always changing, drawing you in with its sheer magnitude and natural beauty. In the evening, the landscape takes on an even more surreal quality, with the night sky so clear and vivid that it feels like you're standing beneath a blanket of stars.

Upon arriving in Sedona, you will quickly become familiar with the term ""vortex,"" which is central to the town's identity. Often referred to as ""America's third eye,"" Sedona is believed to house four of the most powerful energy vortexes in the world. Curious to understand their significance, I began researching these sites and the supposed influence they have on visitors.

The Sedona Visitor's Bureau defines vortexes as areas where the Earth's energy is thought to be highly concentrated, creating a unique environment that promotes healing, introspection, and personal transformation and move in a spiral-like up and down movement. Vortexes are located all over the world such as the Great Pyramid in Egypt, Machu Picchu in Peru, and Uluru/Ayers Rock in Australia to name a few. Visitors often describe feeling more grounded, spiritually aligned, or mentally clear after spending time at these sites. The Bureau identifies two primary types of vortexes:

Both types of vortexes are said to draw their power from Sedona's unique geological features, particularly the high concentration of quartz and iron oxides, which some believe contribute to the heightened energy sensations visitors experience. Sedona's known for having up to 15 energy vortexes throughout town, but there are four major ones that are to be the most powerful.

With my guidebook in hand, I embarked on a journey to visit all four of Sedona's major vortex sites over the course of my two-day stay.

Location: Airport Mesa is located near the Sedona Airport, just a short drive from the town center. A popular overlook, Airport Mesa offers 360-degree views of Sedona's red rock formations. Parking is easy and is offered for $3.

Energy: This vortex is known for its upflow or masculine energy (energy coming out of the earth).

Experience: The Mesa offers stunning panoramic views of Sedona's landscape, including Bell Rock, Courthouse Butte, and Cathedral Rock, and is the most popular for sunset viewing. There is a 3.2 mile hike, the Airport Mesa Loop Trail, that circles the mesa that is not too challenging but guarantees a view from every angle.

Best Time to Visit: Sunset is particularly popular, as the rocks take on a fiery glow and the expansive views become even more breathtaking. Be prepared for crowds, as many gather here to witness the spectacular Sedona sunset.

Location: Cathedral Rock, one of Sedona's most iconic formations and said to be the most powerful vortex, is located off Back O' Beyond Road. Parking is nearby and requires a Red Rock Pass which can be purchased for $5 here to cover parking.

Energy: Known for its inflow or feminine energy (energy entering the earth).

Experience: The Cathedral Rock Trail is a short 1.2 mile roundtrip hike and is a bit steep and moderately challenging hike/climb (not for everyone), but the views of the red rock landscape are worth it. The energy is said to help with releasing old emotional wounds, making it a popular spot for meditation and quiet contemplation. The higher you climb, the stronger the vortex energy is believed to become.

Best Time to Visit: One of the most photographed of the vortexes, Cathedral Rock is a great place to start the day and watch the sun come up. There are two parking lots which fill up fast - so get there early. Water and sunscreen are a must.

Location: Boynton Canyon is located to the west of Sedona, off Boynton Pass Road. It's one of the more secluded and lush vortex sites, offering a peaceful escape from the busier locations. Parking is nearby and requires a Red Rock Pass which can be purchased for $5 here to cover parking.

Energy: Known for its balanced energy, combining both the masculine and feminine energy.

Experience: The Boynton Canyon Trail is about 1.1 miles roundtrip and relatively easy. It takes you through a scenic canyon filled with towering red cliffs and lots of views of the surrounding pines, offering a peaceful contrast to the other more exposed vortex sites. Along the trail, you'll pass by Native American ruins, adding to the spiritual and cultural significance of the area. Once you arrive, you will see rock formations that are named ""Kachina Woman"" by the Hopi Tribe. Visitors often meditate here, seeking both reflection and inspiration in the balanced energies of the canyon.

Best Time to Visit: Because of its greenery and temperate weather, morning or late afternoon is most popular.

Location: Bell Rock is located just north of the Village of Oak Creek, along Highway 179. Its bell-shaped formation makes it easy to spot and one of the most visited vortex sites. Parking is nearby and requires a Red Rock Pass which can be purchased for $5 here to cover parking.

Energy: Known for its upflow or masculine energy (energy coming out of the earth). Visitors often report feeling an increased sense of vitality and creativity, as the vortex is believed to stimulate the body's energy flow.

Experience: There are several hiking trails around Bell Rock, from easy paths to more strenuous climbs. The Bell Rock Trail is relatively easy and there are many places to stop along the way and take in the views and feel the energy. The trail is almost a mile and ends midway to the top. It is not advised to go to the top unless you are an experienced hiker.

Best Time to Visit: A popular stop, it is recommended to come in the late afternoon to avoid the crowds and and take in the energizing vibrations.

The allure of Sedona's energy and stunning landscapes has not only attracted tourists but also drawn the attention of major brands looking to use it as a backdrop for their activations. In 2019, H&M chose Sedona's breathtaking scenery to unveil its Spring/Summer collection, hosting a three-day ""theater experience"" where models and influencers showcased the new line against the dramatic red rock landscape with lavish dinners, performances, and tours.

Recently, General Motors' Chevrolet division chose Sedona as the backdrop to showcase their new Equinox EV. Influencers were given the chance to experience the vehicle firsthand by driving it from Phoenix Airport to Sedona. The timing of the activation, coinciding with the Summer to Fall Equinox, was no accident, as it held symbolic significance for the event. This brand activation was layered with meaning, aligning both the vehicle and the location with themes of transition and new beginnings. The packed two-day itinerary treated guests to a seated dinner, a stargazing experience with a local astrologer, yoga by the creek, and time at the spa.

""We used the meaning of the autumnal equinox to shape the weekend in Sedona with the Equinox EV. We wanted everyone to experience the range and capability of the Equinox EV, but also lean in to balance, wellness and harmony.""

Companies are drawn to Sedona's dramatic red rock formations and serene atmosphere, using the location to create unique and memorable experiences. Whether it's fashion brands unveiling new collections or automotive giants showcasing their latest innovations, Sedona's natural beauty provides the perfect setting to enhance the impact of these events and allow influencers to create the perfect Instagram moment as well as have an authentic connection to the brand outside the showroom.

Celebrities have long sought out Sedona as a sanctuary to reconnect with nature and explore their spiritual side. With its extraordinary landscapes and mystical energy, Sedona has become a favored retreat for stars looking to escape the demands of fame. Lily Collins, Oprah Winfrey, and Justin and Hailey Bieber are just a few who have found the red rock oasis to be transformative, offering peace and clarity. For many, Sedona's energy vortexes, stunning hiking trails, and tranquil atmosphere provide a much-needed escape, allowing them to recharge both mentally and spiritually, making it a truly healing experience for the soul.

The only way I can describe Sedona is that it is nature's ultimate spa -- where the landscape itself offers rejuvenation. It bathes both your body and soul in its ancient, powerful energy, a force that has shaped the land for millions of years, long before humanity ever set foot here. I couldn't help feel like a fleeting moment in the grand timeline of this mystical place and was reminded that, like the sand beneath my feet and the stars in the sky above, we are just a small part of a much larger universe."
"Yazidi woman held hostage for 10 years in Gaza freed in Israel, US operation",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/yazidi-woman-held-captive-10-years-gaza-freed-israel-us-operation,2024-10-03T16:20:20Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A Yazidi woman held captive by Islamic terrorists for the last decade has been reunited with her family in Iraq following her escape and safe evacuation on Oct. 1 in a coordinated effort between Israeli and U.S. officials, the State Department confirmed to Fox News Digital on Thursday.

Fawzia Amin Sido, now 21, was just 11 years old when she was kidnapped by ISIS terrorists before she was sold and trafficked into Gaza, where she was forced to marry an alleged Hamas fighter.

Amin Sido was apparently able to escape after her captor was killed in what was believed to have been an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) strike, enabling her to flee to a ""hideout"" within the Gaza Strip.

CHILDREN ONCE HELD HOSTAGE STILL WORKING THROUGH TRAUMA: 'ARE THEY COMING FOR US AGAIN?'

""In a complex operation coordinated between Israel, the United States, and other international actors, she was recently rescued in a secret mission from the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom Crossing,"" the IDF said in a statement Thursday. ""Upon her entry into Israel, she continued to Jordan through the Allenby Bridge Crossing and from there-returned to her family in Iraq.""

The operation was led by the IDF's Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories unit along with help provided by the U.S. Embassy in Israel, as well as other international actors, though the IDF did not detail who.

""Her story is heartbreaking, and we are glad that she will be reunited with her family in Iraq,"" a spokesperson for the State Department told Fox News Digital. ""As Secretary [Antony] Blinken has noted, '2,600 Yezidis remain missing and unaccounted for. We are determined to find them, to learn their fates, and to rescue those who remain alive'.""

The IDF said the coordinated trafficking efforts in Amin Sido's case are ""further evidence of the connection between the terrorist organization Hamas and ISIS.""

WHY NO ISIS MEMBER HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH GENOCIDE OR SEXUAL VIOLENCE FOR CRIMES AGAINST YAZIDIS

ISIS attacked Yazidi populations in the northern Iraqi town of Sinjar in August 2014, abducting some 6,400 people and killing another 1,200, according to a report by the Times of Israel.

Roughly half of the abductees have reportedly been able to escape or have been freed.

The growing ties between ISIS and other terrorist organizations like Hamas signify a growing shift in the Middle East in which extremist groups, despite prior differences, are increasingly expanding ties, often facilitated by the backing of Iran.

The IDF vowed to continue to counter the ""Hamas-ISIS terrorist organization"" by striking terrorist-based infrastructure sites and pledged to ""free all hostages in Hamas captivity.""

There are still 101 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, including seven Americans, most of whom were taken during the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks, though four of them were abducted in 2014 and 2015.

This figure does not include other Yazidi abductees mentioned by Blinken who may also be being held in Gaza."
Ohio GOP Senate candidate Moreno hits Brown on Inflation Reduction Act vote in ad that's part of $25M buy,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ohio-gop-senate-candidate-moreno-hits-brown-inflation-reduction-act-vote-ad-thats-part-25m-buy,2024-10-03T16:19:51Z,"FIRST ON FOX - Ohio Republican Bernie Moreno is hitting incumbent Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown on his Inflation Reduction Act vote in a new ad that's part of a $25 million new buy ahead of Election Day.

The 30-second ad spot, which will run on television and digitally, opens with a single mother from Versailles, Ohio, saying she can't believe the current prices for groceries.

""It's a lot tougher to provide for my kids with the Democrats' inflation,"" the woman, Carla, says. ""Sherrod Brown's only made things worse. Brown supported Kamala, not us, and voted for her radical Inflation Act, and now prices are at a 40-year-high. Bernie Moreno will fight to lower prices and stop inflation. That's why I trust Bernie Moreno to help Ohio families.""

The ad, first obtained by Fox News Digital in advance of its planned roll out, also includes the message on screen: ""Sherrod Brown voted for Kamala's Inflation Act.""

It was paid for by Bernie Moreno for Senate and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

""Hardworking Ohioans are suffering under the record-high inflation created by Kamala Harris and Sherrod Brown,"" Moreno said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""While he claims to fight for Ohio, families are unable to afford basic necessities. In November, we will send him packing and get our economy back on track.""

Moreno's campaign told Fox News Digital that the ad is part of an additional $25 million in spending. It comes just 33 days before the Nov. 5 election. Early voting in Ohio starts Oct. 8.

The contest is on track to be the most expensive Senate race this cycle, with $310.4 million in spending from both campaigns as of August, according to Axios.

As of August, Moreno shelled out $158.4 million and Brown spent $152 million, Axios reported.

Brown's campaign announced Wednesday it will report raising nearly $31 million in the third quarter.

Fox News has labeled the race between Moreno and Brown as a toss-up.

NRA TARGETS SEN SHERROD BROWN IN 7-FIGURE AD BUY IN OHIO: 'VOTE LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT'

Fox News Digital reached out to Brown's campaign and congressional office for comment about the new ad but did not immediately hear back.

Ohio is center stage on the presidential ticket this cycle with Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, as former President Trump's vice presidential running mate. Moreno ran against Vance in the 2022 GOP Republican primary for Senate, which Vance won, and has supported the Trump-Vance bid for the White House.

In August 2023, on the one-year anniversary of President Biden signing his Inflation Reduction Act into law, Brown's campaign issued a statement championing the legislation as having included ""key priorities Brown fought for to save Ohioans money, crack down on Wall Street stock buybacks, and attract investment and good-paying jobs to Ohio.""

""The Inflation Reduction Act is already saving Ohioans money at the pharmacy counter and spurring Ohio to lead the country in manufacturing the technology of the future - and those cost savings and Ohio jobs will only grow in the coming years,"" Brown said in a statement at the time.

As of August 2024, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) in the Midwest - which includes Ohio - rose by 2.6% over the last 12 months.

The bureau said the index for all items, less food and energy, advanced 3.2% over the year, while food prices increased 1.8%. Energy prices declined 2.6%, ""largely the result of decreasing prices for gasoline,"" it added."
Travis Kelce's best friend dishes on Taylor Swift's influence since 2 stars began dating,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/travis-kelces-best-friend-dishes-taylor-swifts-influence-since-2-stars-began-dating,2024-10-03T16:07:48Z,"Former Denver Broncos star John Elway reacts to Travis Kelce's slow start in an interview with Fox News Digital.

Aric Jones is a rising star in the fashion space and has spent quite a lot of time with his best friend, Travis Kelce, as they've risen to new heights from the suburbs of Cleveland.

Jones is the mind behind Homebred Legends, a lifestyle and clothing brand that is meant to represent where he's from. The brand says on its website it is ""dedicated to people, loyalty and excellence."" Kelce routinely wears Jones' designs on his podcast, ""New Heights"" and was seen earlier this season wearing one of the Homebred hats walking into Arrowhead Stadium.

As Kelce's Q score has risen over the last year due to dating Taylor Swift, Jones spoke to Page Six in a story published Wednesday about how her presence has affected the Kansas City Chiefs superstar. Jones said he's welcome to the idea of Swift rocking his designs - but in due time.

""Taylor's great. Taylor's her own woman. And like, if Taylor wants to participate with us on theme nights, of course, we welcome it,"" he told the outlet.

""But at the end of the day, just having her there and having her presence there is awesome. She's there to cheer on her boyfriend and hang out with us, and to be quite honest, that's enough.""

TRAVIS KELCE SAYS RASHEE RICE'S INJURY FELT LIKE A 'HUGE DAGGER' AFTER SEEING HIM GO DOWN

Kelce and Swift have been dating for more than a year, and the attention has been palpable. If Swift is in the Kelce suite, the cameras are on her waiting for her reaction to a particular play or a Chiefs touchdown. It makes for a better moment when Kelce scores, but he has yet to do that this season.

Regardless, Jones said nothing has changed between Kelce and his closest friends except for one thing.

""I'm never going to downplay [the hype] or to say [the new attention] isn't the coolest stuff in the world,"" he told Page Six. ""But, at the same time, all we got to do is be us. And the only thing that's changed is that there's a camera in the suite now.""

California man learns sentence for killing UCLA graduate student Brianna Kupfer in brutal stabbing attack,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-man-learns-sentence-killing-ucla-graduate-student-brianna-kupfer-brutal-stabbing-attack,2024-10-03T15:31:24Z,"Former U.S. Assistant Attorney General Nathan Hochman joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the latest on the trial as the suspect is accused of stabbing the victim 26 times.

A California homeless man found guilty of brutally stabbing to death a UCLA graduate student inside a boutique furniture shop was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on Wednesday.

Shawn Laval Smith, 34, was convicted in September for the gruesome murder of Brianna Kupfer, a 24-year-old architectural graduate student, on Jan. 13, 2022.

The sentence was handed down after Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mildred Escobedo reviewed reports from doctors and determined Smith was sane at the time of the murder, FOX11 Los Angeles reported.

Kupfer was working alone at Croft House in Los Angeles' Hancock Park neighborhood when Smith, a homeless man with a long criminal history, entered the store and stabbed her 26 times during an unprovoked attack.

WHO IS BRIANNA KUPFER, THE LOS ANGELES STABBING VICTIM?

Kupfer suffered 11 stab wounds to the chest, two in the abdomen, one to the pelvis, two on her right arm, five on her left arm, two on her right leg and three on her left leg. Security cameras showed Smith at the store and his DNA was found on the knife, prosecutors said.

Smith was arrested six days after Kupfer's murder.

During the trial, prosecutors argued that Smith went ""hunting for a woman alone"" on the day of the murder, having approached six other stores before finding Kupfer working alone.

Moments before her death, Kupfer had sent a text to a friend that said she was getting a ""bad vibe"" from someone inside the store, authorities have said.

BRIANNA KUPFER SENT PAL OMINOUS TEXT BEFORE SHE WAS STABBED TO DEATH

The friend said they saw the message about 15 minutes later, although police said Kupfer was killed within 10 minutes of sending it. A customer found Kupfer dead inside the store.

Kupfer's family remembered the 24-year-old as someone who always worked to better herself and her community.

""In many ways, [Brianna] embodied everything that is great about Los Angeles, and the entire city should grieve over this senseless act,"" the family said in an earlier statement.

How data brokers are fueling elder fraud in America,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/how-data-brokers-fueling-elder-fraud-america,2024-10-03T14:09:50Z,"Many of these calls were made by scammers, often promising to eliminate your taxes.

Elder fraud is a growing concern in the United States, with criminals increasingly targeting individuals over the age of 60.

Increasingly, data brokers have been identified as a favored tool among criminals, providing access to personal information that criminals use to improve their scamming schemes.

Using data from the FBI for the calendar year 2023, researchers have found that economic losses from scams continue to increase. In addition to financial loss rising over time, scam complaints have risen for the first time since 2020. Americans over the age of 60 lost over $3.4 billion to scams in 2023 alone. They reported more than 101,000 scams, representing a 14.5% increase compared to the 88,000 reports filed in 2022.

Residents of Hawaii who were 60 or older lost the most money to scammers in all 50 states, with more than 453 complaints filed and a total of $28 million lost, meaning the average amount lost per scam was $61,000. While Hawaiians were impacted the most, this is due to the state's smaller population size. When we look at a large-population state such as California, we see more than 11,000 complaints filed, equaling a financial loss of $643 million.

MOST TARGETED CITIES FOR TRAVEL BOOKING SCAMS

Tech support scams occurred the most in 2023. An example of these scams is those pesky phone calls you might receive telling you your iCloud account has been compromised. More than 17,000 tech-support scams were reported in 2023, which is also nearly the same number as reported in 2022. Behind tech-support scams were personal data breaches, which were reported 7,800 times in 2023.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

BEWARE OF SOCIAL SECURITY SCAMS BY CROOKS TRYING TO TRICK YOU

Researchers found that elder abuse scams were made possible by personal data being available online. This happens largely thanks to data brokers, which are large companies that make money by selling personal information for the purpose of advertising.

So what can you do about it? Invest in personal data removal services. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.

As elder fraud continues to rise, it's crucial for seniors and their families to be proactive in safeguarding personal information and recognizing potential scams. Here are some additional actionable strategies to help mitigate the risks.

1. Monitor financial accounts regularly: Set up alerts for any unusual activity on bank accounts and credit cards. Review statements monthly and consider using financial management apps that can help track spending and detect anomalies.

2. Use strong, unique passwords: Create complex passwords that combine letters, numbers and symbols. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.

3. Enable two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification.

4. Limit sharing personal information: Be cautious about the information you share online and over the phone. Scammers often use social media to gather details about potential victims. Adjust privacy settings on social media accounts to limit who can see your information.

5. Verify before trusting: Always verify the identity of anyone requesting personal or financial information. Use official contact numbers to confirm the legitimacy of the request.

6. Be skeptical of unsolicited calls, emails or messages: Never click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious sources because they may contain malware or phishing attempts. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.

7. Report suspicious activity: If you suspect a scam, report it to local authorities or organizations like the Federal Trade Commission. Early reporting can help prevent others from falling victim to the same scam.

8. Stay connected with family and friends: Regular communication with loved ones can help reduce feelings of isolation, which scammers often exploit. Encourage seniors to stay socially active through community groups, clubs or regular family gatherings. Also, be sure to check out five ways tech can help you feel less alone.

"In excerpt from new memoir, Melania Trump says women have the 'right to choose' abortion",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/g-s1-26134/melania-trump-memoir-donald-trump-abortion-position,2024-10-03T13:23:45Z,"""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?"" Melania Trump asks in her new memoir, according to an early excerpt published by The Guardian. The former first lady is seen here alongside her husband, former President Donald Trump, in cardboard cutouts at a campaign rally in Johnstown, Pa. Chip Somodevilla/Getty hide caption

Former first lady Melania Trump says in a self-titled memoir set to be released next week that she supports women's autonomy and the right to control their own bodies -- including abortion, if they choose, according to a report Thursday.

Her stance adds another jolt to a presidential campaign season rife with dramatic events, with Melania Trump weighing in on a topic that is a central issue in her husband's bid for reelection.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy"" when deciding when and whether to have children, Melania Trump writes in the book, according to an excerpt cited by The Guardian. The newspaper says it obtained an early copy of the book.

Those decisions, she said, should be based on women's personal convictions, not on ""intervention or pressure from the government,"" according to the excerpt.

According to the The Guardian Melania Trump also writes:

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.

Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

NPR has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment about Melania Trump's writings, and is seeking independent verification of the excerpt from the book's publisher.

Abortion has long been a key issue in U.S. political campaigns, but the 2024 race comes two years after the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v Jackson that found there is no constitutional right to abortion.

Democrats have used that controversial ruling as a rallying call, emphasizing that pivotal votes on the high court's decision came from justices nominated by then-President Donald Trump.

The former president's position on abortion has been closely analyzed as he seeks to regain the White House.

""After 50 years of failure, with nobody coming even close, I was able to kill Roe v. Wade, much to the 'shock' of everyone,"" Trump said last year on his Truth Social platform.

But this year, Trump has seemingly sought to portray a more nuanced position on abortion, including saying that abortion laws should be left for states to decide.

As NPR's Sarah McCammon reported after the 2022 midterm election:

""Advocates for bans on most abortions - including a wave of state laws passed in recent years that prohibit the procedure within the first several weeks - are at odds with public opinion, according to many years of polling. While most Americans support some restrictions on abortion, most support access earlier in pregnancy.""

Melania Trump's memoir, titled Melania, has a release date of Oct. 8, by Skyhorse Publishing, with distribution by Simon & Schuster.

In its summary of the book, the publisher said of the former first lady: ""She shares behind-the-scenes stories from her time in the White House, shedding light on her advocacy work and the causes close to her heart.""

The former first lady was born in Slovenia in 1970, three years before the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. She moved to the U.S. in 1996 and became a U.S. citizen in 2006."
"Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses Used To Instantly Dox Strangers In Public, Thanks To AI And Facial Recognition",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2024/10/03/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-used-to-instantly-dox-strangers-in-public-thanks-to-ai-and-facial-recognition/,2024-10-03T13:12:44Z,"Two students at Harvard University have hooked Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses up to a facial recognition system that instantly identifies strangers in public, finds their personal information and can be used to approach them and gain their trust. They call it I-XRAY, and have demonstrated its concerning power to get phone numbers, addresses, and even social security numbers in live tests.

""We stream the video from the glasses straight to Instagram and have a computer program monitor the stream,"" AnhPhy Nguyen says in a demo video on X. ""We use AI to detect when we're looking at someone's face, then we scour the internet to find more pictures of that person. Finally, we use data sources like online articles and voter registration databases to figure out their name, phone number, home address, and relatives names.""

Nguyen and fellow Harvard student Caine Ardayfio then stream that information to an app on their phones.

""Using our glasses, we were able to identify dozens of people including Harvard students, without them ever knowing,"" says Ardayfio.

The system is perfect for scammers, because it detects information about people that strangers would have no ordinary means of knowing, like their work and volunteer affiliations, that the students then used to engage subjects in conversation.

In the wrong hands, this could very easily lead to dangerous or compromising situations: imagine a sexual predator who gains the trust of a target by appearing to know them and claiming to have met them at an event in the past. Most of us have fairly hazy memories of years-ago events, so if someone claims to have met us, knows our name, and a few facts about us, we're likely to believe them and engage with them, offering them at least a little bit of trust.

That's exactly what the two Harvard students did with a woman affiliated with the Cambridge Community Foundation, saying that they met there. The woman buys it, engages, and shakes Ardayfio's hand. They also approach a man working for minority rights in India and gain his trust, and tell a girl they meet on campus her actual home address. For another woman, they guess her parents' names, and get them right.

The technology needed is fairly trivial and easily available:

Naturally, since this was just a demo of system capability, nothing further happened. But the potential for abuse is obvious.

""Are we ready for a world where our data is exposed at a glance?"" asks Nguyen.

Clearly, the answer is no: we typically have an expectation of anonymity in public places and crowds that is no longer warranted. If two students can hack together a doxxing technology this powerful in their spare time, what can national governments or even large corporations do?

""Initially started as a side project, I-XRAY quickly highlighted significant privacy concerns,"" the two students say. ""The purpose of building this tool is not for misuse, and we are not releasing it.""

Privacy in public is probably dead, but the students have some suggestions to restore at least some of it:

Realistically, that might protect you from two Harvard students who hacked together a solution. But it's probably not going to do much against large organizations or nations that have a strong interest in knowing far too much about each one of us in public."
Missing Missouri mother's remains found 6 months after mysterious disappearance,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/missing-missouri-mothers-remains-found-6-months-after-mysterious-disappearance,2024-10-03T12:43:00Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on Foxnews.com.

The body of a missing Missouri mother of four who mysteriously vanished six months ago has now been identified after being found in a wooded area on Saturday, according to the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office.

Authorities say that the identity of 33-year-old Emily Strite was confirmed through medical and dental records after her skeleton remains were found in the De Soto area by a Frissell Road property owner. De Soto is about 45 miles southwest of St. Louis.

Her cause of death has yet to be determined and investigators say they are working to piece together how exactly her remains ended up there.

MISSOURI WOMAN FOUND DEAD DAYS AFTER GOING MISSING, PICKED UP AT HOSPITAL BY SHERIFF'S DEPUTY

Strite had not been seen since April 12 when she left a friend's house on foot and is believed to have left her own free will, the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office said in a prior press release. She was reported missing eight days later by her mother, Charlyn McClain.

McClain tells NBC her daughter's body was found close to the house where she was staying.

McClain says she last spoke to her daughter that morning over the phone where the 33-year-old said she was planning on visiting three of her younger children who live with their father, Steve Fults, over the Missouri border in Cahokia, Illinois.

""We only talked for about a minute and she said, 'I'm going to go see my kids.'"" McClain told NBC News.

McClain told NBC that whenever her daughter went to see her children, Fults would either pick her up himself or send someone to get her. ""That was pretty routine. So my assumption was, 'Well, she's at Steve's now, and she's staying there,'"" McClain told the outlet.

Strite's sister, Jess Strite, claimed to Fox2Now in June that Emily was ""in and out of an abusive relationship for most of her adult life"" with Fults and that her sister was not actively in a relationship with him at the time she went missing, but was in contact with him.

McClain says that on April 19, a week after she spoke to ger daughter, she received an alarming phone call from Fults, who said he hadn't heard from Emily in a week, sparking panic.

""He has never called me and questioned anything about Emily or to tell me anything about Emily,"" McClain told NBC. ""That's why I panicked when he called me because he had never done that before.""

NBC says it spoke to Fults via text in which he said the last time he saw Emily was at the end of March or beginning of April and said he was unaware she had plans to visit the kids. ""I had no knowledge of emily [sic] wanting to see her kids April 12th because she didn't call me!"" he wrote, per NBC.

He told the outlet his relationship with Emily ended in 2022 and that their relationship revolved around their three kids. He described Emily as a ""strong courageous woman and a great mom.""

The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, per NBC, says that there are currently no suspects or persons of interest because there is nothing at this time to indicate foul play or that a crime was committed.

As the investigation continues, Emily's friends paid homage to the mother of four and say they want answers.

""She literally lit up a room every chance that she got."" Amanda Bauman, Strite's childhood friend, said, per Fox2Now. ""We pray now that we get answers and whoever hurt her is brought to justice.""

Bauman's sister, Christi Bauman, added that Emily always sought to help her friends.

""Even if she was down, she was going to lift you up,"" Christi Bauman said, per Fox2Now."
Birders argue over plan to change dozens of bird names,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5137123/birders-argue-plan-change-birds-named-people,2024-10-03T11:09:26Z,"Say goodbye to Bachman's Sparrow, Scott's Oriole and Townsend's Warbler. Those three birds are among a half-dozen that will get renamed first under a plan by the American Ornithological Society to do away with common bird names that honor people.

But whether or not the society will keep going after that, and get rid of all eponymous bird names, remains to be seen.

Last year, the society announced a plan to do just that. The goal was to rename over a hundred North and South American birds, to purge bird names of links to racism and colonialism without having to engage in contentious and time-consuming debates about the morality of every historical figure that had ever been honored in a bird's common name.

The sweeping move, however, surprised and upset many birders and ornithologists.

This week, opponents and proponents will get to have their say at the society's annual meeting in Colorado, which features a forum on Thursday to discuss the bird renaming plan.

""I cannot predict what is going to happen there,"" says Kenn Kaufman, an author of field guides and a fellow of the society.

He's seen his fair share of birding controversies, like when birders debated whether they had to actually see a bird or just hear its call in order to add it to their birding life list.

This controversy, though, is in its own league, says Kaufman.

""Something at this scale, I don't think has ever happened before,"" he says. ""The decision was put out there, there was a very strong reaction in some quarters, and so the initial decision might wind up being altered.""

On May 25, 2020, George Floyd was killed on the same day that a white woman called the police on Christian Cooper, a Black man out birding in New York, heightening awareness of social justice issues in society more generally and in birding specifically.

That year, the American Ornithological Society took action on a proposal to rename a bird that had previously been named after a high-ranking Confederate officer. McCown's Longspur suddenly became the Thick-billed Longspur.

This renaming proposal had been rejected a couple years earlier, but times had changed. Confederate statues and monuments were coming down in cities and towns.

And a group called Bird Names For Birds was urging the society to do more to address problematic bird names, likening eponymous common names to ""verbal statues.""

After forming an ad hoc committee to study the issue and make recommendations, the society announced its plan to rename all birds named after people, along with changing any other names deemed offensive.

The birds would get new names selected to highlight each bird's key features.

""Names have power and power can be for the good or it can be for the bad,"" society president Colleen Handel told NPR at the time. ""We want these names to be powerful in a really good way.""

Kaufman says to him, the arguments for just renaming all of these birds made a lot of sense.

Consider Clark's nutcracker, he says, which is named for William Clark of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Some consider Clark to be a great American hero, says Kaufman, but he also kept a man named York in slavery and refused his pleas for freedom.

""The arguments about whether or not he deserves to have a bird named for him,"" says Kaufman, ""could get to be pretty dicey.""

Canceling heroes

But this spring, over six thousand people signed a petition urging the society to reconsider its plan, saying it should use a case-by-case method.

This was followed by a resolution signed by over two hundred of the society's own fellows. These ornithologists said that while the society could do a pilot project to change clearly offensive bird names, it should hold off on moving beyond that until it had better consulted with its members, with measures such as an opinion poll.

""An important point here is that changing bird names sends a stronger message if the names are restricted to offensive names rather than replacing all eponymous names,"" says Steven Beissinger, professor emeritus with the University of California, Berkeley, who helped organize the resolution.

A lot of important ornithology history is embedded in names, he says, noting that Henslow's sparrow honors John Stevens Henslow, a mentor of Charles Darwin and a committed abolitionist. The Blackburnian warbler, meanwhile, is named after Anna Blackburne, a pioneering female scientist of the 18th century.

""This decision to get rid of eponyms also extends to Central and South American birds,"" says Beissinger. ""It might offend many Latin American ornithologists by canceling their heroes for whom birds have been named.""

He points out that Juan Gundlach, considered to be the father of Cuban ornithology, has a hawk named after him, and there's a flycatcher named after Chico Mendes, a conservationist who was murdered because of his work to preserve the Amazonian rainforest.

A positive process

In May, when the society announced that it had chosen six birds to rename in a pilot project, ""it felt like exciting progress,"" a co-founder of Bird Names for Birds, Jordan Rutter, told NPR in a July email. ""There was a lot of community support around it.""

But few details beyond the six birds had been provided, Rutter noted.

Handel, the society president, says that after the discussion held this week at the annual meeting, ""we will be incorporating ideas and suggestions from our members into the plans for the pilot project.""

""Our members have expressed strong support for the pilot project,"" Handel added. ""With everyone's help, it can serve as an enriching experience for all those who participate in it. The results of the project will then provide guideposts for our next steps.""

The six birds chosen for the pilot project seem to be ones that almost everyone could agree should be changed, says Robert Driver of Duke University.

""People who have birds named after them that are well-documented white supremacists, or grave robbers of Native American skulls, and things like this,"" says Driver.

To him, selecting these six birds seems like a way for the society ""to actually walk back a little bit and change some high-priority ones first and then reassess what the feeling is after these major ones are gone.""

Driver was behind that proposal to change the bird named after Confederate major general John McCown, and he says he's come to appreciate the process the proposal went through, despite the initial rejection and all the time it took.

""To me it was a positive process, overall, and the community really got to learn about John P. McCown,"" he says.

He says changing every single honorific name, in contrast, would mean that ornithologists would not be forced to confront the past in the same way.

""We don't have to worry about what Scott did or Townsend did or Bachman did or Audubon did or whoever,"" says Driver. ""We're changing them all. They're all going.""

That's why, even though he knows the society didn't want to argue over every individual bird species, he personally thinks there would be some benefits if this effort ends up going bird by bird, ""slowly un-turning every stone, and finding out all this history, and really diving into it."""
Virginia school board to pay 'wrongfully fired' teacher who refused to use student's preferred pronouns,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/virginia-school-board-pay-wrongfully-fired-teacher-who-refused-use-students-preferred-pronouns,2024-10-03T10:51:36Z,"Tammy Fournier said she and her husband did not go along with school district's ""affirmative care"" model, so they removed her daughter from the district and she later desisted from her gender dysphoria

The Virginia-based West Point School Board agreed to pay a former high school teacher $575,000 in damages and attorney's fees after he refused to call a transgender student by their preferred pronouns.

""I was wrongfully fired from my teaching job because my religious beliefs put me on a collision course with school administrators who mandated that teachers ascribe to only one perspective on gender identity -- their preferred view,"" Peter Vlaming said.

""I loved teaching French and gracefully tried to accommodate every student in my class, but I couldn't say something that directly violated my conscience,"" he added. ""I'm very grateful for the work of my attorneys at Alliance Defending Freedom to bring my case to victory, and hope it helps protect every other teacher and professor's fundamental First Amendment rights.""

MAX INCLUSIVITY: HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS LETTING NEW HIRES ID THEMSELVES WITH CUSTOM PRONOUNS

The settlement stems from a lawsuit filed by Alliance Defending Freedom against the school board in September 2019.

Vlaming, who taught French at West Point High School for 7 years, lost his job after the board made the unanimous 5-0 decision to fire him.

Vlaming said he could not comply with the school district's policy to refer to students with pronouns inconsistent with their biological sex.

According to the ADF,""Vlaming tried to accommodate the student by consistently using the student's new preferred name and by avoiding the use of pronouns altogether.""

However, school officials were obstinate that Vlaming used the student's preferred pronouns and also to use them ""even when the student wasn't present,"" ADF claimed.

""Peter wasn't fired for something he said; he was fired for something he couldn't say. The school board violated his First Amendment rights under the Virginia Constitution and commonwealth law,"" ADF senior counsel Tyson Langhofer said.

Several months before Vlaming's court victory, the Virginia Supreme Court reinstated this case after it was stuck down in a lower court. Per the Virginia Mercury, the King William Circuit Court ""did not believe Vlaming had any valid reasons for the law to accept his suit.""

""However, the Supreme Court determined in December that the school board violated Vlaming's rights,"" the outlet reported.

The board did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

The settlement comes after Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin updated ""model policies"" regarding the treatment of transgender students, claiming that the previous ""guidelines disregarded the rights of parents."""
Texas man suspected of aggravated robbery and threatening to cut off woman's finger arrested,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-man-suspected-aggravated-robbery-threatening-cut-off-womans-finger-arrested,2024-10-03T10:31:38Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Police in the Dallas Metroplex have arrested a suspect believed to be part of a group of four men who allegedly forced a woman to the ground, tied her up, threatened to cut off her fingers and then walked away with more than $75,000 worth of cash and items from her home.

Manuel Hernandez-Hernandez, 28, was arrested in Colleyville on Monday and is being held on an immigration hold at the Dallas County Jail, according to an arrest affidavit.

Hernandez-Hernandez had been arrested and released in Colleyville 10 days earlier, but the arrest report didn't state what those charges were.

The arrest affidavit states that a woman pulled into her driveway in Dallas on Sept. 21, and was approached by four unknown men when she got out of her vehicle. It states she was forced to the ground by gunpoint, then forced into her home and eventually tied up with pieces of clothing in her bedroom.

She told police that the men spoke Spanish and used Google Translate to communicate with her, threatening to cut off her fingers if she didn't tell them the location of her safe.

Documents say the men fled with $75,000 in cash, the woman's phone, a Gucci purse and several coins from a wooden box.

The men allegedly took her to a bathroom and told her to wait at least 10 minutes before moving. She made it several minutes before making her way to the neighbor's house, where she called the police.

The affidavit says the woman still had some of the clothing tied to her, and that she refused transport to a hospital for medical observation.

Investigators say the woman's house was ransacked and that Hernandez-Hernandez's fingerprints were identified from the wooden box which contained the coins.

The woman was shown a lineup of men but told police she didn't remember any of their faces.

Police found video footage a few days later showing a possible suspect's vehicle and two unknown suspects approaching the woman's garage about the same time of the purported incident.

News of the incident led to social media posts claiming the men were members of the Tren de Aragua gang from Venezuela, but so far no evidence supports that.

Watch: Pro-Israel influencer recovers West Bank interview with Palestinian woman he was threatened to delete,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/pro-israel-influencer-recovers-west-bank-interview-with-palestinian-woman-that-he-was-threatened-to-delete,2024-10-03T09:09:30Z,"Zach Sage Fox traveled to the West Bank to see if Palestinian people truly support the Hamas terror group, but he almost didn't make it out alive.

Comedian and pro-Israel influencer Zach Sage Fox believes an interview he filmed in the West Bank could show Americans how Palestinian civilians truly feel about Jewish people - but it took him months to recover the footage after he was threatened to delete it.

Fox has been on a crusade to educate his followers since the terror attacks of October 7. He went viral earlier this year when his ""Gaza Graduation"" video featured anti-Israel protesters in New York City struggling to correctly answer basic questions about the Israel-Hamas war and decided to take his popular man-on-the-street style interviews to the West Bank, a contentious territory that Palestinians hope to establish as an independent state along with the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip.

Fox, a ""loud and proud"" Jewish American, told anyone who asked that he was an Italian American and was able to cross the border into the West Bank without issue, because Israelis and Jewish people are not welcomed in the region.

INFLUENCER WENT TO THE WEST BANK TO SEE IF PALESTINIANS SUPPORT HAMAS - HE ALMOST DIDN'T MAKE IT OUT ALIVE

Fox found several people walking West Bank streets who were quick to express support for the Hamas terror group and declared Israeli hostages should not be released, but things got dicey when he tried to interview a woman whose hair was fully covered. A ""very upset"" Palestinian man approached him and asked him to delete the footage.

""They're not used to anybody questioning their narrative that they've been brainwashed to believe. And you can see it ... I'm interviewing that girl just for several minutes and these men watching it, they can't even accept that you would be asking questions because it's not a free society,"" Fox told Fox News Digital.

Fox recalled the man yelling ""something about modesty,"" and that females shouldn't speak for all Palestinians. Fox attempted to ignore the man, but he only grew more agitated and started calling additional Palestinian men for support. He explained that he caved and deleted the footage when his Muslim cameraman said the angry group was threatening their lives.

Fox initially enlisted a team of IT specialists who were able to recover some of the footage, and every interview that was salvaged made the viral ""Wild West Bank"" video. But his conversation with the woman who sparked the conversation remained lost.

""Dozens of cyberhackers,"" additional IT specialists and even an Israel Defense Forces veteran with a passion for technology all tried unsuccessfully to restore the video. Fox was beginning to lose hope, but was eager to show the world what this woman had to say because she was ""emblematic of the mindset"" in the region.

She was ""clearly educated"" and spoke perfect English, dressed in designer clothes and said she was an engineer. Yet, she believed all Zionist should be killed.

FOX NEWS MEDIA DRAWS 10.4 MILLION FOR SIMULCAST OF THE CBS VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Another technology expert caught wind of the story and offered to help recover the video. Fox thought it was impossible and was reluctant to set himself up for further disappointment but eventually said ""f -- k it"" and gave them a shot.

""A week later I got a call that they recovered almost all of it. It was a miracle,"" Fox said.

Fox then watched the footage and ""couldn't believe his eyes.""

""To see that interview back after three months was insane... I didn't know when my cameraman stopped filming, so I didn't realize, one, that you could see the men starting to pull the other men in the into the thing. I didn't realize you could see that behind me,"" he said.

""I also didn't realize that my cameraman kept the camera going long enough so that you actually saw the people cut the camera off and stop the shoot,"" Fox added. ""So, that was like wild to me.""

Fox then published ""Wild West Bank: Deleted Scenes Exploded,"" allowing the world to see the footage the angry Palestinian men tried to scrub.

VIRAL INFLUENCER ZACH SAGE FOX PUT SPOTLIGHT ON CLUELESS ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS: 'NO ONE KNEW ANYTHING'

In the shocking video, the woman told him that most Palestinians support Hamas, she proudly declared being ""really satisfied"" with footage Hamas terrorists took on Oct. 7. She also denied Hamas killed babies and women during the attack and said no Israelis are ""innocent civilians."" She suggested she is a ""refugee"" despite her family living in the West Bank for multiple generations and flatly dismissed a two-state solution. Along the way, Fox politely pushed back on antisemitic claims and absurd talking points.

""I am an educated person, it's either us or us,"" she said when suggesting Jewish people need to leave Israel for good. When Fox told her there would ""never be peace"" with that mindset, she fired back, ""It's their problem.""

As a man began lurking in the background, Fox asked if she believes Zionists deserve to die.

""Cut, cut real quick,"" the man said. ""What side are you on?""

Fox calmly responded that he was simply asking questions, but the man demanded to know where he was from.

""I'm from the states,"" Fox answered as the man demanded the cameraman stop recording.

The video abruptly cuts off.

NETANYAHU RESPONDS TO HEZBOLLAH ATTACK THAT KILLED CHILDREN AT SOCCER FIELD: 'THIS WILL NOT GO UNANSWERED

Fox feels ""vindicated"" that he was able to share the footage.

""I just think this girl is really representative of how these people think,"" Fox said.

""I feel bad for her, I know that sounds crazy cause she's literally sitting there saying everyone who I love deserves to die,"" he continued. ""But my takeaway is that she's the perfect example of somebody who's not stupid. She's an engineer, she's a smart girl, but she's been brainwashed by the propaganda they're taught in Palestine.""

Earlier this year, the Department of State urged Americans to avoid the West Bank because of ""terrorism and civil unrest.""

Fox remains one of the only Americans to enter the West Bank and try to ask tough questions, but he doesn't believe State Department warnings are the thing keeping America journalists out of the region.

""I genuinely think that they know deep down, whether they want to admit it or not, that they would find... it totally negates their narrative, which is that, you know, 'Hamas is bad, but the Palestinians are separate,'"" Fox said.

""I wish that was the case. I truthfully didn't believe it myself until I went there that day,"" he added. ""They love Hamas."""
"It's harder to pay and travel for abortion care, but support funds are struggling",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5131573/abortion-fund-travel-state-bans-ballot-measures-national-federation-budget-cuts-repro-rights,2024-10-03T09:02:12Z,"Bree Wallace works for the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund. The group uses donations to help people pay for abortion care in Florida, and to travel to other states, but has struggled financially to keep up with the demand.

Stephanie Colombini/WUSF hide caption

Getting an abortion can cost hundreds, if not thousands of dollars, especially if a patient must leave a state with a strict abortion ban.

But the organizations that provide financial support, sometimes known as abortion funds, are struggling financially and slashing their budgets, unable to meet the needs of the growing number of people asking for help.

Planned Parenthood of New England is warning of a projected $8.6 million deficit. Funds in Ohio, Chicago, Arizona and Florida don't have enough money to meet demand.

Even the National Abortion Federation, which runs a national hotline that helps cover procedure costs, was forced to cut its monthly budget in half, due to fewer donations.

Previously, the Federation had covered up to 50 percent of an eligible patient's costs in most locations. In July, it dropped that coverage to 30 percent.

""We're in the midst of an abortion funding crisis,"" says Oriaku Njoku, the executive director of the National Network of Abortion Funds, which provides an online search tool for patients to find a local or regional assistance fund.

Njoku and others at these funds point to intersecting pressures: increased demand for financial assistance for abortions, additional expenses due to some patients having to travel across state lines, and a decline in donor interest.

The initial wave of ""rage donations"" that flowed into the national and regional funds, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, has subsided.

""It's weird to see the divestment like, don't you see the crisis anymore?"" says Jenice Fountain, executive director of the Yellowhammer Fund in Alabama.

""We're absolutely, very much still in crisis, potentially even worse crisis than when the ban first happened.""

The Yellowhammer Fund supports pregnancy and prenatal care, and is involved in a lawsuit against Alabama's Attorney General, after he threatened to prosecute groups like Yellowhammer for helping patients travel out of state for abortion care.

""People ask 'Why should we donate if Alabama doesn't have an abortion clinic?'"" Fountain says.

""And it's like, well, that's a reason to double down on support in Alabama. We're fighting the thing. We have to exist the whole time that we fight the thing.""

But abortion hasn't faded from the news, or become less politically potent. In fact, reproductive rights have become a prominent issue in this year's presidential election.

Ten states will put ballot measures on abortion rights before voters in November, and many Democratic candidates have made it a central issue to their campaign.

The cumulative effect has been to divert donations away from the funds that support patients directly -- and towards specific candidates and ballot initiatives.

In August, more than 30 local abortion funds across the U.S. signed an op-ed criticizing national reproductive rights organizations for focusing too much on advocacy rather than patient care.

""I think there's this false hope and illusion with putting the right president in place, or winning this ballot initiative,"" says Eloisa Lopez, executive director of the Abortion Fund of Arizona.

""None of that is actually funding abortion care,"" Lopez says. ""You can have all those things in place and people are still not going to be able to get their care.""

Even after the election ends, Lopez fears that donors will continue to assume that grassroots abortion funds like hers don't need as much support -- especially if voters approve state-level ballot initiatives that affirm reproductive rights.

""I think when people see progress is being made, it's translating into people's minds, like 'We're not going to have struggles trying to get abortion anymore.'""

But advocates say that the struggles to pay out-of-pocket for abortion care, or travel elsewhere for care, will continue in all states.

Bree Wallace, an employee at the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund, typically spends her days glued to her laptop, messaging back-and-forth with pregnant clients who need help paying abortion care -- and fast, if they want to comply with Florida's six-week ban.

One afternoon in July, a woman texted the fund from the waiting room of a clinic. She needed an abortion, but couldn't pay.

The National Abortion Hotline had pledged to cover 30 percent, leaving her with a fee of $490.

""It can be pretty hefty for people,"" says Wallace, 27, the fund's director of case management.

Within minutes, Wallace committed to help. All the woman had to do was share her first name and last initial. The clinic would directly charge the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund for the balance, and the woman could move forward with her appointment.

In Florida, an abortion can cost between $600 to $800, during the first trimester. Florida law requires a mandatory in-person consultation and an ultrasound, followed by a 24-hour waiting period.

Since 1977, the Hyde Amendment has severely restricted the use of federal funds for abortion care. In practice, that means Medicaid doesn't cover it -- unless individual states cover the entire cost with state funds.

Florida Medicaid does not cover abortion care, and state law also bans coverage by insurance plans sold on the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

Many patients must therefore pay for the entire cost, and have little time to gather the funds under the state's six-week ban.

Bree explained that many women don't even know they're pregnant by six weeks. But if they do, they often have just days to act.

""Especially with six weeks right now you're kind of working against time, you don't even have time to even get that money,"" Wallace says.

Before Florida's six-week ban went into effect last spring, some patients could have saved up their own money. But now they need the fund's help, says Wallace.

At the Abortion Fund of Arizona, declining donations have forced spending cuts. In September, the Fund spent about $18,000 assisting patients -- half of what the Fund spent in July.

Often, that monthly allotment is gone in just two weeks, and staffers must turn down requests for aid, or tell patients to try again next month.

""It's a really terrible position where we're having to give people ideas about how to raise money on their own,"" says executive director Eloisa Lopez.

""'Can you ask your family or friends? Do you have a credit card? Could you take out a line of credit? Do you have items in your home you can sell?'""

Since most states near Florida also ban abortion, patients past the state's six-week mark are traveling to places like Washington, D.C. or Illinois for care.

Between last-minute airfare and hotel stays, that can push the price up another $1,000.

""There's also taking off work. That can be hard for a lot of people, finding childcare,"" Wallace says. ""Sometimes this is the first time people have ever been on a plane, ever left Florida...it can be really confusing and stressful.""

Earlier this year, the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund decided it could spend fifty thousand dollars a month helping pay for procedures and travel. But since May, it's regularly blown past that limit.

The fund doesn't want to turn down someone who really needs help, Wallace says. She read out loud a grateful text she recently received from a client.

""'Thank you,' with a million exclamation points,"" Wallace reads from the screen. ""'Thank you so much,' with even more exclamation points. 'I appreciate you for what you do, you just helped me more than you know.'""

The Tampa fund hopes to do more fund-raising this fall. But if future donations don't keep up with spending, it will completely run out of money in 3-6 months, according to Wallace.

Because of the federal Hyde Amendment, abortion funds must turn to private donations from individuals, community groups or foundations.

But in many states, federal and state funds are used to support crisis pregnancy centers that oppose abortion and often try to dissuade people from getting an abortion. In the last 5 years, about $400 million dollars in federal money flowed to crisis pregnancy centers across the country."
Connecticut man punches pregnant woman in violent carjacking attempt at Dunkin' Donuts drive-thru,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/connecticut-man-punches-pregnant-woman-violent-carjacking-attempt-dunkin-donuts-drive-thru,2024-10-03T08:31:18Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A Connecticut man has been arrested after allegedly assaulting a pregnant woman while attempting to steal her vehicle.

The East Haven Police department released a statement Wednesday following a report of an attempted carjacking in a Dunkin' Donuts drive-thru.

The incident occurred on Tuesday, October 1 when William Rodriguez, 28, pulled into the parking lot directly in front of the victim's car, according to authorities.

Rodriguez then allegedly exited his vehicle and climbed into the passenger side of the woman's car and demanded her keys. When she refused to surrender her keys, Rodriguez then began punching the woman, who was four months pregnant, before she could escape the vehicle and run inside the restaurant to seek help.

An employee working inside the drive-thru witnessed the assault and notified two coworkers, who then ran outside and restrained Rodriguez, who was attempting to flee in the victim's vehicle, according to the police statement.

When officers arrived at the scene, Rodriquez continued to struggle and after being taken into custody he bit a medic's hand.

The vehicle in Rodriguez's possession at the time of the assault, a 2016 Hyundai Elantra, had been reported stolen previously.

Rodriguez faces multiple charges of Breach of Peace, 2nd Degree Assault on Emergency Medical Personnel, Robbery in the 3rd Degree, Reckless Endangerment in the 2nd Degree, Assault on a Pregnant Person, Assault in the 3rd Degree, Interfering with an Officer and two counts of Larceny of a Motor Vehicle.

He is being held on a $250,000 bond for the charges, in addition to multiple outstanding arrest warrants totaling $475,000 and two outstanding warrants from CSP Troop A and Troop I.

Democrat House candidate says women aren't worried about transgender athletes in their sports locker rooms,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/democrat-congressional-candidate-claims-women-athletes-arent-worried-about-transgenders-sports,2024-10-03T02:16:35Z,"Macy Petty, a Concerned Women for America legislative assistant and an NCAA college volleyball player, discusses the controversy surrounding San Jose State University's volleyball team.

As female athletes and lawmakers across the country fight to keep biological males out of women's sports competitions and locker rooms, a Democrat running for the House of Representatives says she and women athletes are not worried about the issue.

Sue Altman, who is running for New Jersey's Seventh Congressional District, told the New York Post that she and others in women's locker rooms are not worried about the presence of transgender athletes in women's sports.

""As someone who's been working to advocate for women's rights and women's sports, I promise you that in the locker rooms of women's sports teams, we're not super worried about this,"" Altman said. ""We've been worried about getting equal access to gym time, good referees, good trainers so you don't get injured, fair shake at scholarships, equal pay at the higher levels.""

Altman advocated for allowing transgenders in girls' sports at the youth level, but she suggested she would be in favor of leaving individual committees the decision to allow those athletes to compete.

""I will let individual sport[s] committees decide the highest, highest-level things, but at the very heart of it, we have to respect people of all genders and give young children, especially young people and adolescents struggling with their gender identity, the chance to compete,"" she told the Post.

""I grew up with people who are now trans, who have transitioned from boy to girl or girl to boy, and those people struggled in adolescence.""

Altman is a former women's college basketball player who played at Columbia University in the early 2000s. She ended her career there as the program's eighth-leading scorer in history with 964 points. She did this despite playing for Holy Cross her freshman year, transferring to Columbia and sitting out her sophomore year due to NCAA guidelines.

Altman also played professionally in Europe for Killester in the Irish Women's Super League in Dublin and for Medical Instinct Veilchen in Goettingen, Germany.

Almtan has said she grew up in a family of Republicans but that her time at Columbia made her more liberal. In an interview with Columbia's student newspaper in March, she cited the Bush administration's response to 9/11 as a reason for her switching allegiances during her time in college.

Now, she is running against Rep. Tom Kean Jr., R-N.J., who has more than 20 years of experience in the House of Representatives.

Altman is also running in an election year that has seen multiple lawsuits filed by women athletes and at least 24 lawsuits by state attorneys general in response to transgender athletes in women's sports and Title IX changes by the Biden-Harris administration, which some argue enable biological men into women's locker rooms and on their field of play.

In April, the administration issued a sweeping rule to clarify that Title IX's ban on ""sex"" discrimination in schools covers discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and ""pregnancy or related conditions.""

GOP GOVERNOR REVEALS WHY HE ORDERED SCHOOLS TO BAR TRANSGENDERS FROM GIRLS' SPORTS

The rule took effect Aug. 1, and for the first time, the law stated that discrimination based on sex includes conduct related to a person's gender identity. The Biden administration insisted the regulation does not address athletic eligibility. However, multiple experts presented evidence to Fox News Digital in June that the proposal would ultimately put more biological men in women's sports.

On Aug. 16, the Supreme Court voted, 5-4, to reject a Biden administration emergency request to enforce portions of that new rule, which includes protection from discrimination for transgender students under Title IX, after more than two dozen Republican attorneys general filed lawsuits against the administration to block its enforcement.

Meanwhile, Brooke Slusser, a member of San Jose State's women's volleyball team, joined 18 other athletes in suing the NCAA over its gender identity policies. The lawsuit alleged that Slusser, who transferred to San Jose State, was concerned for her safety after realizing one of her new teammates, Blaire Fleming, was transgender. Three of San Jose State's opponents have already forfeited games against the team since news of the lawsuit spread.

Former NCAA swimmer and OutKick contributor Riley Gaines has testified in Georgia about her experience competing against and sharing a locker room with transgender athlete Lia Thomas, a biological male, alongside four other NCAA All-American women athletes. Gaines is joined by Reka Gyorgy, Kylee Alons, Grace Countie and Kaitlynn Wheeler, all members of the Independent Council on Women's Sports, who filed a lawsuit against the NCAA in March alleging the association knowingly violated Title IX in allowing Thomas to compete.

The committee's inquiry will focus on the 2022 NCAA Division I Women's Swimming and Diving Championships, where Thomas competed for the University of Pennsylvania women's swimming team. Gaines competed against and eventually tied Thomas, who identifies as a woman, in the 200-yard championships in 2022.

Far away from Altman's constituents in the Northeast, one Republican governor has already passed an executive order to ensure schools prevent biological males from competing in women's sports.

On Aug. 28, Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed an executive order to enforce the Defending Women's Sports Act, which issued new protocols for the state's public schools to promote the exclusion of transgender athletes in women's sports. In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital on Aug. 30, Little did not rule out administering gender eligibility tests for all girls' and women's sports teams but added that ""I'd have to see really good evidence that that's necessary.""

But Altman says she wants to reduce barriers for transgender athletes to compete as women for the sake of their mental health.

""If we decide as a society that making rules about who is and who isn't female is more important than giving young children a chance to be on teams and compete and to be part of something bigger than themselves, especially young people who are more susceptible to suicide and bullying, then I think we've lost our way a little bit,"" Altman said."
Opinion | JD Vance tried to mansplain his way into the good graces of women. It didn't work.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-vice-presidential-debate-fail-rcna173598,2024-10-02T23:54:23Z,"Vance admits Republicans have a problem when it comes to women's trust. That doesn't mean he has a plan.

Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance arguably had one job going into Tuesday night's debate: convince the American public that he, and his party, don't hate women.

Even with that painfully low bar, I'd say he failed to do the job. The once anti-Trump senator did wear a pink tie, but did not face up to his past comments about menopausal women, ""childless cat ladies"" and a historically low favorability rate. Instead, he used most of his allotted speaking time to mansplain his views to the two women who were moderating, women who vote, and even his own wife.

During a question on immigration, Vance tried to talk over CBS moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, after he regurgitated dangerous lies about Haitian immigrants living in Springfield, Ohio. To Vance's dismay, Brennan reminded the audience that the immigrants in Springfield are there legally.

""The rules that you were not going to fact-check,"" Vance quipped, referring to CBS' statement that it would leave it to Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to fact check each other during the debate. ""And since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.""

Vance talked over and interrupted both O'Donnell and Brennan as they tried to move forward with the debate.

""Thank you, senator, for describing the legal process,"" Brennan said, before the network then muted Vance's mic.

""The audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Brennan said. ""We have so much we want to get into. Thank you for explaining the legal process,"" she added, in a tone every woman sitting in a cubicle, boardroom or classroom knows deep in her bones.

Unlike his windmill-, shark- and Hannibal Lecter-obsessed running mate, Vance deftly wields a very specific type of misogyny that, while far less obvious, is just as insidious -- one that can come off as empathic, but is undeniably condescending as it normalizes the most draconian right-wing policies.

One example of this was Vance consistently referring to Brennan -- a woman he does not personally know -- by her first name rather than addressing her appropriately. The slight-of-hand misogynistic move may have been Vance's attempt to appear likable and down-to-earth, but many viewers saw it differently: condescending, patronizing and rude.

Vance himself admitted that the Republican Party has a problem when it comes to women's trust. He reminded women watching Tuesday that they do not trust Republicans when it comes to abortion and the human right to bodily autonomy -- yet failed to explain how he, his running mate and his fellow party members plan to address the problem.

""We've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue where they, frankly, just don't trust us,"" Vance said, before claiming that is ""one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do.""

To demonstrate his party's commitment to earning that end, Vance lied about not supporting a nationwide abortion ban, the realities of abortion care later in pregnancy, and Minnesota's PRO Act, signed by his opponent, Gov. Tim Walz. Because nothing says ""trust me, I know what's best for you"" like holding an impromptu masterclass on gaslighting.

While Vance was able to appear far more level-headed than Trump in his fateful debate performance against Vice President Kamala Harris last month, it was Vance's faux praise of his wife while discussing the necessity of child care that truly embodied his very specific type of mansplaining and misogyny.

""I speak from this very personally because I'm married to a beautiful woman who is an incredible mother to our three beautiful kids, but is also a very, very brilliant corporate litigator, and I'm so proud of her,"" Vance began. ""But being a working mom, even for somebody with all of the advantages of my wife, is extraordinarily difficult.""

It's telling, when a man publicly laments the challenges his working wife faces, yet doesn't seem to face those same challenges as a working father. While appearing to appreciate all his wife does, Vance still chose to mansplain how hard it is to work outside the home while managing the majority of child care and household responsibilities without structural support -- the exact structural support Republicans have historically opposed.

For his bropropriating coup de grâce, Vance then pontificated on the importance of giving a ""family care model that makes choice possible.""

""The cultural pressure on young families, and especially young women, I think, makes it really hard for people to choose the family model they want,"" Vance said, ignoring how anti-abortion laws make it difficult, dangerous and in some cases impossible for women to choose when and how to start creating a ""family model"" in the first place.

Overall, it's true that during Tuesday's debate Vance succeeded in portraying himself as a level-headed, somewhat ordinary politician (if the definition of ""ordinary"" is calmly discussing the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history). But that is perhaps what makes Vance far more Machiavellian than Trump even. And it's what should put us all on high alert as we prepare to head to the polls in November."
Harris and Biden surveyed damage wrought by Hurricane Helene in 2 swing states,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5136749/kamala-harris-joe-biden-hurricane-helene-north-carolina-georgia,2024-10-02T23:26:55Z,"AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Vice President Harris took a pause from the campaign trail on Wednesday to visit a neighborhood ravaged by Hurricane Helene where more than half of residents don't have power and many don't have running water, consoling a woman who she said had lost her husband.

""There is real pain and trauma that has resulted because of this hurricane,"" Harris said.

Meanwhile, President Biden spent about an hour flying over Asheville, N.C., by helicopter. ""You can see homes that are moved, clearly, from one side of the river, down the river to another side,"" he said. ""Communities like Chimney Rock are reduced to piles of wood and debris.""

Biden and Harris are trying to reassure residents hurt by the massive storm that the federal government will help the region recover. Making good on that promise is a critical test for the administration in this election year, particularly in the swing states of North Carolina and Georgia, where Biden and Harris visited.

But Biden said it wasn't about politics. ""At a moment like this, we put politics aside -- at least, we should put it all aside, and we have, here,"" Biden said at a briefing at an emergency operations center in Raleigh, N.C.

""There are no Democrats, Republicans -- only Americans -- and our job is to help as many people as we can, as quickly as we can, and as thoroughly as we can,"" he said.

Biden announced that the federal government would cover 100% of the costs of debris removal and emergency protective measures for six months for North Carolina, as requested by its Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper.

He also directed up to 1,000 active-duty soldiers to be deployed to help the North Carolina National Guard deliver food, water and medicine.

In Georgia, Harris said the federal government would cover 100% of the costs of debris removal and emergency protective measures for three months for the state, as requested by its Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. Kemp was not with her for the tour.

The White House also announced that Biden had authorized 100% of the costs of debris removal and emergency protective measures for three months for Florida -- a state he plans to visit on Thursday.

Biden will also make a stop on Thursday in Valdosta, Ga. That's where former President Donald Trump was on Monday, where he, too, said that disasters transcend politics.

""As you know, our country is in the final weeks of a hard-fought national election. But in a time like this, when a crisis hits, when our fellow citizens cry out in need, none of that matters. We're not talking about politics now. We have to all get together and get this solved,"" Trump said.

But during his stop, Trump falsely said Gov. Kemp had not been able to reach Biden. ""He's been calling the president, hasn't been able to get him. But they'll come through, I'm sure,"" Trump said. Biden later that day angrily criticized Trump.

""He's lying, and the governor told him he was lying,"" Biden said, noting he had spoken with Kemp. ""I don't know why he [Trump] does this. And the reason I get so angry about it -- I don't care about what he says about me, but I care what he communicates to the people that are in need. He implies that we're not doing everything possible. We are,"" Biden said."
College football Week 6 preview: Penn State vs. UCLA  --  trap game for Nittany Lions?,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/college-football-week-6-preview-penn-state-vs-ucla-trap-game-nittany-lions,2024-10-02T23:21:28Z,"""Big Noon Kickoff"" heads to Penn State this weekend as the No. 7-ranked Nittany Lions, fresh off a victory over Illinois, take on UCLA at Beaver Stadium (Noon ET on FOX and the FOX Sports App).

James Franklin's team is off to an impressive 4-0 start this season, relying on a balanced attack behind junior QB Drew Allar and the one-two rushing punch of Nicholas Singleton and Kaytron Allen. On the defensive side of the ball, the Nittany Lions are holding opposing teams to just 11.5 points and 226.5 yards per game, both of which rank second in the Big Ten through five weeks of the season.

On the other side, UCLA has struggled mightily on both sides of the ball in DeShaun Foster's first year at the helm. The Bruins sit at 1-3 overall and rank last in the Big Ten in total offense, and 17th in the 18-team Big Ten in total defense.

Penn State is one of five remaining unbeaten teams in the Big Ten. The Nittany Lions are set to take on UCLA this weekend before a massive three-game stretch: at No. 11 USC, at Wisconsin, home against Ohio State. What do you expect to see in this weekend's matchup, and could this serve as a potential trap game for James Franklin's team?

Laken Litman: Penn State is in pretty good shape right now heading into this week's matchup vs. UCLA. The Nittany Lions are fresh off beating an undefeated team in Illinois, which is a nice College Football Playoff résumé-booster. Their defense has been strong - the unit is only allowing 11.5 ppg and tallied seven sacks against the Fighting Illini last Saturday. Those kinds of numbers are unfortunate for a UCLA team, which has one of the worst offenses in the country and enters this game having lost its last three.

Nicholas Singleton has been one of the more productive running backs in the country (averaging 102 rushing yards per game) and quarterback Drew Allar has been efficient and has protected the ball, throwing just one interception through four games. Penn State's only weakness so far is its propensity for missing field goals. Kicker Sander Sahaydak missed both attempts last week and is 2-of-5 on the season. That's going to need to improve for when the team inevitably finds itself in a close game later on.

The Nittany Lions have a lot going for them right now, and while it's not unreasonable to call this a trap game, the Bruins have not proven to be dangerous enough to pull off an upset.

Michael Cohen: On paper, it's easy to see why this week's game against lowly UCLA could be considered a trap game for Penn State. The Nittany Lions are in a great place after beating No. 19 Illinois last week to remain unbeaten at 4-0 overall and 1-0 in the Big Ten. And two weeks from now, on Oct. 12, they'll be in Los Angeles for what should be an incredible game against No. 11 USC that might have legitimate Big Ten title implications. Both the Nittany Lions and Trojans are among a handful of programs seeking to keep pace with No. 3 Ohio State and No. 6 Oregon in the national rankings this season.

But there's almost nothing about Saturday's matchup between Penn State and UCLA that suggests the game itself will be close, as the latter struggles to adjust to life in the Big Ten. An offense under the direction of head coach DeShaun Foster and offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy ranks 127th overall (262 yards per game), 127th in scoring (14.8 points per game), 133rd in rushing (57 yards per game), 124th in third-down conversion rate (27.9%) and 131st in red zone touchdown rate (30%). A defense under the direction of defensive coordinator Ikaika Malloe ranks 99th overall (398.3 yards per game), 105th in scoring (30.8 points per game), 127th against the passing (291 yards per game), 134th in opponent third-down conversion rate (58.2%) and tied for 94th in opponent red zone touchdown rate (23.5%). Even the Bruins' special teams units only rank 72nd in the country, according to the FEI Special Teams Ratings.

In other words, even if the Nittany Lions come out flat in Saturday's game, it's hard to imagine UCLA punishing them enough to pull the upset.

RJ Young: The only way this game turns into Admiral Ackbar exultation -- ""It's a trap!"" -- is if Penn State doesn't play like it has for the previous four games. Laken's right. Penn State's biggest weakness is its kicking game, but a kicker shouldn't be the difference in a game the Nittany Lions are expected to win by a whopping 28 points.

The danger for Penn State likely won't come with a loss to UCLA, but with a close win by Penn State. This is a team we're not sold on as a Big Ten title contender. Winning by less than the spread only gives more reason to doubt Penn State as they get set to travel to Los Angeles for the Trojans next weekend.

No. 10 Michigan will travel to Washington to take on the Huskies in a rematch of last year's national title game. These are two programs that appear to be in a very different spot than they were last year, despite the Wolverines' top-10 national ranking. Is this a simple case of attrition within both programs - players and coaches - or is there more to it?

RJ: It's not just that this was the national title game last year. It's that the teams Michigan and Washington beat to get there are the No. 1- (Alabama) and No. 2-ranked (Texas) teams in the country. But neither Michigan nor Washington look the same as they did a year ago: new head coaches, different coordinators.

Change is the only constant in the sport. Turnover on rosters is now catching up to turnover on coaching staffs, and the usual predictors for future success no longer mean as much. Adaptability, a sixth-or seventh-year player at QB, a healthy NIL war chest -- these are the new predictors for success, and UW and Michigan seemed to have learned the hard way through this cycle.

Washington lost to Rutgers. Michigan was embarrassed by Texas.

This game feels less like a play-in for the CFP and more like an artifact displayed to anthropologists decades from now to demonstrate how the game flipped over into this new era of the sport.

Michael: The 24-hour period from late last Friday evening through the end of Alabama's thrilling win over Georgia on Saturday night offered a fascinating window into the state of last year's College Football Playoff participants. It began when Washington, the national runner-up from the 2023 campaign, was upended by unranked Rutgers as a 55-yard field goal attempt by the Huskies went awry in the closing moments. It continued on Saturday afternoon as Michigan head coach Sherrone Moore sounded humbled and subdued during a postgame interview on FOX after his Wolverines nearly imploded in the fourth quarter against Minnesota, the victory aided at least in part by a botched officiating decision during an onside kick. Then came Texas' 35-13 win over Mississippi State in which backup quarterback Arch Manning, the former No. 1 overall player in the country, completed 26 of 31 passes for 324 yards and two touchdowns as the Longhorns remained unbeaten. And then there was the pièce de résistance: No. 4 Alabama sprinting to a 28-0 lead over No. 2 Georgia and then hanging on for what could be remembered as a season-defining win.

On the Big Ten side of that equation, the ongoing struggles at Michigan and Washington are showing just how difficult it is to replace generationally talented coaches in Jim Harbaugh and Kalen DeBoer. That the latter left Washington and immediately molded Alabama into a national championship contender following the retirement of head coach Nick Saban, who is arguably the greatest coach in college football history, shows just how stunningly special DeBoer really is after a mediocre rise from Sioux Falls to Fresno State and from Washington to the Crimson Tide. And all Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian did after losing nearly all of his skill players to the NFL was reload with a transfer portal class that had the highest net rating in the SEC, according to 247Sports.

That's the kind of ruthless efficiency and high-level player acquisition that new regimes at Michigan (Moore) and Washington (Jedd Fisch) have been unable to match thus far.

Laken: Certainly a case of attrition.

For Michigan, Jim Harbaugh is now coaching in the NFL and former quarterback J.J. McCarthy, though he's been out with an injury, was a top 10 draft pick. The Wolverines broke the all-time program record for the most players taken in one draft with 13 being selected. That takes a toll on most programs, unless you are built like Georgia or Alabama. Sherrone Moore, though he served in the role while Harbaugh missed games due to suspension last year, is in his first year as head coach. He doesn't have the kind of talent this team had a year ago, and desperately needs a quarterback and more playmakers on offense.

Meanwhile, Washington is still mourning losing its former coach Kalen DeBoer to Alabama. He's doing quite well, by the way, coming off a smashing SEC debut over the weekend in which the Crimson Tide upset Georgia in the type of game that usually happens when there's a trophy on the line. Now, he's the head coach of the No. 1 team in the country. The Huskies hired Jedd Fisch from Arizona in the offseason, but he hasn't gotten consistent production out of this team yet. Plus, when your program's top offensive playmakers are taken in the top 10 of the NFL Draft, you're naturally going to have setbacks if you can't immediately replace them.

Looking at this week's AP Top 25 Poll, is there one team that jumps out to you and has surprised you more than others?

Michael: There might have been folks out there who believed first-year head coach Curt Cignetti could turn Indiana around quickly after the Hoosiers parted ways with former head coach Tom Allen, who is now the defensive coordinator at Penn State. But it's unlikely that even the most ardent IU supporters were forecasting what we've seen so far from Cignetti and his reconfigured roster: five blowout victories in as many chances for Indiana, which entered the AP Poll at No. 23 this week. Perhaps even more shocking is that the Hoosiers rank third nationally in scoring offense at 48.8 points per game and 13th nationally in scoring defense at 13 points per game. Indiana is 5-0 for the first time since 1967.

Still, any legitimate conversation about the Hoosiers must include a discussion of the schedule Cignetti & Co. have played thus far. Based on their first five opponents -- FIU, Western Illinois, UCLA, Charlotte and Maryland, all of whom have a combined record of 9-14 this season -- the Hoosiers' strength of schedule ranks 119th nationally, according to Pro Football Focus, and second-to-last among programs from the Power 4 conferences ahead of Louisville. No other Big Ten programs have played schedules that rank outside the top 100 nationally, with Nebraska (99) and Rutgers (89) being the only other teams whose schedules even rank beyond the top 80.

Things will look much different for Indiana the rest of the way, however, as the Hoosiers' remaining schedule ranks 20th nationally in difficulty: at Northwestern, vs. Nebraska, vs. Washington, at Michigan State, vs. No. 10 Michigan, at No. 3 Ohio State, vs. Purdue. So, either Cignetti and his team are for real, or the IU bubble is about to burst sooner than later.

Laken: No. 17 BYU.

Nobody had the Cougars as a Big 12 contender, but here we are. BYU is 5-0 and No. 1 in the conference after impressive wins over then-No. 13 Kansas State and Baylor on the road. In the victory over the Bears last week, the Cougars ran out to a 28-7 lead before Dave Aranda's team showed some fight. While the offense has been inconsistent, the defense has been sound - after Baylor cut into the lead, the defense made three big stops, including a game-saving interception, to hold onto the W.

The Cougars still have to play Oklahoma State and Utah, but overall, have a winnable schedule and, at this rate, could find themselves playing for a conference championship in December. Kalani Sitake's team has shown early resilience, which should continue to serve them well.

RJ: No. 25 UNLV

Let's list what UNLV has done and been apart of since Week 1:

A win against a ranked opponent. The first real case of a player refusing to play because he said he didn't get paid the price he agreed to. The backup QB leading the team to a decisive victory to get the Runnin' Rebels into the top 25 for the first time in program history and off to its best start in school history. One of the schools who could tip the balance of power in the Pac-12 and Mountain West realignment quest for an eighth member to earn qualification to the 2026 CFP. The Rebels' Oct. 25 matchup with future Pac-12 member Boise State could give us the answer to who the favorite to win the Mountain West is and secure the G5 conference champ invitation to the first 12-team CFP.

Not a bad month in Vegas.

Oregon has outscored in-state rival Oregon State and Big Ten foe UCLA by a combined 56 points over the last two weeks. The Ducks are set to host Michigan State in a primetime Friday night matchup on FOX this week. After a slow start to the season, is this the Oregon team you expected to see, or do the Ducks still have room to grow?

Laken: After an underwhelming start to the season, Oregon has gotten into a better groove these last two weeks with convincing wins over Oregon State and UCLA. Last week, the Ducks' defense kept a clean sheet and the only touchdown allowed was a 96-yard pick six by the Bruins' Bryan Addison, who intercepted Dillon Gabriel in the second quarter. That was Gabriel's only interception of the season so far. By comparison, he's had nine touchdowns and is completing 81.5% of his passes, which is good for the best in the country. Now that Oregon's offensive line is gelling, Gabriel is looking more like the Heisman hopeful he's projected to be.

The Ducks should handle Michigan State on Friday. The real test comes the next week on Oct. 12 when Ohio State visits Autzen Stadium. That's when we'll know what kind of team Dan Lanning has this year.

RJ: They better learn to take the ball away before Oct. 12. With a turnover margin of zero -- 11th out of 18 in the Big Ten -- and three of their next four games against ranked opponents, I'd like to see the Ducks win Friday night with interceptions, fumbles recovered and a clean offense.

It's time the Ducks began to resemble the national title team we thought they could be in the preseason.

Michael: One aspect of Oregon's winning formula last season as the Ducks finished 12-2 and won the Fiesta Bowl during their second season under head coach Dan Lanning was an incredible turnover margin of plus-11 that ranked tied for fourth nationally. The only programs with better turnover margins last year were Northwestern (plus-13), Penn State (plus-16) and Michigan (plus-19), the eventual national champion. To get there, the Ducks weren't necessarily one of the best teams in the country at forcing turnovers -- after all, their 12 interceptions ranked outside the top 25 nationally and their six fumbles gained were tied for 79th -- but they had an incredible ability to avoid turning the ball over offensively. Quarterback Bo Nix, who is now starting for the Denver Broncos, tossed 45 touchdowns and only three interceptions last season. Oregon's ball carriers only lost two fumbles all season, tied for the third-fewest in the country.

In 2024, however, the Ducks haven't been quite as prolific with their turnover margin. The defenses' total of four takeaways -- all interceptions -- is tied for 93rd nationally. The offenses' total of four giveaways -- three of which were lost fumbles -- is tied for 33rd overall. And the net result is a turnover margin of zero that puts Oregon in a tie for 66th nationally and tied for 11th in the Big Ten.

So yes, the Ducks have room to grow.

"Two men arrested in Missouri after police discover 5 adults, 7 children in back of U-Haul: reports",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/two-men-arrested-missouri-after-police-discover-7-children-back-u-haul-reports,2024-10-02T21:51:16Z,"Hayley and Matthew Leach tell 'Fox News Live' what they want people to know about World Autism Awareness Day.

Missouri law enforcement officials arrested two men after discovering seven children between the ages of 2 to 13 and several adults in the back of a U-Haul box truck during a traffic stop on the interstate, according to reports.

KY3, a local NBC station out of Springfield, Missouri, reported that 31-year-old Shaikiem Bristol and 22-year-old Musa Omar were charged with seven counts of first-degree endangering the welfare of a child.

The station reported that, according to court documents, a trooper with the Missouri State Highway Patrol stopped a U-Haul box truck at about 4:30 p.m. on Sunday on Interstate 44.

Bristol allegedly told the trooper he and Omar rented a U-Haul box truck in Buffalo, New York, and drove down to Glendale, Arizona, to pick up a woman who had been kicked out of her house by her mother.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ACCUSED IN MISSOURI POLICE OFFICER'S DEATH HAS PRIOR RAP SHEET

When Bristol and Omar were pulled over, Bristol explained to the trooper that they were on their way back up to New York from Arizona.

Two women were in the passenger seat, and Bristol said they were his sister and fiancé.

The women told police a different story -- that they traveled to Arizona to pick up some things and visit family.

In the court documents, the trooper noted there were conflicting stories being told by the suspects about the trip, leading the trooper to believe they were involved in criminal activity.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT BROTHERS ARRESTED IN MISSOURI IN CONNECTION WITH DEADLY CARJACKINGS

When the trooper asked to search the U-Haul, Bristol reportedly gave permission and said there were beds, clothing and five adults and seven kids in the back.

The trooper called for backup and placed the women and Bristol under arrest.

To prevent anyone from running into traffic on the interstate, police transported the U-Haul to the Webster County Jail for further investigation.

During the investigation, troopers opened the back of the truck and noticed the air was warm and there was no power or air conditioning. Troopers also said there were clothes and food containers in the back, and most of the children removed from the U-Haul had dirty diapers that had not been changed for hours, police alleged.

The occupants in the back were also reportedly sweaty because of the heat.

When questioned by troopers, Bristol allegedly said he did not know why they took the kids on the trip, knowing it was going to be hot.

""That's why we tried to stop a lot,"" Bristol told police.

He explained that he and Omar tried to stop every hour and a half to two hours during the trip, so the occupants in the back would not get hot. The two men also reportedly shared driving responsibilities, police said.

Sasha Cohen On Why U.S. Women Skaters Have Not Medaled  Since 2006,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimclash/2024/10/02/sasha-cohen-on-why-us-women-skaters-have-not-medaled--since-2006/,2024-10-02T20:00:04Z,"It's been nearly two decades since an American ladies individual figure skater has stood on the Olympic podium. Given America's past dominance in skating, why? We asked Sasha Cohen.

Believe it or not, it's been 18 long years since an American individual ladies figure skater has stood on the Olympic podium. The last was Sasha Cohen, at the Torino Winter Olympics in 2006, where she won the silver medal. Given America's prior dominance in ladies figure skating - Peggy Fleming, Dorothy Hamill, Kristi Yamaguchi, Tara Lipinski, Sarah Hughes, Nancy Kerrigan and Michelle Kwan, to name a few - the omission is hard to understand.

Cohen is about to turn 40 this month. A graduate of Columbia University with a BA in general studies, and working now for a major investment house with two young children - Dash and Paloma - she maintains a very different lifestyle from her intense athletic regimen two decades ago. We thought it would be interesting to drop in on her to get some perspective on her current life, and on the American ladies figure skating program in general. Following are edited excerpts from a longer conversation.

Jim Clash: You are the last individual American ladies skater to stand on the Olympic podium, and that was way back in 2006. Surprising?

Sasha Cohen: It's definitely surprising. Things change, training programs change and different countries tend to dominate at different periods of time. The U.S. still has amazing talent, excelling tremendously in dance and men's single skating but, as you say, we haven't been able to put a woman on the podium since 2006. It's sad as a former athlete and someone who roots for the U.S. I don't really have the answers.

Clash: It seems to me, as a layman, that the judging has become more about jumps, and less about style. Is that a fair assessment?

Cohen: You're not wrong. The sport has definitely shifted towards rewarding higher technical difficulty and certain types of moves, certainly quadruple jumps. Because of that, skaters don't have time to develop their choreography in a way that highlights their personalities and artistry. They have to pack in all kinds of technical things from the beginning to the end of their programs because that's what's reflected in the scores, which ultimately determines whether they are on the podium.

In the U.S. heyday, the whole package was considered, and the women had a chance to develop into mature figure skaters. It wasn't just about jumps, it was also the artistry on the ice that made it so much fun and dynamic to watch.

Clash: When you competed, how did you balance the attention that comes with fame - the autographs, photos and interviews - with the things you had to focus on - ie, the business of skating?

Cohen: It's helpful to have a coach or team leader that can be the one who says, ""No more autographs, let her focus."" Then you don't have to be the bad guy [laughs]. But it's hard because you see these people who've been following your career, and they finally have this chance to get an autograph.

When you're touring, the stakes are much lower, and it's really nice to have that one-on-one moment with someone who has been watching you since you were a young kid. What we do out there is not in a vacuum. It's not just a race, it's a performance to music with an emotional component. So it means a lot more to the audience and fans. It's a very dynamic experience.

Clash: Let's go back to the Salt Lake City Olympics in 2002. Didn't President George Bush sit next to you during opening ceremonies?

Cohen: After the ceremonial lap, all of the different countries began to take their respective spots on the benches to watch the opening ceremonies. Within two minutes of sitting down, two Secret Service agents came over, put down this blanket, and started telling people to scoot over. We're all like, ""What's happening?"" They said that the President was going to sit there. I called my mom and said, ""Mom, mom, President Bush is going to sit next to me!"" She laughed and said, ""Oh honey, I'm sure you're mistaken. I don't think so.""

Fifteen minutes later, when the President did sit beside me, I asked him, ""Can you talk to my mom, will you say hi? She doesn't believe that you were going to sit next to me."" He said, ""Sure,"" and actually chatted with her for a minute, minute and a half, saying how much he loved the opening ceremonies and how nice it was to chat with me. My mom later told me that she almost fell off of her chair watching from some restaurant bar in Salt Lake City. That was definitely a fun moment in those Games.

Clash: You're a mom yourself now. How do you balance that with your job and doing things like this interview?

Cohen: You have to do things quickly [laughs]. I go to yoga, and that helps me re-center, have a little peace, because it's pretty hectic the rest of the time. One thing that's really difficult is to meet all of the demands but never being able to fully do anything well. There's a quote I once read about motherhood: ""You can be great at your job, great with your kids, great at this and that, but not all at the same time."" You have to choose. That's hard, but knowing that many other women are in the same spot is comforting. It's a privilege to be a mother and to be involved in the world - a give-and-take, a balance.

But as my kids are getting older, I'm realizing how fast time is passing. It's becoming increasingly important for me to be there to influence them, to play with them, to learn from them. You show up every day and try to be as present as you can, listening to that inner compass which tells you what's really important."
"MAGA abortion bans are an attack on men's freedom, too",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/maga-abortion-bans-attack-mens-freedom-rcna173625,2024-10-02T19:49:35Z,"Men 4 Choice co-founder Oren Jacobson spoke with The ReidOut Blog about how his group is defying hypermasculine norms and tagging men into the fight for reproductive rights.

This post is the third in ""MAGA and Masculinity in 2024,"" an ongoing series examining the societal fallout from right-wing hypermasculinity -- and the people fighting its toxic messaging by positively redefining what it means to be a man. You can read the first post here and the second post here.

Oren Jacobson, co-founder of reproductive rights advocacy group Men 4 Choice, said he had an ""aha-slash-oh-s--- moment"" in 2015 that led him, a progressive organizer at the time, to shift his focus toward reproductive rights and bodily autonomy.

That was the year he became convinced of the real potential for Roe v. Wade to be overturned and for abortion to be criminalized, Jacobson told me on Tuesday. He cited Pew Research Center data that shows majorities of both men and women support abortion being legal in all or most cases. However, he argued, voices critical of abortion seem to dominate coverage of the issues.

""I was struck by the fact that the men who were speaking were the ones who were trying to criminalize abortion, while the six in 10 of us who thought that was bulls--- were saying nothing and doing nothing,"" Jacobson said. ""And that struck me as this really interesting puzzle.""

Men 4 Choice garnered national attention last year and earlier this year when second gentleman Dough Emhoff invited the group to participate in roundtables on ways to get male allies to help advocate for abortion rights. And the group's ads have drawn support from other prominent activists.

In my interview with Jacobson on Tuesday, we discussed hypermasculinity, men's role in the reproductive rights movement, and the powerful moments at the Democratic National Convention this year, when Josh Zurawski and Derek Cook took the stage as symbols of the righteous impact men can have on the fight reproductive rights.

This interview has been slightly edited for length and clarity.

Jah'han Jones: What are the lessons your work has taught you about men's views on abortion rights?

Oren Jacobson: Number one is that most men don't understand the harm abortion bans cause. It's a little easier now, after Dobbs, because you have Josh Zurawski speaking out or Derek and Anya Cook's story or the couple stories out of Georgia we've seen where women have actually died. So that harm is a little bit more front and center. But especially pre-Dobbs, and in ways that people don't even see still, it wasn't as obvious to many men how people are harmed by the denial of access to care, whether it's like care in an emergency situation or just like, ""Hey, when you start banning and criminalizing abortion, OB-GYNs leave your state and less people have access to all reproductive health care."" So the number one lesson is the need for men to understand harm. How does this actually hurt my family, my community, and my people?

OJ: Number two is that most men don't see this as their issue. It's a woman's issue in their mind. They think, ""It doesn't directly impact me. I'm not affected.""

The third is that most men don't see a natural entry point into this organizing work. Most of the organizations and organizing and messaging and communications and outreach is focused on women and pregnant people, which makes endless amounts of sense. But pick any population in the country and say, ""If you're not engaging them, what are the odds that they actually engage with you civically, right?""

And then the fourth is that men don't have a playbook. They just don't know what to do and don't know what to say. And so even if you get them through the first three pieces, you give them an entry point. You help them see the harm. You help them create ownership. You still need to tell them what to do and how to do it, because they know they're not experts, and they're worried that they're going to screw up.

JJ: What kind of messaging have you seen work in terms of getting men to better understand that abortion is their issue, too?

OJ: We tell men this isn't just about abortion. It's about freedom and power and control. Because no person can be free if they don't have the power to control their own body and reproductive decisions, right? Not if the government has the power to control you, or the power to control the most important decision you could ever make -- which is if, when and how to build a family. So we start in this place of grounding the question in these universal value frames that all of us understand. The word freedom is just such a part of our political and cultural discourse.

JJ: Absolutely.

OJ: The second piece of this is what I would call stakeholder messaging, which is different than allyship messaging and different than beneficiary messaging. Allyship means I stand up for you because you're hurt. Our message is actually different. It's about what men have to lose. It frames them as someone whose body may not be under attack, but someone whose rights are -- whose family is and whose freedom is.

We'll use a story like Josh's as a way to point that out: If the government has the power to control your wife's body, the government has the power to control your family. So your body may not be under attack, but your rights are, your family is, and your freedom. Josh and Derek almost lost everything because their partners were denied access to basic, essential reproductive health care.

JJ: I hear you.

OJ: I should say, men who are LGBTQ+ are quicker on the draw on this. They see the connection between the legal structure of their rights around privacy, around government, and the government attacking and controlling people. If you're a queer man in America and you live in a state that's banning abortion, you probably happen to also live in a state that's attacking your rights.

JJ: Sure, and in that case you might be better equipped with the language to fight back against things like attacks on bodily autonomy and what that means for pregnant people, too.

OJ: Yes, and that's why we focus on terms like freedom, power, control. It's finding a way to center men -- putting men into the center of the [abortion] story without making the story about men, if that makes sense.

JJ: It does. And I appreciate those efforts at a time when the MAGA movement is using those words to promote a toxic masculinity rooted in brutishness and bravado. I see your organization deploying them toward better ends.

OJ: A lot of young men in particular are susceptible to what that movement is doing because the world around them is changing. We're all socialized into ideas. Some of them are good. Some of them are bad. We think that -- not just until Election Day, but beyond this -- we need to build a plan and a movement to win on this question. To win and fight for young men."
Mysterious gravestone in Virginia reveals 400-year-old secrets: archaeologists,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/mysterious-gravestone-virginia-reveals-400-year-old-secrets-archaeologists,2024-10-02T19:10:02Z,"John Evenson, a tugboat that sank in 1895, was recently discovered by a team of maritime experts. It was found in Lake Michigan. (Source: Wisconsin Historical Society)

Archaeologists have discovered surprising new details about the oldest tombstone in the United States, which dates back nearly 400 years.

The 1627 tombstone was set up in the Jamestown settlement and belonged to an English knight. But what exactly the tombstone was made of - and where it came from - stumped experts until now.

According to a study published in the International Journal of Historical Archaeology in September, the stone was not North American in origin.

The study, which is titled ""Sourcing the Early Colonial Knight's Black 'Marble' Tombstone at Jamestown, Virginia, USA,"" argues that the black limestone actually came from Europe - and sheds light on the trade routes of the time.

WOMAN OUT FOR WALK STUMBLES UPON ONCE-IN-A-DECADE DISCOVERY

""In seventeenth-century Virginia, USA, one of the ways affluent English colonists exhibited their wealth and memorialized themselves was with engraved tombstones,"" the article states. ""Wealthy colonists in the Tidewater region of the Chesapeake Bay at this time preferentially selected black 'marble' for their gravestones that was actually polished, fine-grained, black limestone.""

""The iconic knight's tombstone at Jamestown is one such stone.""

Rather than being made of a fossil found in the region, the limestone was likely transported from Belgium.

""This supports the conclusions above for transatlantic trade routes from continental Europe to Jamestown,"" the study said. ""These were undoubtedly not direct, but through London.""

""We hypothesize it was quarried and cut to size in Belgium, shipped down the Meuse River, across the English Channel to London where it was carved and the brass inlays installed, and finally shipped on to Jamestown as ballast,"" the study concluded. ""This trade route was a small piece of the rapidly expanding Atlantic world of geopolitical colonial trade.""

Historians have not definitively concluded who the grave belonged to, but the study said it most likely belonged to Sir George Yeardley, who was the governor of Virginia at the time of his death in 1627.

""Assuming the knight's tombstone was George Yeardley's, then it is the oldest black 'marble' tombstone in the Chesapeake Bay region, and may be the oldest surviving tombstone in America,"" the study said.

Amber Thurman's family slams GOP on abortion again after Vance equivocates at debate,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/amber-thurman-abortion-republicans-vance-debate-rcna173630,2024-10-02T18:52:20Z,"""Amber Thurman should still be alive,"" Vance said, as he defended the very circumstances that led to her preventable death in 2022.

On the debate stage Tuesday night, Sen. JD Vance found himself agreeing with his opponent, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, that a woman who died from abortion complications in 2022 due to Georgia's draconian abortion ban should still be alive.

""Governor, I agree with you,"" the Republican vice presidential nominee said. ""Amber Thurman should still be alive -- and there are a lot of people who should still be alive -- and I certainly wish that she was.""

Vance's acknowledgement that Thurman's death was preventable and his expressed desire for the GOP to ""earn people's trust back"" on abortion doesn't square with Republican lawmakers actively restricting people's ability to make such choices for themselves. After the debate, Thurman's family issued a statement condemning the GOP for ""seek[ing] to further restrict women's access to necessary healthcare under the false guise of protection.""

""Amber's tragic death was a direct result of Georgia's archaic and dangerously restrictive abortion laws, which denied her the life-saving care she so desperately needed,"" Thurman's family said. ""We are grieving an unimaginable loss that no family should have to endure.""

In the debate, Vance said that the American people ""just don't trust"" Republicans when it comes to abortion, and that he wanted the GOP to become ""pro-family in the fullest sense of the word."" He also claimed that he has never supported a federal abortion ban (Vance did, however, say as recently as 2022 that he ""would like abortion to be illegal nationally"") and defended the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

After lamenting Thurman's death, Vance immediately went on to talk about ""partial birth abortion,"" a highly misleading political term that refers to an abortion that happens later in pregnancy. He also asserted that allowing states to impose their own abortion laws is the right thing to do, despite that being exactly the circumstance that led to Thurman's death."
Michigan voters sound off on JD Vance's debate performance: 'He told the truth',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/michigan-voters-sound-off-jd-vances-debate-performance-he-told-truth,2024-10-02T17:47:24Z,"'Fox & Friends' co-host Lawrence Jones takes a pulse from Michigan voters on the 2024 presidential election.

Voters in swing state Michigan praised Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance for his debate performance against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

""I thought it went really well. I thought [Vance] did really well. He held his own. He told the truth,"" a voter wearing a MAGA hat told ""Fox & Friends"" co-host Lawrence Jones, Wednesday.

TOP 5 MOMENTS FROM ONLY VP DEBATE BETWEEN VANCE AND WALZ BEFORE ELECTION

Jones visited Steak 'N Egger restaurant in Muskegon after Tuesday night's CBS News Vice Presidential Debate, where many watchers gave Vance the advantage over Walz.

""[Walz] did terrible in many respects, but he is just honest and truthful also. He doesn't know what he's talking about and he kind of admitted it,"" one voter said.

Another voter said Walz appeared ""too nervous.""

""[Walz is] phony. He's too plastic. He doesn't know the topics like Vance.""

A few voters at the diner, however, defended Walz's performance and argued the Democrat won the pair's only debate showdown.

""[Walz is] very articulate. He knows his facts,"" one woman said. ""JD Vance totally switched the script last night. He told untruths. He flipped the switch. He lied throughout the whole entire debate last night. What he said was untrue - his stance on abortion, his stance on housing, his stance on the finance - everything was was not true.""

The woman conceded that Vance's ""experience on public stages"" may have impacted the number of voters and pundits giving the senator the win.

TOP 5 CLASHES BETWEEN VANCE AND WALZ DURING DEBATE SHOWDOWN: 'YOUR MICS ARE CUT'

Tuesday's debate covered a variety of subjects ranging from immigration to climate change to abortion as the two lesser known politicians sought to make their introductions to American voters before Election Day.

One Michigan voter said she is voting for Vice President Kamala Harris because she likes the idea that ""we get to vote every four years instead of, 'if you vote me in, you won't ever have to vote again.'""

Another woman voiced her support for Trump ""because he's for America, and he's for me. And he's for the unborn child.""

""If you are for the person who cannot defend themselves, then you are for the rest of us,"" she said. ""And if you don't care about those that are not able to defend themselves, you certainly aren't going to be in charge of us or care for us.""

'Slow Horses' Just Gave Us One Of Its Best -- And Most Chilling -- Episodes Ever,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2024/10/02/slow-horses-just-gave-us-one-of-its-best-and-most-chilling-episodes-ever/,2024-10-02T17:10:06Z,"We've almost reached the end of Apple TV's Slow Horses Season 4 and that's making me a bit sad. These six-episode seasons are over so fast! When a show is this good, I can't help but wish it would go on a little longer.

Spoilers for the current season through Episode 5 follow.

We're not quite at the end yet, however, and so far this has been my favorite season of Slow Horses since the first. Gary Oldman's iconic Jackson Lamb remains the most delightful character on TV, and I think I've realized a bit more about him this season, especially as we learn more about his former boss, David Cartwright (Jonathan Pryce), who's made some dodgy deals with very bad people in the past.

Unraveling that past is difficult thanks to Cartwright's rapidly dilapidating mental state. He's easily confused. The past and the present blend together as his dementia quickly takes hold. Lamb has no love for the old man, but in this latest episode -- as he cruelly makes Cartwright believe that he killed his grandson, River (Jack Lowden) -- you can see his scorn for the old man thaw a little.

It turns out, Cartwright did kill his grandson. It just wasn't River.

The plot so far has focused on a handful of crucial questions. Who is behind the Westacres bombing? Who are these mysterious killers in France and are they connected in some way? Why did they come to kill Cartwright so soon after the attack? Who was River lookalike in the bathroom and why did he look so much like him? Now, at last, we have some answers.

Hugo Weaving's villain, Frank Harkness (no relation to Agatha) is ex-CIA. His diabolical plan, which he put into motion decades ago, was to impregnate various women, banish them from his French manor, and then raise his sons on his own to be killers -- brainwashed from birth, loyal to the death. He raised three sons (that we know of) in this manner. One of them, it turns out, was David Cartwright's daughter's. This would explain the resemblance. Cartwright traded guns and money with Harkness decades earlier in order to get his daughter back to England, though she didn't want to return. Harkness is a masterful manipulator.

The pieces keep falling together. After the bombing, Harkness needed to kill off anyone who could tie him (and his dangerous client) to the attack. Cartwright and Bad Bob Chapman were both ""in the know"" and had to be removed. Only, things went badly for the killers and River was quickly on the scent, faking his own death and hiding his grandfather with Standish (Saskia Reeves).

In this latest episode, River is in the custody of the Dogs, with their new chief Emma Flyte (Ruth Bradley) finally getting a win. River pleads with her to help save his grandfather's life, and she finally relents, sending a picture of Harkness and his sons to MI5 -- to both the analyst, Giti, who's been digging into the mystery of their identities, and to the new First Desk, Claude Whelan (James Callis). This small act puts an end to Whelan and Taverner's (Kristin Scott Thomas) attempts to cover the whole thing up -- a sneaky move to hide MI5's culpability.

Which brings me back to my earlier discussion: This episode helped me form a deeper understanding of Jackson Lamb and what drives his character. Lamb is, by all appearances, a terrible spy who's pretty much let it all go. He drinks. He farts. He hurls abuse at everyone. Between the cigarettes, the booze and the junk food, it's almost a miracle that he hasn't snuffed it yet. As far as anyone can tell, Lamb doesn't care about anything or anyone. Even River calls him a terrible boss. It's all a front, of course, though one he clearly enjoys. Lamb is playing a part, disguising his true cunning under a veneer of filth.

But it's not just cunning that's hiding beneath that whiskey-stained exterior. Lamb, you see, is fundamentally an honest man. This is at the heart of everything he does and, I suspect, everything he did that got him here in the first place. He knows that the powers that be at the Park and in the government will do whatever they can to cover things up, that they have no interest in the truth. This is why he's at Slough House. Not because he's a degenerate or bad at his job, but because he wouldn't play ball. Luckily for him -- and his team -- he's also brilliant, always one step ahead of everyone else, quick on his feet and willing to improvise. And despite all his barbs and mockery, he's fiercely loyal to his team.

This is one reason he's so thrown by David Cartwright's confession. Far from being some dastardly act of espionage and double-dealing, Cartwright made his fateful choice out of love.

But even love has consequences. Harkness tricks Molly -- the surly records room MI5 lady -- and takes her hostage in her home, using threats to force her to help him access MI5 databases and track the location of the Dogs. He's following River's progress to the Park, and sends his last remaining son to intercept them.

We'll refer to this killer as The Terminator from here on out, because Marcus (Kadiff Kirwan) is right: He's basically a T-800, very nearly unkillable. Harkness tells Molly ""Thank you Molly, but you've outlived your usefulness"" and we -- and she -- think she's done for, but just when we think he's going to pull the trigger, as the poor woman braces herself for the end, the door slams and Harkness is gone. His last word before departing: ""I need to send a message."" On the desk, Molly finds a handful of envelopes, each with a name on them. This was not the message we were expecting. What game is Harkness playing at? What message is he sending?

The final scene of the episode is one of its finest and one of the show's most intense action sequences so far. The Terminator drives a dump truck at full speed into a car just in front of the one Flyte and River are in, blocking their path. They try to turn the car around but find themselves blocked by traffic. River is cuffed to the car and there's no time to uncuff him before the killer is stalking toward them. He opens fire killing both agents as Flyte scrambles first to shut the door and then to fire back. She puts up a good fight but The Terminator knocks her unconscious and turns to River, who has been doing his level best to help with one hand cuffed to the car. The killer turns his gun on River and then -- much to our hero's surprise -- shoots the chain instead.

He grabs River, pulls him from the car and turns his gun on him, walking him steadily, with an icy calm, through the line of cars and their terrified drivers, before hijacking one and throwing River in the trunk. As the credits roll, we hear River's laboured breathing. It's an ominous ending to one of the show's very best episodes. A week is a long time to wait after a cliffhanger like this one.

I have one other very big question: Is Frank Harkness River Cartwright's father? If his mother was pregnant when she was taken back to London, this would explain a lot of things. Why she abandoned her son. Why David raised him. Why we've never heard about his dad at all. And why the man in the bathroom looked so much like him -- more than just a half-brother, but a full brother."

""I said 'Can we leave?' And the woman said 'no,'"" Robert Jarvis, one of the employees who survived the storm, told News 5 WCYB. ""About 10 minutes later she came back and said 'y'all can leave.' It was too late. We have one way in, one way out. When they told us we could leave, the one way out was blocked off so we were stuck.""

Parts of eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina were slammed by historic flash flooding after Hurricane Helene hit Florida as a Category 4 hurricane and moved north. North Carolina's governor Roy Cooper said entire communities ""were wiped off the map"" and at least 57 people died in and around Asheville. President Joe Biden will on Wednesday take an aerial tour of the Asheville damage but will not tour on the ground because of the extensive damage to roadways. Most of the city is without power or drinking water. More than 1.2 million people were still without power in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia on Wednesday morning, according to PowerOutage.US.

The death toll in North Carolina is expected to rise, Cooper said.

Businesses and historic sites in North Carolina are still discovering how much damage the storm inflicted. The Gilded Age-era Biltmore Estate in Asheville is closed indefinitely as damage to the building and extensive grounds is assessed. The nearby Biltmore Village, a walkable shopping district with stores and restaurants, was inundated after Helene passed through. In the small town of Spruce Pine, two major quartz mines that provide essentially all of the ultra-pure quartz for semiconductor production across the world have shut down and don't know when they'll reopen."
How CMOs Can Work With Influencers And Preserve Brand Safety,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/10/02/how-cmos-can-work-with-influencers-and-preserve-brand-safety/,2024-10-02T16:26:34Z,"What is human authorship? A decade ago, that was a straightforward and easy question to answer. In the days of generative AI, the definition is becoming much murkier.

Board game designer Jason Allen used AI image generator Midjourney to create an elaborate illustration of women wearing Victorian dresses and space helmets, attending a futuristic looking royal court, writes Forbes' Rashi Shrivastava. The image was not something the AI platform conjured from a simple prompt, though. Allen says he spent more than 100 hours giving it specific information to create the image he wanted. But when Allen tried to copyright the image, the U.S. Copyright Office denied his application because it lacked ""human authorship."" After reconsideration of the application was again rejected by the office, Allen sued the Copyright Office, asking a federal court to decide if it could be copyrighted.

At the heart of this case is a question of what creative, as a noun, truly means. Are the questions and indicators that prompted a computer system creative, or is something creative when only human hands and eyes have directly manipulated it? Midjourney and other AI platforms did not respond to Forbes' requests for comment, but Midjourney's website states that artists own what they create, but it also reserves the right to reproduce,license and distribute works created on the platform.

This lawsuit is also an interesting turnabout for AI companies, many of which are dealing with copyright litigation of their own. Authors, journalists, musicians, photographers and artists have sued big AI companies in the last year, arguing that the AI companies are illegally taking their copyrighted works to train their systems. The input, the creators argue, is all copyrighted.

Whether the output is copyrighted hasn't been discussed much until now. This litigation may not force AI platforms to reckon with that issue, since it only involves the Copyright Office. But it's a reckoning that is coming at some point. Some experts have said that copyright protections of data are the most important thing to regulate: There need to be rules governing who can use what and how, and ensuring that owners of copyrights can be paid.

As more brands use influencer marketing, there are more hazards to brand safety. I talked to Kevin King and Nicholas Spiro, chief revenue officer and chief product officer of the agency Viral Nation, about what CMOs should think about before starting to work with influencers. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

While inflation is finally trending down and the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates last month, these trends aren't fully recognized in consumer prices and wages yet. As a result, consumer confidence continues to weaken, with many Americans saying jobs are ""hard to get."" That attitude extends to what consumers spend. Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger writes that the National Retail Federation saw a 5% drop in back-to-school spending, which was at $39 billion this year. There was a 7% decline in back-to-college spending, which tallied $87 billion. And NRF predicts a 5% decline in Halloween spending -- from $12.2 billion last year to $11.6 billion this year. Census Department retail figures show that non-food-service sales only advanced 1.5% last month. That could be because of the still-high prices. A Bankrate study found that prices are 21.2% more expensive today than in February 2020.

This all puts more pressure on the upcoming holiday season. Predictions for holiday spending are beginning to trickle out, but there are a lot of question marks in the air, including a massive port workers' strike that began Tuesday and has crippled all shipping container cargo on the East Coast.

The NCAA's NIL policy, allowing student athletes to be paid for use of their names, images and likenesses, is extremely complex in practice. These complexities came to the forefront last week when UNLV quarterback Matthew Sluka announced he was leaving the university's undefeated football team because of a $100,000 NIL payment he said he was promised, but never received. Sluka's agent has said the payment was offered to him verbally by an assistant coach. The payment in question would have come from an NIL collective, which is a nonprofit affiliated with a school that pools funds from donors, fans and businesses to pay student athletes for things like appearances.

The issue of payments from NIL collectives is already under legal scrutiny following an NCAA investigation into whether an $8 million payment from a NIL collective affiliated with the University of Tennessee for a high school recruit violated a rule barring NIL deals to attract students to certain schools. Attorneys general from Tennessee and Virginia filed for a temporary restraining order to stop enforcement of the rule, which was granted. Even though there does not seem to be proof of a concrete agreement in Sluka's case, it draws more attention to payments from NIL collectives -- especially because it's been criticized as an apparent state of permanent free agency, something that even professional athletes can't have.

Kate Spade New York has always represented luxury commercial fashion, but its clothing was only for relatively small sizes. The brand had some styles in XXL, but its size chart had a maximum waist circumference of 36 inches, less than the 39-inch waist of the average American woman. A new collaboration with online plus-size fashion brand Eloquii is extending Kate Spade to that market, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. The Kate Spade looks, which are sold online and will be showcased in Kate Spade stores in New York and Los Angeles, have so far been a hit with customers, Eloquii founder and brand lead Julie Carnevale told Danziger. The clothes in this collaboration, which will continue at least through Valentine's Day, are not just larger versions of Kate Spade's main clothing lines, and are custom designed for plus-sized customers, featuring fabrics, patterns and cuts that are popular with Eloquii customers.

As Americans spend more time on social media, brands often want to partner with influencers who can showcase their products -- but it's hard to know if those influencers are 100% the type of people brands want to associate with. Marketing agency Viral Nation has technology that helps determine and maintain brand safety in today's world of social media voices. I talked to the company's Chief Revenue Officer Kevin King and Chief Product Officer Nicholas Spiro about the issue of brand safety. This conversation has been edited for length, continuity and clarity.

What are companies looking for today in terms of brand safety with their influencers?

King: Brands are recognizing they've got blind spots in the way that they approach brand safety. Going back to the rise of social, every brand was monitoring media. They probably had a corporate and public affairs group that was monitoring what the government was doing, but nobody was doing social media monitoring. It was a blind spot in brands' overall safety and reputational approach. Flash forward to today, every brand's starting to realize they've got a huge blind spot in the influencer space. There weren't really tools for influencer monitoring.

No two brands are the same in what their red lines are. They are obviously concerned about political leanings. In some cases, they're concerned about gun usage. In some cases, they're concerned about foul language or drug use. There is definitely a common suite of things that brands are starting to pay attention to in their monitoring.

Spiro: Broadly, we see quasi-low adoption of influencer marketing. Not that many brands have tried it. One of the biggest blockers for CMOs that understand the power is brand safety. They want to know that this is safe before they establish a relationship. Brand safety on the platforms can take a few different aspects, but often it's content adjacency. You don't want an ad to appear next to risky content. It's even more in the influencer space, because that's a true brand partnership. You've actually thought about them as a representative of yours, you've signed some sort of agreement, they're your partner. The escalations you might see are actually even riskier for brands.

Have there been many situations where brands were unpleasantly surprised by something that happened in an influencer partnership?

King: It's settling down a little bit. The influencers that are interested in partnering with brands have gotten much better at being cognizant of the world. They're being more careful on their end in a lot of cases. Overall, the space is getting safer as the influencers are starting to recognize where those guardrails are naturally from watching it.

On the brand side, though, I do see a lot of unpleasant surprises. It's because of that blind spot on influencers. You might look at somebody's Instagram feed from last week and it looks great and you want to partner with them, and you miss that when they were in college, they posted a whole lot of really negative stuff. The speed that surfaces is astonishing. It happens within hours. The social communities will make that connection really darn fast.

Spiro: The years of history [are] only increasing. [The year] 2008 was the hallmark in social media. Let's pretend you're sitting there in 2017. That's only nine years of history. At that point, it would be easier for them to scrub it. The whole memory of social media is going to be so much longer, so this in my mind is an increasing need. I think we'll all come back and think, wow, this was actually just the beginning of this, to the point when entire lifetimes have a social media history, which introduces all sorts of risk vectors.

What advice would you give to a CMO who is struggling with the whole concept of influencers and brand safety?

King: Every brand has a suite of tools that they're leveraging to make intelligent decisions. It's not just specific to brand safety. It's on measurement, their brand score, perception, sentiment, everything else. In a lot of cases, those tools and technologies that companies are using to make those evaluations don't evolve as fast as the social or influencer space is moving. Brands are still using a suite of tools that was maybe relevant some years ago, and hasn't picked up with the speed of change. They've got to really be constantly reevaluating those tools in their arsenal. Some of those tools sit in PR. Some of those tools sit in marketing. Some of those tools sit in HR. Some of those tools are sitting in corporate and public affairs. They're not bringing all those data sets together. If I was a CMO, I'd be cognizant of what are the current suite of tools available to me within my organization, and then where do I have blind spots that I can supplement that with to get a holistic picture?

Spiro: Understand that your reputation is one of your greatest assets, and it can be gone in an instant. I know it can be hard to wrap your mind around because it's not revenue, it's not immediacy, but there's that risk element.

Brands are trying to do it with their thumbs. They're trying to just scroll through a couple feeds, and that's not really feasible without the use of technology. There's a big-level-of-effort play. When you leverage technology, you're replacing a workflow of humans that are doing it worse, covering less, costing you a ton of money, because it's all these people and lawyers trying to somehow understand the background of an influencer.

This disabled woman built a career. A federal program that helped now penalizes her,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25453/social-security-ssi-disabilities-work-outdated,2024-10-02T16:25:32Z,"Tabi Haly defied expectations. She's a woman with spinal muscular atrophy -- also, a software engineer and a vice president at JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase hide caption

Tabi Haly defies expectations. She's a woman with a progressive muscular illness; she can't move her body and she needs round-the-clock care from aides. She wasn't expected to go to college, or to get a job -- much less become a vice president at the banking giant JPMorgan Chase.

Even staying alive and healthy defied expectations. ""People with spinal muscular atrophy like myself, living to my age already is a huge win,"" says Haly, who is 40.

Haly's success as a software engineer in New York City was made possible by a government program called Supplemental Security Income, or SSI. It gives Haly access to crucial medical coverage.

But now that same program is threatening to bring her success crashing down.

In July, Haly got a letter that shocked her. The Social Security Administration, the agency that runs the federal benefits program, wrote that she was not eligible for SSI, even though she'd relied upon SSI for almost 19 years.

By losing SSI, she would also lose Medicaid, her health insurance. Medicaid provides medical care -- from round-the-clock personal care aides to an expensive medicine -- that keeps her healthy and allows her to build a career.

""It's like my foundation's falling apart,"" says Haly. She appealed the decision to end her SSI. But she worries that without it, the career she's achieved will end. Even with a high-paying job, she says she can't pay for 24-hour aides and other high-cost medical care on her own.

She faces a big fall -- from a successful career to needing full-time care from family or, more likely she fears, moving into a nursing home.

SSI exists to provide a minimum income, and often health insurance, to people with significant disabilities. But an NPR investigation found that SSI often fails people with disabilities because its rules are long out of date and overly complex.

As a result, recipients like Haly run into decisions that seem bureaucratic and inconsistent but that threaten their ability to stay out of poverty, live independently and keep access to medical care.

Debora Wagner at Cornell University's Yang-Tan Institute on Employment and Disability says Haly's frustration is not uncommon and shows the need to modernize SSI. ""My question is 'Who benefits in this situation? What's the benefit for us as a society of making it impossible for people with disabilities to work?'""

Haly is a software engineer and a team leader on development and coding projects for JPMorgan Chase & Co..

On an early morning this summer at her apartment in Manhattan, Haly, in her motorized wheelchair, prepared to lead back-to-back meetings on a new software project. Her personal care aide, Palone Ruddock, spent about 10 minutes getting Haly positioned in front of her computer.

Haly can't move her body. She needs an aide to help her move her arms and legs.

But with Haly's fingers placed on a large trackpad, she can control the computer and run her meeting.

Some of her work colleagues on the call know she's disabled. None, she says, have any idea of how disabled she is. Nor did any of the outside consultants this day at a second meeting, where she presented the coding project.

Haly needs assistance from personal care aides 24 hours a day. ""That's who gets me into my wheelchair,"" she says. ""They're my hands and feet.""

Those aides move her body several times an hour so she doesn't get painful bedsores. They suction the secretions out of her weakened lungs to keep her healthy.

Haly says those aides, seven days a week, cost about $300,000 a year.

Only Medicaid, the state and federal insurance for people with limited income that Haly gets through SSI, will pay for them.

Her company's health insurance wouldn't. The insurance that people get through their jobs doesn't cover long-term, in-home aides. Nor does Medicare, the government insurance for older people and some younger people with disabilities.

As a vice president at JPMorgan Chase, Haly makes a good salary. But even with a six-figure paycheck, she says she can't afford the health care that she needs.

In addition to the aides, Haly ticks off a list of her other medical expenses. Medicaid pays for a new, breakthrough medication for spinal muscular atrophy. She says that medicine alone, which she must keep cooled in the refrigerator, costs about $350,000 a year.

If she went on her employer's health insurance, a company spokesperson says it might pay for some or all of the medicine.

But there are other big expenses an employer's health insurance won't pay at all, like Haly's customized power wheelchair. At $35,000, it's as expensive as a small car.

In addition, Medicaid pays for wheelchair repairs and tens of thousands of dollars a year in physical, occupational and speech therapy.

""I would have to be a multimillionaire to pay for all this stuff myself,"" Haly says.

Ari Ne'eman, an assistant professor at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard who researches disability income programs, says: ""If you lose access to SSI, you lose access to the Medicaid services that keep you alive and thriving in the community. It's a question of life and death.""

SSI was created in 1972 to provide monthly benefit checks for millions of impoverished disabled and elderly Americans. In 2024, the monthly benefit is capped at $943 for one person and $1,415 for a couple. In addition, most who are eligible for SSI then qualify for health insurance through state Medicaid programs.

Today, SSI is a key benefit to 7.5 million people.

But SSI was created before the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 protected people with disabilities from discrimination in public places and at work. It was created before the 1975 law -- the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act -- that, for the first time, gave a right to a public school education for children with disabilities. Before then, some 1 million children with disabilities, the last group to get the right to schooling guaranteed, were excluded from many schools.

As the experiences and expectations for disabled Americans changed, SSI failed to keep up.

SSI was started with the assumption that recipients couldn't or wouldn't work in jobs where they could support themselves.

As a result, its out-of-date rules discourage work. Today, fewer than 10% of people on SSI do work, although many say they'd like to work and many would like to make enough to get off SSI.

Very few, like Haly, manage to build a career.

The rules make it hard to take even a part-time job. One rule says you can own only $2,000 in assets -- like bank savings or property. That limit hasn't changed since 1989.

For a couple, the asset limit is $3,000, creating a ""marriage penalty"" that forces many on SSI to avoid marriage or to try to hide it when they marry.

As a result of the cap on accruing assets, Haly, for example, is unable to contribute part of her salary or take her employer's match in the company 401(k) plan. Those retirement plans, which are now used by 70 million Americans, didn't exist when SSI and the asset limit were first created.

Over the years, Social Security and the Internal Revenue Service have set up programs where people on SSI can shield part of their income from the asset limit. But these programs -- ABLE accounts, Ticket to Work, PASS accounts -- are often complicated to set up and limited in their scope. The result: Only a tiny fraction of people on SSI use them.

In recent months, the Social Security Administration has simplified some rules about counting income, like excluding the government assistance someone on SSI receives for food and rent. But Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley noted to NPR that only Congress can make the most significant reform to SSI.

There's a fix to the asset limit that's been proposed, but stalled, on Capitol Hill. The SSI Savings Penalty Elimination Act would raise the asset limit to $10,000 for an individual and $20,000 for a couple, in line with what the thresholds would be if they had kept up with inflation.

The bill has bipartisan co-sponsors in Congress and has been endorsed by business leaders, including Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. But the bill wouldn't address other outdated SSI rules.

One rule says that someone on SSI can't earn more than $65 a month. After that, a recipient loses $1 of benefits for every $2 they earn -- in effect, a tax of 50%.

""That's a higher tax rate than anyone faces on their federal income tax,"" says Ne'eman of Harvard. ""But when it comes to the most impoverished disabled Americans, that is the level of taxation functionally that people are facing when they try and enter the workforce.""

That $65 limit is the same as it was first set in 1972.

When Microsoft in 2020 decided to raise the minimum wage for its lowest paid employees to $25 an hour, the company was surprised to find that disabled workers -- largely ones with intellectual disabilities working in the cafeteria, as administrative assistants and other low-level jobs -- suddenly faced losing their SSI benefits.

Microsoft hired private benefit managers to advise every employee on SSI, according to Rylin Rogers, the company's disability policy director.

Many of those workers thought they'd need to ""step away from those jobs, good jobs that they had had for a very long time, which would have been a shame,"" says Dan Rutten with the Washington Initiative for Supported Employment, the nonprofit benefits advisory firm that was called in to help. Most of those disabled employees, guided by the advisers, found waiver programs or cut their work hours to balance their salary increases with SSI's rules.

Fifty years ago, when SSI started, making $65 a month got a person close to the poverty limit. ""It was already inadequate in 1972, but it wasn't laughable,"" says Ne'eman. ""Today we have a situation where the income offset really is frankly insulting.""

People on SSI who ""are having the greatest success working"" are the ones who run into the most problems with SSI's rules, says Jack Smalligan, who studies income benefits for the Urban Institute. ""So the message to beneficiaries is, essentially, that working doesn't pay.""

Haly makes too much to take a monthly SSI benefit check. She's one of a tiny number of beneficiaries who need to qualify solely to keep her Medicaid.

But this summer, Haly learned that she was about to lose that health insurance.

At first, Haly thought it was a simple clerical error.

Every year, she gets recertified for Medicaid. Haly says a caseworker for New York state comes to her home and asks a series of questions to determine that she is still disabled. Haly considers the process ""intrusive,"" given that she has a progressive neuromuscular condition that is incurable.

Usually, the process is automatic. But this spring, when the notice of her coverage renewal arrived, the line that she expected to say that her insurance would last until 2025 said 2024 instead.

The state of New York wasn't extending her Medicaid coverage, even though Haly was currently on SSI, which qualified her for that health insurance.

(A spokesperson for New York's Medicaid agency said rules around confidentiality limited its ability to discuss Haly's case. A spokesperson for Social Security noted confidentiality rules, too.)

Haly went to the Social Security office to straighten it out.

""They had no idea what I was talking about,"" she says. ""Zero.""

She says they offered to help her stop working and sign up for a separate benefit program, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), for people who can no longer work because of a disability.

She recalls: ""The person said, 'I can make you an appointment for SSDI, do you want to claim disability?' I said, 'No, I do not want to collect SSDI.'""

It took several weeks, she says, until she got an appointment to talk over her problem with a Social Security caseworker. Haly says he advised her that she needed to reapply for SSI.

She was reluctant to apply for a benefit that she already held, and had without question, for years. But the staffer was insistent, so she did.

Shortly after, she got a letter from Social Security with a short denial. It said she made too much money to qualify.

SSI's regulations are complex and confusing. Often, recipients find it necessary to hire a lawyer or a benefits manager with specialized expertise to negotiate the rules to stay eligible.

""The rules are so complicated that even the most educated, professional people cannot understand and follow the rules. It's heartbreaking,"" says attorney Wagner at Cornell.

For years, Social Security said Haly qualified for an exception to SSI's earnings limit, called a 1619(b) waiver. It refers to a part of the Social Security law that lets some disabled people earn money over the limit and still qualify for Medicaid.

Social Security's denial this summer turned all that upside down.

It ended her eligibility for SSI because of her growing income, which previously was excluded by the waiver. When she lost SSI, she lost the waiver that went with it. She can't use the waiver now or even reapply for it because the waiver is available only to people who Social Security says are eligible for SSI.

""It's a catch-22,"" says Haly, frustrated.

To be eligible again, Haly would need to impoverish herself and give up the aides and medical care she is unlikely to afford on her own, especially if she can no longer work.

Even then, to reapply for SSI and maybe get the waiver again could take months or even years.

So she's asked Social Security to reverse itself and return to what had been the status quo for years and allow her to stay on SSI, to keep her Medicaid and to keep working.

""My medical expenses are so much, hundreds of thousands a year,"" says Haly. ""Do you not want me to work then? Because I can be a VP at JPMorgan Chase. I pay a lot of taxes being a VP at JPMorgan Chase. Or I can just not work and collect.""

While Haly waits for a decision on her appeal, her Medicaid insurance is in place -- for now.

For a few days in early summer, without Medicaid, everything stopped. Her medicine was delayed. When her medical providers saw her insurance was halted, they canceled her physical therapy sessions and her wheelchair repair.

There would be few options, Haly says, if she loses her appeal to the Social Security Administration. She could stop working and apply for Social Security Disability Insurance. That comes with Medicare. But it would take at least two years to get it.

""Someone like me,"" she says, ""who is a person with a disability who needs full-time care, the only way to get that is in a nursing home.""

For businesses, there's a growing recognition of the value of hiring more workers with disabilities. One trend: The creation of cafes, coffee shops and other small businesses as places where disabled people can be hired to work alongside others without disabilities.

In St. Paul, Minn., attorney Shamus O'Meara opened a specialty popcorn business this year with his 26-year-old son Conor, who is autistic.

Conor O'Meara makes the popcorn and greets customers when they come in.

""When they see Conor,"" his father says, ""it's like, 'Conor, how are you!' It's a true joy to have him here. Everyone knows him. They call him the Mayor of St. Paul.""

The goal of Highland Popcorn (motto: ""Popcorn with Personality"") is to create a place where disabled people can find work.

But Shamus O'Meara says they quickly ran into barriers with SSI. Because of the $65 limit on monthly earnings and the $2,000 limit on assets, many of their employees, including Conor, need to limit their work to just a few hours, a few days a week.

That required Shamus, who hires both disabled and nondisabled workers, to find many extra employees to cover all the shifts.

Work is important to Conor, for social interaction and for the money he can earn.

He takes the bus to two other part-time jobs. At a nearby bowling alley, he cleans the scoring screens and sweeps up the cigarette butts outside. At a pizza restaurant, he buses dishes and wraps silverware in napkins. In addition, he volunteers at a community radio station and hosts a show where he talks about his life and about Minnesota's professional sports teams.

Conor says he'd like to work even more. ""I think Social Security should end that one limiting how many hours you work.""

Tabi Haly's bosses, too, are confounded by SSI's complex and stale rules -- and by the idea that a valued worker would go from a company vice president to having her career ended and possibly needing to move to a nursing home.

""Tabi contributes to our business in a very meaningful way. She's top talent,"" says Bryan Gill, who runs JPMorgan's office of disability inclusion. ""And I want more of Tabi's time contributing to our business.""

Gill says the financial services company makes an effort to hire people with disabilities because it's a way to find talented workers in a tight labor market.

""We do a lot of charity,"" he says. ""We have a lot of philanthropic efforts. This is not one of them. This is a business strategy imperative to the long-term success of this company.""

Haly also writes songs and has recorded two CDs. She started singing as a form of speech therapy to strengthen her weakened lungs.

In the lyrics to one song, ""Waiting in the Wings,"" she asks: ""Do they judge me by my talent? ...Treat me less than a human being? Is that what our life's meant to be?""

""Waiting in the wings means we're waiting backstage,"" she says, waiting for rights. ""What that means here in the States is that we have the liberty to pursue our dreams and live them. And not feel like there are all these barriers to get there.""

Haly says she only wants the chance to keep working and to keep her independence. But she needs to keep her SSI and Medicaid to make that remain her reality."
MSNBC host claims JD Vance's 'mansplaining' over muted mics was 'worst moment' for him with women voters,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-host-claims-jd-vance-mansplaining-muted-mics-worst-moment-him-youre-woman,2024-10-02T16:25:09Z,"MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace claimed on Tuesday that JD Vance's worst moment during the debate was his attempt to ""mansplain"" over the muted mics, specifically for women watching the back-and-forth.

MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace claimed on Tuesday that the ""worst moment"" for Sen. JD Vance in the vice presidential debate was when he attempted to ""mansplain"" over muted mics, and argued the moment was specifically bad for female voters.

""I actually think if you're a woman, that might be the worst moment JD Vance had, because he was going to mansplain right over that mute button. He was, and again, I don't pretend to know how everyone will react to this. I think that a lot of women, in positions of authority that should command respect just by virtue of that dynamic, will see themselves and some do, the direspect of them and talked over,"" she said.

Vance called out the debate moderators, CBS' Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, during the debate for fact-checking him during the debate after he brought up migrants in Springfield, Ohio. The moderators eventually muted his microphone as he was trying to talk.

She compared the moment to the debate Vice President Kamala Harris had with former Vice President Mike Pence in 2020, when Harris said, ""I'm speaking.""

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""There was this real belief that what he had to say was more important than the debate rules and the moderators,"" she said.

Wallace also praised the debate moderators for using ""their mic muting power.""

The Trump campaign ripped Wallace in a statement to Fox News Digital, calling her an ""unhinged idiot who beclowned herself by acting like a crazy person."" ""She's a joke and nobody takes her seriously,"" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said to Fox Digital.

Brennan interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming resources in Springfield, Ohio.

""Just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status,"" Brennan said.

""The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" Vance pushed back. ""And since you are fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process of obtaining legal status and tying it to a Harris-backed immigration policy, the moderators again spoke over Vance, thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Walz attempted to argue with him.

The media criticized Walz following the debate for what they deemed was a lack of preparation.

This disabled woman built a career. A federal program that helped now penalizes her for her success.,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/g-s1-25453/social-security-ssi-disabilities-work-outdated,2024-10-02T16:08:55Z,"Tabi Haly defied expectations. She's a woman with spinal muscular atrophy. Also, a software engineer and a vice president at JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase hide caption

Tabi Haly defies expectations. She's a woman with a progressive muscular illness; she can't move her body and she needs round-the-clock care from aides. She wasn't expected to go to college, or to get a job-much less become a vice president at the banking giant JPMorgan Chase.

Even staying alive and healthy defied expectations. ""People with spinal muscular atrophy like myself, living to my age already is a huge win,"" says Haly, who is 40.

Haly's success as a software engineer in New York City was made possible by a government program called Supplemental Security Income, or SSI. It gives Haly access to crucial medical coverage.

But now that same program is threatening to bring her success crashing down.

In July, Haly got a letter that shocked her. The Social Security Administration, the agency that runs the federal benefits program, wrote that she was not eligible for SSI, even though she'd relied upon SSI for almost 19 years.

By losing SSI, she would also lose Medicaid, her health insurance. Medicaid provides medical care-from round-the-clock personal care aides to an expensive medicine-that keeps her healthy and allows her to build a career.

""It's like my foundation's falling apart,"" says Haly. She appealed the decision to end her SSI. But she worries that without it, the successful career she's achieved will end. Even with a high-paying job, she says she can't pay for 24-hour aides and other high-cost medical care on her own.

She faces a big fall: From a successful career to needing full-time care from family or, more likely she fears, moving into a nursing home.

SSI exists to provide a minimum income and often health insurance to people with significant disabilities. But an NPR investigation found that SSI often fails people with disabilities because its rules are long out of date and overly complex.

As a result, it's common for recipients like Haly to run into decisions that seem bureaucratic and inconsistent--but that threaten their ability to stay out of poverty, live independently and keep access to medical care.

Debora Wagner at Cornell University's Yang-Tan Institute on Employment and Disability says Haly's frustration is not uncommon and shows the need to modernize SSI. ""My question is: Who benefits in this situation? What's the benefit for us as a society of making it impossible for people with disabilities to work?""

Even her coworkers don't know

Haly is a software engineer and a team leader on development and coding projects for JPMorgan Chase & Co..

On an early morning this summer at her apartment in Manhattan, Haly, in her motorized wheelchair, prepared to lead back-to-back meetings on a new software project. Her personal care aide, Palone Ruddock, spent about 10 minutes getting Haly positioned in front of her computer.

Haly can't move her body -- she needs an aide to help her move her arms and legs.

But with Haly's fingers placed on a large trackpad, she can control the computer and run her meeting.

Some of her work colleagues on the call know she's disabled. None, she says, have any idea of how disabled she is. Nor did any of the outside consultants this day at a second meeting, where she presented the coding project.

Haly needs assistance from personal care aides 24 hours a day. ""That's who gets me into my wheelchair,"" she says. ""They're my hands and feet.""

Those aides move her body several times an hour, so she doesn't get painful bedsores. They suction the secretions out of her weakened lungs to keep her healthy.

Haly says those aides, seven days a week, cost about $300,000 a year.

Only Medicaid, the state and federal insurance for people with limited income that Haly gets through SSI, will pay for them.

Her company's health insurance wouldn't. The insurance that people get through their jobs doesn't cover long-term, in-home aides. Nor does Medicare, the government insurance for older people and some younger people with disabilities.

As a vice president at JPMorgan Chase, Haly makes a good salary. But even with a six-figure paycheck, she says she can't afford the health care that she needs.

In addition to the aides, Haly ticks off a list of her other medical expenses. Medicaid pays for a new, breakthrough medication for spinal muscular atrophy. She says that medicine alone, which she must keep cooled in the refrigerator, costs about $350,000 a year.

If she went on her employer's health insurance, a company spokesperson says it might pay for some or all of the medicine.

But there are other big expenses an employer's health insurance won't pay at all, like Haly's customized power wheelchair. At $35,000, it's as expensive as a small car.

In addition, Medicaid pays for wheelchair repairs and tens of thousands of dollars a year in physical, occupational and speech therapy.

""I would have to be a multi-millionaire to pay for all this stuff myself,"" Haly says.

Says Ari Ne'eman, an assistant professor at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard who researches disability income programs: ""If you lose access to SSI, you lose access to the Medicaid services that keep you alive and thriving in the community. It's a question of life and death.""

People with significant disabilities weren't expected to work

SSI was created in 1972 to provide monthly benefit checks for millions of impoverished disabled and elderly Americans. In 2024, the monthly benefit is capped at $943 for one person and $1,415 for a couple. In addition, most who are eligible for SSI then qualify for health insurance through state Medicaid programs.

Today, SSI is a key benefit to 7.5 million people.

But SSI was created before the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 protected people with disabilities from discrimination in public places and at work. It was created before the 1975 law-the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--that, for the first time, gave a right to a public school education for children with disabilities. Before then, some one million children with disabilities-the last group to get the right to schooling guaranteed-were excluded from many schools.

As the experiences and expectations for disabled Americans changed, SSI failed to keep up.

SSI was started with the assumption that recipients couldn't or wouldn't work in jobs where they could support themselves.

As a result, its out-of-date rules discourage work. Today, fewer than 10 percent of people on SSI do work, although many say they'd like to work, and many would like to make enough to get off of SSI.

Very few, like Haly, manage to build a career.

The rules make it hard to take even a part-time job. One rule says you can own only $2,000 in assets -- like bank savings or property. That limit hasn't changed since 1989.

For a couple, the asset limit is $3,000, creating a ""marriage penalty"" that forces many on SSI to avoid marriage or to try to hide it when they do marry.

As a result of the cap on accruing assets, Haly, for example, is unable to contribute part of her salary or take her employer's match in the company 401(k) plan. Those retirement plans, which are now used by 70 million Americans, didn't exist when SSI and the asset limit were first created.

Over the years, Social Security and the Internal Revenue Service have set up programs where people on SSI can shield part of their income from the asset limit. But these programs-ABLE accounts, Ticket to Work, PASS accounts-are often complicated to set up and limited in their scope. The result: Only a tiny fraction of people on SSI use them.

In recent months, the Social Security Administration has simplified some rules about counting income, like excluding the government assistance someone on SSI receives for food and rent. But Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley noted to NPR that only Congress can make the most significant reform to SSI.

There's a fix to the asset limit that's been proposed, but stalled, on Capitol Hill. The SSI Savings Penalty Elimination Act would raise the asset limit to $10,000 for an individual and $20,000 for a couple, in line with what the thresholds would be if they had kept up with inflation.

The bill has bipartisan co-sponsors in Congress and has been endorsed by business leaders, including Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan. But the bill wouldn't address other out-dated SSI rules.

One rule says that someone on SSI can't earn more than $65 a month. After that, a recipient loses one dollar of benefits for every two dollars they earn - in effect, a tax of 50 percent.

""That's a higher tax rate than anyone faces on their federal income tax,"" says Ne'eman of Harvard. ""But when it comes to the most impoverished disabled Americans, that is the level of taxation functionally that people are facing when they try and enter the workforce.""

That $65 limit is the same as it was first set in 1972.

When Microsoft in 2020 decided to raise the minimum wage for its lowest paid employees to $25 an hour, the company was surprised to find that disabled workers-largely ones with intellectual disabilities working in the cafeteria, as administrative assistants and other low-level jobs-suddenly faced losing their SSI benefits.

Microsoft hired private benefit managers to advise every employee on SSI, according to Rylin Rogers, the company's disability policy director.

Many of those workers thought they'd need to ""step away from those jobs, good jobs that they had had for a very long time, which would have been a shame,"" says Dan Rutten with the Washington Initiative for Supported Employment, the nonprofit benefits advisory firm that was called in to help. Most of those disabled employees, guided by the advisors, found waiver programs or cut their work hours to balance their salary increases with SSI's rules.

Fifty years ago, when SSI started, making $65 a month got a person close to the poverty limit. ""It was already inadequate in 1972, but it wasn't laughable,"" says Ne'eman. ""Today we have a situation where the income offset really is frankly insulting.""

People on SSI who ""are having the greatest success working"" are the ones who run into the most problems with SSI's rules, says Jack Smalligan who studies income benefits for the Urban Institute. ""So the message to beneficiaries is, essentially, that working doesn't pay.""

A Catch-22

Haly makes too much to take a monthly SSI benefit check. She's one of a tiny number of beneficiaries who need to qualify solely to keep her Medicaid.

But this summer, Haly learned that she was about to lose that health insurance.

At first, Haly thought it was a simple clerical error.

Every year, she gets recertified for Medicaid. Haly says a caseworker for New York state comes to her home and asks a series of questions to determine that she is still disabled. Haly considers the process ""intrusive"", given that she has a progressive neuromuscular condition that is incurable.

Usually, the process is automatic. But this spring, when the notice of her coverage renewal arrived, the line she expected to say her insurance would last until 2025 said 2024 instead.

The state of New York wasn't extending her Medicaid coverage, even though Haly was currently on SSI, which qualified her for that health insurance.

(A spokesperson for New York's Medicaid agency said rules around confidentiality limited its ability to discuss Haly's case. A spokesperson for Social Security noted confidentiality rules, too.)

Haly went to the Social Security office to straighten it out.

""They had no idea what I was talking about,"" she says. ""Zero.""

She says they offered to help her stop working and sign up for a separate benefit program, Social Security Disability Insurance, SSDI, for people who can't work because of a disability.

She recalls: ""The person said: 'I can make you an appointment for SSDI, Do you want to claim disability?' I said, 'No, I do not want to collect SSDI.'""

It took several weeks, she says, until she got an appointment to talk over her problem with a Social Security caseworker. Haly says he advised her that she needed to reapply for SSI.

She was reluctant to apply for a benefit that she already held, and had without question, for years. But the staffer was insistent, so she did.

Shortly after, she got a letter from Social Security-with a short denial. It said she made too much money to qualify.

SSI's regulations are complex and confusing. Often, recipients find it necessary to hire a lawyer or a benefits manager with specialized expertise to negotiate the rules to stay eligible.

""The rules are so complicated that even the most educated, professional people cannot understand and follow the rules. It's heartbreaking,"" says attorney Wagner at Cornell.

For years, Social Security said Haly qualified for an exception to SSI's earnings limit, called a 1619(b) waiver. It refers to a part of the Social Security law that lets some disabled people earn money over the limit and still qualify for Medicaid.

Social Security's denial this summer turned all that upside down.

It ended her eligibility for SSI because of her growing income-which before was excluded by the waiver. When she lost SSI, she lost the waiver that went with it. She can't use the waiver now or even reapply for it because the waiver is only available to people who Social Security says are eligible for SSI.

""It's a Catch-22,"" says Haly, frustrated.

To be eligible again, Haly would need to impoverish herself and give up the aides and medical care she is unlikely to afford on her own-especially if she can no longer work.

Even then, to reapply for SSI and maybe get the waiver again could take months or even years.

So she's asked Social Security to reverse itself and return to what had been the status quo for years and allow her to stay on SSI, to keep her Medicaid and to keep working.

""My medical expenses are so much, hundreds of thousands a year,"" says Haly. ""Do you not want me to work then? Because I can be a VP at JPMorgan Chase. I pay a lot of taxes being a VP at JPMorgan Chase. Or I can just not work and collect.""

While Haly waits for a decision on her appeal, her Medicaid insurance is in place-for now.

For a few days in early summer, without Medicaid, everything stopped. Her medicine was delayed. When her medical providers saw her insurance was halted, they canceled her physical therapy sessions and her wheelchair repair.

There would be few options, Haly says, if she loses her appeal to the Social Security Administration. She could stop working and apply for Social Security Disability Insurance. That comes with Medicare. But it would take at least two years to get it.

""Someone like me,"" she says, ""who is a person with a disability who needs full time care, the only way to get that is in a nursing home.""

Popcorn with a personality-and a work limit

For businesses, there's a growing recognition of the value of hiring more workers with disabilities. One trend: The creation of cafes, coffee shops and other small businesses as places where disabled people can be hired to work alongside others without disabilities.

In St. Paul Minnesota, attorney Shamus O'Meara opened a specialty popcorn business this year with his 26-year-old son Conor, who is autistic.

Conor O'Meara makes the popcorn and greets customers when they come in.

""When they see Connor,"" his father says, ""it's like, 'Connor, how are you!' It's a true joy to have him here. Everyone knows him. They call him the Mayor of St. Paul.""

The goal of Highland Popcorn (motto: ""Popcorn with Personality"") is to create a place where disabled people can find work.

But Shamus O'Meara says they quickly ran into barriers with SSI. Because of the $65 limit on monthly earnings and the $2,000 limit on assets, many of their employees, including Conor, need to limit their work to just a few hours, a few days a week.

That required Shamus, who hires both disabled and non-disabled workers, to find many extra employees to cover all the shifts.

Work is important to Conor, for social interaction and for the money he can earn.

He takes the bus to two other part-time jobs. At a nearby bowling alley, he cleans the scoring screens and sweeps up the cigarette butts outside. At a pizza restaurant, he buses dishes and wraps silverware in napkins. In addition, he volunteers at a community radio station and hosts a show where he talks about his life and about Minnesota's professional sports teams.

Conor says he'd like to work even more. ""I think Social Security should end that one limiting how many hours you work.""

A workforce issue, not charity

Tabi Haly's bosses, too, are confounded by SSI's complex and stale rules - and by the idea that a valued worker would go from a company vice president to having her career ended and possibly needing to move to a nursing home.

""Tabi contributes to our business in a very meaningful way. She's top talent,"" says Bryan Gill, who runs JPMorgan's office of disability inclusion. ""And I want more of Tabi's time contributing to our business.""

Gill says the financial services company makes an effort to hire people with disabilities because it's a way to find talented workers in a tight labor market.

""We do a lot of charity,"" he says. ""We have a lot of philanthropic efforts. This is not one of them. This is a business strategy imperative to the long-term success of this company.""

Haly also writes songs and has recorded two CDs. She started singing as a form of speech therapy to strengthen her weakened lungs.

In the lyrics to one song, ""Waiting in the Wings,"" she asks: ""Do they judge me by my talent? ...Treat me less than a human being? Is that what our life's meant to be?""

""Waiting in the wings means we're waiting backstage,"" she says, waiting for rights. ""What that means here in the States is that we have the liberty to pursue our dreams and live them. And not feel like there are all these barriers to get there.""

Haly says she only wants the chance to keep working and to keep her independence. But she needs to keep her SSI and Medicaid to make that remain her reality."
How Women Can Use Personal Branding To Accelerate Career Success,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamarruda/2024/10/02/how-women-use-personal-branding-for-career-success/,2024-10-02T16:01:56Z,"Building a strong personal brand has become important for all professionals who seek career advancement. For women, it's an absolute necessity. It's a powerful technique for defining their unique value, showcasing skills, and standing out in industries that, in many cases, remain male-dominated. Establishing a strong personal brand allows women to increase their visibility, control their narrative, combat unconscious bias, and open doors to new career opportunities.

McKinsey research confirms that although women represent a significant portion of the workforce, they're still underrepresented in senior leadership positions. Building a personal brand helps bridge this gap by increasing visibility. When women actively manage their reputations, they have greater control over how they're perceived, making it easier for others to recognize their expertise and leadership potential. A strong personal brand showcases a woman's skills, experience, and achievements.

Unconscious bias plays a role in how women are viewed in the workplace, with certain stereotypes influencing perceptions of their capabilities or leadership qualities. A carefully crafted, authentic personal brand allows women to challenge these stereotypes head-on by consistently presenting a clear message about who they are. By influencing external perceptions, women can push past preconceived notions and demonstrate that they belong at the table.

Confidence is a key byproduct of personal branding and a game-changer in career advancement. It empowers women to take ownership of their achievements and advocate for themselves. However, Jennifer Brown, author and Inclusive Leadership reminds us that, ""Many women struggle with imposter syndrome, a phenomenon defined by Dr. Valerie Young of the Imposter Syndrome Institute as the persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a fraud despite evident success."" In a recent interview with Dr. Young, they discussed her research. It shows that 70% of people will experience this at some point in their career, with women, particularly women of color, facing it at higher rates. Brown added, ""When women own their narratives, they're more likely to take on new challenges, speak up in meetings, and seek out opportunities for advancement.""

The first step in building a strong personal brand is defining what makes you unique. What are your strengths? What differentiated skills, experiences, or perspectives do you bring to your work? What values drive your behaviors? Take time to reflect on your professional journey and pinpoint what you excel at and what you're passionate about.

With a clear understanding of your unique promise value, you can communicate that message consistently across online and in-person interactions. Your unique promise of value becomes the core of your brand, helping others understand what makes you relevant and compelling.

Your personal brand exists across various platforms -- LinkedIn, other social media, professional associations, and professional networks. To build a strong brand, consistency is key. It's one of the three all-important Cs of powerful brands. Your messaging, tone, and image need to be cohesive across all platforms. If, for example, you're known for your expertise in project management and leadership, make that evident in your LinkedIn posts, public speaking engagements, and the way you interact with colleagues and senior leaders. This unified branding helps establish a strong and reliable professional identity.

A well-crafted personal brand opens doors to meaningful professional relationships. Networking is an essential part of career growth, and your personal brand helps make networking more strategic and impactful. Whether you're attending industry conferences, delivering powerful online presentations, or simply engaging on social media, your personal brand acts as your introduction before you even speak. Identify opportunities to connect with influencers, thought leaders, and peers. Cultivating these relationships positions you as someone who is well-connected and engaged.

Research from Harvard Business Review found that women are less likely to self-promote than men, even when they are equally qualified. Women often believe that hard work will be acknowledged and rewarded without having to actively tout their achievements. In contrast, men are comfortable with self-promotion. Founder & author of Ladies Get Paid, Claire Wasserman, suggests, ""Everything you share should be about the value you bring someone else, and your personal brand is the way you do that."" To self-promote without seeming boastful, write articles, share industry insights on social media, and speak at conferences to demonstrate your expertise and point of view, and position yourself as a thought leader.

Leading meetings and delivering impactful presentations are powerful ways to build your brand. That's because the people you seek to influence, impact and impress are there, you have valuable expertise or insights to share, and there's an opportunity to build and bolster important relationships. Focus specifically on virtual presentations because they are the most common form today and are the most challenging when it comes to keeping your audience engaged. They provide the best opportunity to stand out and get noticed.

Having the right support and connections will have a big impact on your career mobility. Brown says, ""Women also need to work smarter, not harder, on investing in and unleashing others as amplifiers of their brand. Like so much underrepresented talent, they are not only under-mentored but, importantly, under-sponsored, according to McKinsey and LeanIn's Women in the Workplace 2023 report. Finding and activating a sponsor who can speak to a woman's performance and potential and share their professional capital with her can further her brand exponentially.""

Authenticity is the foundation of successful personal branding and a core component of authentic leadership. Women often feel the pressure to conform to certain corporate or industry norms, but the most compelling personal brands are those that feel real. Don't try to be someone you're not. Instead, embrace your true self -- your values, personality, and professional style, even when that feels hard. Wasserman adds, ""As a way to move through any self-doubt, focus on service promotion and not self-promotion. That fosters trust, which is critical in building long-lasting professional relationships. When you show up as your authentic self, people are more likely to support you, advocate for you, and open doors to new opportunities.""

By defining your unique promise of value and living your brand actively in all that you do, women can leverage personal branding to advance their careers while breaking down barriers."
How a cold-email led me to professionally photograph Taylor Swift,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/career-growth/cold-email-led-professionally-photograph-taylor-swift-rcna173414,2024-10-02T15:16:11Z,"If you had told me 10 years ago that I would photograph Taylor Swift in concert not once, not twice, but over three different tours, and that I would be hosting a Taylor Swift-themed photography exhibit showcasing all those photos, I would have thought these statements were the stuff of fantastical dreams.

Taylor Swift? Front row, taking photos? Three tours? Hosting an exhibition? Impossible.

Because 10 years ago I was an unemployed production assistant lost in the swap of the Los Angeles entertainment industry, hoping for any bit of work to justify the life decisions I had made at that point: leaving Canada where I had grown up, putting aside my master's degree in journalism from Columbia University, and venturing out to the Wild West for a shot to be a part of creating culture that got exported around the world.

What saved me from a slow slide to abandoned dreams into a much more practical life path, was the ace up my sleeve of cold-emailing, and the ability I seemed to have via earnest paragraphs to somehow convince much more important people to take a shot on me and offer opportunities to try out this thing called photography, in particular behind-the-scenes photography on music video sets, where I first got my start assisting a music video director.

When one of those emails worked and an executive producer (shoutout to Joseph Uliano!) invited me to be the behind-the-scenes photographer on an upcoming Cage the Elephant music video, it started a nearly decade-long path of photographing live concerts that culminated in photographing Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, and displaying work from her three tours (including 1989 and Reputation) at Kimpton Epic Hotel Miami's artist-in-residence program.

Since that fated Cage the Elephant music video set (for their song ""Cigarette Daydreams""), I have photographed the aforementioned Taylor Swift tours as well as Ed Sheeran, Adele, Janelle Monae, Nicki Minaj, Olivia Rodrigo, The Killers, Maisie Peters, HAIM, Gracie Abrams, and SIA. I seem to have been destined to work at the heart of the celebrity-driven world even when I transitioned to working in the tech industry in San Francisco, where for six years I was producer then a creative director at the video-streaming platform MasterClass, joining as one of their earliest employees. At nights I would wander around San Francisco venues just experimenting and honing my photography and during the day, I was part of building a fast-growing once-in-a-lifetime startup that eventually led to me producing, directing, and interviewing more than 30 MasterClasses including with the likes of Hillary Clinton, Anna Wintour, Lewis Hamilton, and Shonda Rhimes.

If all this sounds like some sort of lucky dream version of a career come-up, it is, and I never take it for granted. But what's important to mention is that it was the combination of creating strategic opportunities to build a portfolio, doing what I call ""practicing serendipity,"" and having the fortitude to continually be bold and put myself out there that led to where I am today.

Let me explain each point.

Creating strategic opportunities to build a portfolio

One of the best things that I did during my assistant days in Los Angeles was being conscious about how to find and create things that I could put my name on to showcase what I did. The most obvious example was taking photographs on set. Here was something tangible that I could point to and say, ""I did that."" Even though I was an assistant for some exciting people on some exciting sets, people don't hire you into progressively higher responsibility positions because of tangential associations with cool projects or organizations. Those may offer credibility and help you pass an initial vetting process, but people hire you because you're able to offer a showcase of your skills and because of your ability to initiate and bring things from beginning to end, even if those projects are unsexy or small in scale.

One of the pieces of advice I offer to college students when I give talks is to find jobs that allow you to practice the skills you want to be known for right away. In other words, do the job that you want to do as soon as you can. It's my personal opinion that a job at a small unknown startup or organization that allows you to take ownership and do the skill-defining work, even if you are a junior employee, is a much better choice than a job at a large outfit or at a globally-known buzzy company where you are relegated to prolonged support work.

Of course this is not black and white, as nothing in life is. I've seen plenty of examples of people who start out at big companies, build a valuable network, and then move on to great success, progressively climbing the career ladder. And I've also seen people hang in long enough at a big company to be tossed opportunities to flex and grow and earn a valuable skill set and get their name on projects. But those paths often require a lot of luck and the good will of a generous manager invested in your growth. Perhaps you can create the best of both worlds, like I did, as you work to build a reputation and gain access to a network at one job (in this case, my assistant work around Los Angeles), while staying focused on building skill-set-driven work on your off time (my photography).

Case and point: My former manager and the co-founder of MasterClass, Aaron Rasmussen, recently informed me that it was my concert portfolio that stood out to him in my initial application for MasterClass. It showed initiative, and the ability to have the ""eye"", the latter of which was extremely crucial at MasterClass where we worked to create Netflix-quality online educational videos.

Focus on building a skills-showcasing portfolio, and if your current work is not allowing for those opportunities, create them on your own.

Practicing serendipity

Well I'm sure you're now asking, ""Jasmeet, how do I create these opportunities?"" The answer to that is what I've already referenced in this article through the cold-emailing anecdote, and it is what I called ""practicing serendipity."" What do I mean by that?

Practicing serendipity essentially means giving yourself as many shots as you can for wondrous opportunities to come your way. It's sending out cold emails, attending talks and conferences, posting on LinkedIn. In essence, it's making it easier for you to be on someone's mind when an opportunity comes up, or to spark the interest of a generous someone who remembers what it's like to be early in their career and offer a chat, an experience, or a referral.

I call this practicing serendipity because I've found that being in ""the right place at the right time"" involves a lot of intentional work to make something the right place or the right time. You have to continually put yourself and put yourself out there and make this a habitual part of your career development.

One of the best books I recently read that summarizes this theory well is Christian Busch's ""The Serendipity Mindset: The Art and Science of Creating Good Luck."" Busch discusses how some people are better at creating the conditions for coincidences to arise and taking advantage of them. These involve, as he explains, seeding triggers, giving out hooks, increasing exposure and connecting with influencers (used in the broadest sense).

What does this look like in practice? It means crafting the perfect cold email or DM, paying money to attend an industry conference, finally creating or cleaning up your website, and diligently talking about your accomplishments or work experiences on social media. Taking these actions increases your serendipity to life-changing opportunities and builds up your ""weak ties"", a theory from Stanford sociologist Mark Granovetter that shows that much of our important life-changing information (referrals to jobs, introductions to our future spouses) tend to come from casual acquaintances rather than our strongest relationships.

What did this mean in my lack-luster assistant days in Los Angeles? It meant that I shelled out $200 (an absolutely huge amount of money for me) to attend an industry conference on music videos, where I got to introduce myself to music video directors and producers, and where I met Joseph Uliano (who, as I mentioned, facilitated my first behind-the-scenes photo gig with Cage the Elephant). It meant I kept up with casual work acquaintances doing interesting things over many years, including the person who would eventually connect me to someone at MasterClass when they were hiring.

Some people absolutely get lucky in life and get plucked out of obscurity to the career of their dreams. For the rest of us, practicing serendipity allows us to tweak the strings of luck in our favor and to be ready to pounce on them when they do.

Fortitude

A note on creating and managing careers: It can and will be some of the most emotionally exhausting work of your life. I can't tell you the amount of tears that I have shed over real and harsh rejection, including some rejection that was pointedly personal. As a woman of color from a lower-income background in Canada with immigrant parents, it can be particularly exhausting to navigate privileged white and male spaces, as I've often had to do in my work at the very upper echelons in tech and entertainment from New York to Los Angeles to San Francisco.

Creating any career of meaning and impact is going to require high fortitude, especially if you're not in one of those aforementioned groups of privilege.

How I've learned to mentally deal with the harshness and the roller coaster of my chosen career and build that fortitude is to view everything like a video game. Some people are going to start the video game three levels ahead of you and with special boost-ups. You may be starting at Level 1 with no special powers (yet). While you may be envious that others have started a few levels ahead of you with special advantages, staying fixated on those people and their advantages is not doing anything to get you out of Level 1.

Sometimes you need to hit pause on the video game and take a break. That's OK. You may even realize this particular video game is not for you, and you want to try another game. That's OK! The point that I'm really trying to make with this overwrought video game analogy is that nothing should weigh so heavily on you as you're learning which video game to play and how. It's just a game, and it's up to you to figure out how to do the best you can at it.

And if you hit a dead end, simply reverse course and find a different way. Don't hate yourself if your princess is in another castle. Just take a pause and start again.

What I hope you take away from my story is that although so many things about your career are out of your control, there are so many things that are. I had no idea that cold emails sent ten years ago would lead to experiences and relationships that created the doors to my present career-defining opportunities, including photographing Taylor Swift. As Apple co-founder Steve Jobs once infamously said, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. Start to throw out those fish hooks today, and see where they will lead you in years to come."
"Where One Of 2024's Best Horror Movies, Strange Darling, Is Now Streaming",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/02/where-one-of-2024s-best-horror-movies-strange-darling-is-now-streaming/,2024-10-02T15:09:29Z,"It is now October, and if you're looking for a great new horror movie to stream, one of 2024's best has now arrived, though you'll have to shell out a bit for it at the moment.

That movie is Strange Darling, the new horror thriller that clocks in at just 96 minutes for a quick watch. But it is one of 2024's best new horror films with a 95% score on Rotten Tomatoes from 138 critics. It also boasts an 85% audience score. Here's a synopsis of the film:

""Set in rural Oregon, [Strange Darling] focuses on a man and woman who engage in a one-night stand that devolves into a cat-and-mouse game of murder. It is divided into six narrative chapters arranged in nonlinear order, and presented as a dramatization of the pinnacle of a serial killer's years-long murder spree in the Western United States. The director has neither confirmed nor denied if the film is actually based on real events, saying ""perhaps"" it is.""

The draw here is the somewhat Memento-like mixed-up chapter format which works really well for the narrative, if you can keep up. So where to watch it? Right now you have to buy it rather than rent, but given that it may have been hard to find in theaters near you, this is the first time many will be able to watch it, myself included. Here's the streaming locations:

If you wait a little while the ""rental"" price will probably be $15, before it sinks lower than that eventually. And if you want to wait until it's ""free"" on a service you may own, that's probably going to be at least a solid month, if not more. It's a Miramax film which is owned in part by Paramount, so it may make its way to Paramount Plus, though I don't think that's confirmed.

Strange Darling's score makes it one of the best-reviewed horror films of the year, and the year is almost over. Here's the top 10 list as it stands:

So that's even higher than the likes of higher profile horror films like The Substance and Longlegs, even if it didn't do that level of box office. Maybe it should have with a wider release. But now you can watch it at home."
Future has dropped three chart-topping albums in just six months,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5134015/pop-charts-future-tops-album-chart-again,2024-10-02T14:49:49Z,"This week's Billboard Hot 100 singles chart offers more of the same -- Shaboozey's ""A Bar Song (Tipsy)"" holds at No. 1 for a whopping 12th nonconsecutive week -- but there's major volatility atop the albums chart. Last week's No. 1 album disappears from the Billboard 200 entirely, making room for rapper Future, whose new Mixtape Pluto debuts atop the chart, making it his third new album to top the Billboard 200 this year.

On last week's Billboard 200 albums chart, Travis Scott's 2014 mixtape Days Before Rodeo raced from No. 106 to No. 1 on the strength of its long-awaited vinyl release. This week, without the benefit of that vinyl surge, it plunges again -- dropping from No. 1 out of the Billboard 200 altogether -- while another rapper, Future, takes his place at No. 1.

Mixtape Pluto is Future's third album of 2024, following We Don't Trust You and We Still Don't Trust You. Those two collaborations with Metro Boomin each debuted at No. 1 just three weeks apart back in April; the former record's song ""Like That"" actually kicked off this year's ramped-up beef between Kendrick Lamar and Drake. Naturally, three chart-topping records in six months puts Future in select company: Only two acts have duplicated that feat in the last 60 years, namely The Beatles (in 1965-66) and... the cast of Glee, which pulled it off in the span of just two months back in 2010.

While we're talking milestones, Mixtape Pluto is Future's 11th No. 1 album, which ties him for fifth place all-time with Eminem, Bruce Springsteen, Barbra Streisand and the rapper formerly known as Kanye West. (Drake has 13 No. 1s, Taylor Swift and Jay-Z each have 14 and the aforementioned Beatles hold the record with 19.)

This week, Future's success comes at the expense of pop star Chappell Roan, who'd made a serious bid for No. 1 in conjunction with the one-year anniversary of The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess' release. The album received four new variant editions on vinyl -- and one on cassette -- in a push to goose its sales. The bid worked up to a point, as she sold roughly 50,000 vinyl copies, but it was only enough to lift her from No. 3 to her prior chart peak of No. 2, a position she held for two weeks in August, behind Taylor Swift and then Post Malone.

Rounding out the top five are Sabrina Carpenter's Short n' Sweet (swapping spots with Midwest Princess to land at No. 3), Post Malone's F-1 Trillion (holding at No. 4) and Morgan Wallen's One Thing at a Time (holding at No. 5). There are two chart debuts in the bottom half of the top 10 -- Katy Perry's 143 at No. 6 and Lil Tecca's Plan A at No. 9 -- while three old reliables round out the list: Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department (from No. 6 to No. 7), Billie Eilish's Hit Me Hard and Soft (holding at No. 8) and Noah Kahan's Stick Season (from No. 9 to No. 10).

There've been lots of recent weeks with little movement on the Hot 100 singles chart, but this is getting ridiculous: This week's top 10 appears perfectly identical to last week's top 10 at first glance, except when you notice that two of Sabrina Carpenter's three hit singles (""Please Please Please"" and ""Taste"") swap places at No. 8 and No. 9, respectively. That's it!

Sure, there are minor, iterative milestones to discuss. Shaboozey's ""A Bar Song (Tipsy),"" which holds at No. 1 for a 12th nonconsecutive week, is now tied for third-most weeks at No. 1 for any song this decade. Morgan Wallen's ""Last Night"" was No. 1 for 16 weeks just last year, while Harry Styles' ""As It Was"" topped the chart for 15 weeks in 2022. As for the song whose run of weeks atop the chart this decade ties ""A Bar Song (Tipsy),"" here's a hint: It may well hit No. 1 again, starting later this year. (Okay, here's another hint: It's Mariah Carey's ""All I Want for Christmas Is You."" That song has actually been No. 1 for 14 weeks in all, but only 12 of them took place during this decade.)

Carpenter has hit a fresh milestone of her own: She's now the only solo woman ever to land three songs in the top 10 simultaneously for five consecutive weeks. (Cardi B once did it four weeks in a row.) In addition to ""Please Please Please"" and ""Taste,"" ""Espresso"" holds at No. 3.

The rest of the top 10 is the same as it ever was -- and, near as I can tell, ever shall be: Post Malone's ""I Had Some Help,"" featuring Morgan Wallen, is No. 2; Chappell Roan's ""Good Luck, Babe!"" holds at No. 4; and Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga's ""Die With a Smile"" sits at No. 5 yet again. Speaking of ""yet again,"" Billie Eilish's ""Birds of a Feather"" (No. 6), Teddy Swims' ""Lose Control"" (No. 7) and Kendrick Lamar's ""Not Like Us"" (No. 10) are also sedentary this week.

Also, though none of its songs hit the top 10, Future's Mixtape Pluto makes its presence felt across this week's Hot 100: Every one of its 17 songs has crashed the chart, ranging from No. 21 to No. 85.

Here we are, 19 weeks later, and eight of those 10 songs are still in the top 13. ""Beautiful Things,"" ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Too Sweet"" have been hovering between 11 and 13 for weeks. And, while ""Lunch"" and ""Fortnight"" have slid considerably farther, the albums that spawned them remain in the top 10; those tracks have merely been overshadowed by subsequent singles (""Birds of a Feather"" and ""I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,"" respectively).

Consider this: Since that June 1 chart, only eight songs have entered the top 10 for the first time. Zach Bryan's ""Pink Skies"" had a brief top-10 run in June, peaking at No. 6. Eminem's ""Houdini"" bounced on and off the chart starting in June, peaking at No. 2. Morgan Wallen's ""Lies Lies Lies"" had a one-week cameo in the top 10 in July, peaking at No. 7. The remaining five tracks -- ""Birds of a Feather,"" ""Please Please Please,"" ""Die With a Smile,"" ""Taste"" and ""Good Luck, Babe!"" -- are still there. That... is not a lot of chart movement in four months.

For those who seek something fresh and innovative -- something never-before-heard -- at the top of the pop charts, take solace: If last year's charts are any indication, we're just eight short weeks from the triumphant return of Brenda Lee's ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree."""
Collapse Of Reproductive Rights In America On Exhibit In Dallas,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chaddscott/2024/10/02/collapse-of-reproductive-rights-in-america-on-exhibit-in-dallas/,2024-10-02T14:04:32Z,"Artists from around the South brought together to share stories of a national healthcare crisis.

Tens of millions of Americans found themselves asking that question in spring 2022 when news leaked that the Supreme Court would be throwing out 50 years of supposedly settled law and overturning the Roe v. Wade decision guaranteeing women access to abortion nationwide.

Dallas-based curators Emily Edwards and Sara Hignite were among those in disbelief.

Is it Real? Yes It Is! (1969), the title of Juanita McNeely's multi-panel painting depicting her harrowing illegal abortion experience in the permanent collection and presently on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.

The feeling and artwork gave name to an unprecedented exhibition from Edwards and Hignite, the first organized and mounted in the American South directly addressing abortion access and reproductive rights. The pair has assembled more than 30 artists, most from or connected to the South-where reproductive rights have suffered their greatest assault-most representing marginalized communities-those most at risk from the politicians' and judges' anti-woman cruelties.

Like 28-year-old Amber Nicole Thurman, a Black woman from Georgia who died during childbirth from a preventable infection after being denied life-saving healthcare by the state's draconian abortion laws. Art curators work their entire lives hoping shows intersect with current events, capturing lighting in a bottle, drawing crowds and media attention. Not in this case.

In the case of ""Is It Real? Contemporary Artists Address Reproductive Freedom,"" it's ""ripped from the headlines"" feel represents tragedy. Ongoing tragedy. Needless tragedy.

""The United States is experiencing a reproductive care emergency across the board, and the worst states are in the South, and that's why this exhibition is based in the South,"" Hignite told Forbes.com. ""That's why we're featuring and focusing on artists who have connections to the southern states. If you look at the numbers, potentially every state in the South has a ban on abortion because you've either got total bans or six-week bans. We're living it every single day.""

""Is it Real"" opens at Lagoon Studio in Dallas (1105 Lagoon Drive, Dallas, TX, 75207) on October 5 and runs through October 26, 2024, nine days before Election Day in America.

The symbolism of debuting the presentation in Dallas-where Roe v. Wade was first argued in 1970 before reaching the Supreme Court in 1973-and in Texas-where dogma and control trump safety for pregnant women-is not lost on the curators.

""Is it Real"" examines strategies contemporary artists employ to address the topic of reproductive freedom. Leading with empathy and fact, and challenging often deeply rooted misinformation, the exhibition seeks to destigmatize and humanize reproductive care.

""By transporting people who are experiencing the show into so many different perspectives, into, quite literally, the shoes of some of the experiences, (visitors) are able to see how multifaceted this reproductive freedom crisis is,"" Edwards told Forbes.com. ""(The artists) help foster empathy by rooting (issues) in emotion and in beauty.""

That's what artists can do. They can't wave a magic wand and change laws, but they can change minds.

""Sarah and I both believe in the soft power of art,"" Edwards added. ""If someone comes in and they want to protest the work, they're likely not leaving being like, 'I'm going to vote blue,' but there's a softening that happens, and I think that's the hope for everyone who comes in here who is either on the fence, isn't sure, maybe is not an activist, maybe is just not informed on these issues. I've seen people soften, including my own parents who do not view this topic the same way I do. They've come to every show, and I see them soften, and I see them care, and I see them ask questions, and those questions turn into people changing their minds over time.""

Minds do change. Ballot initiatives related to abortion access nationwide since the repeal of Roe have overwhelmingly gone in favor of more access.

""I have had conversations with people who have started having conversations with family members and friends or people in their community who didn't believe in the right to abortion and maybe we're moving the needle now as they're hearing about this project,"" Hignite said. ""I don't want to overstate it. Obviously, this exhibition is not changing the landscape of abortion access in the country, but if we can just start cracking the window to the idea of coming around to believing in everyone's right to self-determination and bodily autonomy, then we will be so proud.""

While abortion access draws most of the headlines in the contemporary struggle for reproductive rights in America, it's not the only issue, nor the only issue approached in the exhibition.

""It's about the mortality rate of pregnant women, particularly Black women,"" Edwards said. ""It's about rape and sexual assault. It's about trans men who are also experiencing these experiences, and so having these different stories coming together in the show that really all interwoven to show how widespread this is, how this impacts everyone.""

Maternal mortality is on the rise in America. Black women, Native American and Alaska Native people suffer disproportionately. The South, of course, leads the way. Restrictive abortion policies have always gone hand-in-hand with higher maternal mortality. Not that anywhere in America can brag. America ranks 55 globally for maternal mortality, worst of any developed nation.

Broadly speaking, the U.S. is experiencing a reproductive care emergency. From proposed total bans on abortion-including in the case of rape and incest-to threats against birth control, Plan B, and IVF. Abortion access serves as the flash point for a frightening regression of not only reproductive care in America, a subject always impacting women more gravely, but also a frightening regression in how women are viewed, treated, and respected societally.

In November, 70 million or so Americans will vote for Donald Trump for president. He was found liable for rape. His running mate J.D. Vance has verbalized insulting, denigrating, dehumanizing opinions related to women across a spectrum of subjects over many years that would have been cringe-worthy in the 1960s. Comments that would have immediately disqualified a candidate for local office, let alone national office, just 10 years ago.

""Is It Real?"" exposes the harsh realities of the current political climate and envisions a more just country in which every human has the basic right to control their own body and determine their own future.

That hardly seems radical, but in 2024, in Dallas, in Texas, across the South, it is. An advertising poster for the show featuring a Guerrilla Girls Broadband artwork was banned from Dallas Rapid Transit rail stations.

That's why Edwards and Hignite chose to finance and present their project themselves, not in a museum.

""We didn't have to worry about any of the institutional challenges and bureaucracy,"" Hignite explained. ""We wanted to make sure that we could fully realize our curatorial vision, and we decided early on that the best way to do that was to do it independently.""

They've bootstrapped all the fundraising themselves, every penny, grass roots style. They've been supported by The Goss-Michael Foundation, ACLU of Texas, Texas Abortion Advocacy Network, and more than 100 individual donors. ""Is It Real?"" will also be raising funds for Texas Equal Access Fund and The Afiya Center, two Texas-based mutual aid organizations providing essential support to people needing reproductive care and related services.

Programming will include a film series organized in partnership with Spacy DTX; wellness workshops; panel discussions; Get Out the Vote initiatives; a resource library; and a reflection space organized by Make Art with Purpose. Admission to the exhibition and related programs are free and open to the public.

The collapse of reproductive rights in America and its resulting consequences represent a tragedy. In the face of tragedy and crisis and inequality and barbarity, artists make work. Curators bring that work to the public. The public's role is to vote."
Starting A Side Hustle With An SBA Loan: The Hustlin' Woman's Guide,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pattieehsaei/2024/10/02/starting-a-side-hustle-with-an-sba-loan-the-hustlin-womans-guide/,2024-10-02T13:01:52Z,"As women, we often juggle multiple roles -- professionals, caretakers, leaders, dreamers -- but somewhere deep down, many of us have a passion or a skill that could grow into something bigger. Whether it's crafting, consulting, baking, or designing, we often dream about turning that hobby into a side hustle. But let's be honest, the biggest hurdle in making that dream a reality is usually funding. And that's where the magic of SBA loans comes in.

Let me tell you, I was once in your shoes, thinking, ""How can I possibly start something on my own without a boatload of cash?"" Then I started working in the SBA business and realized something: you don't need a millionaire's bank account to start your own business. What you do need is an opportunity -- and SBA loans can be just that.

If you're unfamiliar, the Small Business Administration (SBA) is a government agency that helps small businesses and entrepreneurs (that's you!) get access to financing through different loan programs. And before you start panicking, let me assure you, SBA loans are designed to be accessible for people who don't have perfect credit or a huge stack of cash to start with. The SBA itself doesn't directly lend you money, but it works with banks and lenders to guarantee loans in case of a default. This means the bank has less exposure to loss and you have a better shot at getting approved.

For a woman thinking about starting a side hustle, the most relevant type of SBA loan is probably the SBA Microloan. These loans are usually for up to $50,000, and while that may not sound like a fortune, it's more than enough to get a side business off the ground. It can be the perfect way to get that capital infusion without feeling like you're drowning in debt.

Before we dive into how SBA loans work, let's talk about your side hustle idea. Whether it's making eco-friendly candles, starting a fitness coaching business, selling your artwork online, or offering freelance marketing services, the key is to have a clear vision. Don't overthink it. What do you love doing? What are you good at? That's your starting point.

The beauty of a side hustle is that it doesn't need to take over your life. You can still work your 9-to-5 while building something of your own on the side. The goal is to create a source of income that also aligns with your passions. Once know what that is, you're ready to move forward with financing. But understand that the key word is ""income."" You shouldn't turn a passion into a business if you can't monetize it -- that's what we call a hobby.

Now, you might be asking, ""Why an SBA loan? Why not just dip into my savings or max out a credit card?"" Sure, that's an option, but if you've ever dealt with the interest rates on credit cards, you know it's not pretty. SBA loans come with much lower interest rates than most personal loans or credit cards, which means you're not sinking in a sea of debt while trying to make your side hustle float. And while you can use some of your savings for your new side gig, draining your entire savings is not a smart financial decision.

Another great thing about SBA loans is that they have flexible repayment terms, which is important when you're starting something part-time and don't want the pressure of huge monthly payments right off the bat. Whether you need money to buy equipment, invest in materials, or build a website, an SBA loan can give you that cushion to get started.

Alright, so let's say you've got your side hustle idea ready to go and you're feeling inspired to apply for an SBA loan. Now what?

First things first -- you need to get your ducks in a row. The SBA, while helpful, is not a financial institution. Thus, you have to find a bank or an SBA lender to finance your business, and they'll want to see that you've got a plan. Here's what you'll need:

A business plan: This might sound intimidating, but it doesn't have to be. Your business plan should lay out what your side hustle is, who your customers are, how much money you need, and most importantly, how you plan to pay the loan back. Think of it as your roadmap, not just for the bank, but for yourself.

Financial projections: Even if you're just starting, the SBA will want to know how you plan to make money. Include estimated expenses, income, and growth potential. The more prepared you are, the better your chances.

If you have no idea how to do a business plan or financial projections, hire an independent contract from sites like Fiverr who will do the work for you. But make sure they are reputable with great ratings.

Personal credit: While SBA loans are more forgiving than traditional loans, they still take your credit history into account. If your credit score isn't perfect, don't stress -- it's not the only factor, but it's something to be aware of. Also be aware that SBA loans require a personal guarantee from all borrowers.

Collateral: Depending on the loan, you may need to offer collateral, like equipment or other assets if available. But don't worry, microloans often don't require collateral, making them a great option for a new side hustle.

Once you've secured your SBA loan, the fun part begins: building your business! Whether you're using the loan to purchase inventory, rent a workspace, or launch your online store, it's all about taking that first step. Money is a tool to help you grow, but the real success comes from your commitment to making it happen.

One piece of advice: spend wisely. It's tempting to splurge on everything you think you need, but focus on what will give you the best return on investment. If your business relies on marketing, invest in advertising or building a killer website. If it's product-based, use the loan to perfect your offering.

One thing you can't forget about side hustles- they requires time and energy, and it's a long-term game. Some days, you'll feel unstoppable, and other days, you might wonder why you're putting in the extra hours. The key is to stay consistent, keep learning, and remember that you're building something that could one day be your main source of income, or at least a significant contributor.

What's most empowering about using an SBA loan to start a side hustle is the independence it brings. This isn't just about making extra money -- though that's certainly a bonus -- it's about taking control of your financial future and becoming financially independent. You're investing in yourself, and that's something no one can take away. And with SBA backing, you're more likely to secure that loan and be on your way to financial freedom."

Like many, I have watched in horror as countless friends in my former home of North Carolina have been unable to reach their loved ones.

Hurricane Helene wiped out communities and infrastructure in the Southeast, claiming more than 160 lives as one of the 10 deadliest storms in U.S. history, according to USA Today. AccuWeather estimates the damage will range between $95 billion and $110 billion.

It will be a long recovery, and the region is in need of support. To make sure your assistance gets to those who need it, be sure to check the credentials of potential organizations and use caution when donating to individuals to avoid any potential scams.

A few charities accepting Helene-specific donations include: the American Red Cross, World Central Kitchen and Airbnb.org, which helps people find a temporary place to stay.

Alice Walton, America's richest woman, just reported her largest known charitable gift to date, including $249 million to help fund a new medical school in her name in her family's hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas. Forbes estimates that Walton, the only daughter of Walmart cofounder Sam Walton, has now given away $1.5 billion in her lifetime, making her one of the 30 biggest lifetime givers nationwide.

Iran fired rockets at Israel Tuesday, the Israeli military said, potentially escalating the war in the Middle East as Iran took responsibility for the attack and warned it is only a ""first wave."" In a statement read on state television, Iran said the attack was retaliation for the killings of multiple Hezbollah leaders, according to the Associated Press.

Aerospace and defense stocks reached all-time highs, a grim market reaction to the latest escalation of tensions in the Middle East, as the Israeli military reported missile strikes from Iran a day after Israeli ground forces entered Lebanon. Defense stocks typically see gains during times of heightened conflict as the companies' revenues rely heavily on U.S. government contracts.

Fred Thiel, the CEO of major bitcoin miner MARA, spoke with Forbes about how it is adapting to the wave of smaller miners gravitating towards artificial intelligence, as well as U.S. politics and the outlook for the crypto mining industry. He says that retail investors give small competitors too much credit for AI plays that will not pay off for years.

Since porn entrepreneur Leonid Radvinsky purchased OnlyFans in 2018, it has gone from being a little-known U.K.-based company to earning $485 million in profits on $1.3 billion in revenue in 2023. Its popularity unleashed a massive payday for Radvinsky, who debuted on this year's Forbes 400 list with an estimated net worth of $3.8 billion.

Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates has long ranked as either the richest or second-richest person on the annual Forbes 400 list, but even with his $107 billion fortune, he dropped to No. 9 this year, down from No. 6 a year ago. A major reason for his fall in the rankings is his 2021 divorce from Melinda French Gates, his wife of 27 years.

Less than 2,500 people live in the small town of Spruce Pine, North Carolina, but it's also home to several rare mines for ultra-pure quartz critical to semiconductor production. Operations have been shut down for more than five days due to impacts from Hurricane Helene, according to the News & Observer, but even when mines can reopen, extensive damage to surrounding roads and rail lines is expected to disrupt global supply chains.

In his latest feud with a government official, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has taken issue with the Federal Aviation Administration over launch date delays and fines related to alleged SpaceX violations, escalating to direct attacks on agency administrator Michael Whitaker. The dustup could preview how Musk might tackle government efficiency while working in a possible Trump Administration, an idea the former president has floated.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, faced off in a mostly polite yet policy-heavy vice presidential debate Tuesday night. But one of the more tense moments was a heated back-and-forth related to the false claims Vance spread about Haitian migrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, leading CBS News to cut Vance and Walz's mics.

MORE: Forbes recently looked at how the two candidates compare on assets like real estate, pensions, salaries and more. Vance's earnings from his bestseller Hillbilly Elegy helped him amass an estimated $10 million compared to former public school teacher Walz's wealth of about $1 million.

A massive dockworker strike that began Tuesday comes ahead of the holiday season and as policy makers look to turn the page on inflation, but experts are split on whether it will have a major impact on the economy. The strike could cost the U.S. economy between $3 billion and $4.5 billion daily, according to estimates from Jefferies and JPMorgan, but significant fallout would only occur if the strike lasts more than the ""base case"" of a ""few days,"" Bank of America analysts led by Nathan Gee noted.

TOPLINE Palantir, which builds software to help other businesses gather, manage and analyze their data, at first with secretive government agencies like the CIA and now also with commercial customers, had a banner year.

Palantir took off, with annual revenue increasing more than 20% over the last year to $2.5 billion, and it flipped the switch on profitability -- going from a net loss of $50 million in June 2023 to net income of $400 million a year later. The record year was capped by its addition to the S&P 500 in September.

The company's growth is in part because many of its data software products meshed with the wave of AI hype.

No surprise then that shares are up 134% over the past year, making Palantir the most expensive stock in the S&P in terms of revenue multiples -- more so even than chip design darling Nvidia. Palantir's meteoric rise has earned CEO Alex Karp a spot on The Forbes 400 list of richest Americans for the first time, worth an estimated $3.6 billion, thanks to his Palantir stake and $1 billion or so in cash from stock sales as of September 1, the day we finalized net worths for our list.

But should it be that expensive, trading at a market valuation that's 36 times its annual revenue? Analysts aren't sure: only five of the 20 that cover Palantir give the company a ""buy"" rating, with the remainder split between hold and sell ratings.

D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria drew a parallel between the company and Tesla and CEO Elon Musk, when the EV company was trading at all-time highs in 2021. ""Tesla for a very long period of time traded well above any valuation or comparable metric that you could point to. The reason was people were really excited about the mission and about the prospects.""

WHY IT MATTERS ""The Forbes 400, the definitive ranking of America's richest people, is important because enormous wealth comes with immense power, and the public should know who is doing what with their power,"" says Forbes reporter Phoebe Liu.

""As such, Karp's addition to The Forbes 400 and Palantir's too-high valuation show that what he and his company stand for -- Western values, American defense and artificial intelligence -- are especially relevant in today's economic, cultural and geopolitical landscape. It's worth watching what happens with the ever-controversial, ever-secretive (despite being publicly traded!) firm in the coming months and years.""

LGBTQ+ people who undergo ""conversion therapy"" are more likely to experience poor mental health than those who haven't, a new study found. While scientifically discredited, the practice is still prevalent in some states:

149: The number of participants studied who had experienced conversion therapy aimed at altering their sexual orientation

23: The number of states that ban conversion therapy for minors, including Washington D.C.

1,320: The number of conversion therapy practices across 48 states and Washington, D.C., according to 2023 research from the Trevor Project

A slew of new retirement rules and changes to tax law will affect almost everyone. For instance, starting in 2026, employees 50 and older who are deemed 'high-earning' will only be able to make catch-up contributions to an after-tax Roth account. And if you have money left over in a 529 college savings plan, a law went into effect this year allowing penalty-free rollovers from 529 plans to a Roth IRA.

"Female athletes 'blindsided' on volleyball court with trans player prompts civil rights complaint, lawsuit",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/female-athletes-blindsided-volleyball-court-trans-player-prompts-civil-rights-complaint-lawsuit,2024-10-02T11:14:00Z,"EXCLUSIVE: Concerned Women of America (CWA) is leading the charge to safeguard women's sports after an athlete on the San Jose State University (SJSU) women's volleyball team was identified as a transgender player.

Blaire Fleming's towering 6-foot-1 presence on the volleyball court has assisted SJSU's Division I volleyball team to remain undefeated on the court this season.

Macy Petty, a CWA legislative assistant and a NCAA volleyball athlete, shared with Fox News Digital the organization's efforts to raise awareness of transgender players' impact on women's sports.

""We want to protect the integrity of women's sports but also the safety of these female athletes,"" she said. ""Many of these schools were unaware that there was a male athlete on this team until this news article came out in April. We just want to make sure that these schools know exactly what is going on in this athletic program because the NCAA and SJSU had not previously given them the decency to even let them know what was happening.""

""Female athletes were put in this odd position of showing up on the court and looking at the other side and realizing that something was different about this game. I've never seen an athlete play like this before, which makes total sense considering that this athlete, first of all, is not female, but the net is seven inches shorter than it should be for male players.""

AS A FEMALE ATHLETE, I DO NOT CONSENT TO PLAYING ALONGSIDE MEN IN COLLEGIATE SPORTS

Petty said players feel ""blindsided"" because the governing body - the NCAA - of the league has not informed teams of the presence of transgender players on opposing teams.

""There's no informed consent for the schools or for the female athletes here. They're totally blindsided when they walk up to the court and they see that there's a male athlete on the other side.""

""This actually happened to me. I played college volleyball, and during my recruiting process, the same thing happened to me. I walked up to the court and, with all of the college scouts standing all around me, I looked at my competition, and it was a boy,"" she said. ""I thought this is obviously cheating, but I played anyway because I didn't have this time to sit and reflect and think about the decisions that I was making. It was just kind of upon me at that moment without any respect given to me about that decision.""

Petty said athletes are faced with having to ""choose between maybe a $100,000 educational scholarship or their own safety and dignity.""

""We're not going to jeopardize our female athletes, we're not going to jeopardize their safety and dignity.""

-- Macy Petty, Concerned Women for America

""And for a lot of girls, that's a burden that is just too much to bear,"" she said. ""We're asking these schools to be proactive on this issue and simply say if there is a boy on the other team, we're not going to play. We're not going to jeopardize our female athletes, we're not going to jeopardize their safety and dignity. We're simply not playing, we're not going to do this game and have to make our female athletes suffer that burden.""

The organization's concern prompted them to file a federal civil rights complaint alleging female discrimination and arguing that the California university allowed a male athlete to hold a female roster spot as well as a female athletic scholarship.

CWA also sent letters to schools competing against SJSU, informing them of the males' participation in the sport and the potential impact on their female athletes.

SWISS COURT TAKES TRANS CHILD AWAY FROM PARENTS OVER THEIR OBJECTIONS TO PUBERTY BLOCKERS

Fox News Digital exclusively obtained a copy of the letter the organization sent to Colorado State University informing it about Fleming's presence and about safety concerns.

""We just asked a couple of questions, like, if they knew that there was a boy athlete that they were going to be competing against. We also [asked] if they are willing to compromise the integrity of your program but also the safety of your female athletes by competing in this game, knowing that there is an increased risk of harm. What are you doing to be precautionary and make sure that this doesn't happen in the future?""

On Friday, Colorado State replied to the organization's inquiry, saying it was planning to host the university as planned on Oct. 3.

""And while we do appreciate that they responded to our inquiry, we do recognize that there have been two major developments since their response on Friday. First, Concerned Women for America did file this federal civil rights complaint against San Jose State. And also Boise State pulled out of their game - a conference game - against San Jose State.""

""We're hoping that Colorado State will reevaluate our questions knowing that this is a serious problem,"" she said.

Boise State University forfeited the game's match against SJSU on Sept. 28.

""Boise State volleyball will not play its scheduled match at San José State on Saturday, Sept. 28. Per Mountain West Conference policy, the Conference will record the match as a forfeit and a loss for Boise State. The Broncos will next compete on Oct. 3 against Air Force,"" Boise State said in a statement.

BOISE STATE WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL FORFEITS UPCOMING MATCH AGAINST SJSU AMID CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING TRANS PLAYER

Idaho Gov. Brad Little commended the move, saying it was ""working within the spirit"" of an executive order he signed ""defending women's sports.""

""I applaud Boise State for working within the spirit of my Executive Order, the Defending Women's Sports Act,"" Little wrote in an X post. ""We need to ensure player safety for all of our female athletes and continue the fight for fairness in women's sports.""

On Tuesday, the University of Wyoming followed suit, forfeiting the conference game against SJSU. The news came after CWA's college organization, Young Women for America, sent a letter to University of Wyoming President Edward Seidel and Director of Athletics Tom Burman.

""After a lengthy discussion, the University of Wyoming will not play its scheduled conference match against San José State University in the UniWyo Sports Complex on Saturday, Oct. 5. Per Mountain West Conference policy, the Conference will record the match as a forfeit and a loss for Wyoming,"" they wrote in a statement. ""The Cowgirls will host Fresno State on Thursday, Oct. 3 at 6:30 p.m. in the UniWyo Sports Complex.""

The latest reports on Fleming's impact on female sports comes as a lawsuit was filed in Georgia against the NCAA.

The lawsuit is headed by former University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines and includes SJSU volleyball player Brooke Slusser as a plaintiff.

In the lawsuit, Slusser, a Texas native who transferred to SJSU from the University of Alabama, said Fleming was a ""male who identifies as transgender and who claims a female identity.""

Slusser alleged that SJSU did not immediately tell her that Fleming is transgender, and the two roomed together on road trips. Slusser said she learned of her teammate's gender identity when she overheard a student call Fleming a ""guy.""

Fleming told Slusser in April 2024 that she was born male and considers herself to be transgender, according to the lawsuit.

Slusser said Fleming's spikes traveled more than 80 mph, ""which was faster than [Slusser] had ever seen a woman hit a volleyball."" Other members of the SJSU team were concerned about getting concussed by Fleming's spikes, the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit alleged that team members were instructed not to speak about Fleming's gender with people outside the team.

""Due to the NCAA's Transgender Eligibility Policies which permit Fleming to play on the SJSU women's volleyball team and which led to SJSU recruiting Fleming, giving Fleming a scholarship, and allowing Fleming to be in positions to violate Brooke's right to bodily privacy, Brooke has suffered physical and emotional injuries, embarrassment, humiliation, emotional distress, mental anguish and suffering,"" the lawsuit said.

Fox News Digital has reached out to San Jose State University for comment.

Slusser spoke to OutKick over the weekend about the lawsuit, saying she believed she was doing the right thing.

""It's crazy to say, but it was an easy decision for me to join because it's something I truly believe in,"" Slusser said. ""And it's been easy because all the support that I'm getting, 99% of it is just love and encouragement. So, for me, it shows that I made the right decision to join. This is something that so many people do care about. It's just that so many people are scared to talk about it."""
"WWE star Drew McIntyre says if company introduces mid-card women's title, it's 'absolutely justified'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/wwe-star-drew-mcintyre-says-company-introduces-mid-card-womens-title-its-absolutely-justified,2024-10-02T11:11:33Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The WWE women's division is as loaded as it has ever been, with Liv Morgan and Nia Jax holding singles titles and Jade Cargill and Bianca Belair holding tag-team gold.

With the number of talents on the roster, there has been an argument for more than a year about adding another championship to the mix for the mid-card competitors. The belt would be akin to what the men's roster has in the Intercontinental and United States Championships.

In fact, NXT introduced a similar belt in June with its North American Championship. Kelani Jordan won the title in a six-woman ladder match at Battleground.

Rumors have swirled for months about a mid-card belt coming to the main women's roster.

WWE star Drew McIntyre, who is getting ready for his own war with CM Punk inside a Hell in a Cell at Bad Blood this weekend, agreed that the circumstance is ""absolutely justified.""

""That's certainly something that's going to come around in the near future,"" McIntyre told Fox News Digital in a recent interview. ""And you don't just bring titles in for the sake of bringing titles (especially) if you don't have the adequate depth on the roster. But now, to watch just how far the women's revolution has come - the revolution is such a distant memory now. The women have been killing it for years now.""

McIntyre remembered when he first got onto the main WWE roster how the women's division was far from the way it is being treated now. Since the women's revolution within the company, female wrestlers have had top billing on several match cards. Ronda Rousey, Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair headlined WrestleMania 35 in 2019.

WWE RING COLLAPSES DURING LAST MONSTER STANDING MATCH

""And they got that opportunity years and years ago, and since then, we've had so many people come in, and it's gotten to a point where it's not a case of you want to be after any women's matches, you do not want to be after the women's match anymore because they're going to go out there, they're going to kill it, the crowed are going to be burnt out, and you're going to have to work really hard to get them,"" McIntyre added.

""To watch the talent pool grow, the roster depth grow, and the characters, more importantly, connect with the audience, because if they don't care about you, it doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman, nobody's emotionally attached to you. You might as well just sit in the back and not go out there. There's so many characters the women's division has gotten over now. We're at a point where if there's a second title introduced, it's absolutely justified.""

Zelina Vega told Fox News Digital last year she hoped a mid-card belt would come into the picture, saying it would be ""beneficial"" to have another title.

""We should have a mid-card belt for the ladies, almost like a television championship where it's not competing with the Women's NXT Championship, just to give someone else a little bit of a rub, a little bit of shine, as well as a little bit of something to work for because it always gonna be a while before you work your way to that big goal,"" he said."
Where America's Richest People Live: Forbes 400 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicahunter-hart/2024/10/02/where-americas-richest-people-live-forbes-400-2024/,2024-10-02T10:14:02Z,"Almost a quarter of all the wealth on The Forbes 400 is held by residents of one state. Two others tie for second for the first time ever.

alifornia is a symbol of wealth, famous for the luxuries of Hollywood and the riches of Silicon Valley. So it's perhaps no surprise that the world's fifth-largest economy is home to more of the 400 wealthiest people in the U.S. than any other state by far -- and has been for 34 years, since overtaking New York in 1991.

The Golden State is home to 83 members of this year's Forbes 400 list, four fewer than last year and nine fewer than a decade ago, but the state is still home to more than one out of five 400 members. As a group, these Californians are worth around triple the $489 billion the state's 92 members were worth a decade ago. But it's not the only hub for the three-comma club. Ranking behind California are New York and Florida, with 54 list members each, followed by Texas, with 43. Those four states are the most populous in the country, holding a third of all Americans -- but nearly 60% of the richest ones. The combined fortune of their 234 billionaires totals $3.3 trillion.

California's days at the top may be numbered. Florida's rise continues; the Sunshine State has eight more Forbes 400 members this year -- enough to tie the Empire State for the first time. Some of the recent gains are due to folks leaving their higher-tax hometowns for Florida's lower rates, like former Seattle resident Jeff Bezos and onetime Chicagoan Ken Griffin. Five New Yorkers have moved to Florida in the past decade. Those transplants include the state's most famous resident, Donald Trump, who returns to the 400 list this year thanks to Trump Media & Technology Group, the social media company he took public in March. New York, meanwhile, has eight fewer 400 members than last year as the state's richest couldn't keep up. Among the drop-offs: Wesley Edens and Richard LeFrak.

A handful of states have only one Forbes 400 member, including Maine (Susan Alfond), Oregon (Phil Knight) and Kentucky (Tamara Gustavson). Ten states aren't represented at all on the 400, including Alabama, Minnesota and Vermont. It was harder than ever to make the list this year due to a record-high cutoff of $3.3 billion, up from last year's $2.9 billion and eons away from the median American family's net worth of $192,900, per the U.S. Federal Reserve. That was enough to bump Mississippi off the map as its richest residents, James and Thomas Duff, though richer than last year, barely missed the cut with net worths of roughly $3.25 billion each.

Net worths are as of September 1, 2024

Ernest Garcia II, the largest shareholder of online used car sales platform Carvana and Arizona's richest resident, wasn't born in the Grand Canyon State, but his ties there stretch back decades. He attended the University of Arizona and developed real estate in Phoenix in the 1980s (a job that later brought him a criminal fraud conviction, thanks to his small role in the scandal surrounding the collapse of one of his lenders, Lincoln Savings & Loan). Other prominent Arizona listees include U-Haul heir Mark Shoen ($5.2 billion) and Arturo Moreno ($5 billion), who owns the L.A. Angels baseball team in neighboring California.

Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based mutual fund behemoth, is responsible for three members of The Forbes 400: CEO Abigail Johnson, the state's wealthiest resident and America's sixth-richest woman, and her siblings Edward and Elizabeth Johnson. Their family frequently donates to Boston-area charities and to Harvard, where Johnson got an MBA. Other prominent Bay State listees include telecom billionaire and Massachusetts philanthropist Robert Hale Jr. ($5.8 billion) and Robert Kraft ($11.8 billion), who found fortune in paper and packaging, and fame as the owner of the NFL's New England Patriots.

S. Truett Cathy (d. 2014) founded Chick-fil-A in an Atlanta area mall in 1967; it's now spread to 48 states and his three children are Georgia's richest residents. The Peach State is also home to Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank ($8.9 billion), private equity mogul and 400 newcomer Neal Aronson ($4.1 billion) and two more notable heirs: Gary Rollins ($6.8 billion), who chairs the pest control company his family founded in 1948, Rollins, Inc.; and Jim Kennedy ($6.6 billion), who chairs the media and automotive conglomerate his grandfather founded in 1898, Cox Enterprises.

The Silver State's highest roller hails, fittingly, from the Las Vegas Strip: Miriam Adelson, whose fortune comes from the Las Vegas Sands casino company that her late husband founded in 1988. Two other Nevada listees who hail from the gaming industry are brothers Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta, the UFC cofounders who also inherited their father's casino business Red Rock Resorts in 1993 and took it public in 2016. The state also boasts fortunes in sectors like aerospace-defense (Sierra Nevada Corp.'s Eren and Fatih Ozmen, $4 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively) and fast food (Panda Express' Andrew and Peggy Cherng, $3.7 billion each).

The richest Pennsylvanians are together worth $126 billion, roughly equal to the Keystone State's total annual government spending. Wealthiest resident Jeff Yass cofounded trading firm Susquehanna International Group, headquartered on the Main Line. It owns an estimated 15% of TikTok parent company ByteDance. Yass is a Republican megadonor who often opens his wallet for state and local elections, everything from county judicial races to Philly's city council election. His Susquehanna cofounder Arthur Dantchik ($12.3 billion) is also a Pennsylvania resident on The Forbes 400 list, as is Victoria Mars ($11.9 billion), heir to the Mars candy and pet food empire, and Jeffrey Lurie ($5.3 billion), owner of the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles.

Chicago is home to the youngest member of The Forbes 400, Lukas Walton, who is one of the eight grandchildren of Walmart cofounder Sam Walton. Aged 38, he's one of two listees under 40 (the other being New York-based venture capitalist Josh Kushner). Several list members from the Hyatt hotel brand's Pritzker family are also breezing around the Windy City, including J.B. Pritzker ($3.7 billion), the state's billionaire governor. Others in Illinois made their riches through industries like meat processing (Steve Lavin, $5.4 billion, and Joseph Grendys, $4.2 billion) and finance (Byron Trott, $3.7 billion, and Mark Walter, $6 billion).

Musk -- the richest person in the U.S. for the third year in a row -- is all-in on the Lone Star State, announcing this year that he's moving his companies SpaceX and X there from California. Texas is increasingly seen as a swing state, but Musk made his own political allegiances clear in July when he endorsed Donald Trump for president in a post on X. Texas produces more oil and natural gas than any other state, so perhaps unsurprisingly, nearly a third of its listees made their fortunes in energy, including Randa Duncan Williams ($8.6 billion; Enterprise Products Partners) and Kelcy Warren ($6.7 billion; Energy Transfer).

The Sunshine State keeps attracting big wealth. When Bezos recently relocated from Washington state, he spent $234 million on three homes on Indian Creek, the gated man-made island in Miami Beach dubbed the ""Billionaire Bunker."" Nearly 30% of Florida's listees made their fortunes in finance and investments, including the second-richest Floridian, Ken Griffin ($43 billion), who made headlines in 2022 for moving his family and the headquarters of his hedge fund Citadel there from Chicago. The second-most common industry that enriched the wealthiest Floridians is food and beverage, from which hails Subway's Elisabeth DeLuca ($8.6 billion) and LaCroix sparkling water's Nick Caporella ($4.1 billion).

The world's financial capital is still a finance billionaire hub. Nearly two-thirds of the Empire State's listees made their fortunes in the sector, including Michael Bloomberg, the former NYC mayor who started his career on Wall Street in 1966 at the investment bank Salomon Brothers, then made billions through financial information and media company Bloomberg LP. The state's second-richest resident, Julia Koch ($74.2 billion), is originally from Iowa and owes her fortune to Kansas-based conglomerate Koch, Inc., but has lived in the Big Apple for four decades. In June, she and her children bought a 15% stake in the NBA's Brooklyn Nets and WNBA's New York Liberty for nearly $700 million. Other notable New Yorkers on The Forbes 400 include George Soros ($7.2 billion), Ralph Lauren ($9.4 billion) and Bill Ackman ($9.1 billion).

Hollywood and Silicon Valley have made many Californians rich, but none more than Mark Zuckerberg, who officially resides in Palo Alto, though these days spends plenty of time at his 1,450-acre compound in Kauai, Hawaii. Nearly half of California's Forbes 400 wealth stems from tech moguls like Zuckerberg, including Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin ($136 billion and $130 billion, respectively), Nvidia's Jensen Huang ($104 billion) and Broadcom's Henry Samueli ($16.9 billion). But entertainment moguls like David Geffen ($8.5 billion) and Steven Spielberg ($5.3 billion) also call the Golden State home, as do real estate barons such as Donald Bren ($18.9 billion) and Edward Roski Jr ($7.8 billion), and private equity moguls like KKR cofounder George Roberts ($15.5 billion) and Jim Coulter ($4.9 billion)."
Wife Of Chinese AI Giant SenseTime's Late Cofounder Becomes A Billionaire,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2024/10/02/wife-of-chinese-ai-giant-sensetimes-late-cofounder-becomes-a-billionaire/,2024-10-02T09:36:48Z,"Yang Qiumei, 59, a managing director and advisor to the CEO at the Hong Kong stock exchange, inherited a $1.6 billion stake in SenseTime from Tang Xiao'ou.

Yang Qiumei, the widow of SenseTime cofounder Tang Xiao'ou, has inherited his stake in the Chinese artificial intelligence giant, according to a stock exchange filing. The stake is worth $1.6 billion as of Wednesday's close, Forbes estimates, and propels Yang, 59, to become the latest woman to join Hong Kong's three-comma club.

Yang inherited an almost 20% ownership in SenseTime through Amind, the personal holding company of her late husband and the largest shareholder of SenseTime, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing in August. Tang died in December at age 55 from an unspecified illness. He was survived by Yang and their son.

At the time of his death, Tang had an estimated net worth of $1.1 billion. He debuted on the Hong Kong's 50 Richest list in 2022, a few months after SenseTime went public in a $740 million initial public offering in Hong Kong in December 2021.

Tang cofounded SenseTime in 2014 and grew it into one of the largest Chinese AI software company from a base in Hong Kong, providing technologies for applications ranging from facial recognition, content generation to autonomous driving.

Yang doesn't hold any position at SenseTime. She is currently a managing director and advisor to the CEO at Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing since joining the stock exchange operator in 2022, overseeing its mainland China subsidiaries and activities of its highest-ranking executive. She was most recently the Asia Pacific CEO of Investment Company Institute, an industry association of investment funds, and had previously served as the deputy director general of the China Securities Regulatory Commission's investment fund supervision department. SenseTime didn't immediately respond to a comment request on Yang's fortune.

Coming from a humble background, Yang had to collect cinders to support her family when she was young, according to an interview she gave to state-backed financial publication China Fund in 2014. She eventually earned herself a place at China's Peking University, where she received bachelor's and master's degrees in economics, and went on to earn a Ph.D. from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the U.S.

After graduation, Yang spent a brief time teaching in Latvia before joining the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris, according to the China Fund article. Yang returned to China in 2000 to join the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and started her journey in the finance world.

Over the past year, SenseTime's shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange surged more than 35% as the company became one of China's brightest hopes for its plan to take the lead in the AI field. After joining Chinese tech giants like Baidu in the AI race last year, SenseTime in July launched an upgraded large language model that it claims to be on par with OpenAI's most recent GPT-4o model in multiple capacities.

Yang is the latest woman to join Hong Kong's three-comma club. Forbes' Hong Kong's 50 Richest list in 2024 featured seven women: Kwong Siu-hing, the widow of Sun Hung Kai Properties cofounder Kwok Tak-seng; Lam Wai-ying, cofounder of smartphone screen maker Biel Crystal who shares the wealth with her husband Yeung Kin-man; Pansy Ho, chairman of property developer Shun Tak Holdings; Rita Tong Liu, chairman of property developer Gale Well Group; Chan Tan Ching-fen, the wife of Hang Lung Properties' late founder Chan Tseng-hsi; Angela Leong, co-chairman of casino operator SJM Holdings; and Solina Chau, cofounder of venture capital firm Horizons Ventures and the longtime companion of Hong Kong wealthiest person Li Ka-shing."
Divers find 130-year-old shipwreck with intriguing past hidden in Lake Michigan,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/divers-find-130-year-old-shipwreck-intriguing-past-hidden-lake-michigan,2024-10-02T09:09:32Z,"John Evenson, a tugboat that sank in 1895, was recently discovered by a team of maritime experts. It was found in Lake Michigan. (Source: Wisconsin Historical Society)

A long-lost shipwreck hidden in the depths of Lake Michigan has recently been discovered by a team of maritime experts -- nearly 130 years after it sank.

The Wisconsin Historical Society (WHS) announced the discovery of the John Evenson, a tugboat built in 1884, in a Facebook post on Sept. 20. The vessel sank during an ill-fated trip in June 1895.

The WHS told Fox News Digital on Saturday that two maritime historians named Brendon Baillod and Robert Jaeck had initially discovered the shipwreck.

The two used historical newspaper accounts and sonar images that eventually led them to the shipwreck, which sat 42 feet below the surface.

WOMAN OUT FOR WALK STUMBLES UPON ONCE-IN-A-DECADE DISCOVERY

Before becoming a shipwreck itself, the John Evenson was used to locate and salvage wrecked ships, in addition to towing other vessels and breaking ice.

""The ship was not a cargo ship, it was actually a tugboat,"" maritime archaeologist Tamara Thomsen explained. ""It would have been used to tow vessels into Sturgeon Bay, break ice or assist stranded ships.""

The WHS explained that on the fateful day, the ship was sailing after receiving some repairs when its captain ""thought it would be more profitable for the tug to return to work.""

EXPERTS STUNNED AFTER CORPSE OF MEDIEVAL CATHOLIC SAINT IS UNCOVERED, FOUND IN REMARKABLE CONDITION

""They waited outside the Sturgeon Bay Ship canal for the next vessel that required a tow into the canal,"" the WHS described. ""The steambarge I. Watson Stephenson with two barges in tow signaled for a tug.""

""The John Evenson ran out to the ship, and while attempting to take the line, crossed the Stephenson's bow. The Stephenson was traveling fast and hit the Evenson's stern, which swung the tug across its bow flipping it over.""

The John Evenson sank in a mere three minutes. The tugboat only carried five people in total, and four of the crew members were able to escape.

Only one person was killed, the ship's engineer -- and his remains were found not long after.

""He washed ashore about a month later, so his remains are not associated with the site,"" Thomsen told Fox News Digital.

The recent discovery is not the first time that divers have searched for the ruined ship. The ship's owners once tried to find it, but they abandoned their mission for insurance purposes.

""[The owners] vowed to raise and salvage their former tugboat, but they quickly ran into trouble,"" the WHS explained in its Facebook post. ""They had surrendered the ship as a total loss and already received the insurance payout. If the Laurie Brothers raised the tug, the insurance underwriters could claim ownership.""

Top 5 clashes between Vance and Walz during debate showdown: 'Your mics are cut',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-5-clashes-between-vance-walz-during-debate-showdown-your-mics-cut,2024-10-02T08:11:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance took the same stage for their first and only vice presidential debate this election cycle on Tuesday evening, when the pair had a handful of fiery clashes over top voter concerns.

The CBS News Vice Presidential Debate showcased the two vice presidential candidates' platforms on issues such as the ongoing war raging in the Middle East, abortion laws and their respective tickets' economic records. Amid the 90-minute debate, Vance and Walz had a handful of clashes, including moderators turning off Vance's microphone.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

The CBS debate's rules included leaving microphones on for both candidates no matter who was speaking, breaking from the two presidential debates this cycle that muted microphones when a candidate was not speaking. The outlet, however, reserved the right to turn the microphones off if they felt it was warranted.

Moderators Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell did mute the pair Tuesday when Vance spoke up to complain that the moderators were trying to fact-check him on his remarks regarding illegal immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.

""The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border. It is a disgrace,"" Vance said referring to about immigration issues in a city in his home state.

After Vance and Walz both delivered responses regarding immigration, Brennan told viewers that Springfield ""does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status.""

Vance took issues with the on-air ""fact-check"" before he was muted.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS ADMITS FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP WAS BECAUSE CNN LET HIS STATEMENTS 'HANG' AT FIRST DEBATE

""The rules were that you were not going to fact-check, and since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" Vance said. ""So there's an application called the CBP. One app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand. That is not a person coming in. Applying for a green card and waiting for ten years.""

Moderators tried to quiet Vance before cutting his and Walz's mics.

""Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Margaret Brennan said. ""We have so much we want to get to.""

Walz was forced to answer questions regarding his travel to China during Tuesday night's debate.

Walz has said he was in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets, however, are now reporting that Walz actually did not travel to China until August of that year.

CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan asked Walz to explain the discrepancy.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""Look, I grew up in a small rural Nebraska town, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service,"" a visibly shaky Walz said. ""I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher.""

""I came back home and then started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams. We would take baseball teams. We would take dancers. And we would go back and forth to China,"" Walz said, noting the trips were ""to try and learn.""

""Look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community, and I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect,"" Walz continued.

""And I'm a knucklehead at times.""

Brennan pushed back, reminding Walz of the question and again asking him to explain the discrepancy.

""All I said on this was, as I got there that summer and misspoke on this,"" Walz said. ""So, I will just -- that's what I've said. So, I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests, went in and, from that, I learned a lot of what needed to be in in governance.""

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Walz claimed during the debate that a woman in Georgia likely died due to the state's ""restrictive"" abortion laws after Roe v. Wade was overturned, sparking a clash with Vance.

""There's a young woman named Amber Thurman. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurmond died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights, as basic as the right to control your own body, is determined on geography,"" Walz said during the debate while sparring with Vance on abortion laws.

""There's a very real chance that if Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe v. Wade,"" he said.

Walz's remarks come after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits after the women received chemically induced abortions in 2022.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

Vance shot back that a Minnesota abortion law does not require doctors to save a baby who survives an abortion.

""First of all, governor, I agree with you, Amber Thurman should still be alive, and there are a lot of people who should still be alive. And I certainly wish that she was. And maybe you're free to disagree with me on this and explain this to me. But as I read the Minnesota law that you signed into law, the statute that you signed into law, it says that a doctor who presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide lifesaving care to a baby who survives a botched late term abortion,"" he said.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

""That's not true,"" Walz said.

""Choice or not option that is fundamentally barbaric,"" Vance continued.

The pair also sparred over immigration a handful of times throughout the debate, including Vance slamming Vice President Kamala Harris for her handling of immigration.

""First of all, the gross majority of what we need to do to the southern border is just empowering law enforcement to do their job,"" Vance said during a discussion on the Haitian migrant surge in Springfield, Ohio, and immigration overall.

""I've been to the southern border more than our 'border czar' Kamala Harris has been. And it's actually heartbreaking because the Border Patrol agents, they just want to be empowered to do their job.""

Vance continued by saying that, ""of course, additional resources would help,"" but that the issue is mostly about the Biden administration not empowering law enforcement to say ""if you try to come across the border illegally, you've got to stay in Mexico"" and ""go back through proper channels.""

VANCE RIPS WALZ ON ECONOMY, SAYS HE'S FORCED TO 'PRETEND' TRUMP DIDN'T LOWER INFLATION

""Now, Gov. Walz brought up the community of Springfield, and he's very worried about the things that I've said in Springfield,"" Vance said. ""Look, in Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed. You've got hospitals that are overwhelmed. You've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.

Walz repeatedly argued Trump shut down a Senate immigration bill earlier this year that he believes would have made strengthened border security.

""It is law enforcement that asked for the bill,"" Walz said. ""They helped craft it. They're the ones that supported it. It was because they know we need to do this. Look, this issue of continuing to bring this up, of not dealing with it, of blaming migrants for everything.

""On housing, we could talk a little bit about Wall Street speculators buying up housing and making them less affordable, but it becomes a blame. Look, this bill also gives the money necessary to adjudicate. I agree it should not take seven years for an asylum claim to be done.""

""This bill gets it done in 90 days. Then, you start to make a difference in this, and you start to adhere to what we know, American principles. I don't talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about to the least amongst us, you do unto me. I think that's true of most Americans. They simply want order to it. This bill does it. It's funded. It's supported by the people who do it, and it lets us keep our dignity about how we treat other people.""

The pair of vice presidential candidates also sparred over the threat of censorship on Tuesday, as Walz pressed Vance on the 2020 election and Jan. 6, 2021.

""It's really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th, as we have done for 250 years in this country. We are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election,"" Vance said after Walz cited Jan. 6, when Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol.

""We have to remember that for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections. Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time, and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board. But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had, I don't buy that, governor,"" Vance continued.

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

Walz countered that ""Jan. 6 was not Facebook ads.""

""This idea that there's censorship to stop people from doing, threatening to kill someone, threatening to do something, that's not that's not censorship. Censorship is book banning. We've seen that. We've seen that brought up,"" he continued.

Walz continued that Trump has repeatedly claimed he won the 2020 presidential election.

""Did he lose the 2020 election?"" Walz asked Vance of Trump during the last election cycle.

""Tim, I'm focused on the future,"" Vance replied. ""Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 Covid situation?""

""That is a damning non-answer,"" Walz said. ""I'm pretty shocked by this. He lost the election. This is not a debate, it's not anything anywhere other than in Donald Trump's world.""

""It's a damning non-answer for you to not talk about censorship,"" Vance shot back.

New Jersey Democrat proposes bill to create travel advisories to inform pregnant women of state abortion laws,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-jersey-democrat-proposes-bill-create-travel-advisories-inform-pregnant-women-state-abortion-laws,2024-10-02T07:37:38Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

A New Jersey Democrat introduced legislation establishing travel advisories informing women of restrictive abortion laws in other states they may be visiting.

The bill, proposed by state Sen. John Burzichelli, would require New Jersey's health and state departments to launch a website that would list color codes for states depending on how restrictive their abortion laws are, according to NJ Spotlight News.

""If you're an individual, a woman, traveling across this country for business -- or if you're thinking about going to school in Mississippi [for instance] -- it will help you to know what kind of medical services are available to you should you need emergency care of some kind,"" Burzichelli told the outlet.

The color codes under the ""Reproductive Health Travel Advisory"" are blue, yellow and red.

GEORGIA JUDGE OVERTURNS STATE'S SIX-WEEK 'HEARTBEAT' ABORTION LAW, CALLS IT 'UNCONSTITUTIONAL'

Blue would mean women can exercise normal caution and access to abortion would be available without fear of civil or criminal prosecution, and yellow would mean women should exercise increased caution as abortion restrictions could result in civil or criminal prosecution. Red would mean women are urged to reconsider travel because abortion access is extremely restricted and could result in medical issues and civil or criminal prosecution.

""Right now, there's no single place to go to say, 'OK I have to travel. I have to go to Texas and then move over and go to Tennessee,'"" Burzichelli said. ""You don't have that info at your fingertips. You can find it, but it's a hodge-podge.""

""You, as an American female, do not have equal rights across all 50 states,"" he added. ""And it's important for you to know what rights you don't have when you go somewhere, because something unexpected could happen.""

JUDGE BLOCKS NY AG LETITIA JAMES FROM TRYING TO SILENCE PREGNANCY CENTERS THAT PROMOTE ABORTION PILL REVERSAL

The proposal comes after the U.S. Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in 2022, returning the power to make laws on abortion access back to the states.

Following the ruling, a number of Republican-controlled states enacted laws restricting abortion access, with some exceptions such as in cases of medical emergencies, while some Democrat-controlled states have approved advanced protections of abortion access.

""It's hard to imagine we're even talking about this in 2024 in America,"" Burzichelli said. ""To think that we have to think about even doing this just speaks volumes about where we are at the moment,""

New Jersey expanded access to abortion, enacting statutory protection for abortion as a fundamental right, and the state's highest court ruled the ""fundamental right of a woman to control her body and destiny"" is protected under the state's constitution, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights.

The state also welcomes women who travel from other states for an abortion because their own states have bans in place. Additionally, the Garden State protects them from being extradited after the procedure."
A Texas man is executed for fatally stabbing twin teenage girls in 1989,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5136517/texas-man-executed-fatally-stabbing-twins-1989,2024-10-02T05:39:21Z,"HUNTSVILLE, Texas -- A Texas man convicted of fatally stabbing twin 16-year-old girls more than three decades ago was executed on Tuesday evening.

Garcia Glenn White was pronounced dead at 6:56 p.m. CDT following a chemical injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville. He was condemned for the December 1989 killings of Annette and Bernette Edwards. The bodies of the twin girls and their mother, Bonita Edwards, were found in their Houston apartment.

White, 61, was the sixth inmate put to death in the U.S. in the last 11 days. His execution took place shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court, without comment, rejected three last-ditch appeals.

Asked by a warden if he had any statement, White repeatedly apologized in his final words to witnesses looking on.

""I would like to apologize for all the wrong I have done, and for the pain I've caused,"" he said from the death chamber, shortly before the lethal dose of the sedative pentobarbital began flowing into his arms.

He said he took responsibility for the slayings, regretted his actions and was praying for prison officials, officers and ""for my brothers and sisters behind these walls.""

In a loud and strong voice he began singing a hymn, ""I Trust in God,"" singing several verses with the refrain: ""I trust in God, my savior of the world, the one who never failed."" Then he urged family and friends to to ""just keep pushing forward, keep loving one another,"" and ended by thanking prison officials and officers ""for treating us like human beings.""

As the drugs began taking effect, he exhaled softly several times then began sounds like snores, several of them loud. He burped, snored quietly once and gulped. Seventeen minutes later he was pronounced dead.

Testimony showed that White went to the girls' Houston home to smoke crack with their mother, Bonita, who also was fatally stabbed. When the girls came out of their room to see what happened, White attacked them. Evidence showed White broke down the locked door of the girls' bedroom. Authorities said he was later tied to the deaths of a grocery store owner and another woman.

Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg, who witnessed White's death, lamented that it took some 30 years to carry out the jury's death verdict as multiple appeals in White's case worked through the courts.

""The suffering of surviving (victims') family members is just unspeakable,"" she said. ""At least it's over.""

White's lawyers had unsuccessfully appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the execution after lower courts previously rejected petitions for a stay. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Friday denied White's request to commute his death sentence to a lesser penalty or to grant him a 30-day reprieve.

His lawyers argued that Texas' top criminal appeals court has refused ""to accept medical evidence and strong factual backing"" showing White is intellectually disabled.

The Supreme Court in 2002 barred the execution of intellectually disabled people. But it has given states some discretion in deciding how to determine such disabilities. Justices have wrestled with how much discretion to allow.

White's lawyers also accused the Texas appeals court of not allowing his defense team to present evidence that could spare him a death sentence, including DNA evidence that another man also was at the crime scene and scientific evidence that would show White was ""likely suffering from a cocaine induced psychotic break during his actions.""

White's lawyers also argued he is entitled to a new review of his death sentence, alleging the Texas appeals court has created a new scheme for sentencing in capital punishment cases after a recent Supreme Court ruling in another Texas death row case.

Patrick McCann, one of White's attorneys, said Tuesday that his client has spent his entire time in prison ""working to be a better human being.""

The deaths of the twin girls and their mother went unsolved for about six years until White confessed to the killings after he was arrested in connection with the July 1995 death of grocery store owner Hai Van Pham, who was fatally beaten during a robbery at his business. Police said White also confessed to fatally beating another woman, Greta Williams, in 1989."
Walz repeats Georgia abortion death falsehood decried by doctors as 'fearmongering',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/walz-repeats-georgia-abortion-death-falsehood-decried-doctors-fearmongering,2024-10-02T03:19:45Z,"Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., discusses abortion access during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz claimed during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate that a woman in Georgia likely died due to the state's ""restrictive"" abortion laws following the overturning of Roe, despite doctors previously denouncing such a narrative as ""fearmongering.""

""There's a young woman named Amber Thurman. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurmond died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights, as basic as the right to control your own body, is determined on geography,"" Walz said during the debate while sparring with Vance on abortion laws.

""There's a very real chance that if Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe versus Wade,"" he said.

Walz joined Ohio Sen. JD Vance in New York City on Tuesday evening where the pair squared off on key voter issues this election cycle, including the economy, immigration and abortion.

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Walz's remarks come after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits after the women received chemically induced abortions in 2022. Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

Members of the Democratic Party, including Vice President Kamala Harris, have cited their deaths as evidence for the need to expand abortion access following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.

""Good policy, logical policy, moral policy, humane policy is about saying a healthcare provider will only start providing that care when you're about to die?"" Harris said during an Atlanta campaign event last month, while citing Thurman's death.

OB-GYNs have since criticized the narrative as a misleading story that is being pushed by the media and Democrats.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

""I was not surprised to see this pro-abortion media try to point the blame at Georgia's pro-life laws, but, in fact, Georgia's laws allow doctors to intervene to save the life of the woman,"" Charlotte Lozier Institute Vice President and Director of Medical Affairs Dr. Ingrid Skop recently told Fox News Digital.

""I think the focus of the Democratic Party upon abortion as an issue is only because the American people do not understand the laws. Many times, women are hurt by abortions. It is not necessary for women to live their best life. And, of course, it's the fearmongering and lies that have led us to this place where we are today, where people even think there would be a reason to point at the law.""

Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., and state Rep. Mark Newton have also come out to say they don't believe Georgia laws had anything to do with Thurman's death, but was instead caused by alleged complications from abortion pills, as doctors may have waited too long to intercede.

HARRIS CALLS FOR ELIMINATING FILIBUSTER TO PASS 'ROE' ABORTION BILL INTO FEDERAL LAW

""We never deny a woman an abortion because it's going to harm her in some way. She will always be protected,"" McCormick said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital.

""You have every right to an abortion, even with that heartbeat law,"" he continued. ""So, let's make that very clear right now. When they say there's no exceptions, there's never any law in any state where there's no exceptions. That doesn't exist. That's simply not the way it works. The mother's life is always protected. With that said, it doesn't mean it's easy to get an abortion just because you have a complication or because something goes wrong.""

Vance doubled down on his claims, insisting on CNN that constituents reported to his office directly that their pets were being taken and eaten and accusing the media of downplaying the incidents. Vance has acknowledged the incidents might not be true, but has said they're indicative of a broader problem with the Biden administration's immigration policies: ""If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do,"" Vance said.

Both Springfield Mayor Rob Rue and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine rejected the claims in interviews in the days after Vance and Trump made the false allegations, which led to a series of threats against city officials and facilities, including a bomb threat that forced city hall to close and schools to evacuate. The bomb threat was one of 33 Springfield received in the weeks after Trump and Vance amplified the false rumors. The claim appeared to originate from a post in a Springfield Facebook group, according to the Springfield News-Sun, which reported that some viral posts in the Facebook group erroneously linked Springfield to an incident in August in Canton, Ohio, in which a woman was arrested and charged with killing and eating a cat.

A Haitian advocacy group, the Haitian Bridge Alliance, filed private criminal charges last month against Trump and Vance, asking a judge to order their arrest for allegedly disrupting public services and making false alarms for repeating the claims.

"Jelly Roll was 'so nervous' at the CMAs, the singer shattered his award",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jelly-roll-broke-his-cma-award-after-winning-new-artist-year,2024-10-02T01:26:59Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Jelly Roll's CMA award was beautifully broken, just like his new album of the same name.

The country music star, 39, told Jimmy Fallon Monday night about how, after becoming one of the oldest people to ever win new artist of the year at the awards show in Nashville last year, he immediately ""fumbled"" the glass award.

Fallon then played a clip of the sound of shattering glass during a live local broadcast from backstage at the show.

""Oh goodness, Jelly Roll just broke his award,"" WKRN-TV reporter Stephanie Langston can be heard telling another reporter. ""Yeah, he's still standing there. I'm pretty sure it's his award. He just dropped it on the floor.""

COUNTRY MUSIC STAR JELLY ROLL BELIEVES 'GOD HAD A BIGGER PURPOSE' FOR HIM

""First of all, when it first dropped, you could've heard a mouse pee on cotton,"" Jelly Roll told Fallon. ""I mean, it was dead silent, and right after you could've heard a cricket fart, you heard a bunch of people go 'Aww.'""

He explained that the weight of the award and his sweaty palms likely played a role in the unfortunate incident.

""I was just so excited and so nervous that I had the sweatiest, shakiest palms,"" he said. ""And that thing is -- I'm already not a physically fit man -- and that thing's heavy. That thing was really heavy.

""And I was so excited, and I was going to change it from one hand to the other to shake somebody's hand, and it just boomed,"" he said. ""And I was like -- this is the story of my life though, Jimmy. I finally get my life together. I win the biggest award -- best new artist -- I was one of the oldest people to ever win it. I was 39 years old. I gave a passionate speech, and then I came backstage and fumbled the ball. Just fumbled the ball!""

""No, no, be you. Never stop being you, though,"" Fallon replied.

Jelly Roll added that he ""campaigned"" for the awards show to let him keep the broken one instead of getting a new one.

""I was like, 'I think it fits me great. I'll just duct tape it together,'"" he told Fallon.

The shattered award reportedly was just a generic one though.

A CMA official told The Tennessean last year the award hadn't been engraved yet because the winners weren't known beforehand.

Jelly Roll also described a concert during his struggling artist days that only five people showed up for, leading him to invite all the attendees to party in his van.

""It was a night we played outside of Sacramento, California, in Orangeville, little place called The Boardwalk,"" he explained.

""I pulled up, there was five people, and I felt so bad for the door guy, sound guy and the concessions guy. They were all the same person. And I felt so bad for him that I was like, 'Don't even open the door.' And I brought all five people in my RV.""

He told Fallon to imagine a ""1975 Cheech and Chong RV.""

""There was smoke coming out of the hood. There was smoke coming out of the inside,"" he said of his old RV. ""It smelled like Willie Nelson and cheap beer. It was all bad, man. I actually just brought all five onto the crappy RV and we just partaked in a peaceful pipe together. And I just told them I was sorry I couldn't perform.""

He explained that he canceled the show because he felt bad for the one guy working the show ""because, at that point, we needed to put two of the five people that bought a ticket to help him. He was doing three jobs.""

Telling Fallon how he turned around his life after dozens of arrests in his teens and 20s, the 39-year-old said, ""As cliché as it may sound, [the answer] is faith, finding love. It softened my heart. I fell in love with a woman and got married. I had a daughter. It changed my whole life. She's 16 now, so that's getting interesting, but it's still really good.

""And it just made me want to be a good father and a better human. And I knew I was just a crappy person for so long, man. I just destroyed. I was just a bad human, and now I'm trying to turn that around. I'm a totally different guy, man. It's awesome.""

He also talked about how he came up with the title for his new album and tour, ""Beautifully Broken.""

""I think that we're all a little broken, but I think it's finding beauty in that,"" he said. ""And we use kintsugi for the idea that they do in Japan that if something is worth saving when it breaks, that they bring it back together with gold and they polish it. That's kind of our message, man, is everybody's worth saving."""

The University of Wyoming women's volleyball team became the third in the nation to forfeit a game to San Jose State this season.

Wyoming joined Boise State and Southern Utah, all of which did not give a specific reason for the forfeit.

""After a lengthy discussion, the University of Wyoming will not play its scheduled conference match against San Jose State University,"" the volleyball program said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Per Mountain West Conference policy, the conference will record the match as a forfeit and a loss for Wyoming.""

Blaire Fleming, a transgender female, competes on San Jose State's team. Fleming is a redshirt junior at San Jose State University, who plays as an outside and right-side hitter and played two seasons at SJSU after previously playing at Coastal Carolina.

San Jose State responded in a statement to OutKick on Tuesday.

""It is disappointing that our SJSU student athletes, who are in full compliance with NCAA and Mountain West rules and regulations, are being denied opportunities to compete. We are committed to supporting our student-athletes through these challenges and in their ability to compete in an inclusive, fair, safe and respectful environment,"" the statement read.

Brooke Slusser, a member of San Jose's women's volleyball team, joined 18 other athletes in suing the NCAA over its current gender identity policies. The lawsuit alleged Slusser, who transferred to San Jose, felt concerned for her safety after realizing one of her new teammates was transgender.

Slusser claimed she was not aware that Fleming was transgender despite sharing rooms together on team trips, per the court documents. Slusser also expressed safety concerns for opponents playing against Fleming.

""Brooke estimates that Fleming's spikes were traveling upward of 80 mph, which was faster than she had ever seen a woman hit a volleyball,"" Slusser's complaint read. ""The girls were doing everything they could to dodge Fleming's spikes but still could not fully protect themselves.""

Former NCAA swimmer Riley Gaines, who is also engaged in a lawsuit against the NCAA for having to compete and share a locker room with transgender biological male opponent Lia Thomas, commended Boise State as the second program to refuse to compete against San Jose State in a statement to Fox News Digital on Sept. 27.

""I commend Boise State's athletic department and everyone involved in the decision to forfeit their match against undefeated San Jose State,"" Gaines said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

GOP GOVERNOR REVEALS WHY HE ORDERED SCHOOLS TO BAR TRANSGENDERS FROM GIRLS SPORTS

""Some principles transcend winning on the court, and the safety and well-being of female athletes is one of them. It's encouraging to witness a growing number of institutions prioritizing fairness and athlete safety over forced inclusion. I hope to see more universities follow the lead of Boise State and Southern Utah, standing up for what's right and protecting the integrity of women's sports.""

Utah governor Brad Little also commended Boise State for its decision. Little's state of Utah has been one of the most proactive in the nation in countering transgender inclusion in women's sports.

On Aug. 28, Little signed an executive order to enforce the ""Defending Women's Sports Act,"" which issued new protocols to the state's public school to promote the exclusion of transgenders in women's sports.

In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital on Aug. 30, Little did not rule out administering gender eligibility tests for all girls and women's sports teams, but added that I'd have to see really good evidence that that's necessary.""

""From a national standpoint, there are radical little groups that want to implement changes in the rules that we have already. I'm confident in what we have, and we will aggressively (act), as the state of Idaho, both legally and legislatively, to protect women's athletes and the great advances they've made because of Title IX.""

In April, the Biden administration issued a sweep rule that clarified that Title IX's ban on ""sex"" discrimination in schools covers discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and ""pregnancy or related conditions.""

The rule took effect Aug. 1, and, for the first time, the law stated that discrimination based on sex includes conduct related to a person's gender identity. The Biden administration insisted the regulation does not address athletic eligibility. However, multiple experts presented evidence to Fox News Digital in June that Biden's claims it would not result in biological men participating in women's sports weren't true and that the proposal would ultimately put more biological men in women's sports.

But current administration's efforts have faced heavy resistance from GOP lawmakers like Little and now individual schools and teams are even taking stands.

On Aug. 16, the Supreme Court voted 5-4 to reject a Biden administration emergency request to enforce portions of that new rule that includes protection from discrimination for transgender students under Title IX.

Now, Wyoming, Southern Utah and Boise State have added to that resistance."
"Breast cancer diagnoses spiking among women under 50, new report reveals",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/health/breast-cancer-diagnoses-spiking-among-women-under-50-new-report-reveals,2024-10-01T23:29:09Z,"Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel explains how early detection for breast cancer has improved with the help of artificial intelligence and discusses the factors contributing the rise in stress in America.

Although breast cancer deaths have been declining for decades in the U.S., diagnoses have been on the uptick among women 50 and younger.

That's according to a new report from the American Cancer Society (ACS) -- Breast Cancer Statistics, 2024.

The good news is that since 1989, breast cancer mortality has declined overall by 44% -- but diagnoses of the disease have been rising by 1% each year between 2012 and 2021.

BREAST CANCER SCREENINGS MAY DECLINE FOR WOMEN WHO RECEIVE FALSE-POSITIVE TEST RESULTS, SAYS STUDY

The biggest spike was seen among women younger than 50 (1.4% per year) and Asian-American/Pacific-Islander women (up to 2.7% per year), the report revealed.

The findings were published in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians.

""Although the breast cancer death rate has declined by 44% thanks to advances in early detection and treatment, the continued increase in breast cancer incidence may slow progress in the future,"" lead author Angela Giaquinto, associate scientist in cancer surveillance research at the ACS, told Fox News Digital.

That is especially the case among women younger than 50, she said, whose rates are increasing by 1.4% per year compared to 0.7% per year in older women.

THESE 17 CANCER TYPES ARE MORE COMMON IN GEN X AND MILLENNIALS, AS STUDY NOTES 'ALARMING TREND'

Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer at the ACS, noted that women are ""a lot less likely"" to die from breast cancer, but that ""alarming disparities"" still remain -- particularly for Asian-American, Pacific Islander, Native American and Black women.

""These gaps need to be rectified through systematic efforts to ensure access to high-quality screening and treatment for every woman,"" he said in the release.

The report compiled cancer data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR), and the National Center for Health Statistics.

Second only to skin cancer, breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women.

""The reasons for the increased prevalence in breast cancer in younger patients is complicated, multifaceted and still being studied.""

This year, approximately 310,720 women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and around 42,250 will die from the disease, according to the ACS.

""The increased prevalence of breast cancer is not only an issue in the U.S. -- we are seeing similar trends in other countries as well,"" Dr. Christopher McGreevy, associate chief of breast surgery at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, told Fox News Digital.

""The reasons for the increased prevalence of breast cancer in younger patients are complicated, multifaceted and still being studied,"" said McGreevy, who was not involved in the report.

SENIORS AND BREAST CANCER: WHY AREN'T OLDER WOMEN TOLD TO GET MAMMOGRAMS?

One reason for early-onset breast cancer is that more patients are obese, the doctor noted.

""Excess weight, particularly after menopause, fuels estrogen production, a key driver of certain breast cancers,"" he said.

Delayed childbearing can also increase the onset of the disease, McGreevy noted, as pregnancy reduces women's breast cancer risk.

""Environmental toxins, lurking in everything from plastics to pesticides, are also suspected contributors,"" he said.

""These endocrine disruptors mimic estrogen in the body, potentially triggering abnormal cell growth.""

Genetics could also factor into the uptick, according to the doctor.

""Certain gene mutations, like BRCA1 and BRCA2, significantly elevate the risk of breast cancer, even at a young age,"" he said.

The rise among younger women could also be a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, fueled by delayed diagnoses due to interruptions in screening, according to the researchers.

There were some limitations associated with the study, the researchers acknowledged.

""The risk and trends in the study are for all women and are not able to account for individual patient characteristics, such as comorbidities or treatment received, or control for social determinants of health, such as insurance status,"" Giaquinto told Fox News Digital.

""We also present statistics for the broadly defined racial and ethnic groups, which mask substantial differences within these populations.""

The best means of prevention is to talk to your doctor about getting screened, according to Giaquinto.

""Early detection of breast cancer is one of the best tools we have for improving survival,"" she told Fox News Digital.

""All women should keep up to date with their recommended breast cancer screenings. This is especially relevant for younger women, as the recommended age of the United States Preventive Services Task Force was recently dropped to age 40.""

Women should also be aware of their family history and personal risk factors, Giaquinto added.

""Women can also reduce their risk of breast cancer by moderating alcohol consumption if they drink, maintaining a healthy body weight and being physically active,"" the researcher advised.

""About 30% of all breast cancers are attributed to these lifestyle factors."""
VP debate: JD Vance and Tim Walz face off tonight. Here's how to watch and when,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/live-updates/jd-vance-tim-walz-debate-2024,2024-10-01T21:58:31Z,"One question likely on the minds of many people watching tonight's faceoff: Who is this for?

National polls show a tight race between Trump and Harris, suggesting the race will come down to voters in a handful of swing states -- depending on who they vote for or whether they vote at all.

And as NPR's Domenico Montanaro reports, only a ""tiny slice"" of the electorate -- from 6% to the low teens -- is considered persuadable.

In NPR's own polling, there have been nearly four dozen undecided voters in the last four months who gave their permission to be contacted.

Montanaro spoke with 10 of them in the days after the Harris-Trump debate, and detailed their reflections here.

""The debate was important for Harris. Most who watched said she performed better than Trump. They were not all moved to vote for her as a result, but four who seemed to need a degree of reassurance about Harris are now voting for her or leaning Harris' direction after the debate.

And while undecided voters often have unique reasons for what influences their votes, there was a clear gender divide. All four who say they are now voting for or leaning toward Harris are women. That also reflects the wide gender gap seen in polls between the candidates.

The other six -- one woman and five men -- were a mix. Five said they likely won't be voting for Harris, most citing the economy or immigration as reasons. One other said he is still truly undecided, but said prices are a major concern.

Two are leaning toward Trump; another said she aligns more with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.; a self-described progressive said he doesn't like Harris' stance on the war in Gaza; and one other, a conservative, said he might not vote at all.""

One thing the group had in common? Many did not want their names used, citing security concerns in the current political climate."
What Happened To Vicky And Casey White? The Crazy True Story Behind Netflix's 'Jailbreak',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicamercuri/2024/10/01/what-happened-to-vicky-and-casey-white-the-crazy-true-story-behind-netflixs-jailbreak/,2024-10-01T21:36:23Z,"Netflix's true-crime documentary Jailbreak: Love On The Run is now the platform's No. 1 film in the US. It recounts the real-life story of a corrections officer who fell for a convicted murderer and helped him escape, sparking a nationwide manhunt. What happened to Vicky and Casey White, and where are they now?

Directed by Dan Abrams and executive produced by Rachel Stockman, Jailbreak: Love on the Run revisits the shocking true events of 2022, when Vicky White, assistant director of operations at the Lauderdale County Detention Center in Florence, Alabama, fell in love with an inmate awaiting trial for murder and aided in his escape.

The inmate, Casey White, was a convicted felon when he was transferred to the Lauderdale County Detention Center in August 2020. He was already serving a 75-year sentence for a 2015 crime spree that included shooting a woman during an attempted carjacking and killing his ex-girlfriend's dog, among other offenses.

Before his escape, White was awaiting trial for the unrelated 2015 murder of Connie Ridgeway, a crime he confessed to before being sent to the Alabama detention center, where he met Vicky.

""Casey White was described as a 'romancer' by one of his former cellmates, and those who worked at the jail said he was a polite, even charming, prisoner,"" Stockman told Netflix's Tudum. Vicky, remembered by inmates in the documentary as compassionate and caring, was a victim in Casey's scheme.

""Vicky, who was used to doing things for others, fell for Casey's manipulation, especially when he claimed he was being framed for a murder he didn't commit. He made her believe in him,"" Stockman continued.

However, inmates at the detention center began to suspect a relationship between Vicky and Casey when they observed him giving her cards to mail that didn't have addresses on the envelopes.

Vicky White had reportedly been planning her and Casey White's escape for some time. Leading up to the escape, she announced plans to retire and sold her home for a price well below market value. The home was sold for $95,550, documents obtained by CNN show, while online records with Lauderdale County list the home's total parcel value at $235,600.

Vicky also recently wiped out her checking account and had a secret phone number, which had been in contact with Casey more than 1,000 times over two years. Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said that Casey and Vicky had a ""special relationship"" that was confirmed by other inmates who told investigators that Casey White ""was getting extra food on his trays"" and ""was getting privileges no one else got. And this was all coming from her,"" per CNN.

On her last day at the job, April 29, 2022, Vicky told her fellow officers at her retirement party that she was bringing Casey to the Florence courthouse for a mental health evaluation. She left with Casey for the courthouse, but the two never returned, raising concerns.

According to Today.com, Vicky was tasked with arranging transports at the prison. ""She used her position, and I think she coordinated her transports, to ensure there were no transport deputies there,"" Singleton told NBC News.

Amid their escape, Vicky White abandoned her patrol car at a shopping center in Alabama and hopped in a Ford. The Ford was later found about two hours north in Williamson County, Tennessee after the officers received a tip, NBC News reported at the time.

A few days later, authorities traced the couple north in Indiana, where they received another tip that a Ford F-150 pickup had been spotted at a car wash in Evansville, Indiana. Surveillance footage shown in the documentary confirmed that the man seen next to the vehicle was Casey.

Vicky and Casey White evaded police for nearly two weeks, leading to an 11-day manhunt. Authorities finally tracked them down after spotting a gray Cadillac parked outside a Motel 6.

When the couple left the hotel, police pursued them, resulting in a high-speed chase that ended when their car crashed into a ditch. Casey was taken into custody immediately, while Vicky suffered a head injury and needed to be taken to the hospital.

Casey reportedly surrendered to U.S. Marshals after the crash, telling them: ""Please help my wife. She just shot herself in the head, and I didn't do it,"" according to NBC News. However, Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding said the two were not married. Multiple wigs and about $29,000 in cash were also recovered from the crashed vehicle.

Vicky White was transported to the hospital with a head wound, and authorities said at the time that they believed she might have taken her own life. Vanderburgh County Coroner Steve Locklear confirmed that Vicky died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Newsweek reported at the time.

After his escape and capture, Casey White was sentenced to life in prison in June 2023 after pleading guilty to the escape. He is serving his life sentence at the William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility in Bessemer, Alabama, according to his inmate record from the Alabama Dept. of Corrections.

""We just wanted a new life together because she knew the truth. I can handle the truth because I know who I am,"" White said in the courtroom at his sentencing, according to NBC News. ""I chose this road. It's cost me my life and freedom.""

White pleaded guilty to escape in exchange for prosecutors dropping a felony murder charge involving Vicky White's death. He also agreed to the maximum sentence of life without parole.

Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett Implores Women To Own Their Political Power,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lydiatblanco/2024/10/01/congresswoman-jasmine-crockett-implores-women-to-own-their-political-power/,2024-10-01T20:33:44Z,"Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) is known for many things. Among them are her political fervor, organizing to protect the rights of marginalized people, and educating the masses on how politics impacts them on the local and national levels.

Congresswoman Crockett began her journey as a public defender and civil rights attorney. Now, she is the sole Black freshman and youngest Black lawmaker in Texas during the 87th Legislative Session.

Committed to public service, she represents portions of Dallas and Tarrant Counties. This includes the cities of Dallas, Grand Prairie, DeSoto, Cedar Hill, Lancaster, Duncanville, Glenn Heights, Hutchins, Wilmer, Arlington, Ovilla, and Seagoville.

As the United States braces for the 2024 presidential elect in November, Congresswoman Crockett has made it part of her duty to take centerstage across America to educate people and implore them to become politically engaged, daily.

Forbes spoke with Congresswoman Crockett in Atlanta, Georgia, as she prepared to be in conversation about the state of Black America and politics at REVOLT WORLD to discuss the significance of voting rights and the political climate.

Lydia T. Blanco: There is a lot of political pressure on everyone in the United States right now, but we know that Black women carry so much of that weight. There are women like you, Oprah Winfrey, and the Jotaka Eaddy's of the world organizing and raising money to ensure that the Black vote matters in November. How can Black women position themselves politically to win and move forward in life come the November election, and beyond?

Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett: One of the things that I get frustrated about is that we wait, and we do everything once the elections are upon us. Election day will come, but the work continues.

That's the attitude we must have when we look at all the rights we've lost. We (women) didn't lose them overnight. Especially when they went after our reproductive access. That was a 50-year fight that they waged. We have to be just as bullish about making sure that we are getting our seats at the table.

Congresswomen Crockett: If there is something that you aspire to be, then go and find someone who is in that space and ask them to mentor you. The worst they can say is no. If you don't ask, you definitely won't receive.

It's important to stay engaged. We need to show up at these school boards as they try to ensure that our history is written out of our children's education We need to make sure that we're showing up at the city council as we have rogue police departments that are going out and killing us and our children.

We need to make sure that we show up before there's a problem and that we show up consistently.

My charge to everybody is not to think that the fight is over once November 5 comes and goes. Stay engaged and demand your space at the table. We are always the most qualified in the room, and half the time, they want to try to act as if we should never have been there in the first place.

I think this is going to be a great opportunity for Black women. I want women to be proud, courageous, stand up for themselves, and demand that they do incredible things.

Blanco: There's an ongoing conversation about diversity, equity, and inclusion. You're often leading it. What is your call to action for White women as allies and civically responsible people?

Congresswoman Crockett: If you know anything about your history, you and I know very well as members of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated, that in 1913, when they went through the Suffrage Movement, Black women were not included in the number. But Black women stood firmly by White women in the fight.

We must understand, stop the divisiveness, and realize that their fight is also ours. And so long as we take on that particular attitude, we all will come up.

We know that there's a wage gap that exists whether you're a Black woman, an Asian woman, or a White woman. We know that the wage gap between women and men exists. So, we need to coalesce around one another.

One of the reasons I've been so proud of some of the women in Texas is because White women said they understand their privilege. That is why we decided we would go into court and make sure that we would start these court cases around abortion access. We know that some won't be able to do it.

So, I'm going to say and charge White women with understanding their privilege and making sure that they're looking out for the entire village of us. Just like we are always there to lift you up, even back in 1913, to make sure that you all had access to the ballot box.

Congresswoman Crockett: I'm not, but come November 6, I'm going somewhere people don't know what a politic is!"

Pete Rose on MLB ban for gambling in last interview: 'Other guys will kill somebody and be back in the game',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/pete-rose-mlb-ban-gambling-last-interview-other-guys-kill-somebody-back-game,2024-10-01T19:46:03Z,"Fox News' Chad Pergram appears on OutKick's ""The Ricky Cobb Show"" to talk about MLB legend Pete Rose.

Just weeks before baseball hit king Pete Rose died at the age of 83 on Monday, he addressed his lifetime banishment from MLB for betting on games in his final TV interview.

Rose, who still holds the record for most hits in MLB history with 4,256 but isn't in the Hall of Fame amid his banishment, admitted that he was ""wrong,"" while speaking to KTLA Los Angeles on Sept. 7.

However, he also advocated for himself while suggesting other players have allegedly committed murders and returned to the field.

""It's been a long time, and there's been a lot of negative things happen in the world of baseball,"" Rose said. ""I was absolutely 110% wrong for what I did... and that's bet on baseball games, and now you're punished for the rest of your life... When other guys will kill somebody, or they'll be strung out on drugs and they'll beat their wives and stuff like that, in a couple years, they're back in the game.""

There have been no reported incidents of a player who committed homicide and was allowed to return to the major leagues. But in 1920, New York Yankees pitcher Carl Mays hit Cleveland Indians shortstop Ray Chapman in the head with a pitch, which caused Chapman to die. Mays continued playing for the Yankees until 1923, then even played for the Cincinnati Reds and Giants after that.

The most recent MLB player to be convicted of murder is former Mets and Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Julio Machado, who was imprisoned for involuntary murder in Venezuela in December 1992 for shooting a woman after a car accident. Machado's 12-year sentence was cut short as he was released in 2000, but he never returned to the majors. He did, however, coach and play in Venezuelan winter baseball leagues after his release.

Meanwhile, Rose was banned for life from MLB in 1989 after an investigation concluded that he not only gambled on MLB games but went so far as to wager on games involving the Cincinnati Reds when he was managing the team. Rose signed an agreement with Commissioner Bart Giamatti declaring him permanently ineligible for baseball but allowing him to petition for reinstatement and avoid a formal declaration that he bet on baseball. Multiple appeals by Rose for reinstatement over the last few decades have failed.

""There's nothing I can change about the history of Pete Rose,"" Rose said.

However, Rose held out hope that he may one day still get in, and brought up the fact that sports gambling has become a multimillion-dollar legalized industry that MLB and major sports brands have embraced, while it was illegal when Rose was caught doing it.

LEGENDARY SPORTSCASTER JIM GRAY REMEMBERS MLB GREAT PETE ROSE

""I keep convincing myself or telling myself, 'Hang in there, Pete, you'll get a second chance,'"" he said. ""There's a lot of people gambling on sports, there's no question about it. And ESPN makes a lot of money based on people betting on sports. Baseball makes a lot of money on people betting on sports... I have nothing bad to say about that. Baseball does what it does because it's the world of baseball and they're king.

""I don't think it makes a lot of sense to people.""

However, while sports gambling has become a lucrative and widely used industry, professional athletes across multiple leagues are still subject to discipline for gambling on their own sports. In June, former Pirates player Tucupita Marcano received a lifetime ban from MLB as well, after an investigation found that he placed 387 baseball bets totaling more than $150,000 in October 2022 and from last July through November with a legal sports book. Like Rose, Marcano was discovered to have bet on his own team while playing with them.

Marcano became the first active player since 1924 to be banned for life for such offenses, as Rose received his ban as a manager, three years after his playing career had ended.

In March, Rose commented on a gambling scandal involving Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani and his interpreter Ippei Mizuhara, after an investigation found that Mizuhara stole $4.5 million from Ohtani and bet on MLB games under the superstar's name.

""Well, back in the '70s and '80s, I wish I'd have had an interpreter. I'd be scot-free,"" Rose said in a video posted to X.

As a player, Rose won three World Series titles, two with the Reds and one with the Philllies, while making 17 All-Star games and winning NL MVP in 1973. Yet, his betting scandal has made him one of the most controversial holdouts of the baseball Hall of Fame since his retirement. He wouldn't live to see if he made it, after he was found dead at his home Monday in Clark County, Nevada.

Rose had not been in the care of a doctor at the time of his death, according to multiple reports. His home is being examined and the cause of death remains under investigation.

Rose's death came just one day after he attended the Williamson County Agricultural EXPO Park on Sunday afternoon, where he signed autographs with Ken Griffey Sr., Dave Concepcion, Tony Perez and George Foster, according to Newsday.

""He was all smiles, took photos with the fans and signed many autographs,"" said Michelle Phelps, who worked the show on Sunday alongside her husband."
How To Spend Two Nights With Two Teenagers In Venice,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanneobriencoffey/2024/10/01/how-to-spend-two-nights-in-venice-with-two-teenagers/,2024-10-01T18:28:40Z,"The 16-year-old learned an important lesson about overpacking when we stepped off the boat in Venice. According to Google maps, the walk from the dock to our hotel was just 15 minutes. But what Google maps does not tell you is that walk is primarily up and down bridges. While we were there for the canals that serve as streets in this spectacular city, we hadn't thought through what that means from a practical standpoint.

Turns out that meant dragging a suitcase up and over four bridges in 90-degree heat to get to our hotel. And as our daughter gamely bumped her stuffed suitcase up each set of stairs, then down the other side, she rethought some of her choices. And by the time she pulled her suitcase into the lobby of the NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo dei Dogi, her excitement over arriving in Venice had evaporated.

Traveling with teenagers is a joy - and a challenge. While you can track down multitudes of articles about travel with kids, the teen years are very much overlooked. True, the days of screaming tantrums, limited diets and afternoon naps were behind us, but with a 14-year-old and a 16-year-old, enforced togetherness can wear thin. And just try telling a teenager how to pack for a trip.

Luckily, our home for the next 48 hours was dripping with Venetian charm. The lobby was blessedly cool and regal, with massive Murano glass chandeliers, tapestries, and inlaid marble flooring. Built in the 17th century, but with a top-to-bottom renovation last year, it blends the old and new in an ideal fashion. For example, the beamed ceiling of our room was elaborately stenciled by hand, but the king-size bed was pure modern luxury.

Sitting in the quiet residential quarter of Sestiere Cannaregio, the hotel is about as far from the tourist-choked Piazza San Marco as one can get in the city -- about 30 minutes walking at a leisurely pace. The hotel has a complimentary daily shuttle to the famous square, but the timing didn't meet our desires for an afternoon siesta, so walking was really the only way to go. Public transportation is limited to water buses (called vaporetto) traveling the Grand Canal, which cuts through the center of the city, and those that circle the city from the exterior in the Venetian Lagoon. Private taxis are very expensive.

Cannaregio is a charming neighborhood for teenagers to wander on their own - bookstores, gelato windows, and canal-side cafes invite exploring. Our walk to the other side of the city only reinforced the delights of that neighborhood. The closer we got to Piazza San Marco, the more crowded the narrow alleyways became and the higher the prices climbed. At the famous Café Florian, right on the piazza, an affogato (vanilla ice cream with a shot of espresso) was 19 euro -- an investment for a family of four. Near our hotel, the same thing, granted without fancy service, a live orchestra or a view of the famous square, was only 5 euro.

The girls found touring St. Mark's Basilica eye-opening - both for the stunning Byzantine architecture and the oddly enforced dress codes. While men could stroll into the church in shorts, we watched as women with exposed knees or shoulders were routinely turned away at the gate. Fortunately, our family was dressed for the occasion.

Soaring ceilings and religious paintings could only hold their attention for so long, so on the recommendation of the concierge, we headed for the Home of the Human Safety Net, an organization dedicated to supporting people in vulnerable circumstances. The beautifully renovated building -never before open to the public - now houses an interactive exhibition called ""A World of Potential."" Hands-on exhibits encouraged us to concentrate to raise a ball in the air and work together to solve puzzles, while thinking about values like creativity, perseverance, gratitude, and hope. The tech-heavy exhibit was an air-conditioned respite to the kids' history-overload, as well as a chance to learn about people well beyond our daily experience.

After a snack in the exhibit's café, we were fortified to wander our way back to the hotel, stopping by famous bookstore Libreria Acqua Alta to visit the shop cats and climb the moldering tower of books out back. The kids were worn out, but there are few places to sit in Venice - security guards routinely shooed even small children who wanted to sit down in Piazza San Marco, and the city is so packed that there is very little green space. This made the garden at our hotel all the more appealing. Likely the largest intact green space in the city, it stretches from the Palazzo dei Dogi's lobby at the front all the way to the Venice Lagoon in the back, dotted with inviting places to sit in the shade. The garden, once considered to be ""one of the Venetian Singularities to be referred to by foreigners,"" offered a cool, serene escape from the constant motion of travel.

The next day, fortified by the hotel's lavish buffet breakfast, we set out to tick off another bucket list experience: a gondola ride. Gondola stations dot the islands of Venice, and all tours are about 30 minutes for up to five people, but the routes vary depending upon where you board. If spotting tourist attractions from the water is your thing, pick a boat near them or at one of the more famous stations. For a more serene experience, we chose a boat that left not far from our hotel, primarily gliding past quiet neighborhoods while our gondolier spontaneously burst into song. If singing is part of your vision, be sure to ask in advance.

Many of the shops in Venice adhere to the classic siesta, closing for a few hours in the afternoon. So after lunch, we followed suit, spending a few more hours in the garden before heading out again. Wandering the nearby Santa Croce neighborhood, we came across a friendly woman hand-painting masks and earrings -- she even encouraged us to try them on, something that was frowned upon in shops on the other side of the city. We also found a few thrift stores - a self-proclaimed Charity Shop where a grandmotherly woman pulled recommendations from the jumbled racks for us to examine, offering encouragement in Italian. And a carefully curated shop called Vintageria Venezia, packed with hip finds and designer bargains. Meandering the city's tiny alleyways is a time-honored tradition - and we had the modern assurance that if our kids got really lost, they could pull out Google maps on a phone and find their way back to us. They searched for a church basement thrift store they'd heard about, with piles of clothes to sort through, but the hours were limited and they never tracked it down.

That's okay though -- we had dinner plans across the lagoon. For a spectacular perspective on the islands of Venice, we traveled to the island of Giudecca, where you will find the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice in a beautifully restored flour factory. The hotel's restaurant Aromi sits at sea level, with a lovely outdoor terrace that offers a spectacular backdrop for its creative menu. After dinner, we headed up to the hotel's Skyline Bar- the highest rooftop bar in the city, for a thoughtful selection of fancy mocktails (as well as cocktails for the adults). The girls' favorite was a confection called Spiramisu, made with chai tea and mascarpone, topped with a Ladyfinger biscuit.

On our final morning in Venice, after another tour through the Palazzo dei Dogi's teen-pleasing buffet breakfast, we stored our bags and took advantage of the hotel's complimentary water shuttle to Murano, where we watched an octogenarian (who had been working in the island's famous glass-blowing factories since he was 12) magically pull a delicate galloping horse from a ball of blazing glass.

Heading back to the boat that would ferry us back to our car, once again dragging suitcases up-and-down four bridges, we vowed to return to Venice - hopefully next time with less baggage."
America's Richest Woman Donates $250 Million To Fund Medical School In Her Name,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdurot/2024/10/01/americas-richest-woman-donates-250-million-to-fund-medical-school-in-her-name/,2024-10-01T17:22:42Z,"Walmart heiress Alice Walton has given away an estimated $1.5 billion to charitable causes during her lifetime.

America's richest woman just reported her largest known charitable gift to date. According to a recently released tax return, Alice Walton's Fort Worth, Texas-based Art Bridges Foundation doled out $390 million during the year ended September 30, 2023, including $249 million to help fund the new Alice L. Walton School of Medicine in her family's hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas. Forbes estimates that the only daughter of Walmart cofounder Sam Walton (d. 1992) has now given away $1.5 billion during her lifetime, making her one of the 30 biggest lifetime givers in the country.

Walton now ranks as America's 26th-most generous philanthropist -- just behind cable TV pioneer Amos Hostetter Jr., who has given away an estimated $1.7 billion to causes including climate change, the arts and education -- though still far behind America's top giver, Warren Buffett.

The Alice L. Walton School of Medicine is currently seeking accreditation to offer a four-year MD program that will ""enhance traditional medical education with the arts, humanities, and whole health principles."" If all goes according to plan, the school will open in 2025 and welcome its inaugural class of 48 students to a 154,000-square-foot facility that is connected by woodland trails to the Waltons' highest-profile philanthropic endeavor to date: the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, which received $30 million from Alice Walton's Art Bridges foundation during 2023.

Alice Walton (estimated net worth: $91.3 billion) chaired Crystal Bridges' board for a decade, before handing the reins to her nephew Tom Walton's wife, Olivia Walton, in 2021. Alice is credited with founding the museum, which sits on 120 acres and features works by the likes of Andy Warhol and Georgia O'Keeffe, after realizing there wasn't anything like it within 300 miles of her family's hometown. But nearly all of the $1.6 billion it cost to open the facility in 2011 came from trusts in the names of her late brother John Walton (d. 2005) and mother Helen Walton (d. 2007).

Alice Walton has ramped up her own philanthropy over the past decade, however, pouring more than $5.7 billion into five family charitable foundations that have so far doled out nearly a quarter of that total. That includes an estimated $380 million gifted through the Walton Family Foundation (which her parents founded on Walmart's 25th anniversary in 1987) to organizations focused on education reform, the environment and the region surrounding Bentonville. It also includes more than $490 million that Alice's Art Bridges Foundation has spent acquiring and loaning out works of American art to more than 230 museums across the country -- including the Art Institute of Chicago, the MoMA in New York City and the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. -- since its founding in 2016.

It's possible that Walton's lifetime giving total should be at least a little higher. That's because she's made $2.3 billion of Walmart stock gifts over the last decade that Forbes was unable to track to their charitable recipients. Some of that stock may have gone to the Waltons' foundations after 2022 (the most recent year for which most of the nonprofits' tax returns are publicly available) -- or directly to operating nonprofits that are already using it to do good. But much of it likely ended up in another type of grantmaking vehicle that is commonly used by billionaires: donor advised funds (DAFs), which aren't required to disclose their contributors or to use their assets for philanthropic purposes within a specified period of time. For these reasons, Forbes excludes dollars flowing through DAFs from billionaires' lifetime giving totals, unless we're able to determine the details of how their money is being spent. (A representative for Walton declined to comment for this story.)

In any case, Walton appears to be just getting started with her personal philanthropy.

""Over the past several years, I've founded new organizations focused on the arts as well as health and well-being,"" Walton said in a press release announcing her retirement as chair of the Crystal Bridges museum in 2021. ""I'd like to focus more fully on my board chair roles at these entities."""
"For Springfield, Ohio, the consequences of GOP lies still linger",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/springfield-ohio-consequences-gop-lies-still-linger-rcna173475,2024-10-01T17:04:48Z,"Nearly a month later, Donald Trump and JD Vance aren't done lying about Springfield, Ohio -- and local residents and officials are still feeling the effects.

House Majority Whip Tom Emmer appeared on ABC News' ""This Week"" a few days ago, and host Martha Raddatz asked a good question about the upcoming vice presidential debate: If debate moderators ask Sen. JD Vance about his baseless pet-eating-immigrants claims, should the Ohio Republican acknowledge the truth?

The Minnesota Republican refused to consider the premise of the question. ""The people in the mainstream media want to put up these shiny objects to distract people from what they see happen every day,"" Emmer concluded before changing the subject.

It was a laughable response, in large part because ""these shiny objects"" used to ""distract people"" have come from Emmer's party and its presidential ticket. It was Donald Trump and his running mate who pushed racist and false conspiracy theories about Springfield, Ohio, into the national conversation, and it was the former president and Vance who've continued to repeat their lies for weeks.

Indeed, these ugly efforts are ongoing. Trump continued his rhetorical assault against Springfield's Haitian immigrants on Thursday. And Friday. And Saturday. Two days later, the GOP candidate sat down with Kellyanne Conway for a Fox Nation interview in which -- you guessed it -- he once again said that Springfield ""is going to be destroyed"" by its immigrant population.

The consequences of the Republicans' misinformation and disinformation -- bomb threats, closed buildings, canceled events, et al. -- have been well documented. But they're also not going away. The New York Times reported:

McGregor, whose business makes parts for cars, trucks, and tractors, has spoken publicly about the valuable contributions his Haitian employees have made to his operation -- which in turn has led people to threaten to kill him. His children and his elderly mother have been targeted with hateful calls, too.

""I have struggled with the fact that now we're going to have firearms in our house -- like, what the hell?"" he told the Times.

McGregor is a lifelong Republican who voted for Trump twice. But he nevertheless told the truth about some of his employees, and now he fears for his family's safety.

He's not alone. The Washington Post published a striking letter to the editor from a local resident who's lived in Springfield for 35 years. ""Because Donald Trump and JD Vance have appropriated the town as a set for their racist falsehoods, Springfield lives under a pall of fear,"" the local woman wrote, adding, ""You know who is not afraid to go out and about in Springfield? Proud Boys. Neo-Nazis. People handing out Ku Klux Klan fliers. ... These far-right groups clearly feel as though they have not just permission, but encouragement, from the Republican candidates. It is unsettling to live in this menacing atmosphere.""

The author concluded, ""Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance hope to make every town Springfield, where the angry are emboldened by lies and the people they seek to punish live in fear. As someone who has lived through this transformation, trust me: You don't want to live in Trump's America.""

Meanwhile, Politico reported that Vance, who ostensibly represents Ohio in the U.S. Senate, still hasn't spoken to Springfield's mayor -- who also happens to be a Republican.

The same article quoted Mike DeWine, Ohio's Republican governor, who expressed dismay over the lies from his party's presidential ticket.

""Yeah, after a while, because it got cumulative, and then you keep thinking, 'Well, they're going to stop this,'"" the governor said. ""Well, they didn't stop this, they just keep going.""

The word ""disqualifying"" is often overused. Once in a while, though, it's applicable."
Bill Gates Falls To Lowest Rank On The Forbes 400 In Nearly 25 Years,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2024/10/01/bill-gates-falls-to-lowest-rank-on-the-forbes-400-in-nearly-25-years/,2024-10-01T17:01:09Z,"The Microsoft cofounder, who long ranked as America's richest person, has dropped in part because of philanthropic giving, but also for another big reason.

or nearly two decades starting in 1990, Bill Gates ranked as either the richest or second richest person on the annual Forbes 400 list of America's wealthiest people.

Not anymore. Though Gates still has a massive fortune of $107 billion, his rank on the new Forbes list has fallen to No. 9 this year, down from No. 6 a year ago. His net worth is also $4 billion less than a year ago-after a year when U.S. stock indices like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 rocketed up by 30%. Among all billionaires globally, Gates now ranks No. 12-the first time he's fallen out of the world's top ten richest people since 1991.

A big reason for the drop: his 2021 divorce from Melinda French Gates, his wife of 27 years.

When Melinda announced in May that she was resigning as co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation the following month, she also mentioned that she'd be getting an additional $12.5 billion for her philanthropic efforts. She didn't say where the funds were coming from or when she would get them. But Forbes has learned that those funds were not a transfer of Gates Foundation assets. They were coming from Bill. And it appears that he's made the transfer of these funds already.

In addition, Forbes has nearly tripled our previous estimate of the divorce settlement that Melinda French Gates received. Based on new information about Bill Gates' current fortune, we've boosted French Gates' net worth to an estimated $29 billion, up from $10.3 billion a year ago. That makes her the ninth-richest woman in the country, just behind casino heiress Miriam Adelson. Spokespeople for both Gates and French Gates declined to comment on the couple's divorce settlement.

In a wide-ranging discussion at the Forbes 400 Summit on Philanthropy in September 2022, Bill Gates predicted his own decline on the Forbes ranking. Gates said at the time that he planned to keep giving away more of his fortune and continue doing so until he dropped off the Forbes billionaires list. Gates also said there was ""a small chance"" that the former couple wouldn't keep working together while adding that the Gates Foundation would continue to operate for another 25 more years.

French Gates has staked her efforts, through her Pivotal Ventures investing and philanthropic arm, on ""working to get more power into the hands of more people-especially women,"" per its website, which says she's committed $2 billion to expand women's power and influence. In 2022 she created the Pivotal Philanthropies foundation and funded it with $674 million in publicly traded securities. In all likelihood, the foundation will land some of the $12.5 billion she has touted as well.

Now that Melinda no longer co-chairs the Gates Foundation, one question that's come up is whether the foundation will continue her focus on supporting women and families. At a Gates Foundation event about women's economic empowerment in Manhattan last week, CEO Mark Suzman raised that very question. His answer: ""Nothing about our commitment to gender equality is changing,"" he said. ""We have a deep, sustained focus on women's economic empowerment."""
Billie Jean King Serves Another Historical First For Women With Congressional Gold Medal,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizelting/2024/10/01/billie-jean-king-serves-another-historical-first-for-women-with-congressional-gold-medal/,2024-10-01T16:49:03Z,"September ended with a historic win for women's sports. As announced in a post made by the US Open's Instagram account last week, Billie Jean King is now the first individual woman athlete to receive the Congressional Gold Medal. This is no small feat -- the Congressional Gold Medal is one of the highest non-military honors presented by the U.S. Congress to those who've made outstanding achievements for American society.

The Congressional Gold Medal has been around since the American Revolution and includes notable recipients such as former NFL player Stephen Gleason, activist Rosa Parks, former president of South Africa Nelson Mandela, the Wright brothers and even George Washington. After President Joe Biden signed the ""Billie Jean King Congressional Gold Medal Act"" legislation into law last Thursday, that list now includes King.

This isn't the first time King has received a high governmental honor. In 2009, President Barack Obama bestowed King with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is given to those who make significant contributions to U.S. national security, world peace or culture. The fact that King won not one, but two governmental honors in her lifetime isn't surprising. In fact, it's beyond well deserved. As King's Congressional Gold Medal Act cites, her historic defeat against Bobby Riggs, a former number one tennis player who sought to discredit women in sports, forever set the precedent that women can be just as -- and even more -- athletically skilled and competitive as men.

Of course, King went on to be the first tennis player and woman to be named Sports Illustrated's Sportsperson of the Year, but even more crucial is her role in progressing women's rights both on and off the court. King founded the Women's Tennis Association (an organization that is actively increasing funding for women's sports), successfully lobbied for women tennis players to be paid equally to men, and formed an independent women's professional tennis circuit. Moreover, other professional athletes, including former United States women's national soccer team captain Julie Foudy have cited King's advice as pivotal in their own fight for equal pay.

Though arguably her most profound accomplishment is her work to establish Title IX. One of the clauses in Title IX requires educational institutions to equally reward women and men athletes. Research from the International Journal of Physiology, Nutrition and Physical Education has shown that access to collegiate, and subsequently professional sports, has significantly increased because of the foundation of Title IX.

What's more, King's honor couldn't have come at a more momentous time for the business of women's sports. According to ESPN, during the Paris 2024 Olympics, women accounted for 26 gold medals -- the most won by a women's team in a single Olympics. The four most-watched days of the 2024 Games also coincided with the women's gymnastics events raking in around 35.4 million viewers. And it's not just the Olympics. From professional women's soccer to basketball, Nielsen has found that viewership for women's sports is progressively on the rise and according to PwC, 85% of experts forecast double-digit growth for women's sports revenues over the next three to five years.

King's fight for women in sports is far from over. She might be approaching 81 years in age this November, yet King continues to fight for women by investing in women's sports teams and women-founded companies. King and her wife, Ilana Kloss, fund several sports teams and startups through their investment firm Billie Jean King (BJK) Enterprises. Additionally, King continues to collaborate with companies to further inclusivity in Corporate America. For instance, King's campaign with E.L.F Beauty ""serves facts"" about the importance of having women and more diverse candidates on corporate boards.

There's no way around it -- King has made and keeps making history for women's rights in ways that will continue reverberating for generations to come. Whether it's putting forth a federal law to protect women athletes or winning Congressional awards, King has forever empowered millions of women both in and out of sports. This is just another page to add to the history books as King continues to change the world."
New Book 'Hiding Mengele' Brings Unique Brazilian POV To Real-World Nazi Conspiracy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshweiss/2024/10/01/betina-anton-brings-brazilian-pov-to-real-world-nazi-conspiracy-with-new-book-hiding-mengele/,2024-10-01T16:40:51Z,"Even at the age of six-years-old, Betina Anton knew something strange was going on when her teacher, a woman lovingly referred to as ""Tante Liselotte,"" abruptly left the school in the middle of the semester, never to be seen again.

""It's one of my earliest memories,"" the award-winning Brazilian author/journalist recalls over Zoom, speaking to me from her home in São Paulo. ""I didn't have the notion it was something with a global impact. I didn't know that at the time, of course, but I knew that something very big happened. I could feel that.""

The year was 1985 and unbeknownst to the young Ms. Anton, authorities had just discovered that beloved ""Aunt Liselotte"" (real name: Liselotte Bossert) and her husband, Wolfram, had played a key role in hiding one of the most sought-after Nazi war criminals of all time; a man who skirted justice for over three decades.

His name? Josef Mengele.

Synonymous with the depravity of the Holocaust, Josef Mengele served as an SS doctor at the notorious Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, where he sent countless victims to the gas chambers and performed sadistic medical experiments on inmates -- twins being his favorite test subjects. His methods were so cruel and callous, that Mengele earned himself the macabre nickname ""Angel of Death.""

Having escaped Allied capture in the confusion of post-World War II Europe, the unrepentant and racist physician eventually relocated to South America, living there until he drowned off the coast of Brazil in early 1979. Even in death, however, the Nazi remained anonymous, deliberately buried under a false name by Liselotte, who never once imagined the scandal would ever see the light of day. That assumption proved to be unfounded six years later when the truth came to light and Mengele's remains were exhumed for analysis by international experts.

But how, unlike Adolf Eichmann, was the man successful in evading ardent Nazi hunters like Simon Wiesenthal, Beate Klarsfeld, and the agents of Mossad?

That is the core focus of Anton's Hiding Mengele (on sale from Diversion Books today), a tremendous work of non-fiction and, perhaps, the most significant book on the subject to ever come out of Brazil. While Mengele had already been the focus of numerous historical works, a bestselling thriller, and even a mock trial in Jerusalem (ironically held just a handful of months before the Nazi's public exhumation), Anton had not seen an exploration rooted in the very place where the saga came to an end.

""I never read anything from someone in my community talking about this guy who lived very close to me. I wanted to know more,"" explains the author, who grew up in a Lutheran enclave of São Paulo founded by German immigrants at the turn of the 19th century. ""It's my view as an insider who lives in Brazil, who knows the German community, who knows many of the places where Mengele used to go.""

The process of putting the book together took around six years of intense research and interviews all over the world, with Anton tracking down invaluable respondents like Rafi Eitan, a former Mossad operative who took part in the kidnap of Eichmann and was also tasked with finding Mengele (to no avail). ""This is a 90-year-old guy who had lived five lives in one lifetime,"" she says of the ex-spy, who died in 2019. ""He was a Mossad commander, a businessman, a [government] minister, and he was still working. He had a wonderful memory and told me things that I'd never read before ... It was very interesting to talk to someone who really lived history firsthand.""

The Israeli operation to find and bring the Angel of Death in front of a war crimes tribunal was continually stymied by budgetary and geopolitical factors. Despite the fact that he always feared the same fate as Eichmann, Mengele turned out to be one lucky fugitive. The SS doctor's mythical, boogeyman-like status worked in his favor as the hunt intensified and led to many false leads, dead ends, and empty theories. ""They had too many clues and most of them were false,"" Anton says.

His spartan lifestyle, which stood in direct contrast to the public's imagination of Nazis hiding out in South America, also played a factor in his ability to remain a ghost for so long. Where the version of the concentration camp doctor in Ira Levin's The Boys from Brazil enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, the actual Mengele ""was poor, living in the periphery among humble people,"" Anton explains.

Moreover, he was not aided and abetted by the apocryphal Odessa network, but kept afloat by his affluent family and a small chain of ex-Nazis and their sympathizers. Not exactly the far-reaching cabal of Third Reich fanatics often depicted in popular media, but that doesn't mean the secrets and danger surrounding the conspiracy to hide Mengele were no less real. A year into her research, Anton managed to track down Liselotte Bossert (then in her early 90s) in the hopes of getting the full story. Instead, the veteran journalist received a cryptic warning. ""She started saying things you don't ever expect a former teacher to tell you: 'This is a very, very dangerous subject. I think you should research something else.' I was really scared.""

One can only guess why Bossert wanted her off the trail, but thankfully, Anton continued on, disregarding the old woman's vague threats, as well as personal doubts over what the community might think. ""Many people said, 'We are of German descent. Everybody says we are Nazis. Why are you going to reinforce this image?'"" she remembers. ""But [in the end] most people liked it. I'm very relived."""
"This new MacArthur ""genius"" says she defied caste prejudice thanks to Dad and Mom",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/10/01/g-s1-25437/macarthur-genius-grant-caste-dalit-india-shailaja-paik,2024-10-01T16:07:00Z,"Shailaja Paik was born into India's Dalit community -- one of the millions who belong to historically marginalized and oppressed castes due to their professions. They're so scorned that they were for centuries known as ""untouchables."" And even though modern India is changing, caste discrimination refuses to go away.

Paik faced prejudice both as a Dalit and a woman. She credits her parents, especially her father, for helping her (and her three sisters) defy the prejudices they faced as Dalits and as women. He made sure they got an education.

For Paik, schooling was a path to teaching history in the U.S., writing books about the untold plight of the Dalits -- and now being dubbed a genius.

She's one of 22 recipients of the 2024 MacArthur fellowship, one of the most prestigious awards for creative and intellectual achievement -- informally known as ""the genius grant.""

MacArthur fellows receive $800,000 over five years to spend however they want -- one of the few no-strings attached grants. The fellows do not apply nor are they officially interviewed for it. The call informing them of the fellowship comes out of the blue.

A research professor of history at the University of Cincinnati, Paik is not a public figure as some recipients are. She has documented the deep social inequity rising from India's repressive caste system that she is a part of. Her focus is the plight of Dalit women like herself.

In a video interview with NPR, Paik, age 50, shares key findings from her years of research -- and why this achievement is such a milestone. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

When you received the news that you'd won the MacArthur grant, what was that moment like?

The call came around 5 p.m. I was resting after a full day of classes. I was tired and couldn't really believe what I was hearing. The Foundation congratulated me, explained the details of the award and how it related to my work. It was such an exhilarating, ecstatic moment.

How does it feel to be called a genius? Growing up, did you ever think that this kind of recognition would be yours?

I've worked very hard all my life against odds, and while every success I've had has been appreciated and celebrated by parents, friends, and extended family, I've never been called a ""genius"" before. It's overwhelming, but when I think of how I got here -- an often rocky journey -- I'm going to embrace it with gratitude.

Tell us about those early years.

Growing up, I had to fight hard to survive. I was born in Pohegaon, a small village in [the western Indian state of] Maharashtra.

My family moved to Pune, the nearest city [four hours away by road] in the 1960s, where I grew up. We lived in a one-room house in a slum area in Yerawada, on the Ahmednagar highway, which made it easier for my father to make trips to our native village so he could keep in touch with his family. Our house was about 20 by 20 feet, and we didn't have access to toilets.

The neighborhood where we lived in was a densely populated, underserved area, full of underprivileged people, some labeled disruptive or dangerous. I have three sisters and if it weren't for our father, who was determined to give us an education, these opportunities wouldn't have been ours. My mother, educated until grade 6, introduced me to the English alphabet. She worked very hard at domestic drudgery to enable me and my sisters to devote ourselves to our education. She protected us and taught us to protect ourselves. She has been a model of fortitude, standing by me, teaching me to pursue my interests singlemindedly and believing in my endeavors.

My father struggled for an education himself. He attended what we call night school and worked during the day, waiting tables and cleaning at restaurants. He put up pandals [temporary scaffolding, used for weddings or religious events] and learnt to play [pre-recorded] music during events. In this way, somehow, he educated himself -- and got a bachelor's degree in Agricultural Sciences, the first Dalit man from his village to do so.

Did his emphasis on education encourage you to pursue a career in academia?

Dalits have been excluded from education and seeking out knowledge for centuries. I mention this in my first book, Dalit Women's Education in Modern India, Double Discrimination. Women faced double discrimination -- for being Dalits and because of their gender.

So that became an important motivation for me too. To escape the slum, I had to get education and employment -- it was key to living a better life.

It became especially important after my father's death in 1996, because I had to support my family -- my mother and sisters .

Soon after, in the same year, I got my masters' degree from the Savitribai Phule university in Pune. I started out as a lecturer teaching history in Mumbai. The Ford Foundation fellowship provided me support to pursue a doctoral degree in Warwick University in the U.K. I arrived in the U.S. in 2005 after securing a fellowship from Emory University.

For people encountering your work in South Asian history for the first time, what can they expect?

My work explores the role of power and identity. It shines a light on the fundamental inequalities in our lives that make some people more equal than others.

Broadly speaking, it documents the inequalities that we inherit. My teaching and research focuses on systemic mechanisms of stigmatization and exploitation.

Those who are privileged elites have pushed the burden of [making amends for prejudices like] caste onto Dalits, of race to Black people and of gender to women, thus holding the oppressed responsible for fighting for their rights and addressing their difficulties on their own. My work shows that everyone -- the oppressed and oppressors -- need to work together to fight for liberation.

Through the course of your career, you've championed the cause of Tamasha women, dancing artists from the Western Indian state of Maharashtra -- some of whom are Dalits. What drew you to their stories?

Tamasha brings together drama, dance, mime, song, and it is considered a traditional art performed predominantly by women from the Dalit community. However, it was often branded ashleel or vulgar by the larger society. The performance and the performers were regarded as loud, pretentious, showy and considered indecent, rude, dishonest.

So growing up, I've watched these performances in both my village and the city and I understood how intensely these women performers were stigmatized. I found literary evidence that dates back to the 10th century calling the art vulgar and saying that no one should be engaging in it or watching it.

When I began the fieldwork for my Ph.D. dissertation in 2002 and 2003, I interviewed about 180 women from different social backgrounds -- from middle-class apartments and slums, from different castes and different Dalit castes. Among these interviewees were many Tamasha women.

Little was known about the caste prejudice and violence that Tamasha girls face.

It amazed me how their voice was so completely erased after being branded as vulgar, and so I set about creating an archive, filled with newspaper clips, magazines, pamphlets, films, music and fieldwork that centered on the experiences of Tamasha women.

So this topic has been on my mind for the last 20 years and became the subject of my second book, The Vulgarity of Caste: Dalits, Sexuality and Humanity in Modern India.

In your book, you discuss the vicious cycle that Tamasha women must endure. Many despise their own line of work because of the bawdry, sensual nature of the dance. They know others don't respect them for it and worse, it leaves them vulnerable to sexual assault -- seen by society as sex workers even though that is not the case. Yet they cannot stop performing, because discrimination against them will not allow them to take on other jobs or switch careers. You call this the sex, gender and caste complex. Could you elaborate?

In the caste system, women are rigidly regulated in terms of their sexuality -- it is used as a means of controlling and branding them. Gender and sexuality are used to deny Dalit women dignity.

For instance, the sex-gender-caste complex very cunningly labels a range of dancers, singers and Tamasha women as prostitutes [as a result of their low caste status].

In my book, Mangalatai Bansode, a well-known Tamasha artist who continues to dance to this day, has discussed the ways the sex-gender-caste complex created so many difficulties for her. She recalled an incident that happened to her as a 16-year-old. She was forced to dance in an ox cart by the people in her village. She was the lead dancer, and she and other women were crammed into an ox cart and had to dance as it made its way around her village. A wild crowd gathered, and men danced and cheered around the ox cart, trying to grab at her and pull at her saree. You can imagine how frightening this experience would have been for a 16-year-old, and yet she could not refuse because she would have to face violence if she did.

In recent years, have things changed? Have modern Tamasha girls found a way out of this cycle of suppression and violence?

As I show in my book the sex-gender-caste complex exploited Dalit Tamasha women, but some women like Bansode have made it work. She created business opportunities and propelled social mobility for herself, her family members and her troupe. Her granddaughter is now a medical doctor.

Tamasha women have also pursued different opportunities in terms of recording CDs, uploading YouTube videos, reels, entering films -- but still these numbers are very small.

Many Tamasha women continue to live in poverty, do not get the pensions promised by the government, do not get support from local authorities and continue to struggle. COVID was particularly challenging for many.

Though it isn't easy, is there any way to build a more equitable society for people who still endure caste prejudice?

It's a centuries-old discrimination so certainly not easy. There are a number of ways we can work on fighting this discrimination and the system. But primarily, we need to acknowledge that caste divisions and prejudice exist.

This is something that especially high-caste elite liberals do not want to talk about. Some [Indians] are quick to talk about the racial discrimination that they face but do not want to talk about the caste discrimination that they perpetuate.

So we should talk about it and stop pretending that there is no caste, in India and elsewhere. There are very intense conversations taking place in the U.S. today, especially [around] caste and race.

The MacArthur grant comes with $800,000 disbursed over five years. Is there a beach chair with your name on it? How does it factor in your future plans?

(Laughs). To be honest, it's going to take some time to sink in.

But I do know that it will help me conduct my research and write on historical inequities and social barriers with greater ease and to expose my students to these different perspectives.

You know -- history isn't a dead subject. Our attitude to the past shapes how we think about the present and how we build our future.

What do you think the fellowship means to other Dalits?

This fellowship is a celebration of the enormous contributions of Dalits -- their ideas, actions, history and fight for human rights -- as much as it is of me as a Dalit woman scholar. I am indebted to the Dalit women who shared their lives with me and I hope this achievement will strengthen the fight of both Dalits and non-Dalits against caste discrimination, in and beyond South Asia.

Dozens Of Female Lamborghini Owners Light Up The Desert This Weekend,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinshaw/2024/10/01/dozens-of-female-lamborghini-owners-light-up-the-desert-this-weekend/,2024-10-01T16:05:29Z,"Supercar builder Lamborghini hosted its first ""She Drives a Lambo"" event exclusively for female owners last fall. Thirty women and their roaring Lamborghini models showed up for the event in Connecticut for a three-day celebration of women who love their Raging Bulls.

This year's She Drives a Lambo event will take place in Sedona, Arizona this weekend in a similar format. A posh hotel, beautiful scenery, and lots of fast supercars are on the schedule, and the event is sold out with others from the wait list hoping for an opening to materialize.

The idea, says Automobili Lamborghini CEO for the Americas Andrea Baldi, is to fortify its woman-owned Lamborghini network. Charming and friendly, the executive understands the assignment and is eager to spread the word.

""In the last year, we have had more women approaching the brand and we felt we needed to find a way for them to bond,"" Baldi told me. ""It's a celebration of women. We want them to be confident and bring the car to the next level.""

Even the event curator is a woman at this high-end event, where attendees will spend three days and two nights steeped in Lamborghini culture. In the past, Baldi recognizes, Lamborghini used to be designed by men and for men.

""Today, our company is made up of a big percentage of women who are in design, engineering, and production,"" he says. ""It's the natural evolution from the heart of the company.""

Last year in Connecticut, Baldi heard his female customers talk about other events where they felt pressure from male clients to go faster and drive harder. By hosting an event for female Lamborghini owners only, the brand hopes to grow their confidence and provide an atmosphere that fosters community, not competition.

""I think sometimes [Lamborghini can be] a little intimidating, and that's applicable to all sportscar manufacturers,"" Baldi asserts. ""We are trying to make sure women know they are important to us and they count for our future. We want to have more and more opportunities to learn from women about the direction we need to take. We want them to know we are not a brand polarized around men.""

Introducing the Urus SUV was a huge move for the Raging Bull and became a key entry point for women. Today, Lamborghini is seeing interest from more women than ever before.

At the 2023 She Drives a Lambo meetup, the drivers and their guests had a chance to experience the Huracán STO, Huracán Tecnica, and Urus Performante, which may have whet their appetites for a second or replacement model.

This year's guest star is the new Revuelto, a fantastic track-ready hybrid that replaces the legendary Aventador. Boasting a 6.5-liter V-12 and a trio of electric motors for 1,001 horsepower, the Revuelto is a thrill ride; more than one driver will likely succumb to temptation to order one on the spot.

""Our hope is that they engage more with the brand and each other; word of mouth is such a strong sector to produce new clients,"" Baldi says. ""We want more and more women to drive a Lamborghini."""
"As Healthcare And Politics Intersect, Doctors Urge Patients To Vote.",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/adairalandry/2024/10/01/as-healthcare-and-politics-intersect-doctors-urge-patients-to-vote/,2024-10-01T16:05:11Z,"Five years ago, a young woman with stabbing abdominal pain arrived at my emergency department. Her blood pressure steadily dropped as she developed pale, clammy skin. We told her, ""You are bleeding into your abdomen. We see blood on your ultrasound. We are worried you are having an ectopic pregnancy."" Within minutes, she was in the operating room getting a life-saving surgical procedure for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, a type of pregnancy that is considered non-viable for the fetus.

Remarkably, our pregnant patient survived. Yet, what stands out today is that the legality of our care, years ago, was never a concern. The team was centered only on providing the care she needed.

The Political Landscape of Healthcare

Today, the delivery of healthcare has become increasingly politicized. The recent overturn of Roe v. Wade reversed rights for pregnant people, leaving many vulnerable under recent state abortion bans. In states where exceptions for ectopic pregnancies exist within their abortion ban, women have still encountered hospitals that ""refused to treat their ectopic pregnancies."" This shift in regulation underscores the intersection of healthcare and politics, a reminder of how both physicians and patients should engage in the democratic process.

While a growing number of politicians have healthcare expertise, many lack a nuanced understanding of medical practice and healthcare delivery. This knowledge gap creates challenges when those who regulate medicine are not the ones providing it. ""Doctors and patients should be protected to make collaborative decisions -- without the intrusion of politics"" says Dr. Sharon Malone, physician, patient advocate, and author. The intertwining of politics and healthcare complicates efforts to address fundamental health issues. ""We haven't agreed on the most basic tenant: does everyone in this country deserve healthcare?"" she argues.

Aspects of healthcare influenced by politics extend beyond women's health. Insurance reimbursement, gun violence, criminalization of illicit substances, pharmaceutical cost-regulation are just a few active political issues that affect patient outcomes.

The Need for Voter Registration

As of 2022, there are approximately 162 million registered voters in the United States, leaving millions without a voice in upcoming elections. The journey toward change begins with voter registration. Politicians, like Elizabeth Warren, are working to streamline this process, recently announcing that patients filling out health insurance forms via HealthCare.gov will receive information about voter registration. ""The health of our democracy depends on Americans registering and exercising their right to vote,"" Warren stated.

In Minnesota and Pennsylvania, leaders have designated August as Civic Health Month to emphasize the importance of voting on healthcare. And yet, despite the clear push to increase patients' civic engagement, some critics -- including physicians -- oppose discussing voter registration in clinical settings.

Stanley Goldfarb MD, has been outspoken against doctors speaking with patients about voter-registration. He argues that ""leftists are making the doctor's office a major cog in their voter-registration and turnout machine."" Why the act of registering to vote at the encouragement of a doctor feels threatening or unwarranted is unclear to me, a physician who routinely witnesses the profound and direct impact politics has on patients. His organization, Do No Harm, states that they are focused on ""combating the attack on our healthcare system from woke activists.""

""Many believe that doctors should 'stay in their lane' and not become involved in the political process, as [patients] may see this as a conflict and not get care,"" Dr. Ayana Jordan, Associate Professor at NYU School of Medicine argues. She clarifies that our role is to be non-partisan and avoid swaying patients in our direction. ""Our role is to ensure that patients understand how to register to vote, make this process as easy as possible, and discuss issues most pertinent to them."" she adds.

Critics fear that doctors will abuse their power to sway patients towards their own individual political agenda. ""It's not just ""vote"". It is vote for Joe Biden, if we are honest. Inherently, the doctor's political bias is reflected in the encouragement. What happens if the patient's father is wearing a MAGA hat. Do you still remind them to vote?"" says one physician, Vinay Prasad MD MPH.

I do agree that physicians should certainly not impose their own beliefs onto patients. And that if they ask one patient to register to vote they should indeed ask all, when clinically appropriate. However, it is countercultural to see physicians grossly avoiding the empowerment and education of patients. A physician need only say, ""I'm sorry you can't afford your life-saving medication"" once for it to be clear there's no effective solution in that statement.

Why Clinicians Should Encourage Voting

In 2022, the AMA declared that voting is a social determinant of health. Dr. Alister Martin, physician, CEO and Co-Founder of A Healthier Democracy, a non-partisan organization that is determined to increase voter registration among patients, says that ""data demonstrates that across rural and urban regions, when voting rates are high, health outcomes are better."" While he believes the exact cause is hard to pinpoint, he suspects areas with high voter engagement are better able to pull in resources that help patients access healthcare. ""These communities have more specialty clinics, hospitals remain open, health centers are available. In the rural areas with less civic engagement, there are more hospital closures."" adds Martin.

Martin emphasizes that voting fosters a sense of agency among patients. ""Those who vote generally feel more empowered to effect change in their lives."" He also highlights a concerning statistic: 72 million eligible individuals are not registered to vote, a gap that can influence electoral outcomes and therefore healthcare related policies.

Encouraging voter registration is not only legal but also supported by leading healthcare organizations, such as the AMA. The encouragement should not be invasive, biased, or demanding. Martin advocates for integrating questions about voter registration into patient social histories, asking, ""Do you smoke? Drink? Are you registered to vote?"" He believes that by enabling patients to exercise their voting rights, we can all contribute to a healthier democracy."
"Amazon's Bizarre 'Reacher' Spinoff Is Officially Happening, And It's Still A Bad Idea",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2024/10/01/amazons-bizarre-reacher-spinoff-is-officially-happening-and-its-still-a-bad-idea/,2024-10-01T16:05:02Z,"Jack Reacher is a solitudinous guy. The massive-framed super-hobo likes to work alone. In every Lee Child book, Reacher is effectively a one-man army with a heart of gold. He tends to team up with side characters in every novel. Sometimes these are cops, almost always he finds himself in close proximity to a beautiful woman. Occasionally, a recurring character pops back into the story. Usually it's someone we haven't seen in awhile.

One of these characters is Frances Neagley, a partner at a private security firm who knows Reacher from their days as Military Policemen in the U.S. Army 110th MP Special Investigations Unit. She shows up in exactly four books, is mentioned in a fifth and has a role in a Reacher short story.

Amazon and the creators of the hit streaming Alan Ritchson-led show Reacher decided to expand Neagley's role in the series, having her appear in both of the first two seasons, with an expanded role in Season 2. In some ways, this makes sense for a TV show where viewers enjoy seeing familiar faces. This is especially true of a character like Reacher, always on the road meeting new people and facing new bad guys and other challenges.

The problems with this move, however, are also pretty obvious: For one thing, even in the books, the story is always weakest when Reacher is tied down by anyone or anything. This is a story about a singular -- and very single -- man. His girlfriend arc early in the series is painful, for instance. The charm of Jack Reacher is that he's a wandering warrior monk of sorts, a dharma bum, a man with no possessions except the shirt on his back and the toothbrush in his pocket. He's the Jack Kerouac of action heroes. If anything, Neagley's role in the series is way too big -- not because she isn't a good character, but because Reacher himself is a lone wolf and these stories aren't about his friendships, but rather about the people and places his drifter lifestyle brings him to with every new adventure. Maybe that will matter less in a spinoff, but there are other issues to think of which I'll get to in a moment.

A return from Neagley in Season 4 would have made sense, because there would have been a break as we met new characters along the way. As a major character -- in a full team of Reacher buddies, no less -- it felt forced. I'd argue that one of Season 2's biggest weaknesses was making Reacher just another guy in a team of badasses instead of showing himi as the force of nature that he was in Season 1 (where he also had a team, but they didn't all join in all the fist fights). That was just one of many problems with the hugely disappointing second season.

All this serves as preamble to news that a Reacher spinoff is now officially happening. My colleague Paul Tassi reported on this when it was just a ""maybe"" but now it's actually happening. Tassi noted at the time that Neagley isn't that popular of a character or that interesting of one, at least as far as leads go and I agree.

This brings us to the second big problem with this spinoff. I'm just not sure who this show would be for in the first place. Who is the intended audience here? Reacher appeals to a pretty obvious crowd: Men (and women) who enjoy action movies and Reacher books. I put ""women"" in parentheses because while I know many women enjoy male-dominant entertainment, the vast majority of viewers for this kind of show are men. This is not an opinion; it's a demographic reality. And while men also enjoy shows with female leads, I question whether there is a big enough Neagley fanbase in the Reacher community to bring decent numbers to a show that doesn't include Alan Ritchson's Reacher.

Will this be an action show geared towards women? Or a show that tries to bank on Reacher's popularity without actually including our titular tower of muscle? If so, good luck with that. Then again, as Tassi also pointed out, this will be a much cheaper spinoff than many of Amazon's big shows.

Currently, the spinoff is being referred to as ""The Untitled Neagley Project"" and will star Maria Sten who plays Neagley in Reacher. The series does have a blurb already:

""When she learns that a beloved friend from her past has been killed in a suspicious accident, she becomes hell bent on justice. Using everything she's learned from Jack Reacher and her time as a member of the 110 Special Investigators, Neagley puts herself on a dangerous path to uncover a menacing evil.""

A beloved friend from the past killed in suspicious circumstances? Isn't that the plot to Reacher Season 2?

The news was broken at the Prime Video Presents: Trailblazers event in London, where Sten told the audience: ""I love Neagley. She's so fun to play, she's so quirky and has so much complexity."" I do love that the star of the show is enthusiastic about her character. I just question whether that will translate to success. I hope I'm wrong and we get a compelling new action-mystery.

Reacher creator Nick Santora and Law & Order writer Nicholas Wootton developed the spinoff and will serve as co-showrunners. Amazon MGM Studios, Skydance Television and CBS Studios are producing the series. A release date has not been announced, though it seems likely it will land after Season 3 of Reacher when that returns for a third and hopefully much-improved season."
JD Vance Vs. 'Childless Cat Ladies': VP Candidate's Views Explained Ahead Of Tonight's Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/01/jd-vance-vs-childless-cat-ladies-vp-candidates-views-explained-ahead-of-tonights-debate/,2024-10-01T16:04:55Z,"Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio is likely to be asked at Tuesday's vice presidential debate about comments he made denouncing Vice President Kamala Harris and others as ""childless cat ladies"" who don't have a ""direct stake"" in the country's future, which reflects a worldview that has affected Vance's policy views as he stands to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.

Vance will face off against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at Tuesday's debate in Philadelphia. The debate comes as the Harris campaign and Walz -- a cat owner himself -- have repeatedly highlighted Vance's ""childless cat ladies"" comments on the campaign trail. Walz has posted videos with cats and said when Taylor Swift endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, ""It's not as if I didn't warn these guys a few months ago: You mess with cat people, you will find out."" The governor attacked Vance for his comments even before he was named Harris' running mate in August, criticizing the senator for apologizing to cats instead of women for his comments and telling MSNBC, ""My god, they went after cat people ... It would be funny if it wasn't so sad.""

In comments to right-wing journalist Megyn Kelly about his ""childless cat ladies"" comments going viral, Vance said his remarks were ""obviously ... a sarcastic comment"" and he has ""nothing against cats,"" but defended his broader views. ""People are focusing so much on the sarcasm and not on the substance ... and the substance of what I said, Megyn -- I'm sorry, it is true,"" Vance said.

Vance's views that emphasize the importance of married families with children echo views espoused by the Heritage Foundation, a private right-wing organization with close ties to Vance that's recently come under fire for its 900-page policy agenda for a second Trump presidency known as ""Project 2025."" The Heritage Foundation has publicly called for ""encouraging marriage at the front end of a woman's childbearing years"" in order to increase the birth rate, and Project 2025 heavily emphasizes the importance of the nuclear family and imposing policies that strengthen it. The policy blueprint calls for ending ""LGBTQ equity"" initiatives and others in the Department of Health and Human Services and ""replacing such policies with those encouraging marriage, work, motherhood, fatherhood, and nuclear families,"" for instance, along with restricting abortion rights and eliminating federal healthcare mandates around contraception coverage. About the Heritage Foundation's proposals, Vance spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk told Forbes, ""The views of any outside group have zero effect on JD's policy positions -- full stop."" Vance's office also directed Forbes to comments Vance has made noting Project 2025 has no affiliation with the Trump campaign and saying he thinks ""there's some good ideas in there"" and ""there's some things that I disagree with.""

Vance's comments denouncing ""childless cat ladies"" have drawn widespread condemnation from the left, particularly from female voters. Actress Jennifer Aniston said in an Instagram post she ""truly can't believe that this is coming from a potential VP of the United States."" Addressing Vance, she added ""I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day."" Swift's post endorsing Harris was accompanied by a photo of the singer holding her own cat. Former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., also criticized Vance on X, saying she is a ""proud mom"" of stepchildren -- like Harris -- and she and husband Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., were trying to conceive through in vitro fertilization before she was shot in 2011. ""To suggest we are somehow lesser is disgraceful,"" Giffords said. While Harris has not commented on his attacks directly, her stepdaughter Ella Emhoff posted an Instagram story saying, ""How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I,"" referring to her brother. ""I love my three parents,"" she added. Harris also garnered a significant amount of high-profile support from female voters in her campaign's opening days as Vance's comments first went viral, with more than 100,000 women joining a Zoom call Thursday to support the Harris campaign and fans of Taylor Swift mobilizing for the vice president.

How Vance's policy views would actually affect a potential Trump presidency. The vice presidential candidate is likely to fall in line with Trump's chosen policy agenda, and the ex-president has publicly espoused more moderate positions than Vance on issues like abortion, calling for the issue to be left up to the states. (Abortion rights advocates believe he may take harsher action if elected, however.) Trump has also publicly distanced himself from Project 2025 and its more extreme proposals, though many involved with his first presidential administration helped author the policy agenda.

Trump named Vance as his vice presidential candidate on July 15 as the Republican National Convention was underway, siding with allies like son Donald Trump Jr., who had pushed for Vance to be the nominee over more moderate choices like Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. Vance was elected to the Senate in 2022 and was previously best known as the author of memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy."" He notably spoke out against Trump in the 2016 election before he ultimately claimed his views had changed and he now strongly supports the ex-president. Trump's selection of Vance has come under increasing scrutiny as his more extreme views have gone viral and as President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and Harris replaced him, shaking up a contest that polling previously suggested could go more easily for Trump. The vice presidential candidate has struggled in the polls, with a FiveThirtyEight analysis finding he is the least popular non-incumbent vice presidential nominee since at least 2004, and The Hill reported even some House Republicans denounced him as Trump's running mate."
Why You Should Get Life Insurance Before You Develop A Chronic Illness,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/anne-lysengatta/2024/10/01/why-you-should-get-life-insurance-before-you-develop-a-chronic-illness/,2024-10-01T15:20:30Z,"More than half of Americans will develop a chronic illness at some point in their life according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Life insurance should be a key part of your plans as it provides security for your loved ones in the event of your death. It is an important safety net to have, especially if you have people in your life that you help take care of financially like young children, or a spouse who is a homemaker.

However, it is harder to have life insurance after you have been diagnosed with a chronic illness. That's why life insurance is a wealth-building tool that you should have as early as possible.

I started carrying life insurance outside of my place of work in my late 20s. So, I'm paying a small amount for a significant policy. However, in late 2022, I wanted to increase my premium since it was still inexpensive for me.

Even though my life insurance policy should be enough, term life insurance is still very affordable for a healthy woman or man in their 30s, so I wanted to increase the policy.

While I knew that the premium rises yearly as you get older, life was busy and I didn't get around to doing it, which is something I truly regret.

However, in late 2023, like 39.5% of Americans, I developed a form of cancer. I was diagnosed with Stage 3 Triple Negative Breast Cancer, a very aggressive form of Breast Cancer at age 38. I have been receiving costly health treatments since.

According to Policy Genius, a cancer survivor under 45 years old may be able to get life insurance coverage through their workplace group life insurance policy, which will expire if they leave their job.

People older than 45 qualify for guaranteed issue life insurance, a form of whole life insurance, which is very expensive, and more beneficial to people who already have significant wealth and want to preserve it, as explained in a 2023 YouTube video.

For people like me who never had a serious or chronic illness until recently, suddenly everything changes. ""Now I'm considered ""a high-risk person"" by life insurance companies, even though my cancer is in remission. When I completely beat cancer, I will still be considered high-risk by the insurance company, like any cancer survivor. So, I will face a significant premium.

I have had solid life insurance for a decade and I am so thankful for that. If you don't already have a policy, I hope that you purchase one after reading this story.

Term-life insurance outside of your job makes sense because of its affordability, which gives you room to invest the difference that you would pay for a whole life policy. In addition, the fact that the policy doesn't expire when you switch jobs makes it a great option.

Life insurance increases by 5 to 8% each year in your forties and by 9% to 12 % if you're in your fifties according to Investopedia,

It is in your best interest to get a life insurance policy as early as possible. If you didn't sign up in your 20s or 30s to get the best rates, remember it is best to sign up now than later as the premiums keep increasing.

Life insurance is an inexpensive tool to help your family build wealth. It provides security to your loved ones. It allows them to function without the person who passed away, and without worrying about being able to stay in the same house, or the same school district, to pay for childcare, or to participate in the usual activities. Life insurance is the last gift you leave your loved ones to ensure that they have a good life."
"Signet Jewelers CEO Virginia C. Drosos To Retire, Successor Named",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonydemarco/2024/10/01/signet-jewelers-ceo-virginia-c-drosos-to-retire-successor-named/,2024-10-01T15:10:08Z,"Signet Jewelers, the world's largest retailer of diamond jewelry, said Tuesday that Virginia ""Gina"" C. Drosos is planning to retire as chief executive officer and as a member of the board of directors. Her 12-year tenue will end November 4.

Signet's board of directors has appointed retail industry veteran, J.K. Symancyk, to succeed Drosos. He will also join the Signet board at that time. Following her retirement, Signet said Drosos will continue as an advisor through the end of the company's fiscal year to support a smooth transition. Symancyk will be based at Signet's offices in Dallas.

Signet said in a statement the change in leadership is part of a planned long-term succession strategy.

Signet Jewelers, a publicly traded company based in Akron, Ohio, and domiciled in Bermuda is one of the largest jewelry retailers in the world with a market cap of $4.33 billion and sales in the 2024 fiscal year of $7.17 billion. Its businesses cover the breadth of jewelry retail in the U.S. Canada and U.K., with companies ranging from traditional jewelry retailers Kay, Zales, Jared to digital jewelry retailers, Blue Nile and JamesAllen.com. In the U.K. it owns H.Samuel and Ernest Jones and in Canada it owns Peoples Jewellers. It employs nearly 30,000 persons.

Drosos was appointed Signet CEO in July 2017 and has served as a director of Signet's board since 2012. Under her leadership, the company's market capitalization has quadrupled since the start of the pandemic, the company said. Signet has earned distinctions as a four-time Certified Great Place to Work, included for five consecutive years on the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index and the number 12 company on the Fortune and Great Place to Work 2022 Best Workplaces in Retail. Under her watch, the company's board of directors and Signet's leadership team are the most diverse in its history.

Drosos has more than 30 years of executive leadership experience in the consumer goods, beauty and healthcare industries, as well as retail. She has been recognized by WWD x FN x Beauty Inc 50 Women in Power (2023), as one of the Top 50 Women CEOs by Women We Admire (2022), EY's Entrepreneur of the Year (2017), Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber of Commerce's Woman of the Year (2017), Ohio Venture Exit of the Year (2016), Fortune's 50 Most Powerful Women in Business (2010, 2011), the YWCA Career's Woman of Achievement (2008), and the Cosmetic Executive Women Achiever (2007).

""Gina led Signet in its transformation journey with strategic clarity, disciplined decision-making and a purpose-driven mindset,"" said Helen McCluskey, chair of Signet's Board of Directors. ""Under her leadership, in the last five years the company expanded its market share by nearly 50% and significantly grew its digital presence. During Gina's tenure as CEO, she and the team increased e-commerce sales fourfold and transformed the company's financial results, reducing gross debt outstanding by over 90%, nearly doubling liquidity, and over the last four years expanding adjusted operating margin more than 70% - all helping to drive Signet's Total shareholder return near the top of its retail peer group for the past one, three, and five years.""

Drosos said it is the right time for her retirement as the next phase of growth is planned.

""I am proud of and thankful for our team and partners. Together, we have delivered strong results and transformed Signet into a purpose-inspired and modern jewelry industry leader - creating a truly connected commerce shopping experience, a strong financial platform, and a diverse, inclusive and winning culture,"" Drosos said. ""The company is poised to deliver a brilliant future with long-term, sustainable growth. I look forward to working with J.K., the Signet team, and the board to ensure a smooth transition.""

Drosos replacement, Symancyk has more than 30 years of retail industry experience across a diverse range of categories and has spent his career in large-scale organizations. He most recently served as CEO of PetSmart, Inc. for six years, where he is credited with overseeing a growth plan and accelerating the company's leadership through proprietary brand development, services expansion, loyalty program creation, and digital and supply chain capabilities enhancements. Previously, he served as CEO of Academy Sports + Outdoors from 2015 to 2018. From 2006 to 2015, he held roles of increasing responsibility at Meijer, a supercenter chain in the Midwest. Symancyk began his career with 12 years at Walmart where he held various leadership roles, ultimately serving from 2004 to 2006 as Divisional Merchandise manager, Sam's Club Division. Symancyk currently is a member of the Retail Industry Leaders Association and serves on the Board of Directors of Bath & Body Works, Inc.

He is a graduate of the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville.

""The leadership transition announced today is the result of a thoughtful, planned succession process by Gina and our board,"" McCluskey added. ""We are excited to welcome J.K. as the company's next CEO. He is a strong leader with more than three decades of experience across the retail industry and proven expertise in driving strategic growth, focusing on the customer, and developing and sustaining high performing leadership teams that deliver results. J.K. has overseen the expansion of large-scale businesses with multi-branded portfolios as well as services businesses and brings important merchandising and operational skills to the role. We are confident he is the ideal CEO to build on the team's progress in establishing Signet as the growth and innovation leader of the jewelry industry.""

Symancyk, in the company statement, talked about his passion for serving customers. ""Signet's position as a leading global jewelry retailer with a diverse portfolio of renowned brands provides a competitively advantaged foundation for continued growth,"" he said. ""One of the key attributes that drew me to Signet is its purpose-driven and agile culture and focus on putting its team members and customers first. I am focused on working with Gina and the executive team, along with the Board, through the transition and look forward to capturing the opportunities ahead.""

In another executive move, Joan Hilson, Signet chief Financial, Strategy and Services officer will see her role expand to chief Financial and Operating Officer. In this new position, Hilson will oversee supply chain and Blue Nile and James Allen along with her current oversight of Rocksbox, finance, strategy, real estate and the services business. Hilson has served as chief financial officer of Signet since 2019.

""We are also excited to recognize Joan Hilson's contributions, particularly in creating a strong financial foundation and growing services portfolio,"" McCluskey said. ""We look forward to her making an even larger impact in her expanded role."""
Which Countries Have Been Female-Led?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/katharinabuchholz/2024/10/01/which-countries-have-been-female-led/,2024-10-01T14:32:01Z,"Claudia Sheinbaum takes office as Mexico's president today, thereby adding a country among the world's most populous to the nations that have been female-led. Sheinbaum will be Mexico's first female leader. She is also a decorated climate scientist and has been called the ""most scientifically experienced climate premier in history"". As a member of outgoing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's party, she is expected to carry on many of her predecessor's populist left-wing policies.

Sheinbaum is 62 years old, of Jewish ancestry and has won a Nobel Peace Prize together with other participants of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007. She contributed to the panel's report that year as well as in 2013 after having received her doctorate in energy engineering and having served as Minister of the Environment for Mexico City. She was also the city's mayor from 2018 to 2023.

Mexico is the 11th largest country in the world by population and the seventh biggest that has been governed by a woman. Looking at a world map of all countries that have been female-led or repeatedly female-led since 1946, the American continent as well as Europe stick out as the places that have seen several female heads of state and government.

In Latin America, more countries have also become female-led recently. As seen in data by the Council on Foreign Relations, additions to the list include Honduras, where Xiomara Castro has governed since 2022, and Peru, where Dina Boluarte has been in power since the same year. In total, 12 countries in Latin America have been female-led, but only Argentina and Haiti have been so repeatedly.

In Europe, there are more countries which have been led by female politicians more than once. This includes Switzerland, which tops the list with five female heads of state, including current president Viola Amherd. The country has an advantage, however, as presidents' terms are limited to one year and are assigned on a rotating basis.

Finland comes second with four female prime ministers or presidents, including Sanna Marin, who was premier from 2019 to 2023. Iceland has also counted four female leaders, with Vigdís Finnbogadóttir having been world's first female elected president in 1980 and the current president, Halla Tómasdóttir, also being a women. Two more women, Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir and Katrín Jakobsdóttir, served as prime ministers.

Three females prime ministers each have led the country in the United Kingdom as well as in Poland and New Zealand. Lithuania saw one female president, who is the representative of the country abroad, and two female prime ministers, who share powers with the president. In India, Indira Gandhi was the country's face as prime minister from 1966 to 1977 and again from 1980 to 1984, while two of the country's representative presidents have also been women, including current officeholder Droupadi Murmu.

South Asia stands out as the most female-led place in Asia, with Bangladesh and Sri Lanka also having seen two female leaders each -- the same number as the Philippines. Southeast Asia and East Asia have seen fewer female leaders, as has Central Asia as well as the Middle and Near East. Africa has also not experienced many female leaders despite new additions including the current prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Judith Suminwa Tuluka, the current Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan, and the current representative President of Ethiopia, Sahle-Work Zewde."
"Judge strikes down Georgia's abortion ban, but not quickly enough for some",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/judge-strikes-georgias-abortion-ban-not-quickly-enough-rcna173419,2024-10-01T14:31:15Z,"A court ruling striking down a Republican-imposed abortion ban in Georgia comes too late for Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller.

It's not every day when a judge references ""The Handmaid's Tale"" in a high-profile court ruling, but that's precisely what happened when a judge struck down Georgia's six-week abortion ban. NBC News reported:

As my colleague Lisa Rubin explained in a social media thread that's worth your time, it was quite a ruling from Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who concluded that the meaning of ""liberty"" in Georgia includes ""the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.""

McBurney added that the Republican-imposed ban was ""extreme"" in its ""narrowing of the window of time within which women have the legal ability to end a pregnancy from roughly twenty weeks (i.e., viability) down to a mere six weeks, a point at which many -- if not most -- women are completely unaware or at best unsure if they are pregnant.""

He went on to write that ""for many women, their pregnancy was unintended, unexpected, and often unknown until well after the embryonic heartbeat began. Yet that's too late under the LIFE Act's strictures: these women are now forbidden from undoing that life-altering change of circumstances -- before they even knew the change had occurred.""

""For these women, the liberty of privacy means that they alone should choose whether they serve as human incubators for the five months leading up to viability. It is not for a legislator, a judge, or a Commander from The Handmaid's Tale to tell these women what to do with their bodies during this period when the fetus cannot survive outside the womb any more so than society could -- or should -- force them to serve as a human tissue bank or to give up a kidney for the benefit of another,"" McBurney concluded.

With this in mind, women in Georgia can, for now, terminate unwanted and/or dangerous pregnancies up to 22 weeks.

But in the meantime, it's also worth emphasizing that McBurney's ruling, while heartening and progressive, comes too late for some -- because there's ample evidence to suggest that Georgia's poorly named LIFE Act was responsible for the deaths of at least two local women.

As my MSNBC colleague Sarah Posner recently explained, Amber Nicole Thurman died in 2022 after she failed to receive the medical care she needed -- because her physicians ""were terrified of committing a felony under the state's abortion ban.""

Soon after the public learned of the Thurman tragedy, we were confronted by a related story: Candi Miller also died in Georgia, and as ProPublica reported, maternal health experts have blamed Georgia Republicans' abortion ban.

GOP officials in the state have already vowed to appeal the latest ruling. Watch this space."
Zelda is the hero in this one. 'Echoes of Wisdom' flips roles in iconic franchise,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/25/nx-s1-5119337/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-video-game-hero-analysis,2024-10-01T14:16:26Z,"<iframe src=""https://www.npr.org/player/embed/nx-s1-5119337/nx-s1-97324d52-258a-4b66-801a-0200a134416b"" width=""100%"" height=""290"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" title=""NPR embedded audio player"">

The Zelda series has been around for nearly four decades, and until now, the protagonist of the mainline series has always been Link - the master sword wielding, green hat-wearing boy or man (depending on the game) who saves the world from the forces of evil and usually rescues Princess Zelda in the process.

But in the newest addition to the series, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Princess Zelda is the protagonist in a main Zelda game. Link gets trapped in a rift, so Zelda takes the lead and goes on her own adventure to save him. She uses a wand that duplicates objects instead of Link's sword and shield.

Morning Edition host Leila Fadel talked to Amanda Cote, Director of the Serious Games Certificate in the Department of Media and Information at Michigan State University and author of Gaming Sexism: Gender and Identity in the Era of Casual Video Games about the significance of Zelda being the main character for the first time.

Becoming a first-time protagonist

Cote said in the earliest games, Zelda represents a classic damsel in distress. Link is usually the one taking action within the games, protecting Zelda from the villain Ganon/Ganondorf. In past games she had times where she had agency, but Echoes of Wisdom brings it to a new level.

""But there are some moments where Zelda has taken action in the past. In Ocarina of Time, she also has her alter ego of Sheik. Where she shows up and helps Link progress through the story, helps teach him new songs and abilities, and then of course turns out to be the princess at the end,"" Cote said.

She adds that in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, you meet Zelda first as the Pirate Queen, Tetra, and then later she's revealed to be Princess Zelda.

""Even though Zelda has been somewhat active in previous Zelda titles, in the end she always returns to this more passive princess damsel in distress entity. So she takes action, but then goes back to being the goal rather than the agent,"" said Cote. ""And so having a game where she is an active agent throughout the whole game is really amping up those moments of promise that we saw in earlier titles.""

""I'm optimistic to see what this does for her... does she get to be a whole person? I hope we get to learn things about her that aren't just her role in this story, but also those little quirky bits that make characters feel like people,"" said Carly Kocurek, director of the Game Design and Experience All Media program at Illinois Institute of Technology and author of Coin-Operated Americans: Rebooting Boyhood at the Video Game Arcade.

While Cote doesn't think we'll ever get rid of the damsel in distress entirely because they're the table of some very long running series, like The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers, she thinks games are starting to be more ironic about the trope.

For example, she said, at the end of Super Mario Odyssey, Princess Peach was rescued by Mario, but decides she's over the fight between Mario and Bowser and wants to be her own woman for a while.

""So the damsel in distress trope is still there, but I think we're about to see more interesting takes on it,"" Cote said.

Is this part of a shift in the gaming industry?

Cote says Zelda being the main character is a continuation of a trend that Nintendo kicked off in the early 2000s.

""Nintendo was not competing particularly well against the PlayStation or against the Microsoft Xbox, and so they instituted what they call their blue ocean strategy. So rather than fighting over the traditional gamer market, what they called the Red Ocean, they deliberately decided to try and reach less targeted audiences... and so they started targeting women, older players, and even younger children,""

Cote said that strategy was really successful, and that Nintendo has said about half of its audience is female so they're continuing to capitalize on that.

And there has been a shift in the video game industry over the past 20 years, Kocurek said, in there being more games with female protagonists. She said the percentage of women in the industry has more than doubled in the past couple of decades, and there's a lot more women in senior roles in the gaming industry who have decision making authority.

""I think companies would be foolish at this point to think you can ignore more than half of the marketplace. Women spend more money on entertainment. Teen girls tend to spend more money on entertainment,"" said Kocurek.

Even though Nintendo instituted its ""blue ocean"" strategy so long ago, Cote said, we're only seeing Zelda as the main character now because The Legend of Zelda is a long running, extremely successful series.

""So there's always the thought of if it ain't broke, don't fix it,"" said Cote. ""Video games are a very risk averse industry... and so the thought of changing a long running successful series is a difficult one. Because what if you kill the goose that lays the golden egg?""

While we have been seeing a long term trend of more female protagonists in video games, Cote says what is changing is that we're seeing female characters introduced in a lot more genres of games.

""One of the things that women gamers have to push against is the stereotype that they are only interested in casual games - puzzle games like Candy Crush or things that have cute characters like Animal Crossing. So seeing female characters added across more genres, like GTA 6, moves us away from that stereotype and shows that diverse game audiences matter across genres and not just in these casual games,"" said Cote."
The serious crisis gripping America that no one wants to talk about,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/serious-crisis-gripping-america-no-one-wants-talk-about,2024-10-01T14:15:24Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Children growing up without fathers in the home is one of the most serious crises facing America today. The impact is devastating on spiritual, religious, and material levels. Over 80 percent of the children in my neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago do not have a father, but this not something that can be just dismissed as a ""Black thing."" It is an American epidemic.

Across the nation, 56 percent of Black children do not have a father in the home. For Latinos that number has risen to 31 percent and for whites, 21 percent. Those figures are only snapshots and the reality is that they are getting worse, not better, with every passing year.

For perspective, 89 percent of the ""post-war generation,"" including most Black families I know, had children living in homes with a mother and a father. That number has fallen to 68% today among all American families. That's millions of children being affected.

SCHOOLS ALL OVER AMERICA ARE FAILING OUR KIDS. PARENTS, THIS MESSAGE IS FOR YOU

But I am here today not to bash fatherlessness but to talk about what happens when fathers are present. Every day, I deal with some of the most amazing women who raise their kids singlehandedly. They work their butts off to put food on the table and clothe their kids. But most, if not any, can ever replicate the influence and touch of a father.

The father is part of the creation of the child and it is only natural law that he would see the child to adulthood. This role is at once sacred and a profound responsibility, one that is a higher calling. There is nothing more precious than looking into the eyes of a child of innocence, a child that comes into this world looking for love, a child that recognizes his or her father on the deepest levels.

When a father abandons that child, that bond breaks, leaving a void. Instead of love, that child grows up with that void and that child is often left, unfairly, to deal with that void alone. Some make it. Others destruct.

WHY SOCIETY IS FAILING MEN AND BOYS

In the home where a child grows up with two parents, the child witnesses love. The circle is complete. No one's home is happy all the time, but the child does not seek happiness. The child seeks love, wants to be loved, and wants to give love in return. It is love that carries families through the good and bad times and what better lesson than that to teach the child daily?

Not only that, the child learns different things from the mother and the father. The child learns the differences and the similarities. The child watches his parents negotiate, love, fight, reconcile, discuss, debate, and the child grows up understanding inside the home the basic human skills for how to navigate the world. His or her parents' relationship serves as a microcosm for how the larger society works.

Marriage is very important. I often tell young men that the most important thing they can do is marry. They ask why?

I tell them, if you love your woman, you must enter into a holy union with her. You must declare your love before witnesses in society. In doing so, you are forming a sacred bond that also serves as a social contract. This step is the foundation of the family and provides stability for any children that should come out of this union.

When a child grows up with a married couple, not only are they often better off financially, they also come to value society through the institution of marriage. They grow up knowing that certain actions have a sacredness to them. They believe in something larger than themselves and that humbles them. The child who believes in nothing is the least humble.

A father in the home, a husband in marriage, is what America needs to be preaching these days. We are not better than the humans that came before us despite our wealth and technology. They did families better than we do today. They knew that each parent played a role and it was not about feminism or machismo -- it was all about the child. And they knew, how the child goes is how society goes."
Backyard Barometers To Blockchain And AI: The SkyX Weather Revolution,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/01/backyard-barometers-to-blockchain-and-ai-the-skyx-weather-revolution/,2024-10-01T14:10:27Z,"Growing up, the weather wasn't just small talk in our house -- it was the main event. My dad's passion for meteorology -- he actually filmed for a major TV network -- turned our home into a mini weather station, complete with barometers, anemometers, and even a few strategically placed cameras to capture nature's most dramatic moments.

Little did I know that those childhood experiences would one day intersect with cutting-edge blockchain and AI technology in a way that could revolutionize how we understand and interact with the weather.

Enter Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks, or DePIN -- a concept taking the blockchain world by storm. And now, it's set to transform something as fundamental as weather forecasting. As someone who grew up pouring over wind directions before social media was a thing, this development is a compelling mix of nostalgia and innovation.

Think of DePIN as the Wikipedia of physical infrastructure. Instead of relying on centralized systems (like the weather stations I used to beg my dad to visit), DePINs harness the power of individuals. People like you and me can contribute data and maintain the network, earning rewards for our efforts. It's like if my dad could have earned crypto for all those hours he spent filming thunderstorms!

SkyX is bringing the DePIN model to weather data collection, and it's got me as excited as my dad used to get about an approaching cold front. Here's the lowdown:

Needless to say, Dad would have loved this! But it's not just for meteorological mavens. It stands to benefit everyone by transforming the accuracy of this famously unpredictable science.

As Frank Fang, the co-founder of Skyx said to me, ""The DePIN model has already proven its ability to crowdsource diverse and granular datasets quickly and at low costs. However, the result is raw, unprocessed data that requires further work to create actual value - a task that businesses may not have the funds or capacity for.""

""SkyX's platform takes care of that, offering software for generating industry-specific insights as its product. This way, we are building up on the concept of DePIN to make its value proposition even more immediate and palpable for both retail and enterprise users.""

I lost count of the times my dad used to (accurately!) predict rain for our street while the TV weatherman or -woman said it'd be sunny. This highlights a long standing problem with traditional weather forecasts: they only provide very broad-brush predictions. Watch the weather on TV, even today, and you'll see a rain or sun symbol covering your whole county or even state.

With SkyX's dense network, everyone can have an almost street-by-street-level of accuracy through hyperlocal forecasts. The weather station you've always wanted could now pay for itself through cryptoeconomic rewards, turning weather into a source of income.

From farmers to festival planners, everyone benefits from more precise weather data, making services smarter and more efficient. Better data also means better disaster preparedness, potentially saving many lives.

And with SkyX's AI interface (SkyXGPT), complex weather data could become as easy to understand as my dad's enthusiastic storm explanations, truly making weather accessible for all.

This isn't just about more accurate rain forecasts. It's about filling the gaps in our global weather monitoring system, especially in remote areas. It's the democratization of weather data -- something my dad always dreamed of when he talked about the importance of local observations.

Of course, such advanced capabilities are only possible through harnessing the most sophisticated back-end technology and infrastructure. SkyX picked peaq as their blockchain platform, and for good reason. Peaq's specialized features for DePIN applications, like robust identity management and secure data storage, are crucial for a network of verifiable weather stations. It's the solid foundation this sky-high ambition needs.

""SkyX's value proposition obviously exceeds that of an average earlier-generation data collection DePIN, which only had raw data to propose,"" said Leonard Dorlöchter, co-founder of peaq. SkyX leverages this community-contributed data to offer businesses actual analytical products ready to generate actionable insights while also rewarding the contributors. It's a sign that the wider DePIN space is maturing and is now beginning to offer the world increasingly advanced, enterprise-grade products - an offer that I am sure will be met with much interest.

Challenges and Limitations:

While promising, SkyX's approach isn't without challenges. Ensuring data quality from thousands of individual stations is a significant hurdle. There's also the question of standardization and calibration across diverse equipment types.

Additionally, regulatory frameworks for such decentralized data networks are still evolving. Privacy concerns and the potential for data manipulation are areas that SkyX and similar platforms will need to address as they grow.

As I reflect on those days spent watching the skies with my dad, I can't help but feel we're on the brink of something he could only have dreamed of. SkyX and DePIN aren't just changing weather forecasting; they're inviting all of us to become part of a global community of weather observers.

Imagine a world where every backyard weather enthusiast, every curious kid with a rain gauge, and every farmer with generations of weather wisdom can contribute to and benefit from a global weather network. It's a world where my dad's passion for local weather observations scales to a global level, powered by blockchain technology.

This isn't just about more accurate forecasts or earning crypto rewards -- though those are certainly exciting prospects. It's about creating a more connected, informed, and resilient global community. It's about empowering individuals to play a crucial role in understanding and preparing for the challenges posed by our changing climate.

With initiatives like SkyX, we're not just forecasting the weather; we're fostering a deeper, more participatory relationship with our environment. We're turning everyday weather watchers into custodians of crucial climate data, and in doing so, we're weaving a web of knowledge that spans the globe.

So, the next time you look up at the sky, remember: you're not just observing the weather. You're potentially part of a vast, decentralized network that's revolutionizing how we understand and interact with the atmospheric world around us. And who knows? The weather station you set up in your backyard today could be the source of tomorrow's life-saving forecast or groundbreaking climate research.

In the emerging horizons of blockchain-powered meteorology, we're all invited to become the weather heroes my dad always knew we could be. The future of weather forecasting isn't just in the clouds -- it's in our hands, our backyards, and our shared data. And that future? It's looking sunny with a high chance of innovation."
Katy Perry's New Album Debuts In The Top 10 On Five Charts At Once,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2024/10/01/katy-perrys-new-album-debuts-in-the-top-10-on-five-charts-at-once/,2024-10-01T14:10:23Z,"The rollout of Katy Perry's new album 143 has not gone as well as many had hoped -- likely including the singer herself. The set produced a trio of singles before it was released in full, and all of them underperformed to some extent. It looked for a time like the full-length might have been headed for a disappointing launch, but at least in the U.K., the set turned out to be a sales smash.

143 debuts inside the top 10 on no fewer than five charts in the U.K. this week. Sales powered the dance-pop project to a lofty start on all of them, though fans in the country also streamed the set in large numbers as well.

Perry's latest full-length starts its time highest on a pair of rankings, as it begins in the same position on both the Official Physical Albums and Official Vinyl Albums charts. 143 enters at No. 4 on those lists, which marks the title's loftiest placement on any roster in the United Kingdom.

Looking at all forms of purchases, 143 also reaches the Official Albums Sales chart, where it begins its time at No. 5. The studio effort is also new to the Official Albums Downloads list, as it enters that tally at No. 7.

Looking beyond just sales, Perry's 143 also manages to hit the top 10 on the U.K.'s main albums chart. On that competitive roster, which uses a methodology that combines purchase and streaming activity, the pop icon is back at No. 6.

143 reaches one more ranking in the U.K., though it's one that has nothing to do with purchases. Perry's first new full-length in several years blasts onto the Official Albums Streaming chart at No. 76. It's clear based on where the project starts on that roster that sales are largely responsible for the set's success.

As 143 debuts, the album's lead single ""Woman's World"" is on the rise, while the two more recent cuts spun off as potential hits don't succeed. That track returns to the Official Singles Sales chart at No. 97 this frame. It's also back inside the top 10 on both the Official Physical Singles (No. 7) and Official Vinyl Singles (No. 9) tallies."
Unzipping the truth: Fox Nation series reveals how Dr. Michael Baden's forensics turned cases on their heads,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/unzipping-truth-fox-nation-reveals-michael-baden-forensics-cases-heads,2024-10-01T13:49:45Z,"Fox Nation's 'The Baden Files' follows three cases that forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden helped investigate after they appeared to go cold.

Hope and justice go hand-in-hand, and Dr. Michael Baden delivered both to some families who, at one point, had neither.

The renowned forensic pathologist also saved an innocent man from a life behind bars.

How he did it is the subject of the latest Fox Nation series, ""The Baden Files.""

""In my lifetime, I performed more than 20,000 autopsies. I've been asked by Congress to investigate the deaths of very famous people like President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., but more than 99% of my work has been on lesser-known cases,"" Baden told viewers.

COLD CASES CRACKED: HOW EXPERTS ARE SOLVING HUNDREDS OF VIOLENT CRIME MYSTERIES AFTER DECADES OF NO ANSWERS

Bringing in Baden helped reawaken some cases that had appeared to go cold with time, including one that unfolded in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

After apparent murder victim Ilene Gowan's family vowed to seek justice for her, they brought in Baden to look deeper into her case.

""One particular case brought me out to the Midwest, to an investigation that was more like a puzzle - a stolen safe, a body in a ditch, a missing cell phone..."" Baden narrated.

But none of those explained what had happened to Gowan. The piece that did help? An ordinary zipper.

The first episode of ""The Baden Files"" focuses on that unconventional piece of evidence, and how it helped unravel a devastating truth - Gowan had been strangled, and her ""undetermined"" cause of death shifted to ""homicide.""

THE ROLE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE IN SOLVING TRUE CRIME CASES

""This tells me what happened. Not who done it - that's up to the police,"" Baden said, holding up a photo of the marking.

But the investigation had quickly narrowed two suspects to one that offered a damning piece of information.

HOW DO TRUE CRIME PODCASTS IMPACT PUBLIC INTEREST IN CRIMINAL CASES?

Baden also assisted with the case of Ellen Andros, a wife and mother whose death led the community to cast suspicion on her husband, an Atlantic City cop who came home from a night of drinking and discovered her dead.

As a healthy 31-year-old woman, evidence - particularly small red markings on her face - pointed to homicide. But things weren't exactly as they seemed.

""Forensic pathology provides a way to speak to the dead from beyond the grave,"" Baden said. ""And, in this case, Ellen Andros had a lot to say to me.""

The series also follows Dr. Baden's involvement in the investigation of the ""West Memphis Three,"" a case surrounding three teen boys arrested for the murder of three eight-year-old Cub Scouts in West Memphis, Arkansas in 1993.

Years later, Dr. Baden was brought into the picture, and he arrived at a conclusion that spun the original forensic analysis on its head.

""The answers are there. You just have to know what to look for."""
Fashion Brands To Check Out This Fall 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nadjasayej/2024/10/01/fashion-brands-to-check-out-this-fall-2024/,2024-10-01T13:34:43Z,"Fall fashion is here. Just as global fashion weeks are in full swing, setting trends for the upcoming Spring/Summe 2025 season, some fall trends never go out of style. Whether its tartan skirts, knee high boots, wide leg jeans or turtlenecks, some items remain timeless for your fall and winter closet.

This fall is all about neutral colors, laid back style, oversized cuts and blazers. Keep your caramel-colored wool coat and update your cozy sweater collection. Here are some brands to check out this fall, from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles, Australia, and beyond.

Luxury brand Oleada recently held a pop-up at the M.M.LaFleur in New York City, and has a whole 'back to school' vibe with their latest collection of bags, from mini bags to oversized totes and everything in between. It's really for the working woman. Some of the brand's favorites include the Reverie Tote, which has a thick, adjustable shoulder strap, and the Wavia Bag Plus, which can easily be transformed into a backpack (and is a perfect stylish bag for carryon luggage). On the brand's website, they have a work quiz that anyone can take to see what style of bag fits their work style and schedule the best.

Shoe brand Dolce Vita is becoming a fan favorite in New York City, especially since they opened their flagship store in Soho. Now, the brand just launched their new extra wide boots like, called Boots That Fit. The boots come in three different calf sizes, catering to all types of women (standard, wide, and extra wide). The boots are mainly knee-length boots, but others are shorter, too. Some of their latest styles include the Auggie Boot and the Graya boot, sized from size 6 to 13.

Artless was founded in February 2021 by creator and entrepreneur Madison Orlando, with an ode to 1990s minimalism. This brand's fall winter collection features cashmere sets in blue and purple hues -- adding an upscale touch to timeless items. ""The new collection was truly inspired by my own desire,"" said Orlando. ""I really thought about the pieces that I gravitate toward in the cooler months, focusing specifically on what I felt was missing in my own closet. I didn't own a cashmere polo and I had never really seen something like that before, so I created one. I love matching sets, so I designed a super-soft knit crewneck and pants set that is perfect for day-to-day wear, travel, or even a night out."" She adds that the Mercer Dress and matching Top are an evolution of the brand's best selling asymmetrical styles.

If any brand is an up-and-coming It Girl brand, it has to be Laud. Founded by Maddy Cloud, the brand has a deep respect of minimalistic design, comfort and quality garments. This environmentally conscious has closet staples, and offers inspiration on what to wear and how to wear it.

Semi-precious stone bracelets have come to gain popularity in recent years, thanks to the rise in spirituality. No longer do we just get our birthstone, but rather stones for symbolic purposes. In Los Angeles, Stepan Zhamkochyan hand makes gemstone bracelets, which are individually curated to each client's needs.

""The myth and lore around gemstones have been influenced over the years by a variety of cultures,"" said Zhamkochyan. ""Crystal healing was widely believed in acient Egypt, Greece and China -- philosophers and mystics have been inspired by their powers."" Get them here.

Their approach to slow fashion fills a much-needed contrast to a fast-paced work life.

A Conversation With Jessica Berman Commissioner NWSL,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2024/10/01/a-conversation-with-jessica-berman-commissioner-nwsl/,2024-10-01T13:20:55Z,"Jessica Berman was named Commissioner of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) in 2022. Since stepping in to her role as Commissioner in 2022, the NWSL under Berman's leadership has seen skyrocketing franchise valuations and sales, partnership gains, the signing of the largest-ever media rights deal for a women's sports league and most recently, the signing of a historical collective bargaining agreement that makes the NWSL the first U.S. sports league to eliminate its draft and give players full control over where they play.

In 2023, Commissioner Berman announced landmark media partnerships for domestic media distribution with CBS Sports, ESPN, Prime Video and Scripps Sports, generating record breaking distribution and revenue for the NWSL and marking a key turning point for league viewership; As of 2024, there are over 120 games that can be watched on national broadcast platforms. The NWSL continues to build momentum under Commissioner Berman. Between the 2022 - 2023 season, game attendance increased by 32%, and crowds of 10,000+ more than doubled, setting the average attendance record in 22 years of women's professional soccer in the U.S. To date in 2024, social media followers are up 198% since 2023, and the January transfer window led to a record 22 players joining the NWSL from the world's best leagues.

Commissioner Berman led the league's expansion to 15 clubs, established record valuations and reset the enterprise value of the franchises by more than 10 times. She also navigated the NWSL through a comprehensive internal investigation into abuse allegations, resulting in substantial culture reforms. In 2024, Berman was named a CNBC Changemaker, and her leadership contributed to the NWSL being named number five on Fast Company's list of the World's 50 Most Innovative Companies of 2024. She was also recognized as Sports Business Journal's Best Hire in 2022 and was named Executive of the Year by Sports Business Journal in 2024, the first woman so honored in the history of the award.

Previously, Berman was Deputy Commissioner at the National Lacrosse League as the first female deputy commissioner of a men's professional sports league, and she spent 13 years at the National Hockey League, where she contributed to collective bargaining and drove community engagement and growth. Prior to that she was a labor lawyer at Proskauer Rose LLP. A University of Michigan alum and Fordham University law graduate, Berman sits on the University of Michigan Sport Management Advisory Board and the Fordham Sports Law Forum Board of Advisors. Berman also serves on the U.S. Soccer Board of Directors, the Sports Innovation Lab Women Executive Network, and the UJA Sports for Youth Committee; is a founding member of the Pro Sports Assembly, which is dedicated to promoting diversity & inclusion in the professional sports industry; and is the Vice Chair of the Sports Integrity Global Alliance (SIGA) Advisory Board that aims to create tangible DE&I changes within sports.

We asked Commissioner Berman about the recent growth under her stewardship and future of NWSL. Below are her responses.

The NWSL's new Collective Bargaining Agreement has been called the most ""player-centric"" of any U.S. professional sports league. What are the specifics of the new CBA and the reasoning? Do you foresee other professional leagues copying the NWSL?

Our new collective bargaining agreement grants NWSL players unprecedented agency in where they play, in addition to higher compensation and increased benefits.

On ""agency"", otherwise known as choice, most significantly, we are the first professional sports league to eliminate the Draft. That means that every new player who enters our league will be able to choose where to play. We made this decision, in large part, because we compete in a global labor market for talent and there is a global framework in soccer that forms a set of expectations that we have now embraced. There is nothing standing in the way of achieving our vision: we want to be the best league in the world that attracts, retains and develops top talent.

In addition, the agreement significantly raises the minimum salary, sets aggressive increases in the annual salary cap and creates incentive alignment for players and clubs by increasing the salary cap based on increases in league revenues.

The salary cap has been negotiated into the CBA in two parts: (i) a base salary cap at prescribed levels, and (ii) a supplement that will be determined in the prior year based on media and sponsorship revenue. The base salary cap for the NWSL will nearly double over the term of the agreement, from $3.3M (2025) to $5.1M (2030), with an expectation of further increases based on the revenue sharing model, further incentivizing a collective ambition to grow the NWSL's business. The NWSL also retained the unilateral ability to raise the Base Salary Cap further at its discretion.

There is no limit for an individual player's maximum annual salary, and the league-minimum salary will more than double over the course of the CBA, rising from $48,500 in 2025 to $82,500 in 2030.

Similarly, virtually all end-of-season competition bonuses will double their current value beginning in 2027, including those awarded for the NWSL Shield and Championship winners, Best 11, Rookie of the Year, Midfielder of the Year, Defender of the Year, Goalkeeper of the Year and the NWSL's Golden Boot. The NWSL's Most Valuable Player award will quadruple.

In a groundbreaking decision for a women's league, parental leave and fertility and childcare benefits will be further expanded under the new agreement, and mental health services and mental health leave policies will be broadened. We've introduced increases in benefits for family planning, which includes but isn't limited to, IVF, freezing eggs, and fertility treatments. In addition, we institute minimum standards for the number of health professionals utilized by each club, including physicians, athletic trainers, a physical therapist, a sports scientist, a licensed mental health provider, and a massage therapist.

When it comes to other leagues, we want to be a positive disruptor and the tip of the spear to help the industry think differently, particularly about women and women in sports. The rules that have governed men's sports for decades may not always make sense for our league, and we don't want to default into what everyone else has done without examining whether it makes sense for us. We want the takeaway for our industry to be that, in order to grow the business, we should continue to innovate, pressure test assumptions, and be willing to evolve.

The new CBA runs through 2030, how important was labor stability with the next round of media rights agreement beginning in 2028?

We negotiated a new 4-year media deal in 2023 which runs from 2024-2027; the prior CBA would have expired in 2026. We saw an opportunity entering a new media rights cycle, where we could create labor stability and incentive alignment with the players to grow our business.

Further, by negotiating the CBA proactively without an impending expiration, it gave us the opportunity to work together and imagine what's possible without any external pressure. In all CBA negotiations, there are compromises and trade-offs, and the manifestation of a good deal is when everyone feels like a winner. It was a unique negotiation because the driver for everyone at the table was the opportunity to align, ensuring readiness for this next phase of growth.

How does the NWSL retain top talent with such European competitive leagues such as the Women's Soccer League in England and Spain's Liga F?

We have massive respect for the European leagues who have compelling international rivalries and continually push us to raise the bar as the global standard for women's soccer continues to rise. When it comes to the NWSL, we believe strongly in our unique value proposition, including the elements of playing in the NWSL that do not exist in the rest of the world. For example, even the existence of a collective bargaining agreement which sets minimum standards for players is unique in the global women's soccer world, not to mention the fact that our minimum standards are the highest in the world through this new agreement. We are really proud of that.

We also believe that our structure is a unique differentiator - we are completely independent of any other institution, the federation or the men's league. That is quite different from the rest of the world. Practically speaking, that means our investors are making investments solely through the lens of what is in the best interest of our league, the NWSL.

Finally, we believe our country offers unprecedented opportunities for growing players' Name Image Likeness (aka NIL). Brands are investing in women and that creates incredible monetization opportunities for players outside of the NWSL as well.

The popularity of women's basketball and women winning 26 of 40 U.S. gold medals in the Paris Olympics including the USWNT, nonetheless, a study found women's sports receive only 15% of all sports media coverage. What must be done to get broader media coverage?

In short, a relentless continuation of the initiatives that have begun to change the tides.

There is finally recognition from the industry that there is an increasing demand for women's sports content, and it's rapidly changing how women's sports teams and leagues can and should be covered. Speaking to our media deal specifically, distribution is key in ensuring our matches, teams and players are reaching global fan bases. Our media deal with CBS, ESPN, Prime Video and Scripps has us reaching exponentially more fans and a consistent basis (new and existing) while maintaining our standards for economic growth. This deal expands our reach, revenue, and relevance.

With women's sports in particular, we have a fruitful and unique opportunity to really lean into the personal stories of our athletes and share each player's remarkable journey with our fans. Our athletes are fearless in their willingness to be authentic and vulnerable, and our media rights deal gives them the platform they deserve to educate and inspire a wider swath of fans.

With Robert Iger and Willow Bay acquiring a controlling stake in Angel FC for $250 million in July, the franchise is now the most valuable women's sports team in the world. Some professional leagues, including most recently the NFL, are allowing for private equity firms to invest in franchises. What ownership rules does the NWSL have with PE investors?

As we have seen an exponential increase in team valuations and the desire for institutional capital to invest in sports, we took steps earlier this year to establish clear guidelines around PE investors. Under our policy, no single PE fund can have passive ownership in more than 3 teams; a single fund can own minimum 5% and maximum 20% of a team, but no team can have more than 30% of equity from PE funds; and funds with multiple team investments need to have minimum capital. This provides clear guidance to the marketplace about the parameters under which we will consider institutional capital."
Son Na-Eun Explores Complex Family Dynamics In 'Romance In The House',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanmacdonald/2024/10/01/son-na-eun-explores-complex-family-dynamics-in-romance-in-the-house/,2024-10-01T12:48:30Z,"When Mi-rae's father shows up years after his presumed death it's not a heartwarming reunion. Mi-rae, played by Son Na-eun in Romance In The House, has become even more protective of her mother and younger brother in the years since her parents' divorce and her father's disappearance. She remembers her father's well-intentioned but poorly-thought-out financial schemes that led the family to bankruptcy and divorce. Mi-rae watched her mother Ae-yeon, played by Kim Ji-soo, suffer because of his mistakes. So, when Moo-jin, played by Ji Jin-hee, tries to win over her mother, she's understandably wary.

""Mi-rae experiences a complex blend of love and hatred for her father, Moo-jin, stemming from the pain he caused her in childhood,"" said Son. ""Growing up without a father figure, she became a steadfast support for her mother, Ae-yeon, and a trusting big sister to her younger brother, Hyeon-jae. This environment forced her to mature quickly, transforming her into a Wonder Woman who lives and sacrifices for her family. As the story unfolds Mi-rae gradually untangles her feelings of resentment towards her father and I encourage audiences to pay close attention to how this emotional journey develops.""

Son was intrigued by the script for the SLL drama and the way the story evoked the complicated feelings that linger in a family after a divorce.

""Though Mi-rae's story revolves around her long-standing love-hate relationship with her father, it ultimately tells a tale of family,"" said Son. ""This dynamic is both compelling and captivating. Romance in the House is not your typical love triangle; instead, it's a melodrama featuring an ex-dad, a mother, and a daughter -- a refreshing take that feels new and inviting for me. As the eldest daughter in my own family, I found the script deeply relatable. I wanted to convey a range of emotions while embodying the character of Mi-rae, hoping to share this journey with viewers who might also find solace and connection within it.""

While filming the drama the cast quickly began to feel like family. Son became very close with her drama mother.

""Ae-yeon, Mi-rae's mother, is the one with whom she feels most at ease,"" said Son. ""Before filming began, we nurtured our bond by frequently strolling along the Han River and spending quality time together. This effort allowed me to genuinely see her as a real mom on set from a certain point. The drama also captures moments of tension and conflict between the father, Moo-jin, and the younger brother, Hyeon-jae. I believe that the relaxed and harmonious atmosphere we created on set enabled us to authentically convey the complex emotions of joy, sadness, and frustration that accompany family dynamics.""

One of the challenges Son found in playing Mi-rae was the range of emotions her character experiences toward her father. Son devoted considerable time to exploring those emotions.

""For a long time, she harbors deep resentment alongside love for him, but as she navigates various events, her feelings gradually soften,"" said Son. ""I carefully contemplated how to delicately convey this emotional journey, conducting research and engaging in in-depth discussions with the director. Above all, watching Moo-jin's performance on set allowed me to connect and synchronize with him, enriching our scenes together.""

Father and daughter take a while to reconnect and regain trust. That made it a rewarding role to play.

""As an actor, I find it fulfilling and rewarding to showcase different sides of myself through various characters, and portraying Mi-rae in Romance in the House has deepened my enjoyment of acting,"" said Son. ""I felt joy each time I connected with Mi-rae -- who is more relatable and grounded than glamorous -- and witnessed her growth as she became stronger step by step. I am especially grateful to hear that viewers fully empathized with Mi-rae and offered their unwavering support.""

Son, also known simply as Naeun, is both an actress and a singer, having debuted with the girl group Apink. Her recent dramas include Lost, Cinderella with Four Knights Dinner Mate, Ghost Doctor and Agency. The SLL drama Romance in the House also stars SHINee's Choi Min-ho as Mi-rae's love interest and Astro's Yoon San-ha as her younger brother. The drama airs on Netflix."
The 2024 Forbes 400 List Of Wealthiest Americans: Facts And Figures,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2024/10/01/the-2024-forbes-400-list-of-wealthiest-americans-facts-and-figures/,2024-10-01T10:03:24Z,"Inside Forbes' ranking of the richest billionaires in the United States.

Forbes calculated fortunes using stock prices from September 1, 2024.

's a record-smashing year for America's 400 richest people. After adding nearly $1 trillion to their fortunes over the past 12 months, The Forbes 400 are worth a collective $5.4 trillion, by far the most ever. It now takes a record $3.3 billion to make the list, up from $2.9 billion in 2023.

In general, the richer you were, the richer you got. Just 25 people -- a dozen of them worth $100 billion or more -- are responsible for $500 billion of the gains. These top 25 now holds more than $2.5 trillion in wealth, nearly half the list's total net worth.

The richest person in America, for the third straight year, is Elon Musk, who is worth an estimated $244 billion. Despite dropping $7 billion in wealth over the past year amid sputtering Tesla stock and an ongoing battle over his $56 billion stock options package, Musk remains some $47 billion ahead of No. 2 Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, who is worth an estimated $197 billion. Mark Zuckerberg (estimated net worth: $181 billion) climbed from No. 8 last year to No. 3 in 2024 thanks to the huge rebound in shares of Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.

Alice Walton continues her reign as the richest woman in the U.S., her ninth time in a decade. With shares of Walmart, which her father Sam Walton (d. 1992) cofounded in 1962, up by 41% in the past year, she's worth an estimated $89.2 billion, good for No. 15 overall. Walton is one of just 67 women on The Forbes 400, up from 60 last year.

As a group, the list's women are worth a combined $839 billion, compared to $621 billion in 2023. Diane Hendricks ($21.9 billion) remains the wealthiest self-made woman in America, one of a record 13 women on the list who built -- rather than inherited -- their fortune.

Overall, 67% of The Forbes 400 is self-made, meaning they founded their own company or helped build one, though some traveled much longer and tougher paths to great wealth than others. Forbes once again assigned everyone on the list a self-made score, from 1 to 10, with 10 being the true rags-to-riches stories. Those remain rare -- just 25 out of the 400.

Despite it requiring more money than ever to make the list, 23 billionaires were able to elbow their way into the ranks this year. These newcomers include Todd Graves ($9.5 billion), who created the Raising Cane's fast food chain; Peter Cancro ($5.6 billion), who built and runs Jersey Mike's Subs; Jayshree Ullal ($4.4 billion), the CEO of cloud networking firm Arista Networks; Leonid Radvinsky ($3.8 billion), the owner of OnlyFans; and Alex Karp ($3.6 billion), the cofounder and CEO of data mining company Palantir.

Another 11 people who fell off a previous Forbes 400 list returned to the ranks this year. The most notable: Donald Trump ($4.3 billion), who has ridden the volatile stock price of Truth Social parent-company Trump Media & Technology Group back onto the list, part of a broader ploy to wring billions in wealth out of his political career.

These newcomers and returnees displaced several less-fortunate billionaires who lost their spot among the nation's richest people. Among this year's 30 drop-offs: Vince McMahon ($2.5 billion), who stepped down as executive chairman of WWE-parent company TKO Holdings in January amid sexual assault allegations, which he has denied. Aneel Bhusri ($3.2 billion) of software firm Workday, meanwhile, is one of ten 2023 400 members who got richer over the past year but were displaced by better-performing billionaires.

They join a growing list of American billionaires who are simply too poor to make the cut. For the first time ever, there are more American billionaires not on The Forbes 400 than there are on it: 415 and counting. That includes plenty of famous faces. Arnold Schwarzenegger ($1 billion) is not rich enough for this list. Neither are Jerry Seinfeld ($1.1 billion), Bruce Springsteen ($1.1 billion), Taylor Swift ($1.3 billion) or Oprah Winfrey ($3 billion).

The youngest member of the ranks is Walmart heir Lukas Walton, who is 38 years old and worth an estimated $33.9 billion. Venture capitalist and real estate mogul Josh Kushner ($3.8 billion), 39, is the only other listee under the age of 40. On average, the members of the 2024 Forbes 400 are 70 years old. The eldest is Dole Food Company's David Murdock ($3.7 billion), who is 101.

The richest Americans' net worths have skyrocketed, but their generosity has not. Forbes once again investigated the lifetime charitable giving of every member of the list. A third have donated less than 1% of their fortunes so far, earning a lowly 1 on the Forbes philanthropy score; only ten people -- 2.5% of the list -- have given away 20% of their riches or more, earning the highest mark, a 5."
The 2024 Forbes 400: The 25 Wealthiest People In America,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2024/10/01/the-2024-forbes-400-the-25-wealthiest-people-in-america/,2024-10-01T10:02:49Z,"was another great year to be rich, especially for the select few at the very top. With markets roaring, nearly all of the 25 wealthiest people in America got wealthier over the past 12 months -- some by billions, or even tens of billions, of dollars.

In all, the top 25 billionaires on The Forbes 400 list are worth a collective $2.5 trillion. They hold nearly half of the $5.4 trillion in total wealth of the entire 400.

This elite group is $471 billion richer than in 2023, with each of the top 25 up 31% on average, outpacing the 18% jump in wealth across list members overall and the S&P 500's 27% return.

Much of the gains come from two people: Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, who added $75 billion to his net worth thanks to rebounding Meta stock, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang, who has ridden the AI wave to $63.3 billion in additional wealth since the 2023 ranking. They're two of a record 12 members of The Forbes 400 who are also in the $100 Billion Club, the lucky group of tycoons whose fortunes stretch a dozen digits.

Most of these 25 were among the top 25 last year, too. But there are three fresh faces: traders Jeff Yass (who ranked No. 28 in 2023) and Thomas Peterffy (who was No. 27), plus Walmart heir Lukas Walton, who jumped from No. 31 last year to No. 25 in 2024 on the back of the retailer's rising stock. They replace MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Jeff Bezos, who continues to give away her fortune; Miriam Adelson, whose shares of casino operator Las Vegas Sands have hit a cold streak; and investor Len Blavatnik, whose stock in Warner Music Group is worth less than a year ago. Zuckerberg jumped five spots, to No. 3; Huang jumped six, to No. 11.

Only three members of the top 25 got poorer over the past year: Elon Musk, whose fortune dropped by $7 billion but who remains the richest person in America; Bill Gates, after we increased our estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement with Melinda French Gates; and Phil Knight, following a rough run for Nike stock since last year.

Here are the top 25 members of the 2024 Forbes 400 list:

One of Sam Walton's eight grandchildren, he inherited an estimated 4% stake in Walmart from his father, John Walton, who died in a 2005 plane crash. Lukas, who survived childhood cancer, founded and runs Builders Vision, a sustainability-focused philanthropic and impact-investing platform that has doled out more than $3 billion since launching in 2021. He is one of just two Forbes 400 members under age 40 (the other: VC investor Josh Kushner, No. 347, who is 39). His mother, Christy Walton (No. 48), cosigned a letter urging President Biden to withdraw from the 2024 election in July and has been fundraising for Kamala Harris. Two members of the family's third generation still sit on Walmart's board: Jim's son Steuart Walton (Lukas' first cousin) and Rob's son-in-law Greg Penner, who is chairman.

""On the doorsteps of the Olympic Games,"" Knight wrote this summer in a letter to U.S. athletes, whose jerseys Nike designed, ""we need to reignite the passion, desire and the want to win."" His sportswear giant could use a pep talk, too. Nike stock is down 15% since last year, making Knight, who created the company with his University of Oregon track coach in 1964, one of just three in the Top 25 to be poorer than in 2023.

Peterffy is more than $10 billion richer than last year as shares of Interactive Brokers Group, the electronic trading firm he founded in 1993, rose 30%. The company booked $4.3 billion in revenue last year, a 42% year-over-year increase. Since he failed to persuade Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin to enter the Republican presidential primary race, Peterffy, a longtime supporter of free-market policies, has kept quiet on Trump's reelection bid.

Griffin's hedge fund, Citadel, the most profitable of all time, raked in $8.1 billion in trading profits last year. Since then, Griffin, never one to leave money idle, has donated $50 million to the University of Miami, dropped $45 million on a Stegosaurus skeleton (a record price in the dinosaur auction business) and shelled out more than $90 million for an estate in Saint-Tropez, France.

In August, Schwarzman and his wife announced plans to open their Miramar estate in Newport, Rhode Island, to the public as a museum upon their deaths. They spent $27 million on the Gilded Age mansion in 2021 and have been restoring it ever since. In May, Schwarzman, the cofounder and CEO of $1 trillion (assets) investment firm Blackstone, announced he's backing Trump for president, two years after vowing to support someone else in 2024.

In August, their Mars Inc. announced it's gobbling up snack and cereal maker Kellanova (formerly Kellogg's) for $35.9 billion. The deal will put brands like Pringles, Pop-Tarts and Froot Loops under the Mars umbrella alongside Snickers, M&M's and Kind bars. It's the company's biggest acquisition since it bought Wrigley in 2008 for $23 billion. The Mars siblings own an estimated two-thirds of the $50 billion (2023 revenue) business but have no role in daily operations.

Yass' fortune nearly doubled after Forbes revalued his trading firm, Susquehanna International Group -- and Yass' share of profits -- based on tax returns leaked to ProPublica. With a potential TikTok ban threatening Susquehanna's estimated 15% stake in the social media app, Yass has made nearly $70 million of federal political contributions during the 2024 election cycle, including $20.5 million to the Club for Growth Action, a conservative super PAC that has publicly opposed the TikTok ban (but denies having been influenced by Yass).

In June, Koch Industries became Koch, Inc., as Charles rebranded the increasingly tech-focused $125 billion (revenue) conglomerate for the first time since taking over the family firm after his father's 1967 death. Julia Koch, the widow of his brother David (d. 2019), and her three children paid nearly $700 million that same month for 15% of BSE Global, which owns the NBA's Brooklyn Nets and the WNBA's New York Liberty and operates the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.

Rob Walton retired from Walmart's board in June after more than four decades as a director of the firm his father Sam Walton (d. 1992) cofounded in 1962. He and his siblings' estimated 35% stake in the retail giant is worth more than ever as shoppers flock to Walmart's ""Every Day Low Price"" strategy to escape high inflation, driving both its revenue and shares to all-time highs. Jim still chairs the family's $26 billion (assets) Arvest Bank Group. Alice, the richest woman in America for the ninth time in 10 years, reclaimed the title of the world's wealthiest woman in early September from L'Oréal heiress Françoise Bettencourt Meyers of France for the first time since May 2022.

Dell scored his biggest payday ever in November, when semiconductor giant Broadcom acquired his cloud computing spinoff VMware; Dell swapped his 39% stake for an estimated $33 billion in cash and Broadcom shares. Around that time, he put $3.6 billion in cash and stock into his family's charitable foundation and pumped at least $500 million into a donor-advised fund. Dell's net worth is up 40% this year, thanks to 90% and 64% jumps in Broadcom and Dell Technologies share prices, respectively.

Huang keeps climbing into rarer air: He has added $63.3 billion to his fortune, pushing him up six more notches on The Forbes 400 (he jumped 31 spots last year), on the back of a 162% rise in Nvidia shares. As his wealth grows, so does his celebrity: Paparazzi followed his every move on a trip to his native Taiwan this summer -- a phenomenon termed ""Jensanity."" Huang cofounded Nvidia, which designs and sells more chips used for artificial intelligence systems than any other company, in 1993 and has served as CEO and president since.

The former mayor of New York City and cofounder of financial-data and media firm Bloomberg LP was awarded the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by President Biden in May. Over the next three months, Bloomberg announced $1.6 billion of gifts to the medical schools of his alma mater, Johns Hopkins, and four historically Black colleges.

The Microsoft cofounder's rank is lower than it has been in 34 years, due mostly to a new Forbes estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement. In September, Netflix released a five-episode series called What's Next? The Future with Bill Gates, which tackles topics including AI and income inequality. In February 2025, he's set to publish a memoir, Source Code. TerraPower, the next-generation nuclear power company he cofounded in 2008, broke ground on a demonstration plant in Wyoming in June. That same month, his ex-wife, Melinda, resigned as co-chair of the couple's Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and walked away with $12.5 billion for her own philanthropy.

""Damn, I'm fired up!"" exclaimed Ballmer in August at the grand opening of his Los Angeles Clippers' new 18,000-seat Intuit Dome stadium, which boasts a 38,000-square-foot circular scoreboard. He bought the Clippers a decade ago for a then-record $2 billion after running Microsoft as CEO for 14 years, and spent $2 billion of his own money on the new stadium; Forbes now values the team at more than $4.6 billion.

Net worth: $136 billion | Source of wealth: Google | Age: 51

A federal judge ruled in August that Page and Brin's Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search, which is responsible for 57% of parent company Alphabet's sales. (The tech giant reportedly plans to appeal.) Shares hit an all-time high in July thanks to Google's continued push into generative AI and cloud services, including a partnership with Oracle, before slipping in recent months.

More than seven decades in, the investing legend is staying plenty busy. In August, Berkshire Hathaway became America's first non-tech company to hit $1 trillion in market capitalization. In June, Buffett -- the nation's greatest philanthropist, with some $60 billion in lifetime giving -- donated $5.3 billion of Berkshire stock, with a twist: He clarified that the vast majority of his remaining fortune will go to a charitable trust run by his three children, instead of the Gates Foundation, as was previously assumed.

It was another banner year for the Oracle cofounder, chief technology officer and more than 40% shareholder, with the software firm's shares up 12% to record highs. He's spending accordingly: Ellison splashed out nearly $300 million on a Florida resort in August, adding to his $2 billion-plus real estate portfolio. He also plans to invest a reported $6 billion into the on-again-off-again merger between Paramount Global and Skydance, his son David's media production company.

No one got richer over the past year, in sheer dollar terms, than Zuck. He's $75 billion wealthier, and ranks five spots higher, following a 75% runup in Meta Platforms stock. Revenue has been growing more than 20% per quarter, and the social media giant repurchased $31 billion of its shares over the past year. Zuckerberg, who turned 40 in May, has taken on a new look, sporting a gold chain, letting his wavy hair grow out and ditching his uniform hoodie for a shearling jacket. He also surprised his wife, Priscilla, with a seven-foot-tall statue in her likeness.

Since last summer, Bezos has snapped up three homes on Miami's ""billionaire bunker"" island for $234 million. He has the cash: Since moving to tax-friendly Florida last November, the Amazon founder has offloaded more than $8 billion (pretax) of his shares; he still owns 9% of the e-commerce Leviathan, whose stock is up 29%. The Bezos Earth Fund, through which he has given $2 billion of a $10 billion pledge, will hand out up to $100 million to winners of an AI for Climate and Nature challenge beginning later this year.

Tesla's self-proclaimed ""technoking"" tops The Forbes 400 for the third straight year, despite losing $7 billion as shares of his electric vehicle maker fell 14% and a Delaware judge voided $56 billion of his stock options in January. In May, Musk's new AI startup, xAI, raised $6 billion at a $24 billion valuation. A month later, his rocket maker, SpaceX, launched a tender offer valuing the company at around $210 billion, up from nearly $180 billion. In an X post seen by 220 million, Musk endorsed Donald Trump within an hour of the assassination attempt on the former president. Trump now vows to name Musk to a new government efficiency commission if elected."
The Richest Woman In America 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdurot/2024/10/01/the-richest-woman-in-america-2024/,2024-10-01T10:02:35Z,"or the ninth time in a decade, Alice Walton-the only daughter of late Walmart founder Sam Walton-is the richest woman on this year's Forbes 400 ranking of the wealthiest people in America.

With shoppers flocking to Walmart's ""Every Day Low Prices"" to escape high inflation, the retailer's stock is up 41% since the 2023 Forbes 400, pushing the 74-year-old Walton's net worth to an estimated $89.2 billion, up from $66.5 billion. She is $15 billion richer than the second-richest woman in the U.S., Julia Koch -- who inherited 42% of privately held conglomerate Koch, Inc. (formerly known as Koch Industries) from her husband David Koch (d. 2019), and who briefly took Walton's title as America's wealthiest woman in 2022.

Walton, who ranks No. 15 on The Forbes 400 overall, is now within spitting distance of becoming the second-ever female centibillionaire. L'Oréal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, who is a citizen of France, joined the $100 billion club in June but fell to around $88 billion on September 4, when Walton briefly surpassed her to become the world's richest woman for the first time since May 2022. (Bettencourt Meyers reclaimed the title on September 26, with an estimated $92.6 billion fortune.)

Despite selling more than $28 billion of Walmart stock over the past decade -- and giving away more than $11 billion of the retailer's shares -- Sam Walton's heirs still own nearly 45% of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based behemoth, due to significant stock buybacks that have prevented the family's stake from being diluted. Forbes estimates that three-quarters of the clan's stock is split almost evenly between Alice Walton and her siblings Jim (No. 13 on this year's list, worth an estimated $95.9 billion) and Rob Walton (No. 14, $94.3 billion). Most of the rest of the Walton family fortune belongs to the heirs of their brother John Walton (d. 2005): his widow Christy Walton (No. 48, $16.4 billion) and their son Lukas Walton (No. 25, $33.9 billion).

The youngest of Sam Walton's four children, Alice Walton was 12 years old when her father opened the first Walmart store in Rogers, Arkansas in 1962. She worked briefly at the family retailer, as a buyer of children's clothes, after graduating from Trinity University in Texas in 1971, before taking a job in New Orleans as a stockbroker for E.F. Hutton. Walton returned to Bentonville during the 1980s to run investment operations at her family's Arvest Bank, before launching a lending and brokerage shop of her own called Llama with $19.5 million of family money. When Llama shut down in 1998, Walton moved back to Texas and shifted her focus to curating art.

She chaired the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville for a decade, before handing the reins to her nephew Tom Walton's wife, Olivia Walton, in 2021. Alice is credited with founding the museum, which sits on 120 acres and features works by the likes of Andy Warhol and Georgia O'Keeffe, after realizing there wasn't anything like it within 300 miles of her family's hometown. Nearly all of the $1.6 billion it cost to open the facility in 2011 came from trusts in the names of her late brother John Walton and mother Helen Walton (d. 2007).

Alice Walton has ramped up her own philanthropy over the past decade, however, pouring more than $5.7 billion into five family charitable foundations that have doled out more than $1.1 billion of her funds to date. That includes an estimated $380 million gifted through the Walton Family Foundation (which her parents founded on Walmart's 25th anniversary in 1987) to organizations focused on education reform, the environment and the region surrounding Bentonville. It also includes more than $375 million that Alice's Art Bridges Foundation has spent acquiring and loaning out works of American art to more than 230 museums across the country -- including the Art Institute of Chicago, the MoMA in New York City and the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. -- since its founding in 2016.

Walton is also seeking accreditation for a new Alice L. Walton School of Medicine in Bentonville that will ""enhance traditional medical education with the arts, humanities, and whole health principles."" If all goes according to plan, the school will enroll its inaugural class of four-year MD candidates in 2025.

""Over the past several years, I've founded new organizations focused on the arts as well as health and well-being,"" Walton said in a press release announcing her retirement as chair of the Crystal Bridges museum in 2021. ""I'd like to focus more fully on my board chair roles at these entities."""
"Justice Department No. 3 official pledges to fight hate crimes, fueled by personal story",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/g-s1-25489/justice-department-hate-crimes-ben-mizer,2024-10-01T09:17:21Z,"Benjamin Mizer, with Attorney General Merrick Garland (left), speaks during a press conference announcing an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in March 2024. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images hide caption

When the Justice Department's third-in-command announced nearly $30 million in new federal funds to fight the rise in hate crimes last week, he paused to share a personal reflection.

Ben Mizer told the audience he was ""almost exactly the same age"" as Matthew Shepard would have been, another young gay man living in a small college town in the late 1990s. Attackers beat Shepard, tied him to a fence and left him to die in 1998, striking fear and horror across the nation. The law named after him -- and passed more than a decade later -- gave the federal government new tools to prosecute people who are fueled by hate.

""What I would say to members of the LGBTQ community is that the Justice Department is working day and day out on their behalf to ensure that their rights and dignity are protected,"" Mizer said in a recent interview. ""And I'm proud to be a member of that community and at a senior level of the department.""

The FBI reported more than 11,000 hate crimes in 2023, including a steep increase in anti-Jewish and anti-Black incidents. Mizer and other Justice Department leaders have been targeting those and other crime problems with a two-pronged approach: prosecuting offenders and making financial investments in public safety. The Justice Department administers billions in federal grants. Its Office of Justice Programs has already invested more than $70 million into fighting hate crimes over the past several years.

Mizer, 47, oversees an enormous portfolio at the DOJ, from antitrust and the environment to civil rights. In recent weeks, he's helped launch a lawsuit against the operators of a ship that brought down Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge; announce a settlement over the Norfolk Southern train carrying toxic chemicals that derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, not far from where he spent his childhood; and bring blockbuster antitrust cases against Apple, Ticketmaster and Visa.

""I think economic justice means ensuring that everyone has a fair shake, that the playing field is level and that corporations are not using their power in unfair ways to harm competition or to harm consumers,"" Mizer said.

The son of two union workers, Mizer said he went to law school at the University of Michigan to ""help the little guy."" Since then, Mizer has served as solicitor general in his home state of Ohio, and had two separate stints at the Justice Department in Washington.

In the Obama years, Mizer helped implement a U.S. Supreme Court decision that invalidated the Defense of Marriage Act, a law that defined marriage as between one man and one woman. He sat in on the oral argument at the high court for another case, Obergefell v. Hodges, that ultimately legalized same-sex marriage.

""My husband and I enjoy the benefits of the tremendous advances that were made with respect to gay rights during the Obama era,"" Mizer said. ""But that is not to say that those battles are completely won.""

Mizer said he's proud of the work the DOJ has done to challenge state laws that could deprive transgender people of gender-affirming care -- and to protect women's rights to travel to secure health care including abortion services.

It's not clear whether Mizer will stick around at Justice, in the event Vice President Harris wins the White House. But he said working at DOJ has been ""the honor of a lifetime."""
'Economy way better under Trump': Black voters share if they were better off 4 years ago,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/economy-way-better-under-trump-black-voters-share-were-better-off-4-years-ago,2024-10-01T09:09:05Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Black voters across several states spoke with Fox News Digital about whether they were far better off 4 years ago under former President Trump. Voters from Atlanta, Chicago, and Detroit shared if their financial situations had improved or gotten worse since the Biden-Harris administration took over.

One Black man from Chicago said that he has been ""shaking"" under the current economy.

""[The economy has gotten] really moreso worse. A lot of stuff hasn't really been getting better,"" Emmanuel told Fox News Digital. ""Everything went up.""

""Inflation has been terrible. And the person that was in the office there, he wasn't really doing too much for us,"" Atlanta resident Marcellus said.

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

""When Trump was in office, it was gas prices that were lower,"" he added.

However, several voters said because Harris has not served as president, led them to believe she still has a chance to prove herself.

""Kamala, from my understanding, has never really been in office as the president like that ... she has been vice president,"" said Porter, a student at Harold Washington College in Chicago.

Porter, who lived in the Windy City his entire life, said ""I would say that I would have no answer for that. But I believe that when Kamala is elected towards office, her policies and what she believes in will better fit my needs as a person.""

Anneliese, another Chicago resident, said that she ""was absolutely not better under the Trump presidency.""

""Well, I wasn't under Kamala's leadership as president. I was under her vice presidency, so she was never president. Some people also get that messed up,"" she said. ""Ever since Trump started running, I experienced a lot more ... racial discrimination, gender discrimination. And I can't speak to the Kamala presidency because she hasn't been president yet.""

In Atlanta, Tim, raised the fact that Harris has never served as president.

""That's a question that we don't know yet. Right? Kamala not even in office yet, so we can't speak on it,"" Tim said. ""We just want to speak from what we can see, we have experience living under. So I guess you won't have to just wait for Kamala and see what Trump did.""

'HE HAS A WAY OF CONNECTING WITH OUR PEOPLE': SOUTHSIDE CHICAGO RESIDENT BELIEVES TRUMP IS GAINING SUPPORT

Over in Michigan, Black voters weighed in on whether they were better off under either candidate, with one of them saying that Harris ""did not do anything.""

Ithmamqureshi told Fox News Digital that he was better off under Trump.""Obviously, life was better and all that,"" Ithmamqureshi, a student in Detroit and Hamtramck native, told Fox News Digital. ""The economy was better ... life was better. COVID did take a hit and change everything to the fullest. But I would say life was better before 2020.""

""I want be biased, but I want to say I think its time for history to be made. I just think that its going to be a woman president,"" Detroit resident Mandela said.

""Trump. Them [stimulus checks] was fire tho,"" east side Detroit resident Keandre said. ""Definitely, when Trump was in office, it was gas prices that were lower."""
Tim Walz's state became a 'trans refuge.' Here's what that means and how it happened,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5103113/minnesota-trans-refuge-walz-vance-transgender-rights,2024-10-01T09:07:05Z,"MINNEAPOLIS -- As Gov. Tim Walz prepares to debate Sen. JD Vance Tuesday night, Minnesota's status as a ""trans refuge"" state will likely be in the spotlight.

""He's very heavy into transgender, anything transgender he thinks is great,"" former President Trump said on Fox the day after Walz was announced as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate. (Trump has pledged, if elected, to end gender-affirming care for youth nationally.)

In Arizona earlier this month, Vance falsely claimed the ""trans refuge"" law Walz signed allows the state to ""take children away from their parents if their parents don't want to do sex changes."" He added, ""that is not small government, that is disgusting, and he should be ashamed of himself.""

Here's what the ""trans refuge"" law in Minnesota is, how it's working, and how involved Walz was in getting the law passed.

The first thing to understand about how politically purple Minnesota came to pass this law, is that in 2022, voters elected Democratic majorities in both houses of the legislature and the governorship. It was the first Democratic trifecta in a decade, and lawmakers came in with a list of priorities.

Making the state a ""trans refuge"" wasn't on that list. But freshman Rep. Leigh Finke, the first transgender member of Minnesota's state legislature, made sure it was added.

""I knew that we had to do something because the national, coordinated anti-trans wave was building steam,"" Finke says. In 2023, between January and May, 15 states across the country enacted laws banning gender-affirming care for youth, including Minnesota's neighboring states of Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota.

""The dominoes fell in 2023,"" Finke says. ""The self-evident urgency became clear to the members of the Minnesota legislature.""

Walz, from the governor's mansion, was an active ally in the effort to protect transgender people in the state and not a newcomer to the issues, Finke says. ""Walz is a teacher and his history includes being the Gay Straight Alliance advisor at Mankato West [high school],"" she points out. ""People who are around young people and have seen what it means to deny people their authentic fullness -- they understand it.""

He was ""clear eyed in his support for this all along,"" Finke says, and quickly signed an executive order to put some protections in place in case the bill didn't get through the legislature. Because her party had only a very slim majority, Finke says she spoke to ""every single Democrat in the legislature -- and some of them for hours and hours,"" about the bill and its importance.

The day of the vote in the House, protestors arguing for and against the bill filled the state house. Debate on the floor was contentious and many hours long. ""We voted at 5:45 in the morning in the House -- it was a filibuster situation -- and everybody stayed up and made it happen,"" she said. In the end, the bill passed in both the house and the senate, and only two Democrats across the legislature voted against it, she says. ""I feel incredibly proud and grateful.""

Walz signed the bill in front of cameras. As he signed, he said ""Love wins,"" and handed one pen to preteen Hildie Edwards, who had testified in support of the law, and another to Rep. Finke.

The text of the law protects the privacy of both patients and clinicians when it comes to gender-affirming care in Minnesota.

""If you are trying to access health care for transition-related reasons, you can access that care in the state of Minnesota no matter where you live, and while you are in the state of Minnesota, our laws will protect you,"" Finke explains.

The law also protects medical providers from out-of-state subpoenas. Finke points to how Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton tried to get medical records for transgender Texans from Seattle Children's Hospital. ""Under our bill, the attorney general is tasked with protecting people in Minnesota to receive gender-affirming care,"" she says, so hospitals and doctors in the state don't need to worry about that kind of effort.

The law does not regulate the care itself -- it was already legal in Minnesota, and the details of a patient's treatment are governed by standards of care, and by an individual's choices, made in consultation with their family and doctor.

One provision of the law concerns custody cases, which Vance pointed to when he claimed the state of Minnesota could kidnap kids. ""There's nothing like that anywhere around this law -- it's a made up lie,"" Finke says. The bill allows certain custody cases to be heard in family court in Minnesota and judges to issue temporary orders, but it does not determine which parent gets custody or hand custody to the state. ""The state cannot claim jurisdiction or custody of a child,"" she says. ""Of course it can't.""

Since Minnesota's trans refuge law was in response to anti-trans legislation in states across the country, the circumstances are ""much more tragic than celebratory,"" Finke says.

Many trans people and their families living in states with bans feel like they're being driven out. ""Hundreds of people and families within the first six months moved to Minnesota -- I'm sure that's a major undercount,"" Finke says. ""And I know as the election comes, we're getting more and more."" She says trans people and their families are worried about what another Trump presidency could mean for their rights, not just in relation to health care access, but also military service, housing and employment discrimination, among other issues.

Since Minnesota's law took effect last spring, it has affected health care providers in the state. Children's Minnesota, which runs a gender program for youth, has seen an increase of about 30% in calls from patients in neighboring states. The hospital tells NPR their waitlist is about a year long for new patients, and they have hired new clinicians to keep up with demand. Family Tree Clinic, a Minneapolis provider of gender-affirming care, has begun a program to help train more physicians on this kind of care around the state.

Some families who can't relocate end up driving hundreds of miles to see gender-affirming care providers in Minnesota. One Minneapolis doctor told NPR he currently has 15 patients who do so.

On the presidential campaign trail, Walz isn't shy about his support for LGBTQ+ rights.

He headlined the recent Human Rights Campaign annual dinner and proudly enumerated the ways that both he and Harris have supported LGBTQ+ rights through their careers. He told the crowd, as he has said many times on the campaign trail, that there's a saying in Minnesota: ""Everything works better if you just mind your own damn business and I'll mind mine.""

""That's truly a long standing Minnesota value here,"" says Finke, who was born and raised in the state. ""People don't necessarily want to get involved, for better or worse, in their neighbors' lives, and that has allowed us to do a lot of good progressive work.""

""Some of the earliest trans action for civil rights was done here,"" she adds. ""In 1978, there was a case argued by the ACLU for a trans woman in the Army to be able to stay and keep her job. We were the first state to protect trans people in our Human Rights Act. It's always just been a part of the fabric here.""

Rep. Leigh Finke has faced fierce opposition to her trans legislative work -- including threats and harassment. In a way, that has helped fuel her own political rise. ""I'm a little bit famous in the Midwest,"" she grins.

""There were some viral moments from the House floor from conservatives going on tirades against me and against trans people, and it provided an opportunity for us to be able to stand strong, to be able to say, 'Here we are, queer forever, you can't just yell at us and have us go away,'"" she says.

She's had positive attention, too. Last year, she was named the USA Today ""Woman of the Year"" for Minnesota, and she was recognized as a ""Health Hero"" by Children's Minnesota.

And she is happy that there is more representation of trans people in public life than when she was growing up in the 80s and 90s in suburban Minnesota. ""You can't be what you can't see,"" she says, noting that she didn't come out as trans until adulthood. ""And I'm so grateful that I did. And I'm so grateful that I get to be in a position now where other people can see not just that there are trans people, but that we're succeeding.""

But when she knocks on doors for her re-election bid this fall, Finke says trans issues are not what voters are concerned about. ""I think that, in general, people don't want to be talking about trans kids, they would rather just let us live our lives.""

She's happy to talk about her other political priorities, like housing and the arts and urban tree policy, instead."
"When she called a hotline to report abuse, the voice on the other end offered hope",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/nx-s1-5132063/311-line-abuse-hope-kindness,2024-10-01T09:04:55Z,"This story is part of the My Unsung Hero series, from the Hidden Brain team. It features stories of people whose kindness left a lasting impression on someone else.

One day in 2001, Nora Durkin decided she had to tell someone about a secret she'd been carrying for more than a decade. When she was a child, Durkin says, she was sexually abused.

She picked up the phone and called 311, the nonemergency number in many communities across the U.S.

""And I am anticipating that the person on the other end is going to have the most negative, underdeveloped response, because that's what I was used to,"" Durkin said.

Instead, when she told the operator her story, the woman gave her the affirmation she had needed for years.

""Her response right away was, 'Oh honey, that's horrible. Tell me what happened,'"" Durkin recalled.

""And then I'm like, 'Yeah, this is terrible. This was terrible. You're right.' So it was like validation just pouring from the other end.""

As they talked, Durkin asked the woman what she should do next. The operator told her to file a police report, which she did. The statute of limitations had run out on her claim, but she says that being able to take action brought her a measure of peace.

Today, Durkin is a therapist -- a profession, she says, that allows her to use her traumatic experience to help others.

""I get to be for them who this woman was for me,"" said Durkin. ""And it's really incredible to take that suffering and turn it into something so meaningful.""

If that operator could hear her now, Durkin would thank her for believing her when no one else would.

""I have held onto her in my memory for over 20 years. And I am eternally grateful for this gift that she gave me that day.""

Miss America hopeful slams pageant's 'rule' keeping mothers from competing as organization denies claims,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/miss-america-hopeful-slams-pageants-rule-keeping-mothers-from-competing-organization-denies-claims,2024-10-01T08:17:18Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A mother hoping to compete in Miss America slammed the pageant's ""rule"" that prohibits women with ""legal dependents"" from participating.

""When I first learned about it, I just was really disappointed,"" Danielle Hazel told Fox News Digital. ""And it was unexpected for me. I didn't really know that that was a rule. So, it was really shocking to find out.""

Hazel filed a complaint with the New York City Commission on Human Rights on Sept. 16, requesting the ""discriminatory requirement"" be removed.

The former beauty pageant hopeful noted that motherhood doesn't stop one from having a job, which is what winning the competition entails.

""So, if you're a mom, it's not an obstacle that's in the way,"" Hazel explained. ""It shouldn't be an obstacle.""

2024 MISS AMERICA AIMS TO 'MESH' NEW ROLE WITH AIR FORCE CAREER TO ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO JOIN THE SERVICE

At age 19, Hazel was not allowed to compete in Miss America because she had a son.

""When I told Zion, who is now 6 years old, about these rules, he had an immediate gut reaction. He said that these rules are stupid,"" Hazel said at a press conference. ""His sense of fairness at only 6 years old tells him that this is unjust and makes no sense.""

For Hazel, filing the complaint was a way to ""make a difference.""

""Sometimes it only takes one person,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""I wanted to be able to at least have some kind of impact, even if it wasn't going to be successful. I wanted to at least show that I tried.""

Hazel's complaint was received by the New York City Commission on Human Rights, according to her lawyer, Gloria Allred. The organization chose to serve the complaint to Miss America and Miss World, and Allred said action would be taken soon.

""On a societal level, I feel like there has been a lot of - I guess it is a stigma against moms but not all moms,"" Hazel said. ""I mean, specifically, if you're a single mom, there's even a bigger stigma, because then there's this idea that somehow you're less than ... somehow you're not as worthy.""

A representative for Miss America said in a statement that the complaint brought by Hazel and Allred is ""not factually accurate.""

""There is no ban against mothers. The only ban is against potential contestants with legal dependents,"" the statement reads. ""In other words, if you are responsible for the daily welfare of the child, that welfare must take precedence over wishing to compete in the contest. The rule has nothing to do with any attack on motherhood. It is solely to protect the welfare of minors dependent on their legal guardians.""

""That legal guardian could be someone who is the child's mother, or it could be someone who has become the legal guardian of the child without being the mother,"" the representative wrote. ""Someone who is a mother who has no responsibility for the child (for example, someone who gave up custody or the child for adoption, etc.) is not banned.""

""Essentially, the complaint filed with the NYC Human Rights Commission is a false document filed with a government agency,"" the statement continued. ""Paragraph 6 of the complaint, for example, is a stunningly false statement. Miss America stands apart from contests such as Miss World. There is no connection to them, and our standards are significantly different. Miss America is a more than century-old institution that observes the highest standards of conduct, ethics, etc. That puts us in conflict sometimes with those who do not share those standards. Protecting the welfare of children is consistent with those standards.""

Allred challenged a similar rule in California after a mother was denied eligibility to compete in the Miss California pageant. The pageant is part of the Miss Universe and Miss USA organizations.

After Andrea Quiroga filed a complaint with the California Civil Rights Department, Miss Universe got rid of its 70-year-old rule.

Allred slammed the beauty pageant ""rule"" barring mothers from competing in a ""business opportunity.""

""Sometimes single moms, for example, have parents who will also take care of the children. Sometimes children are in child care. And mothers, yes, are generally the ones that are responsible, especially single moms,"" Allred told Fox News Digital ""And they have the physical, emotional and often financial responsibility for children.""

""And now to block them from a business opportunity, which is what these pageants are - as well as a social opportunity, economic opportunity - to exclude them simply because of an old stereotype that mothers have to be home with children is wrong.""

Allred also represents Veronika Didusenko, a woman who was crowned Miss Ukraine in 2018. She was later stripped of her title because she had a son.

""In 2018, I lost my victory in the Miss Ukraine pageant (which is part of Miss World) because I had a young son,"" she said in a statement at a press conference. ""One of the judges at the Miss Ukraine pageant, Bohdan Yusypchuk, pointed at me live on air and said, 'She had a child at the age of 19 and then divorced. I think it's wrong to make such [a] person a role model.'""

Didusenko has since launched the #RightToBeAMother global initiative and has worked to fight the discrimination of young mothers within the beauty pageant industry."

"Hezbollah terrorists engaged in sex slavery, rape, mass murder of Syrians",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-terrorists-engaged-sex-slavery-rape-mass-murder-syrians,2024-10-01T08:07:05Z,"JERUSALEM -- Photos of Syrians celebrating the assassination of Hezbollah terrorist leader Hassan Nasrallah last week put the spotlight on the brutal activities of the terror group's role in sex slavery, mass starvation and kidnappings in the Syrian civil war which led to the deaths of over half a million Syrians.

Walid Phares, a leading expert on Hezbollah and Lebanon, told Fox News Digital that Hezbollah has ""committed ethnic cleansing"" in Syria. He said Hezbollah ""was behind the uprooting of millions of Syrians, of all communities, mainly Sunni. They have perpetrated rape. They have perpetrated mass sexual abuse, including keeping sexual slaves.""

Israel's targeted assassination of Nasrallah last weekend has prompted greater interest in the inner workings of the Shiite terrorist organization that is widely considered the de facto ruler over Lebanon.

IRAN OFFICIAL ADMITS COUNTRY'S ROLE IN TERROR BOMBING THAT KILLED 241 US MILITARY MEMBERS: REPORT

The Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorist entity is mainly known in America for bombing the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, which killed 63 people in 1983, and the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut also in 1983, resulting in the murders of 241 U.S. military personnel.

A new investigative video series by the Center for Peace Communications (CPC) shines a rare light on the U.S.-designated terrorist movement Hezbollah's role in sexual slavery, rape and mass murder. The shocking expose about Hezbollah's enslavement of a Syrian woman aired days after Israel reportedly launched devastating explosions of pagers held by thousands of Hezbollah terrorists across Lebanon in September.

CPC President Joseph Braude told Fox News Digital ""Hezbollah's war on Israel obscures its larger war to subjugate much of the region -- as a tyrant in Lebanon, an occupier in Syria, a mafia of sex and drug trafficking, and the nerve center of Iran's Arab empire. Millions of Arabs whose lives have been shattered by the militia want a different future. Hezbollah does not want the world to hear their voices.""

CPC's previous series, called ""Whispered in Gaza,"" which was viewed over 20 million times, led to a Fatwa being issued against Hamas by Iraqi and Pakistani clerics. It was used by Gaza anti-Hamas activists during the July 2023 street protests against the terror organization's rule.

He added ""'Hezbollah's Hostages,' an eight-part series produced by the Center for Peace Communications and presented by The Free Press, features the actual recorded testimony of Lebanese and Syrian civilians in Hezbollah's grip. To protect their identities and honor their lives, each recorded interview is accompanied visually by creative images and animation.""

One video depicts the kidnapping and sexual enslavement of Alya, a married 20-year-old woman from the northern Syrian city of Raqqa. She reveals how Yusuf, a member of Hezbollah, ""stalked"" her for months and eventually took her hostage.

Hezbollah took the side of the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad after civilians launched a protest movement in 2011 to secure democracy in the highly repressive nation.

Hezbollah terrorists aided Assad in his scorched-earth campaign to wipe out opposition to his regime, resulting in the killing of over 500,000 people. Syria is now a fragmented and war-ravaged country.

HEZBOLLAH BIGGER CHALLENGE THAN HAMAS TO ISRAEL: 'CROWN JEWEL IN THE IRANIAN EMPIRE OF TERROR'

""They have perpetrated rape. They have perpetrated mass sexual abuse, including keeping sexual slaves.""

Hezbollah's ally, the Sunni terrorist movement Hamas, engaged in rapes and sustained sexual assaults of Israeli women and men after the jihadi terrorist organization invaded Israel on Oct. 7.

Hezbollah joined Hamas' war against Israel on Oct. 8 when it launched rockets into northern Israel. Hamas slaughtered nearly 1,200 people on Oct. 7, including over 30 Americans.

The fundamental corruption and mafia-style criminality of Hezbollah's global organization has been examined by Matthew Levitt, the director of the Reinhard Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at The Washington Institute.

He published a 2018 report on ""Hezbollah's Corruption Crisis Runs Deep."" Levitt noted that ""some prominent figures in Hezbollah are involved in horrific criminal enterprises, including trafficking in sex and human beings."" He cited the example of Hezbollah official Ali Hussein Zeaiter, who according to media reports, was linked to ""a large prostitution network, mainly employing Syrian women.""

Hezbollah's criminal enterprise and terrorism continue to impact Americans.

HOW LEBANON'S HEZBOLLAH GROUP BECAME A CRITICAL PLAYER IN THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Zoya Fakhoury, executive director of the Amer Foundation, told Fox News Digital that ""Hezbollah is a proxy group of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that has the blood of thousands of innocent individuals, including American citizens, on their hands. The death of Hassan Nasrallah is a significant step towards accountability for many individuals but particularly for my family. My father, Amer Fakhoury, was a former U.S. hostage unlawfully detained under direct orders from Hassan Nasrallah.""

She continued, ""He was used a political pawn by Hezbollah and died because of the torture he faced in Lebanon. We hope to see the Lebanese government take this opportunity of the dismantling of Hezbollah to free Lebanon from the occupation of the Islamic Republic and work towards a path of peace.""

In August, Fox News Digital reported the new book by Fakhoury's four daughters covering a first-hand account of his detainment and the harrowing rescue operation to bring him back home to the United States in their book, ""Silenced in Beirut: American Businessman Amer Fakhour's Six-Month Ordeal as a Hostage In Lebanon.""

Walid Phares, a leading expert on Hezbollah and Lebanon, told Fox News Digital that Hezbollah has ""committed ethnic cleansing"" in Syria. He said Hezbollah ""was behind the uprooting of millions of Syrians, of all communities, mainly Sunni. They have perpetrated rape. They have perpetrated mass sexual abuse, including keeping sexual slaves.""

Phares, who has advised U.S. presidential candidates on Mideast foreign policy, said the Hezbollah jihadis defend their hostage taking of women as under Islamist Sharia law that they can take women from the ""enemy camp.""

ISRAEL DEGRADES IRAN-BACKED HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS IN SPECTACULAR PAGER EXPLOSION OPERATION: EXPERTS

He said there is no doubt that if Hezbollah captured Israeli women, they would treat them the same way as the enslaved Syrian women. Phares added that if Hezbollah captured a kibbutz, village or town in Israel, one ""can expect that they will kill the males and the capture the women. Some would be raped and killed and other Israeli women would be kept by Hezbollah.""

Hezbollah is not different from the Islamic state in applying jihadi ideology, said Phares. Hezbollah ""is a global threat. Look at how they treat their own women and how they separate them and organize them in the service of jihadists.""

Braude said that ""'Hezbollah's Hostages' debuted on Sept. 16, one day before pagers exploded across Lebanon. A new episode debuts every Monday through Nov. 4. In forthcoming episodes, we will probe the Hezbollah stronghold of Dahiyeh, just outside Beirut, with help from Shi'ite civilians who live there.""

He added ""Dahiyeh is the shadow capital of Lebanon -- home of Hezbollah's intelligence apparatus, politburo, and prisons -- as well as the central node to all Iran's proxies in the region, from the Houthis of Yemen to Iraq's militias to Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas. Yet the same landscape is also home to some of Hezbollah's many opponents - and in later episodes, we meet them too: Shiite veterans of the countrywide 2019 street protests, who dared to demand a different future; civic activists striving to end the war on Israel, liberate young minds, and restore the rule of law in Lebanon."""
Claudia Sheinbaum to be sworn in as the 1st female president of Mexico,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25648/claudia-sheinbaum-female-president-mexico,2024-10-01T06:38:50Z,"MEXICO CITY -- Claudia Sheinbaum will take the oath of office Tuesday as Mexico's first female president in more than 200 years of independence, promising to protect an expanded social safety net and fight for the poor like her predecessor, but facing pressing problems.

The 62-year-old scientist-turned-politician will receive a country with a number of immediate challenges, foremost among them stubbornly high levels of violence, a sluggish economy and hurricane-battered Acapulco.

Sheinbaum romped to victory in June with nearly 60% of the vote, propelled largely by the sustained popularity of her political mentor, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

He took office six years ago declaring ""For the good of all, first the poor,"" and promising historical change from the neoliberal economic policies of his predecessors. Sheinbaum promised continuity from his popular social policies to controversial constitutional reforms to the judiciary and National Guard rammed through during his final days in office.

Despite her pledge of continuity, she is a very different personality.

""López Obrador was a tremendously charismatic president and many times that charisma allowed him to cover up some political errors that Claudia Sheinbaum will not have that possibility of doing,"" said Carlos Pérez Ricart, a political analyst at Mexico's Center for Economic Research and Teaching. ""So, where López Obrador was charismatic, Claudia Sheinbaum will have to be effective.""

He is not leaving her an easy situation.

Her first trip as president will be to the flood-stricken Pacific coast resort of Acapulco.

Hurricane John, which struck as a Category 3 hurricane last week and then reemerged into the ocean and struck again as a tropical storm, caused four days of incredibly heavy rain that killed at least 17 people along the coast around Acapulco. Acapulco was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, and had not recovered from that blow when John hit.

Sheinbaum must also deal with raging violence in the cartel-dominated northern city of Culiacan, where factional fighting within the Sinaloa cartel broke out after drug lords Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López were apprehended in the United States after they flew there in a small plane on July 25.

López Obrador has long sought to avoid confronting Mexico's drug cartels and has openly appealed to the gangs to keep the peace among themselves, but the limitations of that strategy have become glaringly apparent in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state, where gun battles have raged on the city's streets. Local authorities and even the army -- which López Obrador has relied on for everything -- have essentially admitted that the fighting will only end when the cartel bosses decide to end it.

But that's only the latest hotspot.

Drug-related violence is surging from Tijuana in the north to Chiapas in the south, displacing thousands.

While Sheinbaum inherits a huge budget deficit, unfinished construction projects and a burgeoning bill for her party's cash hand-out programs -- all of which could send financial markets tumbling -- perhaps her biggest looming concern is the possibility of a victory for Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election.

Trump has already vowed to slap 100% tariffs on vehicles made in Mexico. Though that would likely violate the current U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, there are other things Trump could do to make life difficult for Sheinbaum, including his pledge of massive deportations.

Things with its northern neighbor were already tense after López Obrador said he was putting relations with the U.S. embassy ""on pause"" after public criticism of the proposed judicial overhaul.

First lady Jill Biden struck an optimistic tone for relations with the incoming Sheinbaum administration saying at a reception Monday that, ""Under Dr. Sheinbaum's presidency I know we will continue to build a more prosperous, safe and democratic region -- and take the steps in our U.S.-Mexico partnership.""

There are areas where Sheinbaum could try to take Mexico in a new direction. For example, she has a Ph.D. in energy engineering and has spoken of the need to address climate change. López Obrador built a massive new oil refinery and poured money into the state-owned oil company. But his budget commitments do not leave her much room to maneuver.

Jennifer Piscopo, professor of gender and politics at the Royal Holloway University of London who has studied Latin America for decades, said Mexico electing its first female leader is important because it will show girls they can do it too, but it can also create unrealistic expectations.

""Woman firsts are powerful symbols, but they do not gain magic power,"" she said. ""Especially when the governance challenges are so large, expecting magic solutions overnight can also generate outsized disappointment."""
'Gyeongseong Creature' Season 2: What The Netflix K-Drama's Creators Want You To Know,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/reginakim/2024/09/30/gyeongseong-creature-season-2-what-the-netflix-k-dramas-creators-want-you-to-know/,2024-10-01T04:04:01Z,"Netflix has released the second season of Gyeongseong Creature, which sees Park Seo-joon's and Han So-hee's characters reunite in present-day Seoul to face off against supernatural evil forces once again.

Amid all the heart-pounding fight sequences, plot twists, and the introduction of both new and returning characters, there's admittedly a lot to keep up with in this seven-episode series, and audiences might be left with some lingering questions about the show.

To help viewers gain a deeper understanding of some of the key points in the second season of Gyeongseong Creature, I've included below some interesting insights that were shared with the press by the show's director Chung Dong-yoon and writer Kang Eun-kyung.

According to Kang, ""In Season 1, Najin appeared as a terrifying entity that transformed humans into monsters. In Season 2, Najin emerges as a force that stimulates and fulfills human desires. Najin's ability to provide absolute power and infinite vitality raises the question: is this a curse or a blessing for humanity?""

For Tae-sang specifically, najin empowers him to exact revenge. ""But in a more positive light, it could also be seen as his personal struggle,"" Chung noted.

In the final scenes, Chae-ok is seen leading a normal, najin-free life after Tae-sang breaks the water tank that she was trapped in.

Director Chung offered a possible rationale for Tae-sang's actions:

""Perhaps Jang Tae-sang wanted the woman he loved to lose all her dreadful memories and live a truly ordinary life. It's possible he gifted Chae-ok the mundane life she once dreamed of. Eventually, they meet on a street, and Chae-ok, while vaguely recalling distant memories, unknowingly smiles sadly. Tae-sang also smiles back at Chae-ok, who recognizes him. It seems that those who are destined to meet will eventually find each other.""

Gyeongseong Creature was originally intended to be a single-season show with 20 episodes that took viewers from 1940s Gyeongseong to present-day Seoul, but it ended up being split into multiple seasons.

""Seasons 1 and 2 were planned together from the beginning, and the fact that Season 2's story is set in the modern era is the part that sets this season apart,"" Chung noted. ""The elements I wanted to highlight in Season 2 were the remnants of Japanese imperialism and the romance between Master Jang and Yoon Chae-ok.""

""Despite the 79 years that have passed and the advancements we've seen, those who threaten, divide, and exploit the world for their own gain still exist. I wanted to highlight this persistence and encourage the audience to reflect on what must never be forgotten, and why remembering is so important,"" Kang commented.

Both Director Chung and Writer Kang stress the ""importance of remembering the past and the people who must never be forgotten.""

According to Kang, ""Gyeongseong Creature is not just about the historical pain of a particular time but about the pervasive fascism that has existed throughout history and still lingers today. The story explores how violence and power subjugate the weak, how sacrifices are falsely justified for the 'greater good,' and how the normalization of such sacrifices can turn anyone into a monster. Power without humanity has always left horrific scars on human history, and the creature in the series embodies this very message. The series focuses on the stories of those who confront these moral boundaries.""

While Netflix hasn't yet announced any plans to renew the show for a third season, the current enthusiastic response from audiences across the globe could bode well for fans who are hoping for another season. If that happens, hopefully the next installment will answer some burning questions like, will Chae-ok ever get her memories back? What will Seung-jo do with all those vials of najin? And what about that sneaky Detective Park who double-crosses Detective Yuh Myung-joon -- will we ever learn what might become of him?"
'Gyeongseong Creature' Season 2: What To Know About Its Mysterious Characters,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/reginakim/2024/09/30/gyeongseong-creature-season-2-what-to-know-about-its-mysterious-characters/,2024-10-01T03:40:57Z,"The second season of the hit K-drama Gyeongseong Creature recently dropped on Netflix, landing in the streamer's list of the top 10 TV shows in the U.S. shortly after its release. Set in modern-day Seoul -- almost 80 years after the events of Season 1 -- this season starts off with a bang, packing in plenty of gore, action and suspense in its first 15 minutes.

After swallowing her mother's najin at the end of Season 1, Yoon Chae-ok (Han So-hee) continues her line of work as a private eye who tracks down missing people -- only now she's gifted with immortality and superhuman strength, speed and agility thanks to the najin. She runs into Jang Ho-jae (Park Seo-joon), who bears a striking resemblance to Jang Tae-sang, the pawnbroker from 1940s Gyeongseong that she fell in love with. Of course, that's because Ho-jae is Tae-sang -- it's just that he's lost his memory when Chae-ok encounters him in the streets of Seoul.

Over the course of seven episodes, Chae-ok and Ho-jae go up against Jeonseung Biotech and its army of najin-powered super soldiers. And like all those years ago, the pair learn that Lady Maeda is still pulling the strings behind the scenes, and that the evils of the past have carried on to the present.

This season introduces new characters alongside some returning ones, but given the intense and fast-paced storytelling, it might be hard to get a good sense of who they really are unless you're paying close attention throughout the show. So here are insights on some of the more mysterious figures from this season, based on answers provided to the press by the show's director Chung Dong-yoon and writer Kang Eun-kyung.

The leader of the Kurokos (played by Lee Mu-saeng) is a complex and mysterious character. According to the show's writer Kang, he's the son of Kato (the lieutenant colonel who was supervising the horrific human experiments in Season 1) and a Korean concubine -- meaning he's half-Japanese and half-Korean, just like Seung-jo. Meanwhile, his older half-brother Chairman Shin, who leads Jeonseung Biotech, is Kato's eldest son and born from a Japanese mother.

Due to his mixed heritage, the Kuroko Leader ""endured constant discrimination"" his entire life and ""was overshadowed by his elder brother, despite being superior in many ways. He voluntarily participated in Kato's experiments, seeking strength on his own terms to finally gain recognition as a valuable son,"" Kang noted. He worked his way up the corporate ladder at Jeonseung Biotech and was put in charge of running the underground laboratory, while Chairman Shin was named heir to the company.

Director Chung described the Kuroko Leader as someone who seems to be motivated by personal desires, as evidenced by his efforts to heal his disabled girlfriend using najin. ""On the surface, he seems to value order and control, but deep down, he resents both Maeda and his identity as Kato's son.""

Seung-jo (portrayed by Bae Hyeon-seong) is yet another complicated character who appears in Season 2. The son of the Japanese police commissioner Ishikawa and his Korean mistress Myeong-ja (who developed superhuman abilities and a taste for human brains after swallowing najin in Season 1), he struggles with his dual identity as a monster-human hybrid.

With his sweet, angelic face, Bae Hyeon-seong -- whom K-drama fans might remember from hit shows like Our Blues and Hospital Playlist -- seems like a rather interesting casting choice to play a villain, albeit a morally ambiguous one. ""Being naturally very kind and shy, we pondered how to make [Bae Hyeon-seong] appear more menacing,"" Chung noted. ""We decided that rather than forcing a false sense of malevolence, we should present our unique version of Seung-jo. His appearance with one eye covered in the final epilogue was truly striking. He did an excellent job portraying the darker side of Seung-jo.""

The malicious Lady Maeda makes a surprise return in Season 2, looking as youthful and radiant as ever thanks to her ingestion of najin. However, viewers are initially led to believe that she passed away or that perhaps the elderly Japanese woman played by Son Sook is Lady Maeda after all -- making the real Lady Maeda's entrance all the more shocking and dramatic.

""I wanted to keep Maeda hidden. Constantly keeping her hidden creates a sense of fear and shock about what isn't seen. That's why I initially had Son Sook play Old Lady,"" Chung stated. ""For Maeda, I thought it would be quite ironic for her to appear in bright white clothing. This was even more striking in the dark underground setting. I aimed to gradually bring Maeda into focus from blurry memories, creating a moment that would vividly imprint on Chae-ok's mind.""

Lady Maeda's appearance must've been a déjà vu moment for Chae-ok, who encountered her transformed mother in the same underground laboratory decades ago. And while Seung-jo and the leader of the Kurokos appear to be more morally ambiguous characters, Lady Maeda is the ultimate villain in this season -- just like what we saw in Season 1.

""Maeda does not feel true affection,"" Kang revealed. ""Her emotions are fueled by possessiveness, obsession, control, and self-righteousness. While some might mistake these for love, Maeda herself doesn't understand what love truly is or how to open up her heart. To her, both Tae-sang and Seung-jo were simply objects she desired to own. In the end, she remains the loneliest and most miserable character, having failed to possess anyone.""

The Kurokos are a group of najin-enhanced super soldiers that do Jeonseung Biotech's (and Lady Maeda's) bidding. They can easily climb up walls and move at lightning speed while always hiding in the shadows.

On crafting these creepy, stealthy warriors, Chung shared that he pictured them ""as a combination of ninjas and samurais dedicated to protecting the Maeda family.""

""We strived to depict them as unsettling, almost like large cockroaches. Their unique characteristics include making bizarre noises during their action sequences, attacking in groups, adhering to strict hierarchical obedience, and only appearing in dark places. In all, we aimed to show characters that move and flee like cockroaches, dislike light, and perform slightly grotesque actions,"" Chung stated. He added that Park Seo-joon helped conceptualize the Kurokos."
A Psychologist Shares 3 Tips To Safely Explore 'Extreme Sexual Kinks',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/09/30/a-psychologist-shares-3-tips-to-safely-explore-extreme-sexual-kinks/,2024-09-30T23:37:30Z,"Everyone has sexual fantasies, but each fantasy is as unique as the individual. As one study published this February in the Journal of Sex Research points out, ""the content of fantasies varies widely, with themes like exhibitionism, sadism and masochism commonly reported."" This is especially true when it comes to people known as 'Kinksters"" -- people who consensually engage in sexual kinks.

Kinks are described as a non-conventional sexual practice or concept. For kinksters, exploring such fantasies in real life can feel both exciting and empowering. However, when venturing into more extreme sexual kinks, there is a need for caution, as these practices often involve elements that challenge safety, both physically and emotionally.

Autassassinophilia, for example, is a sexual kink in which a person is aroused by the thought of being in a life-threatening situation. For some, this means staging scenarios where a couple pretends to be unsafe to gain satisfaction. However, one study in Sexuality and Culture shows that when taken to the extreme, this particular kink can be hazardous.

A 2020 study in the Archives of Sexual Behaviour discusses a couple that found this out the hard way. The troubling case was initially planned as a staged kidnapping that was thrilling and consensual for both parties, but as the scenarios became more intense, the boundaries between fantasy and reality began to blur. Eventually, this led to an incident where the ""kidnapping"" was mistaken for an actual crime by a passerby, resulting in legal trouble for the couple involved.

The study cautions that sexual appetites that push boundaries can also blur the lines of consent. While one partner may initially consent to a particular act, they might later feel things went too far. This shift in perception can create a sense of violation, causing psychological distress for both individuals.

In another example set out in the same study, an expert witness recalled a case between a man and a woman in which the man had joked about grabbing the woman's genital area in public -- an act controversially nicknamed ""Trumping."" The woman initially consented to the act but later filed charges when the man followed through. As a result, both parties were left feeling violated and betrayed.

So, how do law-abiding citizens engage in thrilling sexual encounters without putting themselves or their partners at risk?

Here are three practical tips to ensure that adventurous sexual play remains exciting, consensual and safe:

By staying informed and mindful of the risks, individuals can explore sexual interests in a way that enhances their lives without endangering their well-being or that of others. Individuals interested in these behaviors must take a thoughtful and cautious approach, prioritizing safety, consent and communication at every step."

""A review of our higher courts' interpretations of 'liberty' demonstrates that liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.

""That power is not, however, unlimited,"" the judge added. ""When a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then - and only then - may society intervene.""

GEORGIA SUPREME COURT REJECTS CHALLENGE TO ABORTION LAW

McBurney continued, saying a law that prevents abortions after six weeks was inconsistent with those rights as well as the proper balance that a viability rule establishes between a woman's rights and society's interests in protecting and caring for unborn infants.

He then declared the ""Life Act"" as ""unconstitutional.""

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed the ""Heartbeat"" abortion bill, also known as the Living Infants Fairness and Equality Act,"" into law in 2019. The law made abortions after the six-week mark illegal.

There were exceptions written into the law, including rape and incest, as long as a police report was filed. Another exception to the law allowed for abortions after six weeks if the mother's life was at risk or if a serious medical condition rendered a fetus inviable.

The law signed by Kemp was blocked by a federal judge in October 2019 -- before it went into effect -- and ruled it violated the right to abortion established by Roe. v. Wade in 1973.

The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, which cleared the way for Georgia's law on abortion to go into effect.

McBurney, in November 2022, ruled the law was ""unequivocally unconstitutional"" because it was enacted in 2019 when Roe v. Wade allowed abortions after six weeks.

But in October 2023, the Georgia Supreme Court rejected the ruling in a 6-1 decision, saying McBurney was wrong.

""When the United States Supreme Court overrules its own precedent interpreting the United States Constitution, we are then obligated to apply the Court's new interpretation of the Constitution's meaning on matters of federal constitutional law,"" Justice Verda Colvin wrote for the majority.

McBurney's ruling on Monday stated that the state, county, municipal and other local authorities are ""enjoined"" from seeking to enforce the six-week abortion law."

The Hitchhiker's Guide to how the VP debate is sometimes more memorable than the presidential debates,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hitchhikers-guide-how-vp-debate-sometimes-more-memorable-than-presidential-debates,2024-09-30T21:17:26Z,"A 'Fox News Live' political panel provided its expectations ahead of the vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz, as well as its views on the border issue.

It's doubtful that this week's debate between Vice Presidential nominees Tim Walz and JD Vance will command quite the same attention as the debate between the nominees: Vice President Harris and former President Trump. But historically, tilts between the running mates are often more pugilistic. A lot feistier. More fun to watch. And sometimes, more memorable.

It's hard to say why the undercard can be more intriguing than the main event. But first round playoff games in hockey are often better matches than the Stanley Cup Finals. I've long asserted that the American League and National League Championship Series is generally more competitive baseball than what you experience during the World Series.

Perhaps it has something to do with the vice presidential candidates introducing themselves to the audience. They simply aren't as well known.

""Who am I? Why am I here?,"" quipped late Rear Admiral James Stockdale when independent Presidential candidate Ross Perot tapped him as his 1992 running mate.

IN CONGRESS - LIKE BASEBALL - THERE'S ALWAYS NEXT YEAR

Stockdale's folksy line immediately drew laughter and applause from the crowd gathered that night in Atlanta.

""I'm not a politician. Everybody knows that. So don't expect me to use the language of the Washington insider,"" said Stockdale from his lectern wedged between future President Clinton's running mate, then-Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., and Vice President Dan Quayle.

While Gore and Quayle quarreled, their verbal fusillades caromed back and forth in front of Stockdale. He was mostly a mute bystander. At one point, trying to get in a word edgewise, Stockdale abruptly blurted that he felt like he was in the ""middle of a Ping-Pong"" match.

Later in the debate, moderator Hal Bruno of ABC News asked if mudslinging tactics were ""necessary"" in the campaign. Stockdale replied he didn't hear the question.

""I didn't have my hearing aid turned on. Tell me again,"" Stockdale requested of Bruno, again triggering howls from the audience.

Sometimes the VP candidates must feel each other out.

EXPERTS PREVIEW VANCE-WALZ DEBATE, SAY USUALLY 'FORGETTABLE' VP BOUT 'MIGHT BE DIFFERENT' THIS TIME

""The first time I ever met you was when you walked on the stage tonight,"" said then-Vice President Dick Cheney to former Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., then John Kerry's running mate at the 2004 VP debate.

Running mates sometimes try to appear more down-to-Earth than those at the top of the ticket.

""Nice to meet ya,"" declared former Alaska Governor and 2008 VP nominee Sarah Palin (R) as she shook the hand of then-Senator Biden on stage in St. Louis. ""Can I call you Joe?""

""You can call me Joe,"" responded the future president with a smile.

Mr. Biden tried to exude an ""aw, shucks,"" lunchpail personae in the 2012 VP debate. He deployed lay language when trading barbs with GOP VP nominee and future House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisc.

""When we look weak, our adversaries are more willing to test us. They're more brazen in their attacks,"" said Ryan.

CONTINGENT ELECTIONS: WHAT THEY ARE, AND WHAT TO EXPECT IF 2024 TRIGGERS ONE

""With all due respect, that's a bunch of a malarkey,"" countered the future President.

Palin tried the same thing, using phrases like ""doggone it"" and winking at the audience not once, but four times, to punctuate her responses.

Vice Presidential debates are often stocked with wry humor.

""If you won't use any football stories, I won't tell any of my warm and humorous stories about chlorofluorocarbon abatement,"" promised then-Vice President Gore during his debate with GOP VP nominee Jack Kemp in 1996.

Gore was known for his views on global warming and environmental policy. A former congressman and Housing and Urban Development Secretary, Kemp also starred at quarterback for the San Diego Chargers and Buffalo Bills in the American Football League before it merged with the NFL.

A lot of people would pay to be a fly on the wall during some of the debate prep. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., has been playing Walz during the sessions with Vance. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg has portrayed Vance during his rehearsals with Walz.

THE MAN IN BLACK: JOHNNY CASH STATUE UNVEILED IN THE CAPITOL

But you don't even have to be a fly on the wall for these debates. Sometimes a fly just shows up - and lands on the head of former Vice President Mike Pence. Such was the case when Pence debated Vice President Harris four years ago in Salt Lake City.

But Vice Presidential debates do grow testy.

Besides the fly, many best remember the 2020 Harris/Pence debate for the Vice President repeatedly declaring ""I'm speaking,"" beseeching Pence to wait his turn.

Viewers also remember Pence and Democratic VP nominee and Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., talking all over one another during their 2016 debate.

In the first televised VP debate in Houston in 1976, GOP Vice Presidential nominee and future Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., depicted World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam were ""Democrat wars."" He then added that ""the pardon of Richard Nixon is behind us. Watergate's behind us.""

""I think Sen. Dole has richly earned his reputation as a hatchet man tonight,"" responded future Vice President and then-Sen. Walter Mondale, D-Minn.

VANCE VS. WALZ: THINK VP DEBATES DON'T MATTER? JUST LOOK AT THESE 6 EXAMPLES

And future President George H.W. Bush drew the ire of female voters when he appeared to speak condescendingly to 1984 Democratic Vice Presidential nominee and Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, D-N.Y., - the first woman to ever appear on a major party ticket.

""Let me help you Miss Ferraro about the difference between Iran and the embassy in Lebanon,"" said Bush.

""Let me just say, first of all, that I almost resent, Vice President Bush, your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy,"" shot back Ferraro.

The congresswoman noted she had served nearly six years in the House by that point.

But one zinger from a Vice Presidential debate is without question one of the best lines in the history of American politics.

During the 1988 campaign, the press corps and some in the public jeered at Quayle as Bush 41's running mate. His youthful looks and frequent verbal faux pas made Quayle seem unprepared for the job. Quayle was 41 years old at the time. But he had already served nearly eight years in the Senate and four in the House. To compensate, Quayle often spun his youth in the same way that late President ""Jack Kennedy"" captured the imagination of Americans.

HOW TO WATCH THE FOX NEWS - CBS NEWS VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE SIMULCAST

Compared to Quayle, 1988 Vice Presidential nominee and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Tex., presented himself as poised, stately and steady. Bentsen and his handlers were well aware of Quayle's ""Jack Kennedy"" comparisons. And so during the debate in Omaha, Neb., Bentsen waited for Quayle to bait his own trap.

""I have far more experience than many others that sought the office of Vice President of this country. I have as much experience in the Congress as Jack Kennedy did when he sought the presidency,"" said Quayle.

Bentsen pounced.

""I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy,"" said Bentsen.

The auditorium erupted into hales of applause and shouts.

Quayle stewed, staring daggers at his Senate colleague.

""That was really uncalled for, Senator,"" fumed Quayle.

Bentsen's line has echoed for decades, lampooned on everything from Saturday Night Live to 30 Rock.

Just one historic footnote. JFK and Bentsen never served together in the Senate. But they were members of the House during the same period in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

Running mates have two responsibilities. They must demonstrate that they're ready to step into the main job. And they aren't supposed to overshadow the actual nominee. Yet with vice presidential debates, the one-liners often do just that."
Harris talks about marijuana and racial identity in 'All the Smoke' interview,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/nx-s1-5133963/kamala-harris-marijuana-racial-identity,2024-09-30T20:05:28Z,"Vice President Harris boards Air Force Two at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas on Sept. 30, 2024. Ronda Churchill/AFP hide caption

Vice President Harris says she thinks marijuana should be legalized, going a step further than the Biden administration has in its marijuana reforms.

""I just think we have come to a point where we have to understand that we need to legalize it and stop criminalizing this behavior,"" Harris said in her first public comments on the issue since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee.

Harris made her comments as part of a 45-minute conversation with former NBA stars Stephen Jackson and Matt Barnes for their podcast All the Smoke.

Harris said she feels strongly that people ""should not be going to jail for smoking weed.""

President Biden has stopped short of calling for legalization, although earlier this year, his administration began a process to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug.

Harris was asked about what she does to take care of her mental health. She said her number one rule for protecting her own mental space is, ""Don't read the comments."" And she said it's important to find hobbies to help relieve stress, which for her is cooking.

Harris talked with the hosts about race in the context of allegations made in July by former President Donald Trump, who falsely accused Harris of shifting her racial identity over the years.

""I'm really clear about who I am and if anyone else is not, they need to go through their own level of therapy - that's not my issue,"" Harris said.

Harris said she feels ""a great sense of responsibility"" when it comes breaking barriers in her job, and what it would mean to potentially become the first Black woman to hold the highest office in the land.

""You got to leave that door open more than it was when you walked in,"" she said. ""That's what it means to me. I feel a great sense of responsibility."""
Biden's old backyard now a key Pennsylvania battleground filled with 'purple' votes,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bidens-old-backyard-now-key-pa-battleground-filled-purple-votes,2024-09-30T20:05:23Z,"SCRANTON, Pa. -- While northeastern Pennsylvania's Lackawanna County has been a Democratic stronghold in state and federal elections, voters on the streets of the old coal mining region say the area runs ""purple"" and will likely be a nail-bitter of an election.

""It's not as blue as people think. It's more purple underneath because people are afraid to say anything around here because they think that there's going to be retaliation. That's an old thing that goes back generations around here,"" David Kveragas told Fox News Digital from a pizza shop on the main drag of Scranton as a storm sloshed rain across the Wyoming Valley last week.

Lackawanna County is home to cities and towns such as Scranton, Carbondale and Throop, mixing cityscapes backdropped by factories of a bygone era, and dotted with suburbs and expansive farms. The county has long voted blue in state and national elections, last throwing its support behind a Republican in 1984 during President Ronald Reagan's blowout election when he won each state except Washington, D.C., and Minnesota -- the home state of Reagan's competitor that year, Walter Mondale.

The county has trended right in recent elections, however, teeing up a heightened election battle that will likely help determine how the key battleground state will swing come Nov. 5.

ECONOMY, BORDER, ABORTION DIVIDE BIDEN'S HOMETOWN AS SCRANTON LOOKS BACK ON NATIVE SON'S FIRST TERM

Between 2000 and 2012, Democratic presidential nominees earned between 56% and 63% of the vote, U.S. News and World Report found. That standard fell below 50% in 2016, when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton unsuccessfully ran against former President Donald Trump, but still carried a win for the Democratic Party's ticket even with the lessened support.

President Biden was born and raised in Scranton until the age of 10, when his family moved to Delaware. Biden's hometown status likely helped boost his popularity among locals in the 2020 election, winning 53.58% of the vote to Trump's 45.23% that year.

As the election cycle comes down to its final five weeks, Fox News Digital spoke to voters on the streets of Scranton to ask about their top election concerns and who they will cast their ballot for come November. Fox News Digital received a mixed bag of responses, with some voters proudly declaring Vice President Kamala Harris' support of abortion access earned their vote, while Trump supporters said voters only need to look at their pay stubs from the 2016-2020 era compared to today to determine their ballot choice.

""If you are a minority and a woman, what is the better choice? I'm not here to knock Trump or any candidate. But as a woman of Puerto Rican descent, I feel it's really important for us to really sit and discuss the pros and cons of each candidate. But especially as a woman,"" a local mom named Adrianna, who is supporting Harris in the election, told Fox News Digital.

BIDEN CLAIMS TO SEE THE ECONOMY THROUGH THE EYES OF SCRANTON, NOT WALL STREET

Adrianna is a mom to a young boy and said that inflation issues and childcare issues have rocked her day-to-day life as she has tried to find a daycare for her son for more than a year. When asked if she believes Harris will correct inflation if elected as president after serving as vice president for three and a half years, she responded, ""I hope so.""

""If you are a minority and a woman, what is the better choice?"" - Pennsylvania mom Adrianna

Adrianna said that while inflation concerns her, abortion is her top voting issue.

""I believe nobody should tell a woman what to do with her body, especially -- not to sound sexist -- but a man. I think that should be an individual decision that a woman should make,"" she said.

For Trump supporters, the economy, inflation, national security and immigration came in as top concerns for voters.

""The price of gas is a big issue with me. I do a lot of driving. And I remember back in the day, you know, when you got $20, it'd fill up your gas tank. It's just going up and up,"" Trump supporter John Soentgerath told Fox News Digital.

""With all due respect to my Democratic friends, I have a lot of them, [under] this previous administration there has been less take-home pay. The prices of gas [is] up, food. And I like to eat like anybody else. You tell me any mother or father that doesn't want to put food on the table for their kids, give them treats, ice cream, goodies and things of that nature,"" Soentgerath added.

Larry West of Scranton told Fox News Digital from a bus stop near The Marketplace at Steamtown that Trump earned his vote for his national security platform as wars continue raging in Ukraine and Israel, saying Harris appears ""weak"" on foreign affairs.

I don't feel that Kamala Harris has what it takes to represent the United States globally. - Scranton voter Larry West

Kveragas told Fox News Digital that he is an independent who ""voted against Hillary"" in 2016, before becoming a Trump supporter while evaluating the 45th president's record in office.

HARRIS SUPPORTERS IN PENNSYLVANIA SAY WORKING CLASS WILL SUPPORT HER

""He straightened out the economy. He got the border under control. He cut regulations. He did pretty much everything you would want a -- a realistic person would want -- a president to do. So with this election, it's primarily the economy, obviously. My retirement was up 40% under Trump. I lost the 40%, plus another 20% under Biden. So things are terrible there. The border, which we're being overrun. Obviously, it's not just a matter of jobs. It's a matter of housing and crime fighting, fentanyl, which has run rampant. Fentanyl is killing more people than guns,"" Kveragas said.

On the flip side, a Harris supporter who identified himself as Michael told Fox Digital that ""women's rights"" is his top priority this election cycle.

""I believe that every woman should have a choice to make their own decision,"" he said.

Michael explained that the economy and inflation have also affected his life, saying that he works two jobs to pay the bills and that expenses were much cheaper a decade ago. When asked if he feels Harris is better equipped to handle the economy over Trump, Michael argued that while Trump is a ""businessman,"" he will ""ruin the country.""

""Donald Trump, he is a businessman, yes. But he's going to ruin the country. He's going to ruin it. And Kamala Harris, you know, she is more steady-handed. She doesn't think with an iron fist, and we don't need that. We're not trying to go to war with China. [We're trying to] actually progress in this life. That's the only thing that we do in this life is to share information and progress,"" Michael said.

GOP GAINS VOTER ADVANTAGE IN PENNSYLVANIA SWING COUNTY NEAR BIDEN'S BIRTHPLACE

Trump's and Harris' campaigns have respectively heaped loads of attention on the Keystone State this year, with both candidates repeatedly visiting the massive state, from its rural areas in the rolling hills to industrial cities in the coal and rust belts that run across the state.

Fox News Digital spoke to both a Trump campaign volunteer and a Harris campaign volunteer, who both work to register Lackawanna voters, door knock and motivate residents to cast a ballot.

Susanne Green is a Trump campaign volunteer and former Democratic voter who began supporting Trump and Republicans in the last decade.

BIDEN'S HOMETOWN SPEAKS OUT ON BIDENOMICS

""I grew up in a Democrat household. Here in the valley in Lackawanna County, we believed in 'Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you could do for your country,'"" Green told Fox Digital, quoting President Kennedy's powerful inaugural address in 1961. ""And it really does choke me up some because it's truthful.""

Green said that her politics have not changed, but that the Democratic Party has morphed into something she can no longer identify with.

""I haven't changed. The Democrat Party changed. I was a Democrat. I registered as a Democrat when I turned 18, and I voted Democrat in every election until 2016, when I really saw that that wasn't the direction that our country needed. Our country really needs to really get back to patriotism and believing that our country is great,"" she said.

ARMED SERVICES REPUBLICANS, WHITE HOUSE PUSH BACK AGAINST CLAIMS THAT ZELENSKYY'S PA VISIT WAS 'POLITICAL'

Green said that when she speaks to locals about the election to motivate them to vote, many Democratic voters will balk at the GOP's abortion platform. Green said she explains to such voters, most notably suburban women, that Republicans for Choice has long been a powerful vote in the party and that the GOP is not working to place a wholesale ban on abortion.

""I think we can all agree, or most of us can agree, that it should be legal and rare,"" Green said in a hat tip to the famous Bill Clinton formulation that abortions be ""safe, legal and rare,"" a sentiment that has since been purged from the party's platform in favor of more lax abortion access.

""That's how most women that I talk to in my experience over my whole lifetime have said that we wanted abortion to stay legal, but rare.""

Andrew Cutillo, a Harris campaign volunteer in Lackawanna County, spoke to Fox News Digital via a phone call this week and said that he has supported Harris since her campaign launch this summer and touted the VP as someone who can ""intuitively"" connect with Northeastern Pennsylvania voters based on her middle class upbringing.

""Kamala Harris is someone who, you know, intuitively understands what it's like to grow up or live in Northeast Pennsylvania and Scranton, Pennsylvania, as she grew up middle class. Her kind of focus has been on building a strong middle class,"" Cutillo said. ""Her focus is on supporting families and understanding what families and communities need, that they can live their lives, that they can not worry about paying grocery bills, not worry about paying all the expenses that come with just trying to raise your family.""

Cutillo added that when he's out door-knocking or speaking with traditionally Republican voters, including his own dad, people have pulled away from Trump because they are ""concerned for democracy,"" and view Harris as a potential president who would ""govern for the people who don't agree with her, too.""

He said despite the fevered political focus on Scranton and Pennsylvania at large this election cycle, Republican and Democratic neighbors in Northeastern Pennsylvania have and will remain friends no matter how the election shakes out despite any portrayal of ""divisiveness"" in the battleground state.

Voters in the area remarked that they have been inundated with campaign efforts, with West saying he's ignored some of the door knockers.

""I'm flooded with ads, flooded. They have knocked on the door. But I didn't answer the door because I saw what it was. But we are definitely bombarded with ads,"" West said.

Soentgerath said that he's seen ""a big push from both sides. And again, with all due respect to either side, the bottom line is, if you want change, get up, go to work and pull that lever on Nov. 5.""

While Michael remarked that while he hasn't seen ""too much out here yet,"" he noted he has seen more Trump ads than Harris ads.

""So that just means we need to work harder,"" Michael said.

Tony Monopoli is a Scranton native who has since moved to another key battleground state, Georgia, and told Fox News Digital that he is supporting Harris in the election. Monopoli was visiting Scranton with his brothers and spoke to Fox News Digital outside of the Lackawanna County Courthouse, where there is a veterans memorial.

""I think her plans to support small businesses by offering a $50,000 tax credit for small business owners is a big deal. I think her plan to offer $25,000 in first-time homebuyers' assistance is a big deal, given the cost of homes today. And also, the $6,000 child tax credit for the first year of a child's life is a big deal,"" he explained of his support of Harris.

Fox Digital asked Monopoli if he's seen more or less campaigning efforts from either candidate in Pennsylvania vs. Georgia, where both candidates are also heavily campaigning for votes.

""I'd say it's about the same,"" he said. Remarking that he hasn't ""really seen any different"" in either area.

Pennsylvania will again serve as a key battleground state this election cycle as former President Donald Trump and President Biden are anticipated to face a rematch in a state that narrowly voted for Trump in 2016, and elected Biden in 2020 at a 1.17% margin.

For Soentgerath, he encouraged voters to do their own homework before casting their ballots, leaning on his concerns over the economy, he said voters should simply review their pay stubs from just a few years ago to help determine their vote.

The ""Miami Vice"" star has been married to his wife, Kelley Phleger, since 1999. The couple share three children: Atherton Grace, Jasper and Deacon.

In another interview with People earlier this month, Johnson said the keys to his 25-year marriage to Phleger are simple.

DON JOHNSON SAYS THREE THINGS ARE 'KEY' TO HIS LONG-LASTING MARRIAGE

""Oh, we are just so in tune with each other that there's an unspoken, like, trust and kindness and respect with us. And those are the keys,"" he told the outlet.

""Obviously, she's a saint. I was with Bob Dylan one time, and I was having relationship issues, and Bob looks up at me and goes, 'Well, see, love is about kindness, trust and respect, isn't it?' And that's the embodiment of Kelley,"" Johnson said about what makes Phleger perfect for him. ""It's kindness, trust and respect, and we have that with each other. We're lovers and friends and it's fun. She's an amazing woman.""

He is also father to a son from his relationship with Patti D'Arbanville, Jesse Wayne Johnson, and daughter Dakota Johnson, from his marriage to Melanie Griffith.

Johnson and Griffith married when she was 18 in 1976, after first meeting when she was 14. They divorced in November that same year.

They married again in 1989 and remained together until 1996. Johnson also adopted Griffith's son from her relationship with actor Steven Bauer, Alexander Bauer, per People.

Being a dad is another one of Johnson's secrets to looking and feeling young.

""You have to exercise, and do it a lot,"" he told the outlet. ""How do you think I got six kids?"" adding jokingly, ""That I know of, anyway!""

Johnson's youthful energy is being put to work, with headlining two projects, Netflix's ""Rebel Ridge"" and the new Hulu series ""Doctor Odyssey.""

Earlier this month, Johnson reflected on the ups and downs of fame during his career-making success on ""Miami Vice.""

""For a long time, I couldn't even go anywhere,"" he told People.

He continued, ""I had to isolate. The [women] know where you are. We had security 24/7.""

The intense fandom reminded him of what Elvis Presley must have gone through at the height of his fame.

""One day, I reflected on Elvis and thought, 'Isn't this kind of the way Elvis lived and died?' Not that I'm comparing myself to Elvis, but in terms of him not being able to have a personal life. So I learned to manage it and vowed not to let it imprison me,"" Johnson said."
The Fiscal Impact Of Mass Immigration On U.S. And European Taxpayers,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/30/the-fiscal-impact-of-mass-immigration-on-us-and-european-taxpayers/,2024-09-30T19:56:58Z,"A year ago, I shared with you my thoughts on the immigration crisis, both here in the U.S. and Europe. At the time, there was speculation that international bad actors may be at least partially to blame for the record numbers of immigrants pouring across the U.S. Southern Border and arriving by boat in Southern Europe. Below is an update to the story.

Immigration is once again making headlines (has it ever stopped?), and it's not just the sheer numbers that have people talking. Concerns about mass immigration -- both legal and illegal -- have dominated political and economic conversations in the U.S. and Europe.

Although the number of migrants crossing into the U.S. has eased significantly in the past 12 months, the underlying challenges remain. The Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the undocumented immigrant population in the U.S. stands at 14 million, a huge increase from just a few years ago. The share of foreign-born residents is now over 14% of the total population, its highest level since the early 1900s, when waves of immigrants came from Italy, Poland and elsewhere.

Today, the new arrivals are straining resources in ways that directly impact the American taxpayer and investor alike.

Let's take Springfield, Ohio, as a microcosm of what's happening across the country. You've probably heard that this town of 58,000 has recently seen a large influx of Haitian asylum seekers, leading to skyrocketing housing costs and a sharp rise in the cost of living. The median rental price in Springfield jumped 43% in just one year, according to Zillow. Locals are feeling the pinch at the pump and the grocery store as inflation ripples through their economy.

It's not just prices that are going up. Health care providers are stretched thin, as more translation services and additional staff are needed to accommodate the growing population. In September, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced $2.5 million in state support for Springfield, but the burden on local taxpayers is undeniable.

We're seeing similar stories play out across the U.S. as towns and cities grapple with the surge of new arrivals. In New York City, Mayor Eric Adams, recently indicted on federal corruption charges, reported last summer that the city expected to spend $12 billion over the next three years on housing, food and health care for recently arrived immigrants. To cover these costs, the city plans to cut services across the board -- sanitation, public education, even the police force. The fiscal strain is real, and it's hitting Americans where it hurts most.

What's happening in the U.S. is mirrored on a much larger scale across Europe. Over the past decade, 29 million immigrants -- both legal and illegal -- have poured into the region, overwhelming an already dysfunctional immigration system. Concerns about public safety and inadequate integration policies have led to widespread public unrest. Just look at the riots in the U.K., where immigration has emerged as a defining issue.

Investors should be paying close attention. Western Europe, traditionally known for its social safety nets and generous welfare systems, is struggling to accommodate this massive population influx. Europe's current situation is a reminder that unchecked migration, without the proper systems in place, can lead to long-term fiscal challenges.

Having said all that, it's important to recognize the value of legal immigration. With fertility rates having fallen well below the replacement level -- or 2.1 children per woman -- the U.S. and Europe face the prospect of near-zero population growth. Legal immigrants, then, play an essential role in maintaining productivity and supporting programs like Social Security.

The hard truth is that the U.S. and Europe face declining populations and a shrinking tax base. I believe the solution lies in smart, sustainable immigration policies -- ones that emphasize legal pathways and prioritize integration."

Produced by the Fashion Impact Fun and the PVBLIC Foundation in partnership with the UN, Vaishnav and a few other women explained how buying and investing in sustainable fashion supports communities, families, the environment, and women's economic and personal lives. ""The stories are just unbelievable,"" Vaishnav said, as she shared the story of a woman who was married off as a child, learned garment industry skills at Saheli Women, and dramatically improved her finances, her life and her family's lives, including finally sending her children to school.

""When woman earns money, she changed everything."" Vaishnav added. ""Another thing which I would say is, more majority of our ladies are saying that we stop facing the domestic violence."" She shared the story of a woman who told her, ""My husband doesn't beat me (anymore). He respect me,"" because now she earns money that supports the family.

""I always say woman is a not a leader, she's a ladder. And when she became a ladder, she let lot of other ladies climb on it and she create such a beautiful world around us,"" Vaishnav impassioned, adding, ""it's an economy of caring.""

Vaishnav is one of three recipients of grants from the Fashion Impact Fund that were honored at the UN session. Saheli Women is a woman-owned business empowering women in rural India with what she called, ""ethical fashion. We co-create slow fashion garments with international fashion partners, utilising traditional craft practices and creating meaningful livelihood opportunities."" They are preserving traditional crafts and their cultural heritage, empowering women and manufacturing and selling sustainable clothing. Saheli partners with 20 global fashion brands to date, which she told the audience they created through Instagram.

Garment factories can be very bad workplaces for women - and are bad for the environment

Women make up 80% or more of the garment factory workers. Nearly 97% of them are in China, Bangladesh, Vietnam, India, Cambodia, and Laos and they earn meager wages. In Bangladesh. For example, some women workers are paid 33 cents an hour. Their wages cover about a fifth or so of their living expenses and they work excessive working hours, 14 to 16 hours a day, often in dangerous conditions. For example, there was fire in a Bangladesh factory that killed about 1,000 workers (women) and there are reports of violence against a lot of these women. There are reports of female garment factory workers being underpaid and overworked in England and Italy as well.

The fashion industry is ranked as the second most polluting business in the world by the UN and 7% of landfills is garments. In addition, the garment industry is responsible for eight to 10% of global CO2, and 500,000 tons of micro plastics are dumped into oceans each year.

Teaching women sustainable fashion and business in New York City

Another women-owned business in sustainable fashion that earned a recent Fashion Impact Fund grant, and another large grant from New York State, is Custom Collaborative, whose Founder and Executive Director, Ngozi Okaro also spoke at this UN session. It's a training program supporting marginalized women in building careers and businesses in sustainable fashion. Okaro, an attorney by training (Georgetown Law School), has received numerous recognitions, including as a 2022 Goldman Sachs Black Woman Impact Leader, Crain's Notable Women Business Owner, and Kate Spade ""World-Changing Women in Conscious Business"" awardee.

""There are three parts to Custom Collaborative's work,"" Okaro explained, ""Our training institute, which is a 15-week, 30 hour per week program that teaches women to design and sell sustainable fashion. So, they learn about concepts of sustainability, actually practice it, all the materials that we use are upcycled and, and recycled. Women learn personal finance. There is a 10-part business curriculum in addition to them learning how to actually create and understand the design and production of clothing."" Some of the program's alumni return to mentor the new classes of students.

""The work that we do with companies like PVH or Chanel or, Theory or others, it's really about them coming in and providing maybe services and support on more specific issues like resume writing or public speaking or career discernment."" Custom Collaborative also has a business incubator and production co-op.

Custom Collaborative recently received a $1.1 million grant from New York State, which ""relates to revitalizing downtown communities,"" Jeanette Rausch of New York State Office of Planning, Developing and Community Infrastructure told the audience. These funds have to be used for ""capital dollars,"" she clarified, ""so they can't use them for operation or ongoing costs or deferred maintenance, or things like that.""

With these funds, Custom Collaborative moved from their small temporary space to a 10,000 square foot space, and will build out its infrastructure. They are also going to buy new equipment, including a new high-capacity felting machine, ""Where you can take old fabrics and make it into a new textile or weaving things, or even like 3D printing and 3D design, which allows people then to make prototypes without going through a sampling process that wastes a lot of fabric,"" Okaro explained.

""We want to make sure that the women who come through our programs are trained for the jobs that are available today and the jobs that will be upcoming.""

Advice for how to purchase clothing sustainably and that supports women?

Okaro suggested, ""buying less,"" because, she added, ""part of the problem is there's this like rampant over production. And so if we buy fewer things, but nicer things and take care of them for longer, that would definitely I think help women.""

She also suggested ""thinking about like how to extend the life of your garments,"" and shared a story about how she is doing that, repurposing a skirt from her grandmother.

Naturally, they suggested supporting women-owned businesses and buying locally as well.

Vaishnav insisted that we be conscious shoppers. ""We really want the consumer to really understand where they are buying from, why they are buying. And if something is super cheap, just think, 'wow how it could be possible?',"" because it took a factory worker's time (likely a woman) and materials. ""So, always be careful what you're buying."" She reminded us that, ""every single consumer is equally very, very important."" Therefore, to make purchasing decisions responsibly."

Ina Garten shares her secret for a great dinner party: 6 people and round table,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/nx-s1-5131273/barefoot-contessa-memoir-ina-garten,2024-09-30T17:43:42Z,"""I love cooking for people I love,"" Ina Garten says. ""And the cooking is just the medium; the thing that I care about is the connection."" Austin Hargrave/Penguin Random House hide caption

Ina Garten, the host of the Food Network's Barefoot Contessa, still remembers a disastrous party she threw when she was 21. She'd invited 20 guests, with the intention of making an individual omelet for each person -- except she barely knew how to cook an omelet.

""I was in the kitchen the entire time,"" Garten says. ""It was such a bad party, I almost never had another party again.""

Garten says she learned a few things from the experience -- not the least of which was to keep things simple. Her ideal dinner party is six people sitting at a small, round table. And, yes, the shape of the table matters.

""Very often people have long, rectangular tables that are way too wide and people are seated too far apart,"" Garten says. ""I like when everybody's knees are almost touching and it feels very intimate, with a dark room and a candle in the middle.""

Garten's relaxed approach to entertaining is the hallmark of Barefoot Contessa, which debuted in 2002. Filmed in the kitchen of her home in East Hampton, N.Y., the show follows Garten as she shops for ingredients, tests recipes and sits down to eat with her husband Jeffrey and their friends.

""When you cook for people you love, they feel taken care of, and you make great friends and you create a community for yourself,"" she says. ""And I think that's really what we all need, and what we all kind of hunger for.""

An Emmy and James Beard Award winner, Garten has also penned 13 cookbooks. In the new memoir, Be Ready When the Luck Happens, she details how she went from working in the White House to becoming a beloved culinary voice, with fans from all walks of life.

""One of the things I love about what I do is that everybody cooks,"" she says. ""I was walking up Madison Avenue one day and a woman in a big fur coat ... said, 'Darling, I just just love your cookbooks.' And a block later, a truck driver pulled over and said, 'Hey, babe, I love your show.' And I thought, That's food. Everybody's interested in food.""

On how working for the federal government in the 1970s connects to her love of cooking

I worked in a group called Office of Management and Budget, and what we did was write the president's budget that was sent to Congress. And I worked in nuclear energy policy. ... I've always been very interested in science, and the way I feel about what I do now is it's science, but you end up with something delicious instead of enriched uranium.

On buying a specialty food store in Westhampton, N.Y., when she was 30

I walked in and they were baking chocolate chip cookies. And I just remember thinking, Wow, this is where I want to be. ... So we met with the owner and I made her a low offer. She was asking for $25,000, which was more money than we had in the world. And I just, on a whim, offered her $20,000, thinking, Well, we'll go home, we'll negotiate, I'll have time to think about this. And we drove back to Washington [D.C.]. And Monday morning, I was in my office and the phone rang, and ... [the owner] said, ""Thank you very much. I accept your offer."" And I remember thinking, s***, I just bought a food store. I remember going to my boss and going, ""You're not going to believe what I just did.""

On the store's name, Barefoot Contessa

The name really related to Diana [Stratta, the previous owner], not me. But then as the summer progressed, I realized it actually had a resonance. ... It was about being elegant and earthy at the same time. And I think that really was what the store was about.

On a time when she separated from her husband Jeffrey

This was the '70s and we both assumed that he would be the husband and I would be the wife and that he would take care of the finances and I would have dinner on the table. I mean, we had prescribed roles, but it was a time when women were becoming aware that just because we were women didn't mean that there were things that we had to do. I really credit Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan for making us think about it. And it may be that you want to have dinner on the table, but it doesn't mean that because you're the woman, you're the only one who should have dinner on the table. So I was becoming aware of this, and Jeffrey, who had no reason at all to change his mind, wasn't. And so I found some frustration with being in a prescribed role as the wife. ...

One weekend in Westhampton, that first summer, we took a long walk on the beach and I said, ""I feel like I need to be on my own for a while."" And Jeffrey said the right thing. He said, ""If you feel you need to be on your own, then you need to be on your own."" And he went back to Washington and didn't come back. And it was a tough time, but it led us back to a different kind of relationship.

On writing about her unhappy childhood

Remember, this was the '50s. It's not the era of helicopter parents who are encouraging their children to do extraordinary things. This is an era where you did what the parents told you to do. And my parents were particularly harsh about it. ... [My mother] dealt with it by pushing us away and making sure that she didn't actually have to spend time with us. So I spent most of my time in my bedroom, and my brother spent time in his. And then my father was a really, really harsh authoritarian figure. If you didn't do exactly what he wanted you to do, it was met with pretty serious anger and sometimes ... hitting. And it was a very difficult way to grow up. ... The only thing I remember is just total disappointment, because I wouldn't do what they wanted me to do. They never gave me an opportunity to do what I wanted to do.

I talk about this in the book, not so much because it was such a terrible childhood. It certainly wasn't a happy one, but there were so many worse childhoods. But I wanted people to know that the story of your childhood doesn't necessarily need to be the story of your life."
The Biggest New Movies Coming To Netflix In October 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbean/2024/09/30/the-biggest-new-movies-coming-to-netflix-in-october-2024/,2024-09-30T15:29:58Z,"Looking forward to what Netflix will bring to subscribers in October, both horror movie fans and non-horror movie fans can rejoice. While there are plenty of scary flicks on their way, including a time-traveling movie where a girl must save her sister and another where a woman slowly loses control over her body, there will also be several other great options, like a new romance between a boy and a ghost and the fourth film of a lucrative animated series. To boot, we're getting a sequel to one of the most popular movies to ever hit Netflix -- needless to say, you've got lots of great options to choose from in the month of October.

So which movies can you not miss next month? Well, I've picked out the best of the best. Below, I've put together the seven biggest movies coming to Netflix in October 2024. And at the bottom of the article, you can find a full list of every single movie that's coming to the streaming platform over the course of the entire month. Your next movie night movie awaits.

It looks like we haven't escaped the Vertical Self-Management Center yet. The famous multilevel prison is back in The Platform 2, the sequel to the Spanish film that took the streaming world by storm back during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this prison, a platform descends once a day with rations, sparking chaos and class division as inmates on lower levels are left with scraps -- or nothing at all -- forcing them to confront their most primal survival instincts. The sequel plans to delve deeper into this twisted universe, with new characters facing ever grimmer challenges than before. Directed by Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia, who helmed the first film, The Platform 2 will maintain the original movie's dark, satirical tone, promising an ""exciting physical journey"" into the psychological madness of its dystopian world. The film stars Milena Smit (known for her work in Parallel Mothers and Cross the Line) and Hovik Keuchkerian (Money Heist (La Casa de Papel)).

The Platform 2 will be added to Netflix on Oct. 4, 2024.

The young adult novel written by Cesar Vitale about a boy who falls in love with a ghost will receive its cinematic adaptation this month on Netflix. This heartwarming, supernatural tale follows the teenaged Cole, who is struggling with the grief after losing his father. But his life takes an unexpected turn after he moves into a new home, only to find it haunted by the spirit of Bea, a free-spirited girl who died in the 1920s. This whimsical yet poignant blend of fantasy and romance aims to combine the present with the past in an attempt to depict the traumatic struggle with grief and the cathartic power that love and connection can inspire. The adaptation stars Michael Cimino (Love, Victor) as Cole, while Bea is portrayed by Peyton List (Cobra Kai). The supporting cast includes Andrea Navedo (Jane the Virgin), Brandon Michael Hall (God Friended Me, Search Party), Ethan Herschenfeld (Red Notice), Shivani Mendez (The Big Leap) and Phoebe Holden.

Girl Haunts Boy will be added to Netflix on Oct. 10, 2024.

It's rare for a modern romance -- or any romance, for that matter -- to explore love that blossoms between two completely different generations. But that's the case for Lonely Planet, which follows a reclusive novelist named Katherine who meets a younger man named Owen on a writer's retreat in Morocco. Her journey seeking inspiration and clarity is realized in unexpected form as she embarks on such a whirlwind, life-changing romance. While exploring Morocco's remote landscapes, both Katherine and Owen confront their inner-most struggles and misconceptions about themselves. Directed by Susannah Grant (who penned movies like Ever After, Pocahontus and Erin Brockovich), this movie explores the vibrant and exotic backdrop of Morocco while traversing this tender tale of introspection and out-of-nowhere connection. Laura Dern (who won an Oscar for Marriage Story and stars, of course, in Jurassic Park) plays Katherine, while Liam Hemsworth (The Hunger Games, The Witcher) takes on the role of Owen.

Lonely Planet will be available on Netflix on Oct. 11, 2024.

Sometimes the plot of a movie seems so crazy that it couldn't possibly be real...yet, Woman of the Hour is one of those cases where you must ask yourself, ""How did I not know this actually happened?"" A large portion of the world will learn such a story later this month when Anna Kendrick's directorial debut hits Netflix. Kendrick also stars in this film about Sheryl Bradshaw, who met a man named Rodney Alcala on the popular blind-dating game show, The Dating Game. At first they hit it off, but steadily she feels uneasy about her new man. Little does she know he's secretly in the midst of a years-long murder spree. The film dives into the stories of his victims, all while Sheryl navigates such new shaky terrain. Screenwriter Ian McDonald's original screenplay, Rodney and Sheryl, was featured on the Black List, which highlights the best un-produced scripts in Hollywood. Daniel Zovatto (It Follows, Lady Bird) portrays the charming yet dangerous Rodney Alcala. The rest of the cast includes Tony Hale (Veep, Arrested Development), Nicolette Robinson (The Affair, One Night in Miami...), Autumn Best (4400), Kathryn Gallagher (Gossip Girl, Jagged Little Pill) and Kelley Jakle (Pitch Perfect, 42).

Woman of the Hour will be available on Netflix on Oct. 18, 2024.

Anyone looking for some kid-friendly entertainment this month on Netflix will be pleased to know that Kung Fu Panda 4 is making its way over from Peacock, and will be available for the next ten months. The fourth film in the series once again centers on Po (voiced by Jack Black), who faces a new challenge after he learns his time as the Dragon Warrior is coming to an end. He must find a new hero to succeed him, so Po embarks on one final (and hilarious) journey before assuming his destiny as the spiritual leader of the Valley of Peace. He and Zhen, a quick-witted thief and corsac fox, go on a search for Po's successor (and battle a few foes along the way) and run across The Chameleon, a powerful sorceress who will test their strength and unity. Anyone who's a fan of the series can expect more of the same: martial arts sequences powered by the DreamWorks Animation machine, witty humor from an all-star voice cast and lots of inspiring messages about using your strength to help others. Jack Black (School of Rock, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle) returns once again to voice Po. Meanwhile, Awkwafina (Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, The Farewell) voices Zhen and Oscar winner Viola Davis (Doubt, The Help) plays The Chameleon. Lots of other familiar voices from the series, like Dustin Hoffman, James Hong, Bryan Cranston and Ian McShane, make appearances as well.

Kung Fu Panda 4 will be available on Netflix on Oct. 21, 2024.

There are a few famous examples of real-time movies that knock it out of the park -- Before Sunset, United 93 and Run Lola Run to name a few. By their very nature, their stories grab you by the collar with urgency and force you into the story. And that certainly appears to be the case with Don't Move, an upcoming Netflix thriller about a grieving woman named Iris who travels to an isolated forest to find solace. What she doesn't know, however, is what awaits her: a stranger who plans to inject her with a paralytic agent. Her search for peace quickly turns into a nightmare of escape as the drug, which only takes 20 minutes to kick in, slowly paralyzes her body as she runs and hies and fights for her life. Directed by Brian Netto and Adam Schindler, this stripped-down, high-tension thriller unfolds in real time over the course of 85 minutes, all in an effort to capture the sense of claustrophobia and escalating dread that comes with losing control over your body. Kelsey Asbille (Yellowstone, Fargo) plays Iris, while Finn Wittrock (American Horror Story: Hotel, The Big Short) also stars.

Don't Move will be available on Netflix on Oct. 25, 2024.

Just in time for Halloween, Netflix will premiere what looks to be their big horror flick for 2024.

Lucy travels back to the early 2000s and must navigate the era's pop culture, fashion and technology, all while trying to survive the relentless pursuit of a vicious killer. The film becomes a race against time as Lucy attempts to unmask the killer and and rewrite history in order to save her family. Directed by Hannah Macpherson (T@gged) and co-written by Macpherson and Michael Kennedy (Freaky), Time Cut aims to blend the nostalgia of the early 2000s with the suspense of a modern teen slasher film. Madison Bailey (Outer Banks, Black Lightning) stars as Lucy Field, while Antonia Gentry (Ginny & Georgia, Raising Dion) portrays the sister Lucy must to save. The cast also includes Michael Shanks (Virgin River, Altered Carbon), Griffin Gluck (Tall Girl, Locke & Key), Rachael Crawford (When Night Is Falling, Possessor) and Jordan Pettle (Murdoch Mysteries, American Woman)."
"Asheville residents battling 'apocalyptic' aftermath of Hurricane Helene after deadly flooding, landslides",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/asheville-residents-battling-aftermath-hurricane-helene-after-deadly-flooding-landslides-apocalyptic,2024-09-30T15:08:05Z,"At least 99 people have died from Hurricane Helene. FOX Weather correspondent Robert Ray reports the latest on the devastation from Asheville, North Carolina.

One Asheville, North Carolina resident sounded the alarm as his community battles the devastation left by Hurricane Helene, detailing the ""apocalyptic weekend"" as the death toll continues to rise while millions are left without power and water.

""It's been an incredibly apocalyptic weekend for all of us here,"" Asheville resident Gregory Harrison said. ""Almost no gas. There is almost no cell service. There's limited power. There is limited food. There are people who are trying to find potable water to feed their families, to have water for their kids.""

HURRICANE HELENE: FOX WEATHER METEOROLOGIST RESCUES WOMAN FROM CAR DURING LIVE SHOT AS FLOODWATERS RISE

Officials in Asheville are still trying to rescue residents who have been trapped by the historic flooding over the weekend, which has left many without access to power, running water and cell service.

As of Sunday morning, the North Carolina National Guard (NCNG) activated more than 500 soldiers and airmen and more than 200 vehicles and aircraft, including hoist and emergency aviation assets as well as high-water response vehicles.

The NCNG reported that it completed 16 air missions, resulting in the rescue of 119 citizens and 11 pets. It said the largest single mission saw the rescue of 41 people north of Asheville in Bumcombe County.

""Our air assets have moved more than 34,000 pounds of cargo, including food, water, and medical supplies to distribute. In the past 48 hours, we have been augmented by personnel and air assets from Connecticut, Maryland, Ohio, Iowa, Florida, South Carolina, and Pennsylvania,"" the post continued from NCNG.

Buncombe County communications director Lillian Govus urged people in surrounding areas to avoid coming to the affected communities to maximize search and rescue efforts.

""Right now, we need people to not come here,"" Govus told Lawrence Jones. ""We are still in an active search and rescue phase. We have active flooding now. Like you said, it will take just a little bit of rain and we'll have more landslides, more mudslides.""

""One of our interstates, I-40, which is the main interstate that takes you all the way to the beach from Asheville, that interstate is closed because the top of a mountain has actually slid down and covered that entire interstate,"" she continued. ""We have a little narrow pathway, and that is just for our emergency vehicles.""

Govus said her community is no longer recognizable after the deadly storm.

""I live out in Black Mountain. What is there now does not resemble anything of the community where I lived before,"" Govus said. ""Homes are completely gone. Power lines are destroyed. The poles are snapped in half and dangling on other places.""

""Houses are completely washed away. We don't have running water, and so that's a really big public health crisis for us right now,"" she continued.

Appalachian State University student Laci Hentschel said she was one of the lucky residents who has power, water and cell service, but said she knows people who lost everything following Helene's devastation.

""My apartment was luckily one of the ones that we're better off, so we have power, water and Wi-Fi,"" Hentschel told Todd Piro during ""Fox & Friends First"" on Monday. ""However, the water is still undrinkable, but sadly, it's just really sad to see all of my fellow mountaineers that... their apartments just didn't fare as well in all this weather.""

""I know people that lost everything they have and are now trying to get back on their feet,"" she continued. ""It's just really sad to see all of that, but I'm glad that our community can come together and lift each other up and do what we can for each other in this time of need.""

Another Asheville resident, who owns an art studio that was luckily spared, said she moved to North Carolina after Hurricane Ian in hopes of evading another catastrophic storm.

""I came from Florida after Hurricane Ian. I thought this is the area to be safe and this is not safe,"" she said. ""They said this... could happen, but it was hard to believe,"" she continued.

On Sunday, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra declared a public health emergency (PHE) for North Carolina to address the health impacts of Hurricane Helene.

The public health emergency declarations followed President Biden's emergency declarations for Florida, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee. Public health emergency declarations give the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' health care providers and suppliers greater flexibility in meeting the emergency health needs of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries."
Is Trust In Healthcare A Task Too Big To Fail Or Too Big To Fix?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisafitzpatrick/2024/09/30/is-trust-in-healthcare-a-task-too-big-to-fail-or-too-big-to-fix/,2024-09-30T14:41:06Z,"The theme for a recent American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation (ABIM) conference was ""Being a Trustworthy Professional in an Untrusting World."" Trust was the theme that punctuated each conversation, including a keynote address by Sree Chaguturu, CVS Chief Medical Officer. He spoke about the organization's deep commitment to building community trust while wrestling with challenges associated with demonstrating its concrete and direct connection to financial returns. This is not a new challenge. Many people across the healthcare ecosystem acknowledge the power and essentiality of trust to most things in healthcare, including engagement and adherence to health advice. If trust is so widely and intuitively accepted as vital to better outcomes, why are we failing to prioritize and measure it? At the conference, Jackie Judd, nurse and former ABIM Board Trustee, posed a provocative question about trust in healthcare; ""Is this problem too big to fail or too big to fix.""

It depends.

If the goal is to achieve a return on investment (ROI) with less regard for which patients and communities benefit, it is probably too big to fix. However, if the goal is ensuring high-quality, high-value care for everyone, the issue is most assuredly too big to fail. Why? ROI can not be maximized without engaged patients, and engagement can not be optimized without trust. However, the challenge with many of our deliberations about trust in healthcare is that our consideration of it is too pedestrian. Trust seems an obvious thing demanding an obligatory mention in conversations about health equity and social drivers of health. But it matters far beyond words.

A few years ago, while answering questions at a homeless shelter, one of the residents asked me, ""Why would I bother with doctors? I don't like them because I don't understand them. If I can't understand you, I don't trust you."" His healthcare support was a combination of Google and the emergency department.

More recently, while out in the community chatting and answering questions from passersby, a woman who had been watching me for quite a while walked up to me, gave me a banana and asked me to eat it while she watched. I agreed on the condition that she explain her rationale for insisting I eat the fruit on the spot. She said, ""I want to see if you trust us."" She wanted to know if I saw her as an equal and would treat her with dignity and respect. She wanted to know if I saw her humanity just as I did my own. After that exchange, we were able to have a conversation.

These stories offer important lessons for why 'fixing' trust in healthcare is imperative.

First, trust may not be easy to measure or have quality measures assigned to it, but it pervades and influences every engagement. Second, people want us to offer the same level of respect and consideration we would expect when receiving a service. When I talk to a lawyer, accountant or auto mechanic, their approach determines my confidence in their ability to honestly and fairly solve my problem. I expect plain language communication to ensure I understand my options and potential actions. Why should healthcare be different? Third, and speaking of plain language, our communication must reflect the needs of the person we are communicating with. This sounds annoyingly obvious, but it is not happening consistently. At least weekly, someone -- a friend, family member or friend of a friend -- contacts me for an interpretation of something a doctor said while using unintelligible medical jargon. We must train students, interns and residents -- the healthcare workforce pipeline -- to speak in plain language.

Finally, we must delineate the ROI opportunity for prioritizing and addressing trust as a driver of health outcomes. For example, how does trust influence early engagement in care or medication adherence? What are the costs associated with clinic 'no shows' or avoidable hospitalizations among people with an assigned primary care provider? Whether we acknowledge and address it or not, trust lurks in the background, showing up on balance sheets and in quality measures and health outcomes.

I suspect at every health-related conference, someone, somewhere is espousing the need to build trust in healthcare. Let's hope these discussions transition from podiums and conference rooms to C-Suites and boardrooms. After all, if trust in healthcare really is too big to fail, the strategies to fix it will likely need to start there."

I don't care what side of the political spectrum you sit on. We're very honored to have her here,"" said Michelle Adams, co-owner of Classic Elements.

Expanding opportunities for small businesses and developing initiatives to meet their individual needs continues to be a focus for Vice President Harris as she hits the campaign trail. Earlier this month, she released her ""Entrepreneurs & Innovators Policy Plan"" that will support small businesses, entrepreneurs, innovation, and economic growth if she is elected president. Last week, she unveiled her New Way Forward plan, which offers their economic vision for the country

In addition, Vice President Harris has taken the time to visit numerous small businesses in her current role, but has also made these stops somewhat of a hallmark during her presidential campaign. Here are a few businesses the Vice President has visited and what it means to them.

Leah & Louise - Charlotte, North Carolina

As previously noted, Vice President Harris stopped in to visit Leah & Louise, a locally-sourced restaurant that serves modern interpretations of Southern classics that honor Mississippi river valley foodways from Memphis to New Orleans, during a visit to Charlotte, North Carolina. Owner Subrina Collier shared in a recap of the visit that Vice President Harris took the time to interact with staff and guests and that, ""This experience was a reminder of the strength and resilience of the small business community.""

Paschals - Atlanta, Georgia

In July, Vice President Harris made a trip to Paschal's, a nearly 80-year-old Atlanta soul food restaurant whose patrons have included Aretha Franklin, Dizzy Gillespie, and Dr. Martin Luther King.

""Today, we had the honor of welcoming Vice President Kamala Harris to Paschal's! As a cornerstone in the heart of Atlanta's history, Paschal's has always been a gathering place for political leaders and civil rights icons,"" the company stated on Instagram. ""It's only fitting that Vice President Harris joined us today, continuing our legacy of hosting trailblazers and changemakers. Thank you, VP Harris, for your visit and for recognizing the significance of Paschal's in the story of our nation.""

Cocina Adamex - Phoenix, Arizona

A few weeks later during a visit to Phoenix, she and Governor Tim Waltz stopped by Cocina Adamex, a downtown Mexican restaurant, and picked up a to-go order. Owner Adriana Zapata said the Vice President ""is a very down-to-earth, very personable, very authentic kind person.""

""I don't know what can top this. Knowing that we're preparing food for such influential people, I don't even know how I can put this into words,"" Zapata added.

Della Soul Records - Grand Rapids, Michigan

Earlier this year, she dropped in to Della Soul Records in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and bought a Miles Davis album. ""It was a joy to look through the impressive vinyl collection at Della Soul Records, the first Black woman-owned record store in Grand Rapids,"" Vice President Harris posted in a Tweet about the visit.

""VP Harris immediately shared that she had heard about me and my journey and wanted to meet me while she was in town. That's dope!"" store owner Della Marie Levi shared in a Facebook post.

Classic Elements - Johnstown, Pennsylvania

In September, she visited Classic Elements, a bookstore, cafe, and wine bar, to meet the owners and staff and learn more about their opportunities and challenges. Her visit coincided with the store's fifth anniversary and Adams said the Secret Service's preparation for her visit was considerate of her business' operations.

""They tried not to impact our business. I mean obviously there was a little bit of an impact. It's been a hectic week, but it was totally worth it."" she said.

""Put it like this -- she knows her stuff. It felt good to realize it wasn't just for her show and tell, you know? It was really a sincere 'I need to pick up some records.' So I loved that,"" said owner Charvis Campbell.

Almost every presidential candidate voices their support for small business and a path to achieving the American Dream. However, Vice President Harris has gone above and beyond in this area and her many visits with entrepreneurs show that she is putting her money where her mouth is - one sweet treat at a time."
Netflix's Best New Movie Arrives With A 99% Critic Score,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/30/netflixs-best-new-movie-arrives-with-a-99-critic-score/,2024-09-30T12:31:45Z,"Netflix has been producing a surprising amount of good movies today, though usually we're talking about something in the scripted space. Now, its best new movie, Will and Harper, comes from comedy legend Will Ferrell in an unscripted format, a documentary where Ferrell tours the country with his friend Harper Steele who recently came out as trans, as he tries to understand a concept he is not all that familiar with.

The film currently has a stunning 99% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes with 85 reviews in, and that's just a single negative review out of all time them keeping it 100. The audience score is quite good as well, an 80% with several hundred reviews in, and it has not been sunk or bombed because of its subject matter, in the face of so much anti-trans rhetoric in the present day.

Here is a longer description of the film:

""Three years ago, Will Ferrell was filming a movie when he received a most surprising email: his dear friend of nearly 30 years was coming out to him as a trans woman. That friend was Harper Steele, a writer he met on his first day at Saturday Night Live back in 1995. From that fateful first meeting in the halls of 30 Rock, Will knew he had found a match made in comedy, and their friendship and creative partnership would only continue to grow over the next 3 decades.

In this intimate, honest, and heartfelt documentary, Will and Harper hit the open road together to process this new stage of their friendship and reintroduce Harper to the country that she loves -- this time, as herself. Over 16 days, the two drive from New York to LA, visiting stops that are meaningful to them, to their friendship, and to America. Through laughter, tears, and many cans of Pringles, they push past their comfort zones as they re-examine their relationships to these spaces, and to each other, in this new light.""

Will and Harper has charted on the Netflix Top 10 list at #4, currently, which is pretty solid. It's past Rebel Ridge, Uglies and the ever-present Super Mario Bros. Movie, at least. The top three right now are Jailbreak: Love on the Run, The Garfield Movie, and Rez Ball, the last of which has again, a really excellent score of a 95% as it follows a Native American high school basketball team dealing with the loss of a teammate. It also sounds very good, so I'll add it to the list. But first, Will and Harper."
Kamala Harris' husband Doug Emhoff 'reshaped the perception of masculinity': MSNBC host,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/kamala-harris-husband-doug-emhoff-reshaped-perception-masculinity-msnbc-host,2024-09-30T10:39:10Z,"MSNBC host Jen Psaki asked Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff about redefining the view of masculinity by openly supporting his wife Vice President Kamala Harris.

Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff has ""reshaped the perception of masculinity"" with his support for Vice President Kamala Harris, MSNBC host Jen Psaki suggested Sunday.

""There is also an important, interesting part about how people have talked about your role is how your role has reshaped the perception of masculinity,"" Psaki remarked with a slight laugh. ""I'm not sure you planned on that, but you are an incredibly supportive spouse. Has that been an evolution for you? Do you think that's part of the role you might play as First Gentleman?""

""It's funny. I've started to think a lot about this. I've always been like this. My dad's always been like this. To me, it's the right thing to do, support women. It is mutual with Kamala and I. We support each other, we have each other's back,"" Emhoff said.

He added, ""I've said many times when we lift up women, we support women whether it's pay equity, childcare, family leave, and all of these issues in this post-Dobbs hellscape. Women should not be less than. Women should not have less rights and be treated differently. That's not the American way.""

MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: TRUMP APPEALS TO MEN WITH 'RETRO, MACHO' VIEWS, WHILE EMHOFF EMBODIES 'SUPPORTIVE' MEN

Psaki continued, ""There is a pop-culture phrase, 'wife guy,' which you've kind of been known as. Are you familiar with this?""

""I have heard about it,"" Emhoff said.

""A 'wife guy,' a 'proud wife guy.' How do you feel about it?"" she asked.

Emhoff joked, ""If I do something annoying to Kamala, and she gets upset, I'll just show her that article.""

Various media outlets and commentators have painted Emhoff and Harris' running mate Gov. Tim Walz to be different examples of masculinity to combat former President Trump's hold on the male vote. A Washington Post columnist went as far as to refer to Emhoff as a ""progressive sex symbol.""

""Move over, Ryan Gosling. The modern female fantasy is embodied by the man who might soon become our first First Gentleman,"" Catherine Rampell wrote.

CNN's Dana Bash suggested during the DNC that Emhoff and Walz appealed to voters who were not as masculine as Republican candidates.

""But they are doing so in trying to put forward male figures, Tim Walz being one of them, Doug Emhoff last night, who can speak to men out there who might not be the sort of testosterone-laden, y'know, gun-toting kind of guy who wants to listen to Hulk Hogan and the kind of players that came out at the RNC or might want to listen to that,"" she said.

""But also, in addition, understand that it's okay in 2024 to be a man comfortable in his own skin who supports a woman, and that is something they are really trying to work on with male voters beyond the base,"" she added."
Inside Two Ibiza Gems: A Chic Club And A Hedonistic Haven Worth Seeing,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisakocay/2024/09/30/inside-two-ibiza-gems-a-chic-club-and-a-hedonistic-haven-worth-seeing/,2024-09-30T10:12:09Z,"Discover the true heart of Balearic living at Chinois and Beachouse, two spaces that successfully balance attracting tourists while also staying committed to serving the local community.

Ibiza's party season is coming to a close. The club capital's peak nightlife run takes place from the end of April or the beginning of May until early to mid-October. No matter the night, no matter the time, no matter the location, each day is full of impressive events.

Enter the world of the underground with artists such as Peggy Gou, Black Coffee, Maya Jane Coles, Kerri Chandler, Solomun, Honey Dijon, Franky Wah, TSHA, Jaime Jones, Claptone, Yung Singh, Green Velvet, SYREETA and Mathame. If you prefer to see chart-topping acts, the options are limitless: Calvin Harris, Arielle Free, Chris Lorenzo, Dombresky, Sonny Fodera, Eric Prydz, CamelPhat, Fisher, Danny Howard and David Guetta are just a few of the tastemakers that concert-goers can find. There are also premier party platforms like elrow, ANTS, Defected, CircoLoco, ABODE, Glitterbox and Music On. What can't you find on the White Island when there's something for every palate of dance music?

In addition, there are globally renowned clubs sure to be on people's must-attend lists, such as Amnesia, DC10, Pacha, Hï and Ushuaïa. These mega venues have earned their status with their impressive lineups, distinct experiential offerings, longevity and more. While these hot spots are worth attending, they aren't the only way to get the authentic Ibiza experience. Consider venturing somewhere new, somewhere smaller and somewhere musically diverse.

Consider venturing to Chinois.

Chinois may be a relative newcomer in Ibiza, having opened its doors in 2022, but that doesn't mean it hasn't already established itself as a prominent party player in the scene. The 1,000-person capacity venue, which is intimate when compared to other clubs on the island, features opulent decor that channels the extravagance of old-world Asia.

The Shanghai Opium Den of China inspires this design, says Danny Whittle, one of the music directors at Chinois. He adds that this aesthetic is the root of the venue's name. Not only is Whittle a key figure at Chinois, but he is also a notable person within the dance music industry, boasting a remarkable resume as he is a founding partner of esteemed music industry conference International Music Summit (IMS) and the former music and brand director for Pacha, which is a position he held for many years. His impressive background certainly aids him at Chinois, informing him on making decisions that have the potential to push Ibiza's nightlife scene to the next level.

Despite the venue's lavish ambiance that pays tribute to history, Chinois remains steadfast in its commitment to maintaining a modern approach, as exemplified through its first-class visual productions and artist booking strategy focused on putting diversity first. Chinois showcases diversity with its inclusive lineups and events. The club has also been successful because of its dedication to serving crowds from numerous genres and its adherence to booking sonic storytellers whose styles span the broad spectrum of dance music. Most notable among the star-studded list of sound designers who have graced the venue's stage this season is global sensation Honey Dijon, who had a September residency with the discothèque this year. Other sonic explorers who got behind the club's decks include Kerri Chandler, Skream, Cincity, Carl Kennedy, Luciano, Gorgon City, Mestiza, Nadja, Cristoph, Clint Lee, Mari Martello and Safar, exemplifying the nightlife hub's bookings that feature not only famed artists but also emerging talent.

Chinois, located in the heart of Ibiza Marina, opened its doors for this season on Sunday, April 28th. Its season finale will take place on Sunday, October 13th, featuring performances by Amémé, Rivo, Bruz and Fell Reis. In addition, there will be a closing party for Trip, which gears itself to the island's locals as opposed to tourists. This event, to take place on Saturday, November 2nd, is for the underground party series, which is the longest-running residency when it comes to the island's season length. Trip's season close hosts the likes of Ricardo Villalobos, Sonja Moonear and Tuccillo, who are all slated to spin stunning sets.

Trip's season close hosts the likes of Ricardo Villalobos, Sonja Moonear and Tuccillo, who are all slated to spin stunning sets.

Trip, which takes place each Saturday, is just one of the world-class residencies that the nightlife spot has hosted this season. This year's peak party time has also seen other series host weekly takeovers: La Troya -- a legacy residency that has been throwing parties geared to the LGBTQIA+ community for over 30 years -- is presented on Mondays, Fridays are home to Pablo Fierro's We're Here events and the parties for the Franky Wah Presents Shén residency are part of the program for Sundays. However, it doesn't stop there. Thursdays showcase ""Chinois Presents,"" which brings in one-off parties and new monthly residencies that are complete with international headliners, one-off appearances and live shows that span various musical styles.

Indeed, Chinois has curated an impressive selection of sonic stylists and residencies for the season, which has led to its stately standing among the island's top discothèques. What makes it stand out from most of its competitors, though, is its focus on multi-genre programming.

""You can't do the same genre every night,"" Whittle says. ""The people won't keep coming back to the club. If you look at a club like DC10, for example, they stick with the same genre, which is why they're only open two nights a week or maybe three nights a week. Then you look at people like Hï and Pacha -- they change their genre quite regularly because they're trying to get the public in. What we are trying to do is sit in the middle a little bit of that, where we keep the similar vibe -- very cool, very good quality -- but without going too wide on the genre levels. We are not doing over-the-top EDM commercial [music], and we're not doing really dark, underground Berlin sounds. We're sitting somewhere in the middle, and hopefully, we're capturing cool, quality and fun.""

Sofija Mehta -- co-owner of Island Hospitality, which is the mastermind company behind Chinois -- adds that the venue always fosters a ""beautiful, feminine energy"" because of its design, as seen in the visual art, round sofas and various fabric and texture choices. ""It's not something that a man would do in his house, but maybe a woman,"" she says. ""So really, like every single detail, I would say, is more feminine than masculine.""

Whether an attendee prefers the sounds of the underground or music that is more approachable for those new to dance music, there are soundscapes for all. Given its location in the Ibiza Marina -- which some consider to be among the top most exclusive yachting and lifestyle marinas in the Mediterranean -- Mehta says any day of the week should be ""a really good time to come to Chinois.""

In addition, Chinois' ability to successfully mix clubbers with VIP attendees has also driven its success. Whittle says the venue's size dictates that both types of clientele are needed in order for the club to succeed. There should be between 800 and 900 general club-goers, with VIP customers completing the rest of the 1,000-person capacity space.

""When I started in electronic music,"" Whittle says, ""there were no older people in electronic music. It was a brand new scene, but it's been around now for nearly 40 years. So what you've got [now] are VIPs who actually grew up with electronic music and actually love electronic music. It just so happens that they've got a credit card, and they want to sit around the table and not necessarily [be] on the dancefloor. So it's not like you're being invaded now by a load of rich people. It actually is just slightly wealthier people who really love electronic music and have grown up with it. So there's a very nice environment now in the club. When clubs that have a sort of a crossover, VIP [and] dancefloor mix, it really works quite well. It's a great environment.""

Certainly, Chinois' diverse artist booking strategy, posh design, modern approach, lineup of globally acclaimed artists and residencies, multi-genre programming and ability to accommodate different clientele proves its status as one of Ibiza's nightlife spots worth seeing. It may be smaller than its supersized competitors, but that adds to the distinct experience that Chinois cultivates.

""I think all the other big venues in Ibiza are like supermarkets, and I think Chinois is like a delicatessen,"" Whittle says.

Chinois is just one of the offerings presented by Island Hospitality. Its other venture, Beachouse, caters not only to those seeking music escapism and a slow lifestyle but also to those looking for day-to-night relaxation, contemporary dining and immersive cultural events.

Located on the palm-tree-lined shores of Playa d'en Bossa in Ibiza, Beachouse is a Balearic escape, one that offers guests the opportunity to relax on the beach, take a dip in the sea and embark on a day-long rejuvenation experience. From sunrise morning yoga to revitalizing breakfasts, lunches on the beach soundtracked by downtempo music, seaside sunbed lounging, moonlit dinners situated on the beach, candlelit cocktails expertly crafted by skilled mixologists and dancing beachside to local and international deejays, the hedonistic haven offers a complete package -- one of relaxation, entertainment and indulgence.

""When I think about Beachouse, I always think of it as a really honest place,"" Mehta says. ""What you get is really honest when it comes to the food, when it comes to the people and when it comes to the venue itself. We're not hiding anything. Everything is super clean. It's not pretentious. It's super authentic. It's really what I would like to believe what Ibiza used to be. It's not like this wannabe crowd that you find in some other places, who come there to show off and pop their bottles. [Beachouse is] a super chill, relaxed place.""

The tranquil establishment celebrates its 10th anniversary this season, complete with a birthday bash that took place in June. The four-day event showcased an eclectic blend of diverse deejays and musicians to bring the essence of Balearic living to life. The partying doesn't stop there, though.

Throughout the venue's season, it hosts regular parties and dining experiences. Guests have the opportunity to groove to the transformative energy of BOHO every Thursday. In addition, there is Beachouse Sundays, where guests find the musical stylings of Dubai-based and French trio Arkadyan -- a 2024 Beachouse resident known for fusing real instruments with electronic sounds, playing everything from organic house to Afro house. There is also the monthly Full Moon Celebrations for lunar-lit dancing. The season will close on Sunday, October 13th, marking the end of the 10-year celebrations.

Much like Chinois, Beachouse has earned its spot as one of Ibiza's worthwhile destinations. Consider attending either -- or perhaps both -- during your next trip to the White Island. Although Chinois and Beachouse attract tourists from around the world, they are committed to serving the local community, thus allowing travelers to experience the true heart of Ibiza.

""All our venues are really grounded with the local community, always. They remain small,"" Mehta says. ""So no matter how big venues can become and how [popular] they can become, we are always really celebrating the local community. It's very authentic. We remain very authentic in each choice -- from food to activities and deejays."""
"Single Utah mother, 33, raising money for her own funeral after cancer diagnosis gives her 3 months to live",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/single-utah-mother-33-raising-money-her-own-funeral-after-cancer-diagnosis-gives-her-3-months-live,2024-09-30T10:06:04Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

A young and single Utah mother of two small children was told by her doctors that she has three months to live after being diagnosed with terminal cancer.

Erika Diarte-Carr, 33, is now planning her own funeral and raising money to leave behind a trust fund for her children: Jeremiah, 7, and Aaliyah, 5.

Diarte-Carr was at the hospital to treat a shoulder injury in May 2022 when she learned she had Stage 4 small cell lung carcinoma, a rare form of cancer, she wrote on a GoFundMe page. The doctor told her there were multiple tumors that had metastasized to other parts of her body including her skeletal system, which is how the tumor that was causing her shoulder pain was located.

The woman began treatment for the cancer before she was given more devastating news this past January, when she was diagnosed with Cushing Syndrome, which is caused by an excess amount of the stress hormone cortisol and includes symptoms such as weight gain, weak muscles and high blood pressure.

DRINKING ALCOHOL LINKED TO SIX TYPES OF CANCER, EXPERTS SAY: 'IT'S TOXIC'

She said the Cushing led to several other underlying health issues, including rapid weight gain, swelling, muscle and bone deterioration, high blood pressure and Type 2 diabetes.

Cushing is extremely rare, with only about 40 to 70 people out of every 1 million having it, according to the National Institutes of Health.

After her diagnosis, she continued working full-time and only took off two months early on for surgeries, biopsies, appointments, radiation and chemotherapy treatments. But due to her deteriorating health, she eventually found herself unable to work and has now been out of work for months.

Diarte-Carr said she had an appointment with her oncologist on Sept. 18, when she was informed that her treatments were not working, and she had only three months to live. She then decided to discontinue her treatments and spend her remaining time with her children.

""I have been given 3 months to live. 3 months to spend with my babies and loved ones,"" she wrote on the GoFundMe page. ""3 months to make the best of what time I have left. During these next couple of months I need to make sure my kids will be ok after I am gone. I am faced now with the most difficult thing of planning my own funeral.""

Because she has not been able to work for the past several months, she says she does not have money saved up or life insurance set aside.

""I have looked into the expenses and I am needing to raise about $5,000 to ensure funeral costs are covered plus I'm wanting to leave something behind for my babies,"" she said.

The GoFundMe page was created shortly after Diarte-Carr learned of her diagnosis when she was still 30. She has far surpassed her $5,000 goal and wants to leave the rest in a trust fund for her children.

As of Monday morning, the GoFundMe page has raised more than $1 million.

""All the funds that have exceeded my funeral cost will be now put into a trust fund for my babies,"" Diarte-Carr wrote. ""That way, I can leave behind something for them and I can still ensure they are going to be ok as they grow up.""

""They are my whole life, light and soul. My children are my fight and what keep me going,"" she said."
Miami's famed restaurant Versailles shares 'delicious' Cuban sandwich recipe,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/miami-restaurant-versailles-shares-cuban-sandwich-recipe,2024-09-30T09:42:38Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Tennessee Titans fans who have traveled to Miami for the ""Monday Night Football"" game against the Dolphins will no longer be able to try the classic Cuban sandwich from Versailles, which once served them at Hard Rock Stadium.

But there are satellite locations throughout Miami International Airport for visitors to taste the iconic flavor of ""the world's most famous Cuban restaurant,"" as the establishment proudly proclaims on its sign.

Nicole Valls, who was practically raised in the restaurant, is today co-owner of the iconic eatery that her grandfather first opened in 1971.

THESE 10 RESTAURANTS ARE CONSIDERED THE 'BEST OF THE BEST' IN THE US, SAYS TRIPADVISOR

""It was pretty cool growing up in the restaurant industry and especially being a part of Versailles,"" Valls told Fox News Digital in an on-camera interview, calling it ""the epicenter of the city of Miami."" (See the video at the top of this article.)

Versailles serves as a regular congregating spot for Miami's large Cuban American population, particularly during important events in their native country's history.

""It was like our funhouse,"" Valls said, reflecting on the childhood memories she shared with her siblings.

""We would come here, run around, go to the bakery, grab sweets. And then, later on in life, you realize what an important role the restaurant has within the Cuban American community and the city of Miami in general.""

FROM COOKING FOOD AT THE WHITE HOUSE TO CREATING FRESH MEALS FOR CLIENTS, GREEK CHEF HAS 'AMAZING' JOURNEY

One of the restaurant's most popular meals, Valls said, is the Cuban sandwich.

""It's a comfort food,"" she said.

Although there is debate as to the origin of the Cuban sandwich, Valls said it's the authentic, unchanged ingredients of her family's recipe that have stood the test of time.

WOMAN AT VIRGINIA RESTAURANT RECORDED SHOUTING RACIST REMARKS AT FAMILY SPEAKING SPANISH: 'GO BACK TO YOUR F---ING COUNTRY'

""It's family recipes,"" Valls said.

""It's recipes of people who worked in the kitchen when we first started that's just kind of been passed around through all these decades to what it is today.""

""It's just a great, hearty sandwich that I think is delicious.""

Asked why she believes the Cuban sandwich is so popular, Valls said it all comes back to the Cuban bread - Versailles makes its own - and a ""combination of the flavors.""

Said Valls, ""It's just a great, hearty sandwich that I think is delicious.""

"As a female athlete, I do not consent to playing alongside men in collegiate sports",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/female-athlete-do-not-consent-playing-alongside-men-collegiate-sports,2024-09-30T09:12:43Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Another female college athlete has joined the lawsuit against the NCAA, alleging Title IX violations for allowing biological men to compete in women's sports.

Brooke Slusser, the starting setter and co-captain of San Jose State University's NCAA Division One women's volleyball team, says in the lawsuit she was forced to compete and share a residence with fellow teammate Blaire Fleming. The kicker: Slusser never received advance notice that Fleming is a biological male.

Another unfortunate case of another woman in college sports who did not consent to living with and playing alongside a man.

SWISS COURT TAKES TRANS CHILD AWAY FROM PARENTS OVER THEIR OBJECTIONS TO PUBERTY BLOCKERS

Male athlete Blaire Fleming is leading SJSU's women's volleyball team to extraordinary success. As videos of his superior biological advantage over women surfaced online, NCAA President Charlie Baker sent a letter to the U.S. Senate implying there is nothing to see here. As a former NCAA volleyball player, this entire situation begs the question: Why is the NCAA recklessly disregarding women's concerns?

In August, 23 U.S. senators wrote a letter to Baker urging the NCAA to prohibit male participation in women's athletics. Several other elected officials, women's organizations, and NCAA female athletes, myself included, have demanded the same.

Much of this fiery enthusiasm was sparked by the Lia Thomas controversy, when the NCAA awarded a 6'4"" male athlete a women's National Championship trophy. They also allowed this male athlete into the women's locker rooms to strip himself in front of female athletes who were changing into their swim gear.

But the problem of men invading women's spaces didn't stop, nor did it start, with Lia Thomas. The reality is that the NCAA, with its extraordinary power over college athletics, has tipped the scales in favor of male athletes in women's sports.

Without any underlying research to justify it, the NCAA has compromised women's sports to the detriment of female athletes around the world. Despite an outcry of public opposition, the NCAA has continued to invite men into women's private spaces and competition.

The Fleming-led San Jose State University team is climbing to previously unreached success, recently beating a Big Ten volleyball team for the first time in two decades. As of September 23, the team is one of seven teams in D1 NCAA Volleyball, remaining 8-0 for the first time since 1990.

Fleming consistently leads the team in scoring and even racked a remarkable 25 kills in a singular match. Videos circulate Twitter/X of Fleming appearing to hit the ball in the face of one of his female opponents for a game-winning kill.

Fleming is not the only one. A similar instance of a trans-identifying man hitting a volleyball straight into Payton McNabb's face left her partially paralyzed with likely permanent head and neck damages.

Despite the clearly dangerous nature of their policies, Baker and the NCAA continue to flee from any responsibility. In their response to the Senate, Baker notes ""the NCAA policy seeks to align with other national governing bodies' policies"" and member schools must abide by their state's regulations.

However, most of these schools will travel outside of state protection to compete in NCAA competition. Baker also says he would ""welcome"" a national policy on the topic, looking to Congress for national sport regulation, rather than within his own National Collegiate Athletic Association.

Shockingly, he took it so far as to acknowledge ""schools may also choose to operate in a different way due to institutional values."" Not only is this statement something no one had heard before, it is also very misleading.

There are no records of the NCAA notifying their member schools if their women's teams will soon be competing against, or changing in the locker room with, a man. Few knew about Fleming's true sex until Reduxx uncovered it this past April, nearly four years after his NCAA debut.

Southern Utah appears to have taken Baker up on the offer almost immediately. The team opted out of their game against Fleming just days after Baker's letter became public.

Yes, San Francisco, Saint-Mary's, Fresno State, Boise State, Colorado State, Wyoming, San Diego State, UNLV, New Mexico, Air Force, Utah State, Nevada, and New Mexico can still choose to protect their female athletes by forfeiting the competition.

And if a school is committed to the safety and fairness of their female athletes, they should opt out if they are aware of male athletes on opposing teams. But universities should not hold their breath expecting the NCAA to offer the respect of prior notification of male participation.

Baker's scheme simply doesn't work, and he knows it. The reality is that a school would possibly forfeit earnings, records and even NCAA tournament appearances if they withdrew their female athletes from competing against a man. The entity is effectively forcing schools to knowingly place female athletes in harm's way.

Women's voices in college sports matter. We fought hard for - and deserve - the right to say no when we do not consent to playing alongside men. It's time to hold the NCAA responsible for this reckless disregard for women's safety and fair play in college sports."

CBS News is the latest network under the spotlight as it prepares to host the vice-presidential debate between Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

The debate on Tuesday, being led by outgoing ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Norah O'Donnell and ""Face the Nation"" moderator Margaret Brennan, will face intense scrutiny, particularly after the fury sparked by ABC News for its partisan handling of the first presidential debate between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

The network's past coverage suggests Vance, like Trump, may enter a one-against-three political showdown.

CBS' '60 MINUTES' ACCUSED OF EDITING EXCHANGE BETWEEN DESANTIS, REPORTER PUSHING 'PAY FOR PLAY' NARRATIVE

Perhaps the greatest example of CBS News' liberal bias was in 2020 when Trump famously sparred with ""60 Minutes"" veteran Lesley Stahl over the Hunter Biden laptop scandal just days before the election.

Trump insisted at the time that then-candidate Joe Biden was ""in the midst of a scandal.""

""He's not,"" Stahl gleefully replied.

""Of course he is, Lesley,"" Trump sternly doubled down.

""No, c'mon,"" Stahl continued to reject the president's claim, before lecturing him, ""This is '60 Minutes' and we can't put on things that we can't verify.""

CBS News eventually went on and verified the infamous laptop in 2022.

CBS TARRED AND FEATHERED FOR ADMITTING EXISTENCE OF HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP TWO YEARS AFTER NEW YORK POST REPORT

When Hunter Biden initially accepted the plea deal with his father's DOJ, Brennan suggested that Republicans ""move on"" from the growing controversy tainting the president, who at the time was seeking reelection.

""The deal has infuriated many congressional Republicans who were holding their own hearings. And I wonder after this plea happens if you would advise your party to move on?"" Brennan asked then-2024 presidential candidate Chris Christie.

Christie flatly responded ""No, I wouldn't.""

""The conduct here by the U.S. Attorney in Delaware and by the Justice Department, just can't be justified,"" Christie told Brennan. ""It does not take five years to investigate two misdemeanor tax counts and to dismiss a gun charge, and we need to know what they were investigating, and why these are the charges they concluded to. This is not just any person. This is the son of the President of the United States. When justice needs to be equal, it needs to be equal, and it doesn't appear to me that this is the way to do it.""

NORAH O'DONNELL EXITING 'CBS EVENING NEWS'

Brennan attempted to push back by pointing out that the prosecutor, U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware David Weiss. was a Trump appointee, but Christie insisted it ""doesn't matter,"" adding it was ""incompetent and inexplicable.""

That plea deal was ultimately tossed by the judge overseeing the case after it crumbled under scrutiny.

For the past several years, among the biggest stars at CBS News has been Gayle King, co-host of ""CBS Mornings.""

However, before joining the network, she donated a combined $9,000 to Harris' 2010 bid for California attorney general, according to Open Secrets.

King's past support for the VP hasn't stopped CBS News from not only allowing her to repeatedly interview Harris over the 2024 presidential campaign despite the apparent conflict of interest, but also singing Harris' praises.

""When I hear people say I will vote for Kamala Harris because she is a Black woman, she is so much more than that. She's so uniquely qualified to be president of this country,"" King said during CBS News' coverage of the DNC convention last month.

King did not disclose to viewers that she was a Harris donor.

In September 2023, CBS News was caught editing an unflattering exchange Harris had with Brennan during an interview.

In a preview clip that aired on ""CBS Mornings,"" Brennan was seen asking Harris about age being a factor in the upcoming election with her then-elderly running mate.

""You're 58 now. If you win the second term, as you and the president are running to do, he would be 86 at the end of it,"" Brennan said before the camera quickly cut to Harris' facial expression.

Brennan immediately continued, ""The Wall Street Journal had a poll showing two-thirds of Democrats say Joe Biden is too old to run again. Are you prepared to be commander in chief?""

""Yes I am, if necessary,"" Harris responded before defending Biden's fitness as president.

However, what aired on ""CBS Mornings"" was actually not how the conversation unfolded between Brennan and Harris, as the network acknowledged later in the day.

CBS ADMITS TO 'INCORRECTLY' KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW CLIP, OMITTING GOP ATTACKS ON HER

Initially left on the cutting room floor was Brennan grilling Harris about the criticism she received from GOP presidential candidates.

""You're 58 now. If you win the second term, as you and the president are running to do, he would be 86 at the end of it. And we are seeing Republican candidates hone in on you, in particular, as the next up for that job,"" Brennan told the vice president. ""Nikki Haley says 'a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for President Harris.' Chris Christie, 'I want to be clear that I pray every night for Joe Biden's good health, not only because he's our president, but because of who our vice president is.' Ron DeSantis, 'Harris is Biden's impeachment insurance. People know if she were president, batter the doors. As bad as Biden did, it would get worse.' How do you respond to all of that?""

While the incorrect version of their exchange was seen by the millions of ""CBS Morning"" viewers, the corrected version was featured on CBS' little-watched streaming network and on social media. The interview later aired in full on ""Face the Nation.""

""A previous version of this clip was edited incorrectly,"" CBS News acknowledged on both platforms.

Both Brennan and O'Donnell appeared to chastise Trump following July's assassination attempt, suggesting his own rhetoric led to the fatal shooting in Butler, PA.

""He is recovering from these injuries now, this was a traumatic event, no doubt, for him,"" Brennan said during CBS News' breaking news coverage after Trump released a statement on social media. ""But I did notice there was no call for lowering the temperature, condemning all political violence, and really trying to signal to his supporters as well not to retaliate or have any kind of escalation here.""

Brennan later clarified that the statement was ""not meant as a critique, but rather an observation.""

However, O'Donnell struck a similar tone during an interview with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy from the RNC Convention the following week, as the two of them discussed how ""hot"" political rhetoric has gotten in recent years.

""Does Donald Trump bear some responsibility for that? Does he need to change his rhetoric?"" O'Donnell asked.

""This is a man that came less than an inch from losing his life and the question is you're worried about him?"" an astonished McCarthy reacted.

Last month, Brennan ran cover for Harris after Trump began accusing his Democratic rival of being a ""communist.""

""And a new line of false attack on Vice President Harris,"" Brennan told viewers in her ""Face the Nation"" intro before playing a clip of Trump telling rallygoers ""Kamala went full communist.""

In what might be a preview of what to expect at Tuesday's debate, Brennan got testy with Vance during his late June appearance on ""Face the Nation."" He was yet to be tapped as Trump's running mate.

Vance took a swipe at the media for not fact-checking Biden following the June 27 presidential debate, something Brennan took immediate offense to.

""You know, I lost track, sir,"" Brennan interjected. ""I've been told the media is on every single side of this and everything's our fault, but let's get back to the candidate you're here to talk about.""

Fox News Digital reached out to CBS News for comment, but did not immediately hear back."
3 women from different backgrounds detail why they're voting for Harris,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/nx-s1-5123647/kamala-harris-georgia-women-vote-election-2024,2024-09-30T09:06:18Z,"Eustacia McCloud Carter, Latrice Cushenberry and Donna Smith Aranson sat down with NPR in mid September. Nydia Blas for NPR hide caption

The state of Georgia has never elected a female governor or U.S. senator. So, given that fact, we wanted to know: Are Georgians ready to make history and cast their 16 electoral votes for the first woman president?

In mid-September, NPR sat down with three women of different ages, races and religions who have seen politics in Georgia evolve through multiple election cycles. Each said they were voting for Kamala Harris this November, and detailed what her candidacy meant to them.

Read and listen to more of All Things Considered's recent trip to Georgia, including interviews with the secretary of state and Georgia GOP chairman.

For Latrice Cushenberry, Harris feels familiar.

""She is someone that I have seen repeatedly throughout my lifetime in my grandmother, my mother, my aunt -- [a] capable, competent African American person that basically can get the job done with empathy and compassion,"" she said.

So when Cushenberry saw Harris become the Democratic candidate for president, she says she saw someone ascending to a position that has always existed in her life: ""Of authority, of really making certain that everyone is cared for and making certain that everyone is represented.""

The fact Harris is a woman of color also resonated for Cushenberry and made her think of what she had experienced in her own life.

""I'm a person that works in a company where I'm the only person that looks the way I look,"" she said. ""I think it's important for her to be the most capable, to be the most competent. And her gender and her race is just a part of her, of who she is as a person. She shouldn't lead with that, I don't think, but it is critical for people to understand ... that people of color are capable.""

And Cushenberry believes Harris' ascension has helped redefine this narrative around people of color.

""Thank God, because it's quite exhausting, to be honest with you. It's exhausting to have to be in a constant state of proving because of the color of your skin.""

Eustacia McCloud Carter is a 20-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force and has lived in Georgia since 1998. She says it took her some time to come around to the idea of Harris at the top of the ticket.

""I was all-in for Joe Biden. I didn't care if we had to put him in a wheelchair, motorized, five oxygen tanks on his back,"" she said. ""And I was not liking the way that he was being coerced to leave. I just felt like he was a statesman and he deserved a little more respect than that.""

After Biden stepped aside, McLoud Carter said she took some time to grieve what had changed, but that once she came out of her ""mourning period"" she was all-in for Harris.

McCloud Carter believes much of the challenge in getting a woman in the White House has to do with the way that some men view women and their roles in society -- something she qualifies as a ""fallacy.""

""They see it that way, that we need to be barefoot, pregnant, in the kitchen,"" she said. ""I did a canvas of my team of 50 barber and beauty shops, and that is the one thing I heard when I went in there, especially in the African American barbershops, 'I'm voting for Trump.' And they like Donald Trump. He comes out with that machoism.""

McCloud Carter said she doesn't think all men believe this, but that there is a large part of the country that does.

""I was never raised that way. I have a father who always told me and my three sisters, 'You can be anything you want to be.'""

Donna Smith Aranson has lived in Atlanta her entire life and has volunteered for Hillary Clinton and both of Stacey Abrams' gubernatorial campaigns.

She feels the state is ready to elect the first female president.

""It's been an evolution. I think in our last election cycle ... we elected two senators who are unique in their positions, Reverend Warnock and Jon Ossoff,"" she said. ""And I'm proud to say that I voted for both of them and campaigned for both of them. Is it time for a woman? God, I hope so. I do hope so.""

""I think that women have always taken second place. I think the stand on abortion and all of the things that matter to women specifically are strong issues that [Harris] backs. And that's not to say that men don't either. But ... it feels more personal when it comes from a woman.""

Smith Aranson says she has seen a change over time, and that each election cycle she is watching stronger women step up. She is personally excited to see a woman running for the presidency, but adds that she's glad that Harris has not made her gender or race the central focus of her campaign.

""She has to appeal to all people, all genders, all religions,"" she said."
"COVID lockdowns led to spike in kids' vision problems, 1 in 3 now nearsighted, study finds",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/health/covid-lockdowns-spike-kids-vision-problems-nearsighted-study-finds,2024-09-30T08:38:15Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

As many as 30% of children and teens across the world were nearsighted in 2023, a new study has revealed.

Diagnoses of nearsightedness (myopia) are expected to worsen over the next two decades, according to the findings, which were published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology.

By 2050, nearly 740 million young individuals worldwide are expected to have the condition, lead study author Dr. Yajun Chen, a professor at Sun Yat-sen University in China, told Fox News Digital.

'PICKLEBALL SAVED MY SIGHT,' SAYS FLORIDA WOMAN, 79: 'I WAS REALLY WORRIED'

""The study also highlights significant disparities in myopia rates across different regions, suggesting that factors such as gender, ethnicity and culture play a crucial role,"" he said.

""Understanding these variations is crucial for tailoring prevention and intervention strategies to specific at-risk populations.""

In the study, researchers analyzed 276 studies that included more than 5.4 million participants from 50 countries across all six continents.

Rates of nearsightedness were highest in East Asia (35.22%), in urban areas (28.55%), among females (33.57%), among adolescents (47%) and among high school students (45.71%), the study found.

ASK A DOCTOR: 'IS IT SAFE TO SWIM UNDERWATER WITH MY EYES OPEN?'

Myopia can progress rapidly during critical growth periods, particularly in children and adolescents, Chen noted.

There was a significant spike in myopia after the COVID-19 pandemic, research has shown.

""During the pandemic, many countries implemented nationwide lockdowns to curb the spread of the virus,"" he said.

""Prolonged indoor living reduced outdoor activity for children and adolescents while increasing screen time, potentially exacerbating the ocular burden on this population and worsening the myopia crisis.""

Dr. Marc Siegel, senior medical analyst for Fox News and clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center, was not involved in the study but commented on the findings.

""Diet may play a role, but I think the greatest reason for the increase, especially coming out of the pandemic, is due to lockdowns and being indoors more,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""Untreated myopia can lead to more severe vision problems later in life.""

With increased screen time, kids and teens have fewer opportunities for the eye muscles to have to adapt, Siegel said.

""For example, going back and forth from looking close to looking far, and accommodating to light by going from indoors to outdoors, and talking to people in person -- all of those exercise the small eye muscles that keep you from getting nearsighted,"" he added.

Dr. Jesse Willingham, an optometrist at Brighter Outlook Vision in North Charleston, South Carolina, warned that unaddressed vision problems can have several significant consequences for children, including academic problems, social and emotional struggles, behavioral issues and long-term eye health issues.

""We all understand that being able to see clearly is important for school, but there are many different visual skills we need for learning,"" Willingham, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.

""Nearsightedness is the most common developmental vision problem, but early vision problems can start with tracking difficulties, poor ability to adapt the focus of the eyes or use the two eyes as a team, or other functional problems that arise from too much stress on the visual system at an early age,"" he added.

The study did have some limitations, Chen acknowledged.

""The major limitation of the included studies is the disparity in the designs and methods utilized,"" he said.

""The quality of included epidemiologic studies varied significantly within and among the reviews, ranging from high to low risk of bias.""

There is also a possibility of ""uneven distribution of data"" among countries within any given continent, Chen said.

""As a result, our reported findings might be biased because they were mainly influenced by data from a limited number of countries.""

Studies included in the analysis also varied in terms of criteria and procedures for assessing nearsightedness, Chen noted.

Creating a supportive environment at home and in schools can encourage children to adopt healthy habits that protect their vision, the researchers said.

Experts offered the following interventions to help reduce the prevalence of myopia among youth.

Families should prioritize outdoor playtime, Chen recommended.

""Schools can organize outdoor activities and encourage sports, creating a culture that values physical engagement and natural light exposure,"" he said.

For very young children who haven't started school yet, Willingham recommends only allowing screen time when video-chatting with friends and family.

""For school-aged children, matching screen time one-to-one with outdoor time and limiting screen sessions to no more than 20 minutes at a time are good rules of thumb,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""Also make sure screen time is done ergonomically, with screens held at least 12 inches away and done while maintaining good posture.""

Parents should ensure that their children receive regular eye examinations starting at a young age, Chen recommended.

""Early detection and intervention is crucial, as untreated myopia can lead to more severe vision problems later in life,"" he said.

""It's also beneficial to stay informed about new treatments and technologies aimed at slowing myopia progression, such as specialized contact lenses and eye drops.""

It's important to choose an eye care provider who understands visual development, according to Willingham.

""Developmental optometrists have more training and experience in this area, and are typically affiliated with OVDRA, the Optometric Vision Development and Rehabilitation Association,"" he said.

""If your child is at high risk of developing nearsightedness or is already nearsighted, consider finding a myopia management specialist through organizations like TreeHouse Eyes.""

Engaging with community programs aimed at preventing myopia, such as vision screening events or educational outreach, can help reduce the prevalence, according to Chen.

Integrating vision education into school curricula and supporting public health campaigns focused on myopia prevention can also be effective, he added.

""By taking these proactive steps, everyone can contribute to reducing the prevalence of myopia and promoting healthier vision for children and adolescents,"" Chen said."
Tennessee mom skeptical of daughter's 'suicide' vindicated by husband's confession,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/tennessee-mom-skeptical-daughters-suicide-vindicated-husbands-confession,2024-09-30T08:17:24Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A mother's fight for answers about the death of her daughter paid off as her resilience led to a confession from her daughter's husband about her murder that was initially ruled a suicide.

""There were things that led me to believe... I just knew it wasn't suicide, it was like she just had plans for a future. People, you know, don't usually say, 'I'll meet you at church the next morning.' I was putting all these pieces together, and I'm like, It's just none of it made sense,"" Jamie Dickerson, mother to 29-year-old April Holt, told Fox News Digital.

April Holt was a young mother of two and the wife of 33-year-old Donovan Holt. The Metro Nashville Police Department (MNPD) said April was found almost lifeless at their apartment in Antioch with a plastic bag taped tightly around her neck in July 2023.

Dickerson said she hosted a lockout with kids from her church on July 28, 2023, and her daughter was supposed to come over and help chaperone, but had to cancel and take her son to his football game.

MASSACHUSETTS MAN ARRESTED IN 36-YEAR-OLD COLD CASE AFTER SPIT ON SIDEWALK LINKS HIM TO MURDER OF WOMAN

""So I did the lockout and got up. The next morning, I cleaned, I jumped in the shower and I just laid down, and I saw that she had texted me, and it just said, 'How did the lockup go? I can't make it to the Barbie movie today because Donovan had to work' and so she was just telling me that she would meet me at church the next day. And so I laid down, and I didn't reply to her,"" Dickerson said. ""It was the last text I ever got from her.""

Dickerson said she went back to sleep and an hour later, Donovan Holt called and said he found April unresponsive in the shower and that he was on his way to the hospital with her as she was not breathing.

""So I jumped in my car, but even right when I got the first phone call, I was like, 'Something's not right. April's in perfectly good health.' An hour and a half ago or so, she texted me perfectly fine. So something's not right. Like I thought maybe she had passed out. Maybe she hit her head because she passed out. I didn't know. I mean, like, why would she just not be breathing? I didn't know anything about it,"" Dickerson said.

Upon arrival at the hospital, Dickerson said she looked into her daughter's eyes and knew she was not there anymore, she knew she was gone.

Dickerson said she immediately noticed that April's husband, Donovan Holt, was acting strangely.

""From that second on, when I got into the room at the hospital, he was just like rocking, like pacing. And I'm curled up in a ball on a bench next to him, just hysterically crying and just calling out to God to save my child. Even though I knew in my gut that she was gone,"" Dickerson said.

""So he's sitting there and he's holding his head, and he just acts real weird, and he's like, 'Her throat was hurting this morning. She wasn't acting like herself.' He was doing the weirdest things. And I was like, 'Why are you even saying this right now?' And then he hands me her phone and was like, 'Well, you can make all medical decisions for her and here's her phone,'"" Dickerson continued.

Dickerson said she did not find out until later that April had a bag over her head. She said Donovan claimed to tell the doctors, who said they were not aware.

The Metro Nashville Police Department (MNPD) told Fox News Digital that April's case was an unclassified death that had been under investigation for months.

Police said no evidence was developed to counter Donovan Holt's explanation given during interviews in that time period, and the police department was in consultation with the Medical Examiner's Office and the District Attorney's Office, who initially ruled her death as a suicide.

Dickerson said even though the death of her daughter was first ruled a suicide, she found a 47-page cold case supplement report with evidence proving her daughter did not kill herself, and she was determined to get her son-in-law to confess that he killed her.

The key piece of evidence in the police investigation report was that only Donovan Holt's fingerprints were found on the bag and tape, not April's, Dickerson said.

""That is when I confronted him (Donovan) and he confessed to me and so that is when I went to the police,"" said Dickerson. ""I wasn't shocked. And I know that sounds very strange, especially when he gave me the confession, because I had already known for years. I've been processing these emotions. The harder part is, I didn't allow myself to really grieve or heal yet. So I'm just now entering that season of that,"" Dickerson said.

Detectives reopened the case once Dickerson reported Donovan Holt's confession.

""A fresh set of eyes even went over the investigative file. After the victim's mother reported a conversation she had with Mr. Holt, the death investigation was immediately reopened, and MNPD detectives traveled to Texas to reinterview him, during which he implicated himself in April Holt's death,"" police told Fox News Digital in a statement.

Donovan Holt was arrested in San Antonio, Texas, and returned to Nashville on Friday afternoon. He was charged with reckless homicide, false reporting and tampering with evidence after an indictment by the grand jury.

When asked if she ever thought her son-in-law could do this, Dickerson said she was not surprised at all.

""He had an obsession with April. So the weird part is, is like you see these movies, and they love somebody so much that they're willing to do literally anything. I think that was him because she'd left him before, and he would sleep outside of her apartment. He would sleep in her car if it was unlocked,"" Dickerson recalled.

""And it's heartbreaking. It's absolutely heartbreaking. And so I'm just, I'm not shocked. I think that when she said that this time she was very serious. She said, I'm getting a divorce and two weeks later she was dead,"" Dickerson continued.

Dickerson added that she has so much relief knowing that Donovan is behind bars and that her grandson is safe with her after the trauma he was put through that day.

""The person you were supposed to love, you killed, and then you put a trash bag over her head and ate lunch? Like she wasn't in the other room dead? And then you sent your son in there to be traumatized for the rest of his life. It's just bizarre,"" Dickerson said.

Despite being angry at Donovan for taking April away from her, Dickerson said she does not want harm to him and hopes he finds peace because April would not want her harboring hate.

""As a Christian woman, I pray that his heart gets right. That's what I would want for him. I know it's what April would want. And even after killing my daughter, that is what I'd want for him. And I would want anybody to be able to have everlasting life,"" Dickerson said."
Trump assassination attempt: Secret Service to face new lawsuit over DEI quota,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/trump-assassination-attempt-secret-service-face-new-lawsuit-over-dei-quota,2024-09-30T08:06:55Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A nonprofit defending women's issues plans to sue the U.S. Secret Service for what it alleges is an ""arbitrary"" diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) initiative that harms female employees.

The proposed lawsuit comes more than two months after some pointed fingers at female USSS agents assigned to former President Trump's detail at his July 13 presidential campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a 20-year-old shooter gained access to a nearby rooftop and shot at Trump with an automatic rifle.

""In our country, it is illegal for the government to discriminate on the basis of sex. That is the Constitution's 14th Amendment,"" May Mailman, director of the Independent Women's Forum, told Fox News Digital. ""But also Title VII prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of sex. And yet you have the Secret Service, of all agencies, saying that they want to have a 30% female quota.""

A Secret Service spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the agency does not comment on pending litigation matters.

SECRET SERVICE RIPPED FOR PLAN TO SEND AGENTS TO DISNEY WORLD LGBTQ SUMMIT AMID FAILURES PROTECTING TRUMP

Mailman added that there is a ""30x30"" pledge that various law enforcement agencies have taken with a goal to reach a 30% female workforce.

""And we know that Kim Cheatle took this very seriously. We know that she made hiring decisions based on this,"" Mailman said.

TRUMP ASSASSAINTION ATTEMPT SPARKS INVESTIGATION OF SECRET SERVICE DEI POLICIES: 'COMPROMISED ITS MISSION'

In 2022, President Biden appointed former USSS Director Kimberly Cheatle, who resigned after the July assassination attempt, making her only the second woman to lead the agency.

Cheatle previously served as senior director of global security at PepsiCo, where she was responsible for directing and implementing security protocols for the company's facilities in North America.

Critics have accused Cheatle of prioritizing ideologies rooted in DEI instead of only focusing on hiring the best for the agency. While at the Secret Service, Cheatle has stressed the importance of increasing diversity in the Secret Service. The ""30%"" female quota stems from a 2023 CBS report stating that the agency was looking to increase women recruits to make up 30% of the USSS workforce.

""I'm very conscious as I sit in this chair now, of making sure that we need to attract diverse candidates and ensure that we are developing and giving opportunities to everybody in our workforce, and particularly women,"" Cheatle told the outlet.

WATCH:

Women currently make up 24% of the USSS workforce, according to the agency's website.

The Diplomatic Security Service -- which is the protective arm of the State Department, whereas the Secret Service is overseen by the Department of Homeland Security -- has a similar pledge ""to increase the representation of women in its recruit classes to 30 percent by 2030,"" as an April press release states.

SECRET SERVICE STRUGGLE TO PROTECT PRESIDENTS WON'T SEE 'IMMEDIATE' END EVEN WITH MORE MANPOWER: RETIRED AGENT

Mailman pointed to three reasons IWF takes issue with the 30% pledge: first, ""it's illegal, and you shouldn't discriminate on the basis of sex,"" she said. Second, ""it's particularly dangerous in the Secret Service"" to hire on the basis of sex or other identifying factors rather than solely on expertise and qualifications for the job. Third, ""it's particularly harmful to women,"" Mailman said.

""[W]hen the pictures of that day came out, it was immediately like these women are all cops, and they can't find their holster.""

-- May Mailman

""I am sure it is not easy to be a woman in any male-dominated field, including the Secret Service. But as we all remember, when the pictures of that day came out, it was immediately like these women are all cops, and they can't find their holster,"" Mailman explained. ""All of the blame seems to be on women, including Kim Cheatle, all the way down. That's what happens when you have quota systems . . . you turn women into tokens. That makes it really hard for women who are trying to be respected and earn their way into male-dominated fields.""

Agents received criticism for their handling of the assassination attempt on X from conservative voices including Matt Walsh, Dinesh D'Souza and even Elon Musk.

""It is an insult to the women of our agency to imply that they are unqualified based on gender.""

-- Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi

""As an elite law enforcement agency, all of our agents and officers are highly trained and fully capable of performing our missions. It is an insult to the women of our agency to imply that they are unqualified based on gender. Such baseless assertions undermine the professionalism, dedication and expertise of our workforce,"" Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement to Politico following the criticism. ""We stand united against any attempt to discredit our personnel and their invaluable contributions to our mission and are appalled by the disparaging and disgusting comments against any of our personnel.""

President Trump has defended the female agents who shielded him on July 13.

""Every one of them - there wasn't one that was slow. A woman who was on my right, she was shielding me,"" he said at a rally at St. Cloud, Minnesota, two weeks after the assassination attempt. ""Beautiful person - she was shielding me, everything she could. And she got crushed. And she got criticized by the fake news because she wasn't tall enough.""

IWF is joining Mountain States Legal Foundation's investigation into what they describe at the Secret Service's reliance on DEI policies for hiring, retention and promotion.

LOCAL OFFICER'S BULLET STOPPED TRUMP SHOOTER'S GUNFIRE BEFORE SECRET SERVICE SHOT, WITNESS TESTIFIES

""Protecting candidates for President of the United States is imperative to the functioning of our Republic, and the catastrophic results of an assassination simply can't be understated. Yet it appears that the Secret Service is prioritizing its DEI agenda over the need to hire the best person for the job, regardless of sex. If it takes a lawsuit to change that, so be it,"" Will Trachman, general counsel of Mountain States Legal Foundation, said in a statement.

IWF and Mountain States Legal also believe the 30% quota is ""arbitrary."" ""Why not 31%? Why not 29%?"" Mailman asked.

""We want for women to be seen and treated as the hardcore, bada-- women that they might be,"" she said. ""We just don't know because the whole thing has been tainted by quota system.""

Four stabbings were reported in Long Beach, California, over the weekend in a nine-hour period, according to police.

Long Beach Police said the department has bolstered its presence in the aftermath of the stabbings that happened Saturday night and early Sunday morning, according to City News Service.

""The LBPD will have additional police presence today, including patrol officers and Neighborhood Safety Bike Team officers, to engage with residents and businesses,"" the Long Beach Police Department said in a statement to Fox 11 on Sunday.

The first stabbing happened at about 6:20 p.m. Saturday in the 2000 block of East Pacific Coast Highway, where police said an argument led to a fight in which a man was stabbed several times in his upper body. The suspects fled the scene before police arrived at the scene.

The victim was hospitalized and was listed in stable condition.

The next stabbing was reported at about 2 a.m. Sunday morning, when officers responded to the 5100 block of Second Street in Belmont Shore after two men were involved in a physical altercation that escalated. The suspect stabbed the victim in the upper body, and the victim was rushed to a hospital in critical condition. Police said the suspect fled the scene before officers arrived.

Another attack occurred at about 2:20 a.m., after which officers responded to a local hospital regarding two victims who had been admitted to the facility for stab wounds.

The preliminary investigation revealed that two women were in a physical altercation in the 200 block of Pine Avenue downtown with another woman who allegedly stabbed each victim in the upper body. The two victims were listed in stable condition.

Officers probed the area but were unable to find a crime scene.

Police said the fourth stabbing was reported at around 3 a.m. in the 5100 block of Second Street. While this was the same location as the second stabbing, police said the two attacks do not appear to be connected.

The victim was outside in a dispute with a group of women that escalated when one female suspect punched the victim before a second female suspect stabbed the victim in the upper body, police said. The victim transported herself to a hospital in stable condition.

Anyone with information regarding any of the stabbings is urged to contact the police department."
September Song: Rosés That Sing Into Fall,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lanabortolot/2024/09/29/september-song-ross-that-sing-into-fall/,2024-09-30T00:39:48Z,"September may signal the turn of the seasons, but not a turn of heart (at least, not mine!) when it comes to drinking rosé. As readers of this column know, I have been a steadfast supporter of drinking the pink-hued wines well beyond the summer months and beyond the traditional borders. The fall months, in particular, offer opportunities to try different styles that go deeper in fruit and structure and pair well with dishes that either transition from summer to fall or straddle both seasons. California rosés, many made from Pinot Noir grapes, do that particularly well, as they carry over a darker fruit and earthy profile. Here are a few to try.

Bouchaine, Vin Gris of Pinot Noir 2023, Carneros, Napa Valley. This comes in a tall, slender bottle as part of the winery's estate selection series. Salmon pink, this is a tropical-fruit-inflected rosé carried by melon, silky guava and juicy watermelon. The finish is a little earthy, reminding you of its Pinot roots. Vin Gris, meaning ""gray wine"" is a variant of the rosé style and uses a very short maceration to keep the color light. Good match with spicy Asian foods.

Calera Vin Gris of Pinot Noir 2022, Central Coast. An offspring of the Duckhorn portfolio this is a cranberry-colored wine with zesty, but not off-putting acidity. Young red fruits, well made and balanced -- very serviceable for a number of occasions and dishes.

Cuvaison Rosé of Pinot Noir 2023, Carneros Napa Valley. Sweet baby strawberries lend a perception of sweetness, but from natural fruit sugars. Very aromatic, dry and soft style of wine. Red currants and a citric twist give this a tangy lift. Nice match with burrata, sopped up with crunchy bread.

Decoy Rosé 2023, California. This non-appellation wine has southern French roots with its blend of 62% Syrah, 15% Carignan, 12% Vermentino and 11% Grenache. It's tropical toned, with sweet tangerine and honeydew and heady white florals sharing the stage with small red fruits like wild strawberries and currants.

Domaine Carneros ""Avant Garde"" Rosé of Pinot Noir 2023, Carneros, Napa Valley. Here's another first from a winery known as a cool-climate sparkling pioneer -- a rosé made entirely from the winery's new micro-grid-powered sustainable facility, launched this year. This is a lip-smacking sip marked by deeper southern-clime citrus fruits such and blood orange or Spanish clementines. Dry, structured almost like a light red, it's a good partner to smoked shrimp on couscous with almonds and dried cranberries. Not to be too specific, but that's how I enjoyed it on a rainy September evening.

Eleven Eleven Rosé of Syrah 2023 Bennett Valley, Sonoma. An earthy, dusty nose leads into the strawberry and tart raspberry fruit tones. Linear, nicely structured with a deeper fruit profile with just a touch of iodine that keeps it interesting. This is a fun, convivial lifestyle wine from an urban winery near downtown Napa.

Frank Family Vineyards ""Leslie"" Rosé of Pinot Noir 2023, Carneros, Napa Valley. Ever been to a farmer's market in late summer and the farmer says ""this is the last week for [fill in fruit]""? That's what this wine tastes like: the last gasps of juicy summer fruit -- here, it's peaches and plush raspberries with a ripple of tangerine. There's some heft to this wine, so you'll want to pair this with transitional dishes such as roasted or grilled poultry or sausage, a roasted root vegetable salad with crunchy kale.

Inman Family ""Endless Crush"" Rosé of Pinot Noir, OGV Estate 2023, Russian River Valley. This is the 20th anniversary for this rosé from a woman-owned and operated estate. It is so named for the occasion of the winemaker's 20th wedding anniversary: this was created as a gift to celebrate her ""endless crush"" on her husband (also, file under ""romantic wines to give on Valentine's Day). This one is dry, driven by raspberries and strawberries with more concentration than a simple quaff and enough structure to stand up to something like Chicken Tandoori, Keema (Lamb) or other Indian mainstays.

Lang & Reed Rosé 2023 Napa. This Cabernet Franc specialist presents its first foray into rosé in 20 years. This one is from grapes cultivated in the Sugarloaf Mountain Vineyard, a cool southwestern corner of the valley that's been the mainstay of Cab Franc plantings for 17 years. The color of wild-caught salmon, this is a robust interpretation of a CF rosé, a with strawberry preserve profile playing alongside savory herbs. There's also a rhubarb vibe going on here (bring on the pie!). At 14.2% abv, you'll want to have something substantial with this -- a good match with garlic-roasted shrimp and pasta or a goat cheese and tomato tart.

Materra, Cunat Family Vineyards, Yoshino 2023, Napa Valley. From a relatively new winery established in the Oak Knoll District in 2014, this medium-hued rosé comes in a pretty bottle with a Japanese-inspired label reflecting the heritage of the winemaker. Named for Japan's Yoshino Mountain, famed for its cherry blossoms, this is fresh, delicate -- a whisper of a wine, considering the power of Malbec, its lead grape (with 6% Grenache). At 13.%, the alcohol is deceptively higher than what the wine conveys. This is a nice start to a wine still to find its audience.

Saracina 2023, Mendocino County. Made from Grenache grapes, this is made from 25-year-old vines from the Teak vineyard, an old-vine block adjacent to the Russian River. Mid-summer strawberries sing in this wine, accompanied by a splash of pink grapefruit. Very fresh, zesty acidity, easy to wash down with soft cheeses, charcuterie or a burrata with roasted beets.

Simon Family Estate Tigress Rosé of Grenache 2023, Napa Valley. Pink grapefruit and cranberry jump out of the glass of this tart, fresh and simple sip. A bit of an earthy, stalky note on the finish. Easy to pair with appetizers or drink on its own.

Sonoma-Cutrer Rosé of Pinot Noir 2023, Russian River Valley. A well-made, inclusive and democratic rosé, this should run for political office (everyone likes!) and be served at large gatherings where you're not quite sure of your guest's tastes (everyone will like!). This shows small citrus fruits -- tangerine or Clementine -- cranberry and raspberry, watermelon and a touch or lychee gives it a slightly exotic touch."
"DAVID MARCUS: Selfish Kamala Harris pours gasoline on Pittsburgh sandwich shop's Vance gaffe, because it's all",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-selfish-kamala-harris-pours-gasoline-pittsburgh-sandwich-shops-vance-gaffe-because-its-all,2024-09-29T22:41:40Z,"Vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance was seen talking to an employee at Primanti Bros. in North Versailles, Pa., on Saturday.

Vice President Kamala Harris is fond of saying that Donald Trump is only in it for himself, not the American people. Well, this weekend we saw, in a picture-perfect example of psychological projection, Harris throwing a small business under the bus for her own supposed political gain.

On Saturday, GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance tried to drop in on Pittsburgh's famed Primanti Bros. sandwich shop, only to be barred entry. This came much to the disappointment of waiting voters, some of whom angrily recorded the events on their phones.

VANCE NOT ALLOWED TO CAMPAIGN IN PITTSBURGH CULINARY LANDMARK - DESPITE HARRIS EVENT AT SAME RESTAURANT CHAIN

Ire was raised on the right, threats of boycotts abounded, and Vance had cause to be a little miffed.

But Trump's running mate graciously forgave the snub, while greeting fans in the parking lot, paying for the crowd's meals with a generous tip. The store released a statement saying he was welcome and that their employee had just been surprised by the cameras.

As the Bard once pointed out, all's well that ends well, until Kamala Harris gets involved, and it's very telling.

On Sunday, Harris' campaign posted a video on X showing Harris being welcomed as a hero in Primanti Bros. back in August. The message was as clear as it was ugly - unlike Republicans, Democrats are welcome in polite society.

Let's set to one side the fact that Harris' appearance at the Steel City staple this summer was met by widespread mockery when it was discovered her campaign had kicked out actual diners and bused in supporters to set the fraudulent scene. That's bad enough.

But what Harris has wrought here isn't just the disingenuous papering of the house at a political event. She is doing real harm to Primanti Bros.' effort to walk this situation back and make clear that everyone, of every political stripe, is welcome there.

That was the point Vance was trying to make when he spoke after being denied entry, saying of the manager, ""Don't hold it against her, she just got a little nervous, but it's a great local business.""

That is the classy way to handle such a thing. It is what generations of Americans have expected from our leaders.

Primanti Bros. confirmed that was what happened and that really should have been the end of it. But no, not for Kamala Harris, the 'me' girl, around whom all things must revolve.

It didn't matter to Harris that the matter had been settled, that calls to boycott the restaurant were dying down, or that people were ready to move on to more serious matters.

No, the vice president of the United States had to spike the football on X over her astroturf event at the greasy spoon, even if it meant hurting the business. You see, Harris winning is more important than any individual small business.

And it was done in such an obnoxious way. Does Harris really want all of our businesses segregated by the politics of the customers? How ghastly.

It brought me back to a conversation I had with a woman in San Francisco recently. She was a lifelong resident who had followed Harris' rise.

""She doesn't seem to believe in much, and the word is she isn't very nice,"" she told me.

This echoes similar voices in Pennsylvania who told me they ""just don't know who she is,"" or, commonly, ""I think she'll say anything to get elected.""

Harris keeps insisting that she is the candidate who is selflessly in the race for the sake of the American people, while Trump only cares about Trump, but when has Harris ever done anything selflessly, or not on the public dime?

When in her career has she taken a back seat for the good of the people?

She certainly isn't doing so by extending the controversy and misery surrounding Primanti Bros., which wants nothing more than for this whole story to go away.

The brutal fact is that the only moral compass Harris and her campaign have is set squarely on a north star of victory, not helping actual people, even if they think they might get around to that part eventually.

In the meantime, much like the bused-in participants at her event at Primanti Bros., we are all just extras in Kamala's Excellent Adventure."
Some 'Giant' Snakes Do Eat Humans -- Here Is The How And The Why,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/scotttravers/2024/09/29/some-giant-snakes-do-eat-humans-here-is-the-how-and-the-why/,2024-09-29T20:26:59Z,"The risk of a snake targeting a human (as food) is almost non-existent. Even the largest snakes, like pythons and anacondas, primarily feed on rodents, birds and other small to medium-sized mammals. However, in certain scenarios, they do prey on people -- behavior that occurs when the snake mistakes a person for its usual prey or finds itself in unusual circumstances where food is scarce.

Here are two snake species with confirmed cases of man-eating behavior. While these instances are rare and often result from human encroachment on natural habitats, they serve as a sobering reminder of how fearsome these predators can be.

One of the most infamous and well-documented cases of a man-eating snake occurred in Indonesia in June 2024, when a woman was found inside a reticulated python measuring 16 feet long. The victim, a mother of four, had been reported missing, and her body was recovered after cutting the snake open.

It was the fifth such incident of a python devouring a human in the country since 2017, with this most recent occurrence unfolding in Kalempang village in the South Sulawesi province. In 2023, residents in South Sulwesi's Tinanggea district had to kill an eight-meter (26 feet) python that was found strangling and eating one of the farmers in the village.

The reticulated python is the world's longest snake, with individuals recorded reaching over 30 feet in length. Native to Southeast Asia, they thrive in tropical forests, grasslands and mangrove swamps, often close to or in direct contact with human settlements.

Known for their beautifully patterned scales and incredible constriction power, they primarily hunt birds, small mammals and other reptiles. However, horrific cases like the ones detailed above do occur and speak to the risk posed by this enormous species in regions where our interactions with them are becoming increasingly unavoidable.

Research into the feeding behavior of reticulated pythons has revealed that they can consume meals weighing up to half of their body weight. A June 2005 article in The Raffles Bulletin of Zoology documented cases of these pythons attacking and eating Malayan sun bears, underscoring their capacity to prey on large animals.

Their flexible jaws and ability to stretch their stomachs and intestines allow them to swallow large animals, and occasionally, humans.

In 2002, headlines were made when a 10-year-old boy in Durban, South Africa was killed and swallowed by an African rock python. It was the first recorded ""man-eating"" incident for this species.

Other children who were with the victim witnessed the horrifying scene unfold from mango trees where they were hiding, as the snake trapped the boy, squeezed the life out of him and swallowed him whole.

Herpetologists suspect that the python had just woken up from its winter hibernation and was searching for prey when the victim, unfortunately, wandered into its path.

Another grim incident took place in Campbellton, New Brunswick, Canada, in 2013 when two young boys aged 4 and 6 were killed by an African rock python while they were sleeping in an apartment above their father's pet store.

The African rock python, native to sub-Saharan Africa, can grow over 20 feet in length, according to a 2009 U.S. Geological Survey report. Its top and bottom jaws are attached with stretchy ligaments, which allows it to swallow animals wider than itself. In the wild, it has been documented preying on animals as large as antelope and crocodiles.

Much like their Southeast Asian relatives, they kill via constriction, suffocating the animal before ingesting it. It is assumed that these pythons, like other large constrictors, do not differentiate between prey types once a target has been subdued, leading to such rare attacks on humans.

While tales of man-eating snakes are often exaggerated in popular media, there have been verified reports of constrictors like the reticulated python and African rock python preying on humans.

These rare events occur due to a combination of human encroachment, habitat loss and the opportunistic feeding behavior of these powerful snakes. In almost all cases, these serpents do not actively seek out humans but come into conflict with them because of proximity and circumstance."
16 Sakes To Try For Sake Day According To Experts,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jilliandara/2024/09/29/16-sakes-to-try-for-sake-day-according-to-experts/,2024-09-29T20:09:52Z,"Three sake experts share their favorite bottles to try and what makes them so special.

World Sake Day is October 1. As a relatively new holiday to commemorate Japan's national beverage of fermented rice wine, World Sake Day is perhaps one with as much history as the drink itself.

According to the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association (JSS), the first record of sake in Japan dates back to the 3rd Century AD. It wasn't until the early 2000s, however, that exports increased and created a global demand for the fermented rice wine; between 2011 and 2022, total sake exports grew from 14 million liters to 35.9 million liters.

Much of sake's growth in the 21st century was a result of the wine's evolution in the mid-20th century, including enforcement surrounding sake quality labeling standards as well as experimentation with new styles like ginjo-shu and unpasteurized sake.

Amidst sake's mid-century evolution came the official designation of World Sake Day in 1978 as the JSS marked October 1st -- traditionally the start of a new sake brewing season as this is when the rice is harvested before it's sun dried, milled and brewed through the winter -- as Sake Day.

""World Sake Day always lands on my favorite time of year from drinking sake, where the temperature fluctuates from infinite summer to sweater weather and we have a sake for that,"" shares Alyssa DiPasquale, founder and owner of The Koji Club in Boston.

With over 1,200 sake breweries in Japan alone (not to mention American-made sake like Brooklyn Kura and the just-launched Oishii Sake), selecting a sake to celebrate its namesake day may feel overwhelming. Don't let this be the case: below, three sake experts share their favorite bottles to try and what makes them so special.

""The woman who brews this sake is one of the most intensely joyful people I have ever met; Kuniko San's laugh is as unique as her red rice sake and you can hear it echo throughout the town of Ine,"" says DiPasquale about ""one of the most unique breweries"" she's ever visited on the Northern coast of Kyoto prefecture where the mountains meet the bright, blue sea. ""The red rice used in the sake is called Murasaki and is grown about 15 minutes north of Ine and gives the sake a ruby red color and cranberry notes on the palate. The flavor profile reminds me of fall feasts. The sake smells like olives and tastes like cranberries. It's bold, acidic and unlike any sake.""

""This unique sake is one that I am really excited about,"" shares sake sommelier Jessica Joly, marketing director of Sake Discoveries. Produced in Saga, Japan, Amabuki Sakura Fubuki is made from cherry and strawberry blossom flower yeast and black table rice which gives it a soft pink hue. ""It also is a very light nigori ""sasa-nigori"" which gives it a bit of texture,"" explains Joly. ""Sometimes nigori can be a bit sweet but this one is really refreshing with beautiful notes of red cherry and candied citrus peel. This sake is great chilled but you can also enjoy it lightly warm with a beautiful fall dish with some truffle and wagyu.""

Kiki Austin, sake sommelier of Mujō in Atlanta also appreciates Amabuki sake for their exclusive use of flower yeasts in their brews. This particular rosé Junmai is made with pink Nakeshido bloom flower, and was one of the first premium sakes that Austin remembers igniting her passion for the beverage. ""It's brewed with an ancient black-purple heirloom rice that provides color and has everything you need: aromas of hibiscus, pomegranates, and juniper with a smooth texture and bright acidity on the finish.""

Another Amabuki to add to your must-try list comes from DiPasquale. ""This one, developed with sunflower yeast, spotlights the nutty, salty, bitter flavor we've come to love in the seedy snack itself.""

""This is a go to pick for guests who'd like to enjoy a bottle throughout the whole dining experience,"" shares Austin. Hailing from the Hiroshima Prefecture, Nakao Shuzo has been in production since 1871. ""The Junmai Daiginjo is brewed with apple yeast which adds distinctive characteristics reminiscent of mainly green apple,"" says Austin. ""Sometimes Junmai Daiginjo can carry the reputation of having a quick, wispy finish, but here it's long, and intense. The flavors are crisp and mineral driven.""

Brewed on the coast of Lake Biwa, a vacation destination for the Japanese, since 1862, this sake is crafted from an ancient rice grain called Watari Bune that's revered for its remarkable final product, shares DiPasquale. ""The seventh generation brewer creates a creamy and acidic sake with a big body and plenty of layers to discover with shifts in time and temperature,"" she adds.

""Everybody loves a great sake cup and for the winter months the cute polar bear design is a win,"" says Joly about this favorite Junmai from Fukushima, Japan. ""This sake is a nice and easy crisp, clean and dry sake that goes well with all kinds of food. Take this on your next road trip or use it as a stocking stuffer for the holidays; it doesn't break the bank either.""

Nothing denotes cooler weather than the smell of wood-burning fires and that's exactly what you'll taste in this distinct sake from Miyoshino Jozo, located in the heart of Nara under Mount Yoshino. The slopes here are renowned for its thousands of cherry blossom trees, explains DiPasquale, but within them there is a small golden ring of cedar trees which are the only wood used to cooper barrels for cedar aging sake. ""This special ring of wood gives this sake its unique flavor notes and distinct peppery, woodsy character.""

""Aged for two years at negative 50 degrees Fahrenheit, this rich daiginjo from Fukui sees a flash pasteurization locking in its bold personality just before it gets sent to us to drink,"" says DiPasquale. ""It is silk soft, almost creamy on the palate, has notes of hazelnut, caramel and candied orange peels.""

Izumibashi grows the rice they brew in Kanagawa, informs DiPasquale. ""Aged two years, this kimoto style sake (an ancient style of brewing where the yeast starter is exposed to ambient yeast) has a luxurious richness, subtle smokiness, light peppery notes and a hint of citrus that shines with anything off the grill.""

In Fukushima, Daishichi is a brewery that specializes in the kimoto method and according to Joly, ""this product is a rare brew."" Rakutenmei is made using kioke (cedar vats) and then aged in bottle for a minimum of 10 years. The result is a sake with gentle umami notes, rich texture and smooth finish. ""Because Daishichi ages in controlled temperature the sake is able to mature without oxidation and can maintain the quality leaving a lush and long finish,"" explains Joly, noting that the value for quality is reasonable despite Rakutenmei being a vintage sake.

New York's first sake brewery uses American-grown Yamada Nishiki, a high-quality, short-grain rice for this Grand Prairie sake that's balanced acidity is accented by a hint of stone fruit on the nose. ""It's a great sake for newbies and sake drinkers,"" advises Joly. ""What's even better is to visit the taproom and try their exclusives and the Kurakin which is the box subscription on limited releases. In lieu of sake day they are celebrating a week of fun sake events.""

""A pet nat from Nagano, this sake is sweet and salty with a linear precision that sommeliers seek in great champagne,"" says DiPasquale. ""The combination of crisp, tiny bubbles and wine-like acidity with the creamy and savory richness expands on the palate to impress anyone for a special occasion.""

Umeshu is a sake that has been infused with green plums and rock sugar. ""In this case, the sake has been aged for one year to give the base a little more character. Also from Shiga prefecture, this sake gives tamarind and fruit leather flavor notes to compliment the acidity of the tomato and the depth of the brown butter,"" says DiPasquale.

""This brew is smooth and round with hints of steamed rice and pear. I love to enjoy this sake fresh out of the fridge and even slightly warmed,"" shares Austin about this Tokubetsu Junmai from the Iwate Prefecture. Tokubetsu means ""special"" in Japanese, which reflects the use of locally-grown sakamai Ginotome rice that the brewers are using.

""Unapologetically unconventional, Yuho experiments with brewing techniques that produce sake with a wild personality, pronounced acidity and remarkable texture,"" says DiPasquale. ""This bottle has notes of soy, chamomile and roasted, salted nuts."" Fun fact, she adds: Yuho means ""happy rice"" and also refers to the area's numerous UFO sightings."

"Rescue missions underway in North Carolina after Hurricane Helene brings 'historic' flooding, landslides",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/rescue-missions-underway-north-carolina-after-hurricane-helene-brings-historic-flooding-landslides,2024-09-29T18:11:23Z,"Fox News Steve Harrigan reports on the aftermath of Hurricane Helene on 'Fox News Live.'

Rescue efforts are underway across western North Carolina after Hurricane Helene brought unprecedented flooding and landslides to the region over the weekend.

Deanne Criswell, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) administrator, described the catastrophic flooding as ""historic"" during an appearance on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday.

""I don't know that anybody could be fully prepared for the amount of flooding and landslides that they are experiencing right now,"" Criswell said. ""But we have had teams in there for several days where we're sending more search and rescue teams in there.""

North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said during a press conference on Sunday that the death toll of 11 was expected to rise as search teams reached areas left isolated from the storm.

""This is an unprecedented tragedy that requires an unprecedented response,"" Cooper said, adding ""we know there will be more"" deaths.

Cooper asked residents to avoid traveling on roadways in western North Carolina to keep roads clear for emergency vehicles.

More than 50 search teams have fanned out across the region in search of stranded people.

""Many people are cut off because the roads are impassable,"" the governor said.

Supplies were being airlifted to the region around Asheville, a popular tourist city in the western North Carolina mountains.

Criswell said that water is ""a big concern right now"" as recovery efforts continue.

""We have sent bottled water in, but we also have the Army Corps of Engineers that's getting ready to start assessments today to see what we can do to help get those water systems back online quickly,"" she said. ""And we're also moving in, satellite communications, Starlink satellites into the area to help facilitate the lack of communication that that part of the state is experiencing.""

When asked about climate change and the storm's impact, Criswell said that the storm intensified quickly due to warmer water temperatures.

""It's creating more storms that are reaching this major category level than we've seen in the past,"" she said. ""It's also creating greater amounts of storm surge in the coastal areas. It's creating greater amounts of rainfall, as it moves up north.""

""And so in the past, when we would look at damage from hurricanes, it was primarily wind damage with some water damage,"" Criswell continued. ""But now we're seeing so much more water damage. And I think that is a result of the warm waters, which is a result of climate change."""

Her father came to the States from Southern Germany; her mother's family had already been in the US for a generation, having come from the diaspora of the Austro-Hungarian empire with roots in Hungary, Poland, and having spent time in Vienna (which is where my parents met).

Nathan was born in Providence, Rhode Island (I just helped with a book about a Providence notable). Already at two years old, her teachers reported that she was organizing birthday parties among the toddlers. From Providence they moved to Larchmont where her parents were among the founders of the Larchmont Temple (which I have attended) and her mother compiled a Temple Cookbook with Gertrude Blue, the mother of the late food and wine writer and impresario, Andy Blue (who was also my friend).

In her childhood there were the German dishes her father missed and the Hungarian foods she ate with her mother's family at the long ago and much missed Hungarian restaurants of the Upper West Side of Manhattan such as Emke and Tik Tak, and Red Tulip on The East Side (all part of my calorie-laden childhood).

""I learned to love exploring the world of New York's foods from my mother's side of the family,"" Nathan writes. ""While from my father's I learned the importance of knowing my own roots and the family recipes that keep memories alive.""

Recipe: Cabbage Strudel

Her teenage years are dotted with cameo appearances by Marilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller whom she met in the backyard of her friend's father's home, the publisher George Braziller; and her summer camp friend Kathy Boudin, a founding member of The Weather Underground, who went to jail for a murder committed during the 1981 Brinks robbery for which Boudin was an accomplice.

The family moved back to Providence. Her father insisted Nathan learn French. After a summer in France and one spent with a family in Grenoble, she attended the University of Michigan graduating with a bachelor's and master's in French Literature (I, too, was a French literature major in college and like her did a thesis on Proust).

In 1969, Nathan decided to go to Israel. She ended up working for Teddy Kolek, Jerusalem's legendarily charismatic mayor (who I was lucky enough to meet). In Jerusalem, she met David Ben Gurion and Moshe Dayan. She did not meet Golda Meir, but she describes Golda's matzoh Ball recipe as like her foreign policy, dense and hard. For Kollek, Nathan was tasked with leading tours of Jerusalem for visiting dignitaries and celebrities including Barbara Streisand.

Recipe: Chicken with Artichokes and Lemons

Jerusalem was significant in Nathan's life in several ways (Jerusalem was also important to my career). It was where she was first introduced to Moroccan food, as well as Yemenite dishes. As she recalled, ""Living in Jerusalem in 1970, I knew nobody who knew what falafel was."" Discovering a world of middle eastern cuisine that was terra incognita to Americans, Nathan decided to compile a cookbook, The Flavor of Jerusalem, which showcased Jewish, Muslim and Christian dishes. And Jerusalem was where, at the Wailing Wall, she met Allan Gerson, who would several years later become her husband, father to their three children, and who passed away in 2020.

""I wrote about Jerusalem as a lark."" Nathan now says. ""I thought I'd be an anthropologist or something else""

When Nathan returned to America after three years in Jerusalem, she settled at first in New York, where she worked for New York's then Mayor Abe Beame (my first job was as a speechwriter for a NYC politician). Nathan co-founded the Ninth Avenue Food festival, one of New York's first street food festivals (San Gennaro aside) that remains a landmark event to this day (the smell of the sausages and peppers there haunt me to this day).

Nathan returned to Israel in 1973 and found herself there for the Yom Kippur War where she ended up volunteering in the Golan Heights. Back in the US, she was accepted to the Kennedy School of Government in Boston, where she and Allan who had reconnected and married lived among new friends such as Julia Child. Nathan started writing about food for The Boston Globe, and published her second cookbook, The Jewish Holiday Kitchen.

In the meantime, Allan, who was an attorney, got a job in Washington DC with the Justice Department working in a newly created division, the Office of Special Investigations (OSI), formed to prosecute Nazi War Criminals living in the United States (my first book was about the prosecution of Nazi extermination camp guard John Demjanjuk).

They moved to DC which, at the time, was not a foodie town. However, because of all the embassies, there were great foreign cooks from all over the world, great chefs came to DC and set up restaurants, beginning with Jean Louis Palladin who brought French cooking to DC. In DC, Joan began writing about food for the Washington Post. She also began doing lectures about food for the Smithsonian.

Nathan's American Folklife Cookbook followed, which took her all over the country to meet the cooks who shared recipes that had been in their families for generations. Lunch with another legend, Leo Lerman, editorial guru at Conde Nast, led to writing for Gourmet and an introduction to iconic cookbook editor Judith Jones.

By the mid-1980s, Nathan was writing for the New York Times about trips to Morrocco, South Africa, the former Soviet Union and its satellite republics, Georgia, and Lithuania. All while raising three children, and while Allen was working for Jeanne Kirkpatrick at the United Nations, and at the State Department during the Reagan administration.

Over the course of her writing, books, and food activism, Nathan met and became friends with the most notable food writers, restauranteurs, and chefs of our time such as Alice Waters, Georg Lang (whose Hungarian cookbooks and restaurants loomed large in my family), M.F. K. Fisher, Diana Kennedy, Jose Andres among many, many others. And she even became friends with Jones, who was probably the most well-known cookbook editor in the United States and also the woman who found The Diary of Anne Frank in the slush pile and championed its publication.

Recipe: Gefilte Fish

One day, as Nathan recalled, Jones called her up with an idea: To write a book about Jewish Cooking in America. ""The first thing I did,"" Nathan recalled, ""as there was no internet [yet]. I wrote to all the Jewish newspapers asking for information."" The recipes poured in. The book was not only a major success, and a reference point for chefs all over the world (Ottolenghi credits it as an influence), but it also provided the impetus for Nathan's landmark Public Television program Jewish Cooking in America with Joan Nathan (now viewable on YouTube).

At that time, Jewish food had what Nathan calls, ""a lousy reputation."" She elaborates: ""It was overcooked. It was heavy. It was all Ashkenazi."" But food that identified as Jewish was changing. Since 1982, Wolfgang Puck has been serving his ""Jewish Pizza"" with crème fraiche and smoked salmon at Spago. People began to appreciate Delis and explore the diaspora of Jewish cooking even as Israeli cuisine came into its own.

The Jewish Cooking in America series gave Nathan license to highlight the diversity and strength of Jewish cooks living in the United States. ""The most rewarding for me,"" Nathan writes, ""were those like Agi [a Holocaust survivor] from older generations telling their stories from the past that gives us all strength for the future. Once again, sharing food opened the lives and hearts of so many people.""

Over the following three decades, Nathan was an enthusiastic globetrotter, traveling to Cuba, Vietnam, Ethiopia, working with the US State Department LIFE Project which was a food incubator business for refugees, revisiting Israel and Israeli cuisine for The Foods of Israel Today, combining her love of France and of Jewish cooking in Quiches, Kugels and Couscous: My Search for Jewish Cooking in France, and then gathering Jewish recipes from around the world for King Solomon's Table.

For Nathan, love of food ""makes every trip a voyage of discovery for local recipes and home cooks. Food is a way to learn about other cultures, customs and religions.""

After her husband Alan died in 2020, Nathan was in deep mourning. She had read Joan Didion's Year of Magical Thinking and did not want to fall into the sort of repetitive thinking that deepens depression. So, she decided to work on her memoir.

""I would get up early in the morning before I could start feeling sorry for myself and just write."" Nathan then had to sort through years and years of files, clippings, boxes of letters. Fifty years of articles. ""It took me almost two years to get everything in order chronologically so I could go through it.""

She wrote more than she had ever planned. In the end, with her editor, she had to cut out 30,000 words, including a story about bringing Julia Child to a potluck dinner for her children's school at a parents' home, where no one recognized their famous guest.

In the process of writing the book, she discovered the impact Jewish Cooking in America had, the tremendous amount of funds she raised with charity events she co-led, such as Sips and Suppers in DC, and how she had built a life one adventure at a time.

Recipe: Apple Cider Honey Cake

""I realized [that] I've always done things just because I wanted to do them, and I sort of plowed ahead,"" Nathan told me. She even has a new book coming out in November, A Sweet Year, a cookbook for kids and their families for Jewish celebrations.

""I learned from everybody,"" Nathan said, ""and a lot of these things, you just have to know enough to see the connection. And that's what I love to do. The older I get, the more I learn.... For me, that's one of the most exciting things."""
"President And CEO Of The Bay Area Host Committee, Zaileen Janmohamed, Is Breathing New Life Back Into The City Through Sports",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pauleannareid/2024/09/29/president-and-ceo-of-the-bay-area-host-committee-zaileen-janmohamed-is-breathing-new-life-back-into-the-city-through-sports/,2024-09-29T16:24:32Z,"President and CEO of the Bay Area Host Committee, Zaileen Janmohamed, is bridging the gap between sports and community impact in the San Francisco Bay Area.

With three major sporting events-NBA All-Star in 2025, and Super Bowl LX and FIFA World Cup in 2026-all scheduled to take place over the span of 18 months, Janmohamed is placing the Bay back on center stage.

Shifting the future for women through the business of sports

As the daughter of immigrants, Janmohamed has always been inspired to explore success outside of traditional lines. After taking a liking to hockey, she saw the many ways it influenced fortitude and resilience within her, and challenged expectations of what femininity looked like within the realm of sports. This passion eventually led to her studying Kinesiology and Sports Management, placing her at the intersection of science and sports.

With a broader view of the industry, she began to develop an intimate understanding of the business of sports, as she grew increasingly more inspired by the women she encountered along the way. However, as with most spaces, the gender inequalities she encountered reserved women to executional roles and placed them on the other side of C-suite doors, and away from tables where policy and impact were taking place. Janmohamed expresses, ""...within my own career ambitions, I knew that if I wanted to be in a position where I could actually influence change, I needed to have a different type of skill set."" Recognizing that the skills she needed to break these barriers weren't readily available to her, Janmohamed set out to create these opportunities in the hopes of providing increased instances for growth and learning for women following in footsteps they had yet to discover existed.

In collaboration with University of Massachusetts, Janmohamed founded the Women in Sport Business Program that seeks to provide young women with the skills needed to shatter gender and resource-based hindrances to access pivotal roles within the business of sports. By providing skill development within strategy, along with business and financial acumen, it offers women integral access to the support, resources, and visibility that Janmohamed wished had been available to her at the onset of her career. She understood that, in doing so, she would be inspiring young women to reimagine career possibilities, just as she'd done the first moment she stepped onto that hockey rink as a young girl. In providing indelible resources and support to about 30 young women each year since its inception in January 2021, she offers a space to unleash their untapped potential by exposing them to scenarios that aim to give invaluable world and industry knowledge, through direct access to leading female leaders across the sporting industry.

Janmohamed's commitment to increasing representation in the industry also led her to serve as a board member for Women in Sports Tech (WIST)-an accelerator program that helped to connect over 7,500 candidates with sports and technology roles through its employer network. Within any role she undertakes, her goal, she states, ""[is] to get women into positions where I believe the industry is going so that they could be more impactful, and be placed in leadership positions in the future. When you fast forward that to today, now I'm in a position where I can actually hire those women and put them in C-suite positions. It's almost a full circle moment; you offer education at the beginning, the skill development at the beginning, then you evolve those skills based on where the industry is going, which is in technology. And then, you hire those women when you have the ability to do so."" And that is exactly what she did when she became the president and CEO of the Bay Area Host Committee.

The impact of sports goes beyond the field

The expertise Janmohamed acquired within each of these spaces, paired with her much sought-after insights on and off the field, has continued to make her a valued collaborator and resource with a holistic perspective that spans the full spectrum of sports, from mental health to brand positioning and impact. She understands the unique lens through which she's able to be a key asset for community leaders, business executives, and those with the power to impact policy and change. ""Beyond the science of sport, I also work on the business side. So, when I walk into a room and I'm talking to a team or a brand and they have a focus on a certain thing within sport, I can usually find a way to relate. I understand the movement of sport, as well as its impact because I've studied it and I've worked in it for a number of years.""

It is why it came as no surprise when she was asked to take the helm of the Bay Area Host Committee and lead the region through the most highly visible sporting events in the world.

This unprecedented occurrence finds the Bay Area being the first city to host the Super Bowl and the World Cup within the same year, and is most likely a feat that may never occur again. While these events are expected to collectively bring in $1.4 billion into the region, beyond this, Janmohamed knows that this is an opportunity for the Bay Area to shine through after years of economic strife. While these events will showcase the Bay to millions of viewers and attract hundreds of thousands of visitors, Janmohamed is more focused on the community impact. From the moment the first tourist arrives to the moment the last tourist has returned home, she aims to, ""explore initiatives or programs that our organization can implement to ensure that local communities are actively involved and that these benefits are widely distributed and really felt across different demographic groups.""

To do so, Janmohamed and her team are focusing on events and initiatives that include, ""BIPOC and marginalized populations, and the ways to contribute to community and economic impact in order to attract other events to come to the Bay after."" The diversity that exists within the Bay Area is one that cannot be denied. With a total of nine counties, Janmohamed is creating festivities for tourists, and locals alike, to experience the magic of the Bay Area together. ""A fan in San Jose is going to engage in the sport of soccer differently than a fan in Oakland, or a fan in Marin, and we should allow for that to happen. It's that diversity that we should actually be focusing on and allowing to flourish organically versus forcing everybody into one spot."" Through each county, Janmohamed hopes that ""...fans will celebrate the events in a way that's more authentic to them through food, culture and music. And as the host committee, it is our job to ensure events like this have a lasting impact in the Bay.""

From play to policy, equitable outcomes for the future of sports require women at the helm

With the Bay Area Host Committee-a not for profit organization with the primary goal of uniting the Bay Area through sport-acting as an effective collaborator for communities, brands, investors, and industry leaders, Janmohamed humbly leverages the knowledge and support of her team and board members to blaze new and inventive trails toward the future. With a shared vision, she leads by example, while also creating greater opportunities for continued growth for those around her. With a small team that she hopes to scale in the future, the key to success, she believes, ""[is] to be completely transparent with my team and vice versa. If there is a problem that they're facing, and they don't know how to solve it, we need to support each other through it."" She is also a huge advocate for optimizing the skills of those around her, explaining, [I have] to trust the people in the positions [I'm] putting them in. They are experts, and I have to rely on them and trust them to do a really great job to the best of their ability, versus trying to micromanage and stifle [their] growth.""

It is this unwavering confidence in her leadership that allows her to build trusted relationships with those within local, state, and federal government entities to ensure she can lend her voice to the issues that matter.

The possibility model for women and young girls is directly impacted by their ability to see themselves within spaces that have traditionally been reserved for men and boys. However, through her determination to shatter stereotypes, ceilings, and limitations for women and girls, Janmohamed is leading the way to create more executive roles for women, while redefining what it means to be a woman in sports, and she's hoping to make the Bay Area proud along the way."
"The Bible makes clear who will win today's battles, says Jonathan Cahn, bestselling author",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/bible-makes-clear-win-todays-battles-jonathan-cahn-bestselling-author,2024-09-29T14:11:21Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Author and evangelist Jonathan Cahn did not plan to write his newest book, ""The Dragon's Prophecy: Israel, the Dark Resurrection, and the End of Days."" Instead, as he told Fox News Digital in an on-camera interview, current events simply forced his hand.

""I was kind of interrupted by everything that was happening in the Middle East,"" Cahn said in a video interview from New Jersey. Cahn is the leader of Beth Israel/The Jerusalem Center in Wayne, New Jersey, a messianic congregation. (See the video at the top of this article.)

While Cahn has written other books, he'd ""never written a book that so much got into the biblical prophecy that is coming true now -- that whole realm that is happening,"" he said.

'CHIPS' ACTOR ERIK ESTRADA ON HOW FAITH BUOYS HIS LIFE AND CAREER: 'IT'S A GOOD THING'

Cahn began writing the book in January; it was released on September 3. The process of writing ""The Dragon's Prophecy,"" he said, was different for him than writing his other books.

As he was writing it, ""things are coming true,"" he said. ""I had to keep on updating the book because of that.""

Shortly after it was released, it hit bestseller lists, something Cahn told Fox News Digital he did not expect to happen. (His very first book, ""The Harbinger,"" became a New York Times bestseller, as his other books did as well.)

He said that in regard to the new book, ""There's been a real hunger. We've never seen a reaction like this,"" he said. ""This is different.""

ANCIENT SWORD FROM THE ERA OF MOSES, BOOK OF EXODUS UNCOVERED IN EGYPT

""I had no idea that what the Bible wrote was actually coming true, starting with the resurrection of Israel,"" he said.

""The enemy is depicted in the Book of Revelation in a vision as a dragon.""

""[The Bible] said it was going to happen,"" he noted. ""'They're going to be gathered, Jewish people from the ends of the earth, and it's going to become a nation again.' Well, we're here.""

The title ""The Dragon's Prophecy"" is a reference to the Book of Revelation, Cahn told Fox News Digital. ""The enemy is depicted in the Book of Revelation in a vision as a dragon,"" he said.

In Revelation 12, a dragon is ""warring against a woman,"" said Cahn.

Some people, including Cahn, interpret the woman as a representation of Israel.

""The largest part of 'The Dragon's Prophecy,' or the largest section, is called 'The End of Days,'"" he said.

""And the Bible speaks of something called the end of days, really from the time of Moses up to into the New Testament,"" said Cahn.

MOTHER TERESA'S LAST MESSAGE, WRITTEN ON THE DAY SHE DIED, REVEALS DEEP FAITH IN CHRIST

While the Bible also states that nobody will know the ""day or the hour"" that Christ will return, it also states there will be certain signs to look out for, signs that Cahn says are happening.

""It says on one hand you'll know it, because the nation of Israel will come back into the world - which will have been dead for ages - [it] will be gathered back. The Jewish people will come back to the land. Well, that's happened,"" he said.

Cahn continued, ""It says that the Jewish people will be back in it, in the city of Jerusalem. Well, that happened in 1967, by the way.""

""It says that all nations will be focused on the Middle East.""

The Second Coming of Christ, he said, ""can't happen without the Jewish people being in Jerusalem.""

""Another thing. It says that all nations will be focused on the Middle East and focused on this little New Jersey-sized land of Israel -- and that the nations will rage against the Jewish people, rage against Israel.""

He added, ""It's happening"" -- noting the surge of antisemitism over the last year.

""So, the thing is, you have a checklist. We could check all these things off,"" said Cahn.

""We don't know the exact moment [Christ will return], but we do know the season, and we're in it.""

Cahn said he wants people to know that the Bible makes clear who will win this battle in the end.

""You know, for 4,000 years the world's been trying to destroy the nation of Israel, the Jewish people -- the dragon, the enemy, has been trying to do that,"" he said.

Despite this, the Jewish people have survived -- and all who have tried to destroy them, from ancient to modern times, ""are all gone,"" said Cahn.

""And so, if you follow the God of Israel, you follow the Messiah of Israel, Jesus, you will live. You will prevail,"" he said."
"After Jeff Lynne's ELO Farewell Tour, We Need The ELO Musical",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/darrynking/2024/09/29/after-jeff-lynnes-elo-farewell-tour-we-need-the-elo-musical/,2024-09-29T14:09:02Z,"That was the major takeaway from Jeff Lynne's ELO in concert at Madison Square Garden on September 16.

Famously, Lynne's stated objective with Electric Light Orchestra was to pick up where The Beatles' ""I Am the Walrus"" left off. What did he mean by that, exactly? He probably wasn't just referring to the heavy psychedelic menace of that track (although Lynne does love to kick off albums -- and concerts -- with a bizarro space-shifting time-warp sequence -- the ELO spaceship plunging into hyperspace.)

More likely, he was thinking of those snarkily present cellos, George Martin's string arrangement generally, and, most of all, the everything-including-the-kitchen sink production. The endless appeal of ELO's sound is that -- as Lennon remarked of ""I Am the Walrus"" -- it's loaded with ""enough little bitties going to keep you interested even a hundred years later."" It's rock'n'roll and Phil Spector's Wall of Sound crossed with the orchestral score for a fantastically brooding sci-fi adventure film. (The late-song arrival of an ominously intoning male choir, a favorite Lynne maneuver, should sound preposterous in a pop context. In fact, it's never not awesome.)

The robust production is part of the appeal, anyway. Probably even more important is the breeziness and vibrancy of Lynne's pop songwriting. ""Evil Woman,"" ""Sweet Talkin' Woman,"" ""Livin' Thing,"" ""Don't Bring Me Down"" and ""Mr. Blue Sky"" are pop at its most exquisite and grin-inducing. ""Evil Woman"" could go on pretty much forever and no one would complain. These are songs that defy you to resist grinning and singing along. Experienced with a large audience, the feeling is nothing short of euphoric.

While his proggier peers were creating ponderous rock symphonies, Lynne understood that you could borrow the drama of classical instruments at the service of fun. Think of the Vivaldi-flavored violin breaks in ""Livin' Thing"" which could soundtrack a scene from The Great Train Robbery (complete with heroic trumpet moment). And Lynne's unerring pop instincts meant that ELO was able to cruise through the disco era with flair, with ""Don't Let Me Down,"" ""Last Train to London"" and ""Shine a Little Love"" more than worthy additions to the catalog. (Though, in concert, the futuristic shimmer motif of ""Shine a Little Love"" could be taken down a notch.)

In concert, Lynne prefers to let the songs speak for themselves -- which is fine when the songs are this good. In truth, it's sad to see Lynne lose his way in the musical wonderland of his own making. He is giving so much joy on this, his final tour, and has more than earned his retirement.

But, clearly, there's a deep desire among music lovers to get down to ELO's greatest hits -- which is why a catalog or compilation musical centered around those hits (not a biomusical, please) feels like a no-brainer at this point. There might be a ""21st Century Man"" taking a ""Ticket to the Moon,"" or a ""Wild West Hero"" missing a ""Sweet Talkin' Woman."" Obviously there would be a vocoder-voiced robot -- and someone named Bruce. (Producers, I am available to discuss ideas.)

All I know is that, for an hour and a half, Jeff Lynne's ELO transported a sold-out crowd to a galaxy where infectious, feel-good symphonic pop reigns. And I'm ready for another trip."
IDF prepares to invade southern Lebanon as 2 more Hezbollah leaders are presumed dead,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/g-s1-25330/idf-strikes-hezbollah-invasion-lebanon,2024-09-29T13:41:30Z,"A woman reads the Quran at the site of the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut's southern suburbs, Sunday. Hassan Ammar/AP hide caption

Israel's military says it carried out ""dozens"" of additional raids on Hezbollah targets early Sunday, as reports circulated that another two senior Hezbollah commanders were assassinated following the assassination of the militant group's leader Hassan Nasrallah in a southern suburb of Beirut.

In a statement, the IDF said it had eliminated Nabil Kaouk, head of Hezbollah's preventative security council.

Hezbollah did not comment on Kaouk's whereabouts, but it separately confirmed the death of another senior commander, Ali Karaki.

At least 11 people were killed in the latest strikes, according to Lebanon's National News Agency.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned to Israel earlier than expected from his trip to the United Nations as Israel was said to be preparing for an invasion into southern Lebanon after reservists were called up to Israel's north.

In a statement on the messaging app Telegram, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its air forces targeted ""buildings where weapons and military structures of the organization were stored.""

The IDF says it has attacked hundreds of Hezbollah targets since Saturday, aiming its attacks in Dahieh, a densely populated southern suburb of Beirut and Hezbollah stronghold.

""The IDF continues to attack with force, damage and degrade Hezbollah's military capabilities and infrastructure in Lebanon,"" the Israeli military said in a post on X.

Israeli strikes left another 33 people dead on Saturday, according to the Lebanese health ministry, and an additional 195 people wounded.

Meanwhile, the IDF also said it had intercepted eight projectiles launched from Lebanon into Israel on Sunday, hitting open areas near Tiberias in Israel's north.

The latest exchanges of fire, combined with Israel's preparations to invade southern Lebanon has mounted fears that the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah was heading toward an all-out war.

Israel's killing of Nasrallah, in particular, represents another dramatic new development for a conflict that has metastasized across the Middle East region since last October.

In a statement on Saturday, Netanyahu stood by the move, calling it necessary to ""change the balance of power in the region for years to come.""

""Nasrallah was not a terrorist; he was the terrorist,"" Netanyahu said in a statement, warning of challenging days ahead.

Even as Israeli forces prepared for a response to retaliatory strikes from Hezbollah, Lebanon's Information Minister said on Sunday that negotiations for a ceasefire with Israel were still ""underway"" even as cross-border exchanges of fire continued.

The U.S., France, the U.K. and other allies have called for a 21-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, even as the prospect of any such agreement appears less and less likely.

""It's time for a ceasefire now,"" President Joe Biden told reporters on Saturday as he left a church in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.

Asked about Nasrallah's killing, however, Biden said the longtime Hezbollah leader's death was ""a measure of justice"" for victims of his four-decade ""reign of terror.""

In a separate statement, Biden noted the operation to take out Nasrallah happened within the wider context of the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attacks against Israel.

""Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a 'northern front' against Israel,"" Biden said in a statement.

On Saturday, the U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy reiterated calls for a ceasefire, saying in a post on X that he had spoken with the Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati.

""We agreed on the need for an immediate ceasefire to bring an end to the bloodshed,"" Lammy said. ""A diplomatic solution is the only way to restore security and stability for the Lebanese and Israeli people.""

Mikati told reporters on Sunday that he ""welcomes"" a ceasefire, adding that if one were to occur, it would need to apply to both Gaza and Lebanon."
Should you vote your feelings? A traveling play helps audiences think that through,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5107876/fight-night-theater-election-drama-ann-arbor-durham-minneapolis-santa-barbara,2024-09-29T11:14:18Z,"Fight Night begins with a sinister host emerging from the shadows of a set resembling a boxing ring. ""Friends, voters, audience, lend me your ear,"" he intones, evoking a much older play about the perils of picking leaders.

Five actors materialize. Or rather, candidates. One is a young Black woman with stylish, scarlet hair that matches her turtleneck sweater. One is a middle-aged white man, short and grumpy. Another white man is Kennedy-handsome, tailored and lean. A white woman wears a surprisingly short skirt and a semi-transparent blouse. A Black man with long dreads smiles cheerfully. Over the course of the next 90 minutes, they appeal to audience members to choose them.

Each audience member is given a small device that allows them to anonymously vote for the candidates in different rounds and answer questions that range from age, to income, to qualities most valued in a leader.

Fight Night premiered to great acclaim at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2013. It's toured the world since then, with performances in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Russia, Australia and Hong Kong. The current U.S. tour includes upcoming stops in Durham, N.C., Minneapolis and Santa Barbara, Calif.

Angelo Tijssens plays the sinister emcee and is part of the Belgian theater group Ontroerend Goed. The group created this show, under the direction of Alexander Devriendt, after a real-life political crisis that paralyzed the country.

""We spent 541 days without a federal government in Belgium,"" Tijssens told NPR. In 2007, a right-wing Flemish politician named Bart De Wever won a popular TV quiz show called The Smartest Person in the World and became unexpectedly powerful. Forming coalitions turned out to be nearly impossible for a period during De Wever's rise.

Tijssens and Devriendt became fascinated by entertainment's influence on democracy. ""And as humans always do, thinking that this was very specific to this point in history, we started reading and found out it wasn't,"" Tijssens said. ""The Greeks had already written about the dangers of politicians being too popular.""

They decided to create an ambitious show about democracy in general, rather than about specific issues, such as housing, or social reform, ""or climate, or abortion rights, or everything else I'd really like to talk or even shout about,"" Tijssens said. ""But just about - how does the system work, and how easy it is to be influenced.""

Like theater, he pointed out, democracy needs people to show up in person.

""It's been there all the time,"" he noted. ""So it didn't really have to change a lot. I think the show can still go on for another - but I'm being very modest now - 20 centuries.""

"'Diff'rent Strokes' star Todd Bridges reveals last words to mother, 'Good Times' actress Betty A Bridges",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/diffrent-strokes-star-todd-bridges-reveals-last-words-mother-good-times-actress-betty-bridges,2024-09-29T11:12:53Z,"Fox News Flash top entertainment and celebrity headlines are here.

Todd Bridges said that when his mother, actress Betty A. Bridges, was dying this summer, his last words to her were to tell her she could go.

""Before she passed away, she was awake a little bit, and I kissed her on the forehead, and I said, 'Look, if you want to go see your mom and your grandmother and your brothers, you can go ahead, Mom. Go,'"" the actor, who played Willis Jackson on ""Diff'rent Strokes,"" revealed to People magazine this week. ""'We're going to be okay,' and about a couple hours later, she was gone.""

The ""Diff'rent Strokes' alum, 59, was by his mother's side when she died in late August while in hospice care at his home in Phoenix. She was 83 years old.

""She was going through too much, and I was happy that God took her home,"" Bridges told People. ""My mom passing away, to me, I didn't want her to, but I didn't want to see her suffer anymore either.""

Betty A. Bridges played a crucial role in Todd's recovery from addiction, her rep shared after her death. ""Her tough love and unwavering support highlight the profound impact of family and friends in overcoming life's toughest battles,"" the rep said.

Lambert Wilson And Amira Casar On  Apple TV+'s New Series 'La Maison',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/maellebeauget-uhl/2024/09/29/lambert-wilson-and-amira-casar-on--apple-tvs-new-series-la-maison/,2024-09-29T10:27:15Z,"After tackling the lives of the world's biggest fashion designers, including Christian Dior and Coco Chanel during the Second World War in The New Look, Apple TV+ once again dives into the secrets, schemes and intrigues of a fictional French family of fashion designers in La Maison, now available on the streaming platform.

Vincent Ledu, portrayed by Lambert Wilson, is the artistic director of Ledu, one of France's biggest fashion houses, which in size and legacy, could be comparable to Chanel. Vincent starts to feel like his artistry is declining and cannot seem to satisfy the needs of his new clients.

After failing to conclude a sale with a wealthy Korean bride, Ledu is secretly filmed at a party, while making racist comments about her. Of course, the video is leaked and goes viral. Vincent's team and Perle Foster, his muse and right-hand woman, portrayed by Amira Casar, try to make him do his mea culpa but it is too late for him and for the house, now in peril. On top of that, Vincent's brother and his in-laws have become his foes and are at the head of Rovel, a fashion empire that could be compared to LVMH.

While La Maison will keep you hooked for its plot and twists, I spoke with Lambert Wilson and Amira Casar about the fashion side of the show and particularly about the relationship the two actors have had to their costumes in the show but also throughout their respective careers. Lambert Wilson said, ""Since I was a kid, I loved to disguise myself and I think my desire to become an actor started from that.""

He added: ""Some actors start from the inside, and it is the decisions they will take from the inside that will help them decide how to carry the character and how they are dressed. I like to start with the costume because it has an immediate impact on me. It changes me radically, it is like wearing a mask. It starts with the shoes particularly, and how they enable you to walk.""

Wilson then declared that while he was filming Gods and Men directed by Xavier Beauvois (2010), he was giving monks habits and while at first glance, it might seem like a very simple costume, it actually had the biggest and strongest impact on his performance. He said, ""You are reduced to just being a face, your identity and your difference lies within your face. It erases your past, your identity, it worked amazingly."" The actor also shared that he likes to keep things inside the pockets of his costumes for the building of the character.

For Amira Casar, costumes are essential in the portrayal of a character as they can translate into what is not said by the character. She said, ""It's in the shoulders, it's in the attitude and of course when you have a good costume designer, you work hand in hand with them and you find the structure of the character, the way they walk, the way they move, the way they behave. So you need a costume that will help you explore the kind of psychological, inner emotions that are written or not written, that you as an actor, have to color and fill in. We were trying to bring a casual, chic thing. But I absolutely think that working on costumes is a very vital part of the creation of the character.""

Wilson further elaborated that with Carine Sarfati, the costume designer of La Maison, Vincent would be wearing a lot of black as his job is to create beauty, so his own outfits would have to be very neutral and classic, which would also be a tribute to the family's historical fortune made with black lace, which was worn by the widows of sailors.

In the show, we can see that the designers can only be creatively fulfilled once they see their work being worn by models on the runway, and then on their clients. I asked Wilson and Casar when they felt the most creatively fulfilled as actors.

Casar said, ""It's different stages, for creating a character but also in the fashion house, from the top and then the clothes come down for the client, I realized that when I did the film Saint Laurent as well. So many artists, so much sweat that goes into the work.""

Wilson said, ""I think that no artist is fulfilled and satisfied, ever. So I think the designers are never satisfied. They are aware of the energy of the group and of what they accomplished. But I think, at the end of the day, particularly in fashion, they are already thinking about what they are going to do next. Or they have to think about what they are going to do next. Presumably, the first time they see someone, a woman, wearing their clothes on the street, that must be an extraordinary feeling. Not a feeling of fulfillment, but it must be fantastically exciting.""

For Casar, La Maison draws the bridge between a new and an older generation of designers. For the actress, not all fashion designers can be artists as they have a huge pressure on them, having to sell and answer to a bigger group, to a bigger fashion empire. She said, ""It talks about the clash between the old generation, having to hang on to a beautiful craftsmanship and then the young generation that is definitely hungry to bring their political and radical ideas into today's world, they're recycling, upcycling.""

Wilson said, ""I have a friend who is an Italian designer, he's working for quite a big house in France, and every time I ask him to show me some of his work, he is always so self-deprecating, because it also has to do with the time issue, this is now something from the past. For instance, people ask us what we think is our best role, our best film. I always want to say 'It's the next one', because if I look back at what I have done, I think it's shit.""

Casar added: ""We tend to tear our performances apart.""

For Casar, La Maison innovates by not only focusing on the fashion world, but also on two dysfunctional families and shattered people. She said, ""When they take their clothes off at night, their beautiful clothes, I think they are lonely. There is sadness, there are dysfunctional, they carry that in them. And I think a lot of actors and sensitive people carry that around in their bodies, all these feelings."""
Virginia man found guilty of 1992 cold case rape as part of initiative to test rape kits,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/virginia-man-found-guilty-1992-cold-case-rape-part-initiative-test-rape-kits,2024-09-29T09:10:58Z,"Harvey Castro talks about how AI cold be used in cold cases and the symbiotic relationship between AI and a detective.

A 56-year-old Virginia man was found guilty this week of rape and armed burglary in a 32-year-old cold case, officials said.

DNA evidence from the victim's sexual assault kit was matched to Vernon Lorenzo Gay, 56, after it was retested two years ago.

The retesting was part of a grant-funded Virginia Sexual Assault Kit Initiative by the state's attorney general that began in 2016.

Gay climbed through one of the victim's three children's windows on the night of May 5, 1992, found her bedroom and raped her in her own bed while one of her children was in bed with her, the city of Norfolk, Virginia, said in a news release.

MASSACHUSETTS MAN ARRESTED IN 36-YEAR-OLD COLD CASE AFTER SPIT ON SIDEWALK LINKS HIM TO MURDER OF WOMAN

Another child was also in the room in a crib and a third was in the next room.

The victim wasn't able to identify her attacker, and while a rape kit was administered, no leads were uncovered and the case went cold.

In July 2022, the rape kit was submitted for testing and Gay was found as a match last November.

Gay's defense team claimed that he had consensual sex with her, which the victim denied, telling police when a match was made that she didn't know him.

The jury found Gay guilty of rape and armed burglary with intent to commit rape on Wednesday after deliberating for under two hours.

SERIAL KILLER KNOWN AS 'HOLLYWOOD RIPPER' EXTRADITED TO ILLINOIS FOR 1993 MURDER OF HIS TEEN NEIGHBOR

""Once again, Norfolk leads Virginia with the first SAKI [Sexual Assault Kit Initiative] jury to go forward in the Commonwealth,"" Commonwealth's Attorney Ramin Fatehi said in a statement. ""Thank you to former Attorney General Mark Herring and Attorney General Jason Miyares for devoting resources to test back evidence cases in cases like these.""

He added, ""The wheels of justice may move slowly, but they never stop, and we have served justice today. I am glad that we were able to bring a measure of closure, after all this time, for the survivor and her family, and to be able to hold Vernon Gay responsible for this terrible crime.""

Gay's family maintains his innocence.

""He's a very, very good person. Good father. Good friend. Good worker. Good uncle. Good brother,' one of Gay's relatives told WVEC-TV.

Fatehi explained to WAVY-TV that the ""statute of limitations on a felony in Virginia is forever.""

""Today's verdict brings much-needed solace and closure in this cold case, underscoring the unrelenting commitment of state and local law enforcement to secure justice, no matter how much time has passed,"" Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares said. ""I'm gratified that our SAKI initiative helped fund this vital partnership and made this resolution possible."""
Pennsylvania leaders in both parties talk ground game as GOP seeks to undo Dem gains: 'Massive shift',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pennsylvania-leaders-talk-very-exciting-ground-game-gop-seeks-undo-dem-gains-a-massive-shift,2024-09-29T08:13:56Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Pennsylvania Republican leaders said they are optimistic about their chances to make the Keystone State the one that puts former President Donald Trump over the finish line, while a top Democrat suggested otherwise, laying out how his party is on a path to victory.

State Sen. Cris Dush, a Brookville Republican, who noted he represents seven of Pennsylvania's 67 counties, was asked about the one big blue swath in his district - Centre County, home to Penn State University.

Dush's district covers all-or-parts-of Jefferson, Elk, Cameron, Centre, Clinton, McKean and Potter counties in Pennsylvania's lush northwestern forests.

With Republican activist Scott Presler targeting Centre as part of his statewide GOP voter registration push, Dush said the prospect of flipping Centre County is ""actually getting very exciting.""

Dush noted neighboring Clinton County, home to Lock Haven, was solidly Democratic until the Trump era. ""They just went over 3-to-1 Republican.""

CRISS-CROSSING PA TO REGISTER VOTERS, SCOTT PRESLER SAYS HE'S MOVING THE NEEDLE TO FLIP KEY COUNTIES RED

""This is a massive shift that's coming in rural Pennsylvania... and part of it is that my working class, middle-age and senior constituents are seeing what's happening to their jobs and with inflation and this craziness,"" he said.

""With a man now being able to be called a woman: that kind of stuff too. They've just finally had enough.""

At a recent fair in his district, Dush said he was heckled by a young Democrat while speaking to a crowd that included many Gen-Z people. Instead of engaging, he told the crowd the reason the man was upset was that he is one of many who cannot afford to own a home, a car or other ""American Dream"" mainstays.

""And I'm getting applause from the kids,"" he remarked.

In several of Dush's redder counties, Democrats like Sen. John Fetterman performed better than most last cycle - while GOP nominee Dr. Mehmet Oz still won the areas outright.

In that regard, Dush was asked if that was an aberration or if the areas are truly trending toward the Democrats.

""The fact that they're putting such restrictions on the development of businesses in the northern tier and western Pennsylvania: There's not a state in the United States that doesn't have a Steelers bar in it, and that's because working-class kids have become our best export. I want them back,"" he said.

Farther east, near the New Jersey border, the Lehigh Valley was once home to a booming steel industry immortalized by Billy Joel's 1981 hit ""Allentown.""

PA TOWN ROILED BY TALK OF MIGRANT HOUSING IN CIVIL-WAR-ERA ORPHANAGE BUILDING

Since then, the area has been through several years of transition after the mills and some shopping districts closed. Slowly, it has regained some footing as a warehousing hub, with its vicinity to New York and Philadelphia.

State Sen. Jarrett Coleman, R-Parkland, represents the western half of the Valley, centered around Lehigh County - where Republicans have come within a razor's edge several times of flipping the congressional seat currently held by Rep. Susan Wild, D-Pa.

For many years, the seat was held by anti-Trump moderate Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., and before that, then-Rep. Pat Toomey, and before him, moderate Democrats.

Coleman said he predicts a good year for Republicans in Lehigh County, noting how neighboring Bucks County - part of which he also represents - flipped to majority-GOP registrants through the work of people like Presler.

The economy is a major issue in the district, he noted, as Fox News Digital discussed its industrial past.

""I think that's because I believe the GOP has done a better job connecting with folks over those kitchen table issues,"" Coleman said.

""The one that's kind of come up a lot lately has been homeownership,"" he said.

He noted Vice President Kamala Harris has proposed assistance for homebuyers, while at the same time floating taxation on unrealized gains.

""So on one hand, she'll help you buy the house, and of course, that will just be [via] tax dollars to help subsidize the down payment... then the administration will tax you out of [it] as the house grows in value.""

""That's not a solution. That's another example of the government creating a problem and then trying to swoop in and say they've saved the day.""

In a statement, National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Mike Marinella added that the GOP is ""on offense in Pennsylvania.""

""The Keystone State is a deep GOP well of flippable seats and ground zero to grow our House majority,"" he said, adding several vulnerable Democrats running for re-election do not speak truthfully of their records on the border, inflation and crime.

While he believes Philadelphia and Pittsburgh will ""play well"" for Harris, Coleman said he has never seen such enthusiasm for the GOP ticket in areas like the Lehigh Valley and key mid-state areas.

""Can the rural vote come back, and can we make up for the votes of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh -- and will there be enough folks in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia who are waking up? But I think it's going to be a question of whether everywhere else can get motivated enough.""

One man who believed otherwise is Pennsylvania Democratic Party Chairman Sharif Street.

Street, a state senator and son of popular former Philadelphia Mayor John Street, suggested Democrats are the ones whose ground game has been unmatched.

""We've had over 40,000 volunteers signed up since Kamala became our nominee for president. Vice President Harris has inspired people. We've had we've had people knocking on doors, canvass launches, over 50 offices opened [in PA],"" Street said.

""People are just super excited about supporting Vice President Harris. So yeah, we're seeing lots of energy, lots of engagement, and the vice president has sort of set the world on fire,"" he quipped.

When asked about the candidates appearing to focus in recent weeks on key areas of the state, Street said Harris has been all over the Commonwealth.

When asked about both candidates frequenting Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Street noted there is a key congressional race there between Rep. Matt Cartwright, D-Pa., and Republican Rob Bresnahan.

""It's also hometown territory for Senator Casey,"" he added.

When asked about Republicans claiming they are making inroads in Centre, Bucks, Luzerne and the Lehigh Valley, Street said he has not seen such evidence.

He noted that in Centre - the Penn State county - Democrats added a second state representative in Paul Takac, and that Northampton County is now as Democratically-controlled as its bluer-counterpart, Lehigh.

However, Street said that shift may not be because there are more Democrats in those areas, but because the Republicans have departed from their longtime moderation.

He contrasted Trump-type politicians with past Republicans who have performed well statewide, like Sen. Arlen Specter and Gov. Tom Ridge.

Pennsylvanians of both stripes also largely supported moderate Democratic Govs. Ed Rendell and Robert Casey - the incumbent U.S. senator's father, he said.

""Our Republicans and Democrats statewide have never been that far apart from each other. Democrats are still pretty much where we always were,"" Street said.

Fox News Digital also reached out to the Harris campaign for an interview."

Funeral home horror stories have cropped up across the country in an industry riddled with mishaps.

For forty years until this May, Colorado's funeral directors did not need licenses to operate, and they faced minimal oversight. A litany of horror stories that emerged from the state were ""bound to happen,"" Bill Booker, owner of Roller Funeral Homes and member of the Arkansas State Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors told Fox News Digital.

But even in states with tighter regulations, cases of frightful mix-ups and mismanagement crop up, traumatizing already-grieving families and sparking public outrage.

""I would assure the public that plenty of safeguards are in place, and these instances couldn't go on for very long outside the situation that was in Colorado,"" Booker said. I ""I think most funeral professionals consider themselves to have a sacred trust between their clients and themselves and really aspire to be in this profession.""

Regardless, when funeral home mismanagement makes the news, those in the profession are shaken.

""A lot of the work in the funeral profession is done when no one else is present -- no one but the funeral director and the deceased,"" Booker said. ""People need to have the proper education but also the proper heart to serve the public at such a tender time.""

1. Hundreds of bodies left to rot by Colorado funeral directors who misused COVID relief funds on vacations, lavish lifestyle

In April, nearly 200 decaying, maggot-infested bodies were found abandoned in a building by Colorado Springs' Back to Nature Funeral Home owners John and Carie Hallford, Fox News Digital previously reported.

The couple were charged with five counts of abuse of a corpse, five counts of theft, four counts of money laundering and over 50 counts of forgery.

Instead of their deceased relatives' ashes, the Hallfords allegedly presented families with dry concrete and buried the wrong body on two occasions. In total, they collected $130,000 from bereaved families for cremation and burial services that they never followed through with. In court, an FBI agent testified that the money was enough to cover cremation costs for all the abandoned bodies twice over.

MOURNING LOVED ONES TARGETED BY 'DESPICABLE' FUNERAL HOME SCAM

Based on text messages exchanged by the couple, the accumulation of bodies began four years before the grisly discovery. In their messages, the couple had discussed dumping the bodies into a hole, then treating them with lye or setting them on fire.

A later indictment claimed that the Hallfords also used $882,300 in COVID pandemic relief funds to buy cars, dinners, cryptocurrency, their child's tuition and a slew of vacations.

""In Colorado, it was just a matter of time that someone who was not regulated, not licensed, with no governmental oversight, they eventually lose their sense of right and wrong, and the results are just horrifying,"" Booker told Fox News Digital.

The Hallfords were ordered to pay out more than $1 million to the families of the deceased in August, CNN reported.

2. Former Colorado funeral director arrested for hoarding cremated remains, woman's body in hearse for two years

Two years after his mortuary business closed, a funeral director was found with the cremated remains of up to 30 people in his rented home this February.

Police made the sickening discovery during a court-ordered eviction of 33-year-old Miles Harford from his Denver home on February 6, Fox News Digital previously reported.

Harford also kept the remains of a deceased woman inside a hearse for two years. He acknowledged to police that he owed money to several crematories in the area and that none would cremate the woman's body, so he decided to store it in the hearse, the Colorado Sun reported.

His business, Apollo Funeral and Cremation Services, had been closed since September 2022.

Booker said that ""greed"" or ""the lack of a moral compass"" could have motivated Harford.

""Maybe [he didn't] intend to make a pattern of this. But when you go down that road once, and no one detects it, you can do it again and again,"" Booker said.

A warrant issued for Harford's arrest at the time listed potential charges of abuse of a corpse, forgery of the death certificate, and theft of the money paid for cremation.

3. Long Island sisters sue funeral home for $60 million after wrong man buried in their father's plot, wearing his favorite t-shirt

Stacy Holzman and Megan Zaner claim that a South Carolina funeral home mistakenly sent the wrong person's remains to New York for burial when their father died out of state, and that New York funeral directors insisted it was the correct body even though the women didn't recognize the man in the casket.

The Long Island sisters sued Fletcher Funeral Home and Cremation Service in Fountain Inn, S.C., and Star of David Memorial Chapels in West Babylon, New York, for $60 million in damages after the interment imbroglio last February.

The women suspected that something was awry when they asked for a final look at their dad. Although the man was wearing his favorite Led Zepplin shirt, his face didn't look quite right.

STACKS OF BODIES, FLUIDS AND FLIES FOUND AT COLORADO FUNERAL HOME, FBI AGENT SAYS

""Where is his facial hair?"" Stacy Holzman asked the funeral home, according to CBS News. ""The funeral director said it's standard practice that we shave everybody.""

The man also had an autopsy scar on his forehead, but the women had asked that their father be buried according to Jewish tradition, which does not allow for autopsies.

""Again, the funeral director is dismissing it, saying, 'Oh, it's standard for if somebody passes in a hospital,' and I'm like, 'No, this isn't right, I don't recognize him,'"" Holzman told the outlet.

Weeks later, the South Carolina funeral home confirmed the women's suspicions. In the lawsuit, they claim that his body had been left ""abandoned"" inside the morgue ""without dignity or respect."" The bereaved daughters buried their father later without his favorite clothing.

The Star of David said in a statement that the family ""confirmed the identification of the deceased at the cemetery"" before the burial, Fox News Digital previously reported. Star of David said it ""took swift and decisive action to contact the family and offer whatever services needed to lessen their grief"" after Fletcher notified them of the mistake.

""We deeply regret any sorrow experienced by the family for the mistake made by the funeral home in South Carolina,"" the Star of David said, adding that ""families are under a great deal of stress when they identify their deceased.""

Booker said that he had ""never seen"" a body mix-up during his 44 years in the funeral profession.

""I don't know what all the background information is, but I would like to hope that the people who pass away went through an extended illness and maybe don't look like themselves as often,"" he said. ""A mistake could happen in the healthcare setting where the wrong identification is put on the deceased person . . . two people passed away at approximately the same time, there's a missed identification between the deceased, and you have two funeral homes that are impacted by that.""

4. New Jersey funeral home nearly buries woman 20 years younger in place of 93-year-old woman

The family of Kyung Ja Kim, who died on November 10, 2021, sought a $50 million settlement from two funeral homes, a funeral director and a mortician after the wrong woman was almost buried in their mother's stead.

Kummi Kim, the woman's daughter, told NorthJersey.com that their family thought that embalming technology had gotten so good that it made their deceased mother look much younger.

Kyung Ja Kim wore dentures, and the other woman's body had a full set of teeth, the family's attorney told the outlet. The dentures were later found under the casket pillow.

Mourning family members, many who had traveled from Korea, began to throw shovelfuls of dirt onto the woman's casket during burial. The family realized that something was amiss when funeral director Haemin Gina Chong tried to hurry mourners away.

Chong allegedly showed Kummi Kim a photo of the 93-year-old, asking whether it was her mother. When Kummi Kim replied in the affirmative, Chong allegedly directed the cemetery to lift the casket out of the grave and bring it back to the funeral home, leaving friends and family flabbergasted.

5. Texas funeral home sued for allegedly letting body ""literally rot"" during Winter Storm Uri in 2021

Julietta Guerra sued Integrity Funeral Home in south Houston last February, claiming that her son, Edward Silva, had not been embalmed for four days.

Fox News Digital previously reported that Silva had died unexpectedly on February 9, 2021. According to Guerra's lawsuit, funeral home director Hilda Rojas assured the woman that her son would be embalmed by Feb. 12 and that ""they would make him look like he was real.""

Guerra was allegedly told that her son's body wasn't ready yet on February 12, then again when she called the next day.

On February 14, Winter Storm Uri hit Houston. Guerra and her husband drove to the funeral home when they were unable to reach them by phone. The door was locked, and the mourning parents noticed that there weren't any generators as they drove around they building.

Guerra arrived at the funeral home on Feb. 22 with a beautician to do Silva's hair and makeup. The lawsuit said he was ""severely decomposed"" and smelled so strongly that the beautician told Guerra's sister to not let her see her son. The funeral home director allegedly did not say anything to any family member beforehand about the state of the body.

The funeral suit that the family had brought for Silva also would not fit because of ""extreme post-mortem swelling,"" according to the lawsuit. The clothing ultimately had to be cut open and draped over his body for him to be able to wear it.

The family was forced to hold a closed-casket funeral, with many of more than 100 mourners ""retching"" at the smell.

""No family should have to endure the desecration of their loved one's body like the Guerra family did,"" family attorney Omar Khawaja said. ""We intend to hold Integrity Funeral Home at Forest Lawn Cemetery accountable for their egregious conduct."""
California mafia member on death row fatally beaten by other inmates in prison,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-mafia-member-death-row-fatally-beaten-other-inmates-prison,2024-09-29T04:39:29Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

A death row inmate was beaten to death by three other inmates at a prison in Southern California, according to officials.

Alberto Martinez was killed in the Calipatria State Prison in Imperial County on Thursday, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a news release. His death is being investigated as a homicide.

Another inmate, Tyler A. Lua, was observed by prison staff striking Martinez and knocking him to the ground before he continued to hit him. Lue eventually stepped away from Martinez, but two other inmates -- Jorge D. Negrete-Larios and Luis J. Beltran -- began striking Martinez as he laid motionless on the ground.

Staff then stopped the beating using pepper spray and a baton strike. Two incarcerated-manufactured weapons were found at the scene.

Martinez sustained injuries consistent with an incarcerated-manufactured weapon. No staff or other inmates were injured.

Emergency responders were called to the scene and medical staff performed life-saving measures on Martinez. He was transported to the prison's treatment area and was pronounced dead at 2:20 p.m.

Movement has been limited in the yard where the alleged attack happened.

Lua, Negrete-Larios and Beltran were moved to restricted housing pending an investigation into the incident.

Martinez, 46, was most recently received from Orange County on Aug. 17, 2010, and placed on condemned status for first-degree murder. He was also sentenced to life with the possibility of parole for attempted first-degree murder with an enhancement for street gang activity and two years for street gang activity, a sentence that was to be served concurrently with the condemned sentence.

He acted as the getaway driver in a botched plot to kidnap and murder a businessman, according to the Orange County Register. The plot was reportedly orchestrated by the businessman's sister.

According to the Los Angeles Times, Martinez was a powerful member of a Mexican mafia who orchestrated murders while on death row and communicated with a woman from Mexico using a cellphone he was prohibited from having.

There are a total of 623 inmates with condemned sentences in California prisons, according to the state's Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

In 2019, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed an executive order that instituted a moratorium on the death penalty in the Golden State. The order also called for the repeal of the state's lethal injection protocol and the immediate closing of the state's execution chamber at San Quentin State Prison.

The last execution in California was carried out in 2006."
'Love Next Door': 12 Things You May Have Missed In Episodes 5-8,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/reginakim/2024/09/28/love-next-door-12-things-you-may-have-missed-in-episodes-5-8/,2024-09-29T02:45:39Z,"The hit K-drama Love Next Door is filled with numerous Korean historical and cultural references as well as clever wordplay that might puzzle many viewers, but apparently that hasn't prevented the show from enjoying ongoing popularity among international audiences. The series continues to be one of the most watched shows on Netflix, currently ranking No. 2 on the streamer's weekly Global Top 10 list of non-English shows (it's worth noting that the top spot is occupied by another Korean show, the reality cooking competition Culinary Class Wars).

Below I've attempted to provide some additional context around some of the cultural references found in Episodes 5-8. (To be honest, I wasn't sure whether to write such explainers for the entire series since it's difficult and time-consuming to put together a piece like this -- which includes trying to pull half-decent screenshots where the actors aren't caught in an awkward frame. But due to the overwhelming response I received on my previous article on Episodes 1-4, I'll upload similar pieces for the rest of the series, though it might take a while.)

Of course, the explanations below will only do so much, as part of the show's humor and overall appeal lies in the way the characters verbally interact with each other -- e.g., their intonation, the way that Seok-ryu and Seung-hyo play off each other when they engage in witty banter -- these are all things that cannot be easily conveyed via subtitles. Jung So-min, for example, is particularly brilliant in delivering her lines as Seok-ryu. Oftentimes how she says something is just as important as what she says, but subtitles obviously won't be able to capture many of these nuances.

Love Next Door has also been praised for its ingenious wordplay sprinkled in throughout the series -- much of which inevitably gets lost in translation, unfortunately -- but international audiences can get a glimpse of this by closely paying attention to how the episode titles change at the end of every episode to reflect the evolution the main characters have undergone. I didn't explain these transitions previously because I assumed viewers would figure them out based on the animations and subtitles, but I'm including an example below just in case:

At the end of Episode 2, the Korean word for ""hate"" (미움, pronounced like ""mee-oom"") is traced against the night sky like a constellation. Then a couple of lines in the word are re-traced to spell out the word 마음 (pronounced like ""mah-eum""), which in this case means ""having feelings for someone."" So with a simple stroke of animation, the scene can be interpreted to mean ""hate turns to love"" (note that the Korean letters in the second image also somewhat resemble holding hands).

Anyway, without further ado, here's a list of 12 things that viewers might have missed while watching Episodes 5-8 of Love Next Door.

1. Many viewers have asked why Seok-ryu often addresses Seung-hyo as ""Choi-sseung"" (최씅) instead of by his first name. According to Seolran Won, a PR manager at Studio Dragon (which co-produced the show), ""Choi-sseung"" is simply a nickname that Seok-ryu uses for Seung-hyo, and the show's writer Shin Ha-eun didn't intend for it to have any particular meaning.

That said, many young kids in South Korea don't address kids of the opposite gender by their first name because it can feel a bit embarrassing to do so at that age, Won points out. (For instance, if a girl in elementary or middle school calls a male classmate by his first name, other kids around them might think the two are very close and perhaps even like each other.) Instead, a young girl will often call a boy by his full name or a nickname (and vice versa).

In Seok-ryu's case, it's likely that the nickname she used for Seung-hyo just kind of stuck.

2. While at Namsan Tower, Seung-hyo and Seok-ryu hear the news that Atelier In has been commissioned to build Greip's new flagship store. Seok-ryu decides to cook a meal to celebrate, so they buy groceries. Seung-hyo asks why they didn't just eat pork cutlets in Namsan.

The area around Namsan Tower in Seoul is known for having tons of restaurants selling donkatsu (돈가스 or 돈까스), or Japanese-style fried pork cutlet. Donkatsu eateries began cropping up in Namsan, especially along Sopa-ro Road, in the 1990s when the hearty dish became popular among taxi drivers shuttling passengers to and from the area.

Both tourists and locals flocked to Namsan last year to eat donkatsu after watching Disney+'s hit K-drama Moving, which featured the item in over half of its episodes.

3. Many K-drama fans will have noticed this as a cute reference to the 2018 romantic K-drama Something in the Rain, which Jung Hae-in himself starred in alongside actress Son Ye-jin. The Korean title for that show is <밥 잘 사주는 예쁜 누나>, which translates to ""Pretty Noona Who Buys Me Food"" (""noona"" is a term Korean men use to refer to an older sister or a woman who's older than them). Here Seok-ryu puts her own clever spin on the title by saying, ""I'll show you a pretty noona who cooks you food,"" to which Seung-hyo responds by saying, ""Don't mess with Son Ye-jin"" (Son played the ""pretty noona"" in Something in the Rain).

4. The word 출가 (pronounced ""chool-ga""), which Mo-eum's mother Jae-sook has written on her ""prayer tile,"" has multiple definitions. For example, it can refer to the act of renouncing the material world (i.e., ""moving out"" of secular society) to become a Buddhist monk, or it can signify a woman getting married (i.e., moving out of one's home to live with one's husband). At first Jae-sook's friend In-sook mistakenly believes Jae-sook wants her daughter to become a monk, when Jae-sook clearly meant the latter.

5. Seung-hyo's ex-girlfriend Jang Tae-hui (Seo Ji-hye) is an artisan who specializes in onggi. Onggi (옹기) is an umbrella term for earthenware pottery used in Korea. Some types of onggi, including dok (독) and hang-ari (항아리), are used for fermenting and storing foods like kimchi (김치); doenjang (된장, pronounced kind of like ""dwen-jahng""), Korean soybean paste that's similar to Japanese miso; gochujang (고추장), or red pepper paste; and soy sauce (간장 - ""gahn-jang""). The porous nature of the earthenware material allows air to pass through freely, enabling the contents to ripen without spoiling.

6. When Tae-hui suddenly shows up at Seung-hyo's office, one of his employees, Na-yun (played by Shim So-young), sarcastically asks Seok-ryu if Seung-hyo and Tae-hui are filming Architecture 101. Architecture 101 is a 2012 romantic film starring many familiar names like Uhm Tae-woong, Han Ga-in, Lee Je-hoon, Bae Suzy, Jo Jung-suk and Yoo Yeon-seok. In the movie, Uhm plays an architect named Seung-min who suddenly receives a commission from his former college classmate and first love Seo-yeon (played by Han) to redesign her family home. As the two spend more time together, they begin rekindling their feelings for each other, which upsets Seung-min's fiancée.

Seems like Na-yun picked the perfect movie analogy here.

Architecture 101 enjoyed unexpected box office success and catapulted both Jo Jung-suk and Bae Suzy to cinema superstardom. It was Suzy's big screen debut and earned her the nickname ""the nation's first love."" Prior to the movie, Jo Jung-suk was primarily a musical actor, but after winning a number of awards for his role as Seung-min's best friend during college, Jo began appearing in a number of films and K-dramas.

7. Seok-ryu and Seung-hyo visit Tae-hui's pottery studio, where Tae-hui also makes Korean condiments with the help of her neighbors. Seok-ryu spots piles of meju (메주), or dried blocks of crushed soybeans that are used to make sauces and pastes like doenjang, gochujang, soy sauce and more. Bricks of meju are made by washing, boiling and crushing soybeans and then pressing them into rectangular cubes, which are then left to air-dry and ferment. The meju slabs are put inside onggi jars like dok and hang-ari and further fermented in salt water. The liquid mixture arising from the fermentation process becomes soy sauce, while the solid part is used to make pastes like doenjang.

Due to the difficult and time-consuming nature of the process (the condiments usually take around six months to make!) and the very strong odor emitted by meju, most Koreans nowadays just buy these sauces and pastes from their local supermarkets.

8. At the end of Episode 5, the subtitles say, ""GO BACK TO YOU."" However, the Korean words shown on screen -- 고백 (""goh-baek"") -- sound similar to ""go back"" but actually mean ""confession"" -- as in, Seung-hyo confessing that he has feelings for Seok-ryu.

9. In this scene Mo-eum's mother Jae-sook is shown hanging a poster of Lee Chan-won in her office, much to the excitement of her friends Mi-sook and In-sook. Seung-hyo's mother Hye-sook, however, doesn't know who he is because she has spent much of her time overseas.

Lee Chan-won is a famous trot singer and TV personality in Korea who shot to fame after appearing on the popular televised singing competition Mr. Trot in 2020, where he finished in third place. He captivated the nation with his rendition of the Korean trot song ""진또배기"" (jin-tto-baegi) and even came to be nicknamed ""찬또배기"" (chan-tto-baegi), a combination of his name and the song's title.

For those who are curious, jin-tto-baegi is apparently a word used in Korea's Gangwon Province to refer to a type of sotdae (솟대), a wooden pole erected at an entrance to a village to chase away evil spirits and bring a good harvest, according to Korean folk traditions. A jin-tto-baegi has three wooden geese sitting on top of the pole that are believed to ward off disasters caused by water, fire and wind.

10. In cooking class Seok-ryu learns to make jijim nureumjeok (지짐누름적), a type of dish made by skewering together slices of seasoned meat, shiitake mushrooms, carrots, balloon flower root and/or other vegetables and coating them in flour and egg before frying them in a griddle or frying pan. The skewers are removed before serving.

(Note: I didn't think there were any scenes from Episode 7 that needed additional context, but if there's anything you'd like explained from that episode, please feel free to let me know by leaving a comment on this article or reaching out to me on social media, and I might add it to this article later.)

11. In this scene Seok-ryu returns Seung-hyo's tie, saying she has removed all the blood stains (he had previously used it to stop her nosebleed). He responds by saying that he wishes the blood hadn't come out. Seok-ryu then asks if he wishes his tie were ruined so that he could tell her to compensate him by buying him a more expensive one. Seung-hyo jokingly replies it's so that he can be buried while wearing the blood-stained tie, and -- according to the English subtitles -- adds, ""It would've looked pretty nice."" Here he's alluding to the 1979 film Sonagi, or The Shower, which is based on a famous Korean short story of the same name by Hwang Sun-won. What Seung-hyo says here in Korean could be loosely interpreted as, ""That would be a pretty clever idea.""

Seok-ryu instantly recognizes the movie reference and responds by saying, ""You crazy guy! Are you filming Sonagi or what?"" (Though the English subtitles say, ""Are you insane? Do you think you're in some melodrama or something?"")

The plot of Sonagi centers on a boy and a girl who become fast friends and develop feelings for each other. One day they get caught in the rain while playing outside, and the girl becomes ill. She later shows him the dress she wore that rainy day, telling him it got stained while they were crossing a stream together. The girl never recovers from her illness, and one day the boy overhears his father saying that the girl has died. He hears his father tell his mother, ""The girl was a very clever child. Before she died, she asked to be buried in the same clothes she was wearing [that day it rained].""

Sonagi -- especially its rain scene -- has served as a source of inspiration for various Korean films and K-dramas over the years. The iconic romcom flick My Sassy Girl, directed by Kwak Jae-yong, features a hilarious parody of Sonagi:

The rain scenes in The Classic, another famous romantic film that's also directed by Kwak, are also thought to have been inspired by Sonagi:

The Classic's rain scene with Son Ye-jin and Zo In-sung, in turn, inspired the below scene from the popular K-drama What's Wrong With Secretary Kim:

12. Some of the show's funniest scenes involve Seung-hyo's father Gyeong-jong and Seok-ryu's father Geun-sik getting drunk. Gyeong-jong repeats the Korean word for lily-of-the-valley (은방울, pronounced like ""eun-bahng-ool"") over and over again, and Geun-sik mistakenly believes he's referring to the famous singing duo Eunbangul Sisters (은방울 자매), aka the Silver Bell Sisters. (Note that the Korean term for lily-of-the-valley literally means ""silver bells"" because of the flowers' appearance.) Geun-sik then starts singing ""Mapo Terminal,"" one of the best-known songs by the Eunbangul Sisters."
Dozens of 'exceptionally well-preserved' Viking skeletons unearthed in Denmark: 'Truly Unusual',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/dozens-exceptionally-well-preserved-viking-skeletons-unearthed-denmark-truly-unusual,2024-09-29T02:21:59Z,"Fifty skeletons from the 9th and 10th centuries were found during an excavation in Åsum, Denmark, west of Copenhagen, according to the Museum of Odense. (Credit: Reuters)

Fifty ""exceptionally well-preserved"" Viking skeletons have been unearthed in Denmark by archaeologists from the Museum Odense, west of Copenhagen, along with five cremated graves.

""It is truly unusual to find so many well-preserved skeletons at once, like those discovered in Åsum,"" museum curator Michael Borre Lundø said in a statement. ""This discovery offers extraordinary opportunities to perform a wide range of scientific analyses, which can reveal more about the general health, diet, and origins of those buried. The analyses might even reveal whether the buried vikings were related, which would be particularly significant, as this has never been examined in similar graves.""

The skeletons were found in the Danish village of Åsum not far from Odense, Denmark, over the past six months and were buried with artifacts from outside the country, proving that they traveled internationally for trade, according to the museum.

""The graves in Åsum are so well-preserved that it may be possible, for the first time, to conduct special aDNA analyses on most of the skeletons -- meaning DNA analyses on ancient material,"" Sarah Croix, associate professor and PhD from the Department of Archaeology and Heritage Studies at Aarhus University, said in a statement. ""It will be incredibly exciting to learn where these people came from and whether the same families were buried here across multiple generations.""

High water levels and good soil conditions kept the skeletons from decomposing, Lundø said.

1,000-YEAR-OLD VIKING TREASURE FOUND HIDDEN IN DIRT: 'UNIQUE FIND'

""Normally when we excavate Viking graves, we'd be lucky if there were two teeth left in the grave besides the grave goods,"" he explained, ""but here we have the skeletons fully preserved. The skeletons are so amazing. They are so well preserved. There are five fingers, five toes. And that opens up a whole new set of possibilities for discoveries.""

Some of the skeletons were buried with items such as knives, brooches, glass pearls and even a wagon.

""The woman was buried in the wagon she likely traveled in,"" Lundø said. ""We must imagine that she was buried with her finest clothes and belongings. She was given a beautiful glass bead necklace, an iron key, a knife with a silver-threaded handle, and, most notably, a small shard of glass that may have served as an amulet. At the foot of the wagon, there was a finely decorated wooden chest, the contents of which we still do not know.""

Another grave next to the woman's contained a bronze three-lobed brooch, a red glass, an iron knife, and a small piece of rock crystal, which Lundø noted isn't natural to Denmark. He said it was likely imported from Norway.

""Several items from the many graves in Åsum indicate that the buried Vikings were connected to international trade networks that developed during the Viking Age,"" he said.

The excavation took place in preparation for renovating an electrical grid.

While those graves were for high status individuals, the majority of skeletons belonged to a community of farmers, the museum said.

"Nantucket parents fear for children amid spike in migrant crime: 'As a father, it truly scares me'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/nantucket-dad-fears-children-amid-spike-migrant-crime-as-father-truly-scares-me,2024-09-28T23:29:21Z,"NANTUCKET, Mass. - Local parents fear for their kids' safety after federal agents nabbed five illegal immigrants, including a member of the notorious gang MS-13, for alleged crimes that include sexual assault of children on this picturesque island.

Erik Evans, who has lived on the Massachusetts island off Cape Cod for 31 years and has an 8-year-old daughter, told Fox News Digital the arrests earlier this month by Immigration and Customs Enforcement underscore how the town has changed in recent years.

The surging migrant population that largely serves the summer crowd remains when the weather turns cold, and a handful have allegedly committed crimes rarely seen here.

WEALTHY, LIBERAL NANTUCKET, MARTHA'S VINEYARD SEE 6 ICE ARRESTS IN ONE MONTH, INCLUDING MS-13 GANG MEMBER

""How are these past five people that have gotten arrested that are rapists and [violent criminals] working here and walking through our grocery store and passing by us at the gas station? It just ... it's not what Nantucket once was,"" Evans said.

""I'm very happy that ICE was here and was able to do their job and get rid of at least some of the bad people that are on the island. There's obviously many, many more. And, as a community, it scares me. As a father, it truly scares me, and I would like to see more being done.""

Evans, a construction worker, said the island's wealthy seasonal residents who want ""everything done yesterday"" have attracted an influx of illegal migrants.

Tommy Hilfiger, former Secretary of State John Kerry, actor Ben Stiller and actress Kathie Lee Gifford are among the rich and powerful who own homes on the idyllic island with a population of about 14,000.

""They can cut wood or they can bang nails,"" Evans said. ""And, you know, I wonder who's hiring these people. Do they do background checks on them?""

On Sept. 10, 28-year-old Salvadoran migrant Bryan Daniel Aldana-Arevalo was charged with one count of child rape with a 10-year age difference and two counts of indecent assault and battery on a child under 14.

ERO Boston Field Office Director Todd Lyons said Aldana-Arevalo ""represents a significant danger to the children of our Massachusetts communities"" in a press release at the time of his arrest. His alleged victim was just 12 years old, the Nantucket Current reported.

That day, Aldana-Arevalo and Elmer Sola, another Salvadoran migrant charged with 11 counts of sex crimes against a child, which Lyons said took place in Nantucket, were quietly taken to the mainland in handcuffs via ferry.

Sola was arraigned, charged and released with an ankle monitor Aug. 14 on the condition he stay away from the victim and the victim's family, according to the Nantucket Current. But, nine days later, he returned to court after allegedly violating the pretrial conditions of his release.

AOC'S 'RED LIGHT' DISTRICT OVERRUN WITH PROSTITUTES AS LOCALS CALL OUT MIA 'SQUAD' MEMBER

On Sept. 11, agents returned to the iconic vacation site to arrest illegal Brazilian migrant Geon do Amaral Belafronte and Guatemalan illegal immigrant Felix Alberto Perez-Gomez. Both had committed sex crimes against Nantucket residents, Lyons said.

Belafronte entered the U.S. lawfully in 2018 but left of his own volition after the alleged assault took place in 2021. He reentered the country illegally and was picked up on an arrest warrant in March. After his arraignment, Nantucket District Court released him on $500 cash bail or a $5,000 surety bond, according to court records and Boston ERO.

According to a police report reviewed by the Nantucket Current, Belafronte pinned his alleged victim to the ground with her hands over her head and said ""I will rape you"" as he licked her lips with his tongue while she kept her mouth closed.

Reputed MS-13 gang member Angel Gabriel Deras-Mejia of El Salvador was taken into custody by the agency on the island Sept. 12. Lyon said Deras-Mejia ""represent[ed] a significant threat to the residents of Nantucket.""

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT, MURDER CONVICTIONS ROAMING US STREETS: ICE DATA

Deras-Mejia was arrested at the Discovery Playground on Old South Road in July. Nantucket Police wrote that he was ""drunk and cursing, flaring his arms, yelling loudly and distracting all civilians who were at the scene"" and left children at the scene crying. Allegedly, he and the mother of his child were arguing about who would take their child home, according to the Nantucket Current. In August, he was arrested again for assault and battery on a household member.

Another Nantucket father, who asked not to be named, noted that one of the gang member's arrests took place right beside his daughter's preschool.

""It's a little scary, knowing there are people like that living here,"" the father said outside The Muse, a watering hole frequented by locals. ""The reaction from some people is that '[Immigrants here] are scared [after the ICE arrests].' Well, I have kids, and I think it's scary these people are living here.""

A 39-year-old woman who has lived in Nantucket since she was 4 years old and has a daughter enrolled at Nantucket Intermediate School, told Fox News Digital the particulars of the illegal migrants' crimes - and the reactions of her neighbors and friends to the ICE raid -- were disquieting.

""On Facebook, the [local newspaper] is covering it a lot. They'll post it, and nobody will say anything,"" she said. ""I feel like people are scared to say, you know, like, 'Good for [ICE]. Glad this is happening.' You know, it's crickets.""

""Of course I do,"" Evans said when asked whether he had had concerns about his child's safety in the community after the arrests.

""My daughter goes to school, and after school, she goes over to the Boys and Girls Club. But, I mean, they walk there. ... And the number of kids, there's never enough chaperones or people that can really keep an eye on all of these kids,"" he said.

Evans told Fox News Digital there are ""Ring doorbell cameras everywhere"" these days on Nantucket and that a number of ""big-time alarm system companies"" have cropped up on the island in recent years.

""Our local paper comes out every Thursday. And the crime report ... is dramatically much larger in the past few years than what it used to be,"" he said. ""There's always at least 15 to 20 different people that are in the court report, and those episodes stem anywhere from a lot of drunk driving, OUI arrests, [and] many home invasions. Domestic abuse drugs.

""Obviously, you know, we're not really sure where there is a safe place anymore.""

Before this month, immigration officials had not come to the island to carry out arrests since 2017, Boston ERO told Fox News Digital.

""I never foresaw what we have now,"" Evans said. ""And it's only going to get worse before it gets better."""
Bethenny Frankel Goes Biodynamic With Her New Wine Brand,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanettehurt/2024/09/28/bethenny-frankel-goes-biodynamic-with-her-new-wine-brand/,2024-09-28T23:01:06Z,"This original Real Housewife of New York City and Skinny Girl now owns a French biodynamic rosé and Sauvignon Brand, Forever Young

Bethenny Frankel's entrepreneurial pursuits have evolved from her passions, and she's now a biodynamic wine brand owner.

Frankel, who initially gained fame as one of the original cast of The Real Housewives of New York City and then became an entrepreneur with such brands as Skinny Girl cocktails and wine, has dived deep into the world of biodynamic wines with the release of her first French rosé, Forever Young.

""The wine is amazing, and it's made by a woman-owned chateau,"" Frankel says. ""It's absolutely delicious.""

Forever Young's first debut was a Rosé from Côtes de Provence made by the Chateau Robine.

Her focus on biodynamic wines grew from her own interests. ""It's more natural, and it's healthier,"" she says. ""There are some wines, even organic wines, and there can be a lot of crap in it, and you don't feel good the next day. There's a drastic difference in quality.""

Frankel says she chose rosé because that's what she drinks. ""I know red wine is more respected, but I don't drink red wine,"" she says. ""It feels like you're drinking syrup, and this is my brand. I only work with what I'm passionate about.""

Her next wine is a cru classé rosé. ""The cru classé is a type of wine that you can't make as much of, and it is only made about about 18 wineries in the world,"" Frankel says. ""It's a more elite type of rosé.""

Frankel's Forever Young brand is also adding a Sauvignon Blanc from Pay d'Oc, which is also made by the Château Robine, too.

While Frankel is currently promoting the two rosé wines, her Sauvignon Blanc should be rolled out soon after. ""It has a green floral background instead of the pink, and it's amazing,"" Frankel says. ""It doesn't yet have the distribution of the rosé, as we're still focused on expanding its distribution, and then we will add the Sauvignon Blanc.""

Frankel says she chose to focus on the wines that she personally enjoys. ""I do love Sauvignon Blanc, but the rosé is so feminine, and it's become a year-round wine,"" she says. ""There are really a lot of well marketed rosés. They're really bougie and branded, and they're good, but they're not as good as Forever Young. You can put it side by side, and it's phenomenal.""

Besides promoting her new wine brand, Frankel is also promoting her non-alcoholic cocktail line, Mingle.

""It happened very organically,"" Frankel says. ""About a year ago or so, I was in my kitchen with my assistant, and we were tasting Mingle, and my assistant was like 'Wait a second, this tastes like the real thing."" I thought so too, and we were freaking out.""

Frankel promoted Mingle online, and then they reached out to her, and she's now owns a piece of that business, too. ""It's immediate,"" she says, of businesses and products she likes. ""You just know you really like it, it hits you, and you go.""

With Mingle, Frankel says she's most excited that it tastes differently than anything else out there. ""It doesn't tase like soda, it tastes like it's own, different thing the way kombucha tastes like its own thing,"" she says. ""It's great for people who are sober curious, and it's kind of choose your own adventure in terms of flavors."""
38 Must-Read Greek Mythology Books And Stories,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/entertainment/article/greek-mythology-books/,2024-09-28T19:01:17Z,"When people hear ""myth"" or ""mythology,"" they often think of fictional stories, but for early Greek poets, myths were more than fiction -- they were an art form, embedding truths about life, the gods and the world.

Greek mythology, born in the oral traditions of the late Bronze Age, gradually found its way into written texts that became foundational in classical literature. These stories, rich with gods, heroes and monsters, have been integral to Mediterranean cultural history.

For centuries, these myths have intrigued generations, shaping their views on human nature and the impact of war, the gods and cause and effect. Greek myths cover various issues, including fate, rebellion, heroism, violence, non-conformity and hubris, while addressing everyday concerns like the weather and human emotions. This duality contributes to its timelessness, making it a cornerstone of Western literature, art and culture.

With origins dating back to around 1200 BCE during the Mycenaean civilization, Greek mythology reached its peak in written form in the 8th century BCE with works like Homer's epic poems ""Iliad"" and ""The Odyssey.""

Depending on how the stories are presented, Greek myths fall under the literary genres of fantasy, epic poetry and classical literature, and in academic settings, the impact of Greek mythology has been studied for its effect on tragedy, epics and historical fiction. This list ranks the best Greek mythology books based on their contributions to mythological literary agency, relevance and classic appeal. Some recurring characters in almost every Greek myth are Apollo, Athena, Helen of Troy, Odysseus, Hercules (Heracles) and Medusa, just to name a few. Several famous authors on this list include Magaret Atwood, Natalie Haynes, Edith Hamilton, Madeline Miller, Robert Graves and Homer.

The expansive world of Greek mythology features complex characters and favorites that have become ancient storyline staples. This encyclopedia by the Roman family is an accessible and comprehensive guide for readers who are not accustomed to reading Greek mythology material. The authors of this book analyze the main characters, gods and goddesses that have been the primary subjects of Greek myths and storytelling. This illustrative book also offers a literary reflection on how Greek mythology has evolved vastly since its inception and influenced tribes, cultures and lifestyles globally. This book is not an original Greek myth or retelling per se, but a great companion to important Greek mythology stories and their historical context.

Who should read this? Readers who haven't read much Greek mythology and are curious about its themes and characters without the overwhelmingly academic approach some encyclopedias take.

Ellen Switzer's explanation of Greek myths gives readers an intelligent probe into the stories of the prominent protagonists that have formed the basis of Greek storytelling. Switzer's account provides a holistic baseline for understanding the gods, heroes, creatures and monsters in a way that does more than merely retell their stories. Instead, it explains their motivations, the context within each myth, and the historical and religious roots that informed how these stories were passed down through generations. This book is not an original Greek myth story but a reinterpretation of Greek mythology, focusing on the protagonists who breathed life into its most important stories.

Who should read this? The book combines research and accessible storytelling to appeal to readers interested in classical mythology or Greek culture.

Many authors have retold the classic story of Medusa a few times, so the story has several variations. Jessie Burton's Medusa, however, is a feminist and empathetic retelling of Medusa's transformation from a beautiful maiden to a snake-haired monster. Rather than vilifying Medusa, Burton's work is a vindication of victimized women and an admonishment of broader society to reconsider how it punishes and isolates those who have been mistreated.

Who should read this? Readers fascinated by feminist retellings of mythology and exploring the less-popular perspectives of well-known myths. It's also excellent for those who enjoy stories about justice, victimhood and societal blame.

Robert Graves's The Greek Myths is a creative mythography with a twist on the ancient stories of Greece. In this book, Graves relies on credible sources of ancient literature and his poetic capacity to forensically examine mythology in a compilation that recounts the myths and provides some context for their historical backgrounds. Graves presents the myths as narratives emerging from three ritualistic stages, often viewing them as historical records of struggles between Greek kings and moon-worshiping priestesses. Graves positions the Bronze Age as a society transitioning from matriarchal rule under the Pelasgians to patriarchal control influenced by conquering Greek-speaking tribes. During this transformation, local kings arrived as foreign princes who reigned by marrying the hereditary queen -- a representation of the Triple Goddess -- and were ritually killed after six months.

Who should read this? This book is great for readers interested in understanding the layers of mythology and its connections to historical societal shifts.

Legend has it that Venus and Adonis were likely William Shakespeare's first foray into poetry. The mythically informed narrative poem follows the story of Venus, the goddess of love, and her one-sided affection for Adonis, a handsome young man more interested in hunting than in falling in love. Shakespeare uses eroticism, comedy and tragedy to express the nature of love and observations of the natural world. The poem is written in stanzas of six lines of iambic pentameter with an ABABCC rhyme scheme. Despite launching his career as a poet with this poem, many literary critics are not particularly impressed by it, as it is primarily considered a work of fan fiction rather than of Shakespeare's imagination. By 1640, the poem had been reprinted fifteen times and was frequently quoted in journals, letters and plays of that period.

Who should read this? Readers interested in mythological stories retold with poetic panache.

Alleged sex worker and john exit NYC brothel 24 hours after police raid it: video,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/alleged-sex-worker-john-exit-nyc-brothel-24-hours-after-police-raid-it-video,2024-09-28T18:03:45Z,"An alleged sex worker and her client were seen leaving an NYC brothel, just 24 hours after police raided it.

A long commercial strip in Queens, New York City, has become such a hotbed for open-air prostitution that when police raided a brothel there last week, the same cathouse was open for business again within 24 hours, an astonishing Fox News Digital video shows.

Fox News Digital visited the seedy strip of Roosevelt Avenue in Queens - part of which encompasses Democratic Squad Member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez's district - to report on the law-breaking behavior in the area and was conducting an interview outside the nearby brothel when an alleged sex worker and her client walked out of the building.

The building, a former beauty salon, appears closed due to metal shutter doors covering the storefront, but a makeshift door has been cut out of it. Two CCTV cameras are stationed overhead.

AOC'S 'RED LIGHT' DISTRICT OVERRUN WITH PROSTITUTES AS LOCALS CALL OUT MIA 'SQUAD' MEMBER

The woman, wearing tight gym shorts and a black top, briefly looks at the Fox News Digital camera and then makes a dash towards Roosevelt Avenue with her young client fixing himself and then following closely behind her.

The woman in the video was allegedly later seen soliciting sex along with other women around the corner from the Case Street brothel. The alleged sex workers are understood to pick up clients on the busy street and then take them to the brothel around the corner, which leads into a residential neighborhood.

The NYPD confirmed that three arrests were made during the Sept. 18 raid on the building. It is unclear why it wasn't immediately padlocked.

The Queens District Attorney's Office tells Fox News Digital it is in the process of shutting the brothel down and says it understands that the NYPD is separately seeking a ""parallel nuisance abatement order against the establishment.""

Ramses Frías, a local resident turned activist who was being interviewed as the pair walked out, said he was not surprised that the building was operational again, given that the alleged sex workers advertise their bodies in the open during all hours of the day and night with few repercussions.

""This area has been run rampant with prostitution, especially on this corner,"" Frías said. ""This block itself, it's just been out of control and the lawlessness continues to happen. This [raid] was done yesterday and as you can see, it looks like it's still operational.""

AOC DISTRICT NEIGHBORHOOD LABELED 'THIRD WORLD' AS MIGRANTS CLOG STREETS AND PROSTITUTES OVERRUN EVERY BLOCK

WATCH: NEW YORK CITY STREET LINED WITH ALLEGED PROSTITUTES SOLICITING SEX

Known to locals as the ""Avenue of the Sweethearts,"" residents say the prostitution situation reminds them of the red-light district streets of Bangkok. Additionally, illegal vendors also overrun the sidewalks cooking hot food or selling used clothes ""third world"" conditions.

On one block along Roosevelt Avenue, Fox News Digital cameras recorded a line of no less than 19 alleged sex workers on the sidewalk. Around the corner, there were at least seven more, and a woman on the next block was witnessed soliciting sex for $60.

Frías says that the alleged prostitutes and their pimps continue to flout the law with little repercussions, while many elected leaders do nothing to stop the lawlessness.

Prostitution is illegal in New York.

In January, the NYPD raided six establishments in the area allegedly engaged in prostitution, which were issued closing orders.

The raid was well publicized, with embattled New York City Mayor Eric Adams and local Democratic City Council member Francisco Moya present. However, the Queens District Attorney's Office confirmed that no arrests were made, saying it was strictly carried out to serve court closure orders of nuisance abatement over which the NYPD has jurisdiction.

Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels and a Republican candidate for mayor, slammed it as a ""show raid"" and said there were no arrests.

""They didn't arrest the johns, prostitutes, madams; they never went after the landlords, and they were back in business the next day,"" said Sliwa, who joined Fox News Digital and Frías on a walking tour of the area. ""This would never be tolerated in Manhattan. They tolerate it because it's ... a poor and impoverished area in the eyes of many New Yorkers, but that doesn't give you a reason to allow this to exist."""
"Wife's refusal to learn to cook, says Reddit user, is harming the marriage: 'Loses patience'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/wifes-refusal-learn-cook-reddit-user-harming-marriage-patience,2024-09-28T17:08:15Z,"Ilana Muhlstein, a registered dietitian nutritionist in Los Angeles, talks about what she's eating this season.

A Reddit user who was upset a spouse was refusing to learn to cook or even embrace basic food preparation skills was not wrong for bringing up the issue, said a family therapist as well as other users of the platform.

""AITA for disagreeing with my wife's idea of her never learning how to cook?"" asked a Reddit user by the name of ""Significant_Tree3606"" in a post this week on the ""Am I the a--hole"" (AITA) page.

In the post, the person described a struggling marriage.

WOMAN FEELS AS IF SHE'S TRAPPED IN ENDLESS EPISODE OF 'THE BIGGEST LOSER'

""She believes she does not need to help cook or prepare food or even help clean up after, besides dishes,"" said the poster, even though the spouse is a ""very picky eater.""

This is due in part to the spouse's upbringing, the writer said, which included needing to do ""no chores"" during childhood and having a maid in the household.

""She has never learned to cook and cannot boil water,"" wrote the Reddit poster.

""Despite me walking her through it, she just loses patience,"" the writer also said.

""She lasts about two minutes before either walking away or throwing a tantrum that she doesn't want to learn, and [that] I should be the only [one] in this house who has to know how to cook,"" said the poster.

EASIEST VEGETABLE STIR-FRY RECIPE EVER, SAYS FOUNDER OF LITTLE KITCHEN ACADEMY

This came to a head the other night, the writer said, when -- after a long week at work -- the non-cooking wife complained the couple had not spent enough time together that week.

""She lasts about two minutes before either walking away or throwing a tantrum that she doesn't want to learn.""

""I offered to have her cook with me so she can learn while also spending time together,"" said Significant_Tree3606. ""I thought it would be cute to make a recipe together that we [had] never [eaten] before.""

This did not go over well, the writer said.

""She threw a fit,"" she said. The behavior continued throughout the evening after Significant_Tree3606 asked the spouse to clean a grill rack and put away spices, she said.

""She eventually stopped yelling and complaining and put some stuff away. I gave her [a] plate of food first to enjoy since I still had some cleaning up to do,"" the Reddit user said.

Aside from doing the cooking, the writer described herself as ""the one who does the 'handyman' duties as well as takes care of all the bills and yardwork,"" but noted the spouse ""does the dishes and puts the laundry away.""

The writer's friends sided with her, saying they would not tolerate having a partner who demanded separate meals and refused to help in any meaningful way.

""It's important for them to have an honest conversation.""

""Am I the a--hole for wanting her to learn how to cook and/or at least help in preparing the kitchen?"" she asked others.

A therapist told Fox News Digital it is not wrong to want one's spouse to help in the kitchen, but ""it's surprising that [the couple] didn't address this issue before getting married.""

JEWISH COOKING 'GODMOTHER' RECREATES VIVID FAMILY MEMORIES AND 'SENSE OF BELONGING' THROUGH FOOD

""That said, since they're in this situation now, it's important for them to have an honest conversation about household responsibilities and how they can divide the chores in a way that both feel comfortable with and avoid resentment,"" Rachel Goldberg, LMFT, founder of Rachel Goldberg Therapy in Los Angeles, told Fox News Digital via email.

If the resistant spouse continues to refuse to learn to cook, ""they could come up with alternatives where she takes on other responsibilities to balance things out,"" said Goldberg.

She also said that the Reddit writer needs to acknowledge that the spouse ""clearly doesn't want to cook or learn how to, and trying to change her won't be productive,"" she said. ""Instead, they should focus on finding a compromise that works for both of them.""

Additionally, the writer may want to examine why her spouse has ""such a strong reaction to cooking.""

Said Goldberg, ""If she's throwing tantrums, there may be a deeper issue than simply never learning to cook or having a maid [while] growing up.""

""There may be a deeper issue than simply never learning to cook or having a maid growing up.""

""Understanding what's behind her aversion might provide insight into how she could contribute differently.""

Reddit users largely agreed with the therapist's take on the matter.

10 Must-Read Gabriel Garcia Marquez Books And Short Stories,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/entertainment/article/gabriel-garcia-marquez-books/,2024-09-28T17:07:55Z,"Gabriel García Márquez didn't just write stories -- he created worlds, and his work was soaked in magical realism, so much so that the impossible meshed so convincingly in a way that made even the most skeptical reader believe in magic. Born in Aracataca, Colombia, Márquez's writing has mixed myth and history with tragedy, humor, love and solitude to create literary masterworks. With a Nobel Prize and a celebrated body of work, Márquez remains one of the greatest writers in literature.

The 10 books and short stories in this list are not just core reading material for Márquez' fans -- they are the codes to unlocking the nature of his literary genius. Much of Márquez's work has given readers an unparalleled look into Latin American history and politics. Each piece shows a different facet of his skillful storytelling and the vibrant worlds he creates. The stories on this list are ranked for their literary genius, commercial success and popularity.

Leaf Storm is Márquez's first novella and the forerunner to his magnum opus One Hundred Years of Solitude. Set in the fictional town of Macondo, Leaf Storm follows the story of a family's decision to bury a despised doctor in a town that wants nothing to do with him. The story's plot alternates between the perspectives of three generations, which exposes the web of memory, guilt and obligation that each town within the story swears by. Leaf Storm is a slow burn, but the seeds of Márquez's later masterpieces are all here.

Who should read this? Anyone curious about the origins of Macondo and who appreciates layered, multi-generational, fantasy stories.

In The Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor, Márquez transforms what could be a straightforward survival story into something far more profound. Márquez, who was working as a journalist for El Espectador in 1955 when the events in this story happened, combined journalistic finesse and literary genius to bring this story to life. In the story, he recounts the grueling experience of Luis Alejandro Velasco, a Colombian sailor who drifted alone for 10 days in the unforgiving waters of the Caribbean after being swept overboard during a violent storm. Velasco's survival after floating on a makeshift raft with no food or water for days is gripping on its own, but Márquez uses his uncanny approach to magical realism to elevate the story, peeling the layers back to tell the story with heart without deviating from his signature stylistic tone.

Who should read this? Adventure lovers and those who enjoy stories of grit and resilience against the odds.

Where can you read / rent / buy this book?: Penguin Random House.

Of Love and Other Demons is a tour de force that sees Márquez use history to make the unbelievable appear realistic. The plot is set in 18th-century Colombia and follows the life of 12-year-old Sierva María de Todos Los Ángeles, born to a wealthy family but raised by enslaved Africans. After a rabid dog bites Sierva, she is sent to a convent, where she is suspected of being possessed by evil spirits. Upon her arrival at the convent, Father Cayetano Delaura, a priest, is sent to investigate, but he falls in love with her instead. It's a short, intense novel that wrestles with colonialism, religion and forbidden desire, all wrapped up in Márquez's lush, evocative approach to creating stories.

Who should read this? Readers who enjoy dark, gothic tales tinged with religious themes and forbidden love.

Márquez considered No One Writes to the Colonel his best book, even though his famous works like One Hundred Years of Solitude often overshadow it. Readers have celebrated this body of work for its insight on patience, despair and the hope of its protagonist. This financially strapped retired colonel waits for a pension that never comes. He and his asthmatic wife live in poverty in a small village, surviving on little more than dreams. Despite its quiet and small-scale narrative, the novella packs an emotional punch, and every page hums with tension as the colonel clings to his dignity in the face of a country that has forgotten him.

Who should read this? Readers who enjoy quiet, emotionally vibrant stories that explore poverty, duty, loneliness and duty.

Márquez turns his eye to history in The General in His Labyrinth, honing in on the last days of Simón Bolívar, the iconic political leader who released much of South America from Spanish rule. The story traces Bolívar's final journey in 1830 as he travels down the Magdalena River toward the sea. Along the way, he revisits the places of his victories, all while lamenting the collapse of his vision for a united Latin America. But this isn't only a heroic epic; it's a portrait of a man at the end of his rope, physically and emotionally worn down and plagued by his failures. Márquez portrays Bolívar as a flawed figure who is more human than he is a legend.

In this 12-short-story collection, we see Márquez at his finest. Strange Pilgrims follows Latin American exiles and travelers -- some who mirror Márquez's experience -- often disoriented and out of place in foreign lands. The stories are absurd, touching and darkly humorous, like the one about the Brazilian prostitute in Barcelona who prepares for her death by training her dog to mourn her at the grave she has chosen for herself. All of the stories in this short story collection have an undercurrent of displacement and longing, told with Márquez's usual combination of whimsy and melancholy.

Who should read this? Fans of short stories who appreciate offbeat humor and themes of exile and isolation.

Márquez transforms dictatorship into a fever dream in The Autumn of the Patriarch. The novel follows a nameless, ageless Caribbean despot who clings to power for what seems like centuries, even as his empire crumbles around him. Dense in both language and theme, the narrative mirrors the dictator's decaying mental state through long, winding sentences that trap the reader in the tyrant's own oppressive mindset, despite his power. Márquez's writing reflects the collapse of both the man and his kingdom, making the novel an ultimate exploration of tyranny, power and moral decay. It's a haunting meditation on absolute power and the inevitable rot that comes with it.

Who should read this? Readers who enjoy a challenge and are curious about the psychology of power.

In Chronicle of a Death Foretold, the entire town knows that Santiago Nasar will be murdered by the Vicario twins, yet no one steps in to stop it. This is the unsettling brilliance of the novel and despite the killers being identified from the start, the townspeople remain paralyzed by fate, honor and cultural expectations. Márquez writes the story based on real events and examines the bizarre ways a community can justify its collective inaction. Márquez recasts the town into a pressure cooker where everyone is aware of the impending tragedy but chooses to ignore it, creating a tense, foreboding atmosphere where destiny feels both difficult to escape.

Who should read this? Readers who enjoy tight, suspense-filled stories about murder and open secrets.

Where can you read / rent / buy this book?: Penguin Random House.

Forget everything you thought you knew about romance. Love in the Time of Cholera is not a traditional love story -- it's a raw, complex and messy meditation on love in all its forms. Far from the idealized notion of ideal love, this novel digs into the obsessive, patient and sometimes painful aspects of human connection. At its heart of the story is Florentino Ariza, who waits over fifty years for his chance to reunite with Fermina Daza, the woman he's loved since his youth, but the one who got away and married a wealthy doctor. But this is not a fairy-tale reunion. Instead, Márquez takes us on a foray into the murky waters of passion, loyalty, aging and the endurance of desire.

Who should read this? Hopeless romantics, cynics and anyone fascinated by the messiness of love and human emotion.

There's no getting around this -- One Hundred Years of Solitude is the book that put Márquez on the literary map, and for good reason. In the story, Márquez draws inspiration from the history of his hometown, in coastal Colombia. It shows the rise and fall of the Buendía family over seven generations in the fictional town of Macondo where ghosts linger in the trees, the dead and the living mingle, and time is as fluid as memory. It's a story about everything from power, passion, violence, betrayal and the revolving loop of history. In this book, Márquez creates a world so intricate and so alive that when you close the book, you half expect to find Macondo somewhere on a map. It's the book that has not only inspired a major part of Latin-American but global literature as a whole.

Who should read this? Anyone curious about where magical realism started or anyone who enjoys generational sagas laced with grandeur and despair.

Gabriel García Márquez's works are a masterclass in storytelling and have been renowned for their stylistic impact of magic realism in the world of literature. Whether readers are drawn to epic sagas or intimate stories, his works offer a classic journey into the heart of Latin American life and beyond."
Idaho gov praises Boise State's decision to forfeit women's volleyball match against team with trans player,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/idaho-gov-praises-boise-states-decision-forfeit-womens-volleyball-match-against-team-trans-player,2024-09-28T17:05:51Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Idaho governor Brad Little commended Boise State for forfeiting its match against San Jose State University on Saturday amid controversy surrounding a transgender member of the women's volleyball team.

Boise State Athletics confirmed the decision in a statement on Saturday. The university did not provide an explanation of the forfeiture.

""Boise State volleyball will not play its scheduled match at San José State on Saturday, Sept. 28,"" the statement read. ""Per Mountain West Conference policy, the Conference will record the match as a forfeit and a loss for Boise State. The Broncos will next compete on Oct. 3 against Air Force.""

The republican governor, who recently signed an executive order directing the State Board of Education to ensure the safeguarding of fairness in women's sports, released a statement praising the decision.

""I applaud @BoiseState for working within the spirit of my Executive Order, the Defending Women's Sports Act,"" his post on X read. ""We need to ensure player safety for all of our female athletes and continue the fight for fairness in women's sports.""

Boise State is the second school to opt out of playing against SJSU amid controversy surrounding a member of the women's volleyball team.

Blaire Fleming, a redshirt senior at San Jose State University, plays as an outside and right-side hitter on the women's volleyball team. Fleming, a transgender athlete, has played three seasons at SJSU after previously playing at Coastal Carolina.

BOISE STATE WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL FORFEITS UPCOMING MATCH AGAINST SJSU AMID CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING TRANS PLAYER

Earlier this week, one of Fleming's teammates joined several other female athletes in suing the NCAA for Title IX violations.

According to the criminal complaint, Brooke Slusser claimed that she was not aware that Fleming was transgender despite sharing rooms together on team trips. Slusser also expressed safety concerns for opponents playing against Fleming.

""Brooke estimates that Fleming's spikes were traveling upward of 80 mph, which was faster than she had ever seen a woman hit a volleyball,"" Slusser's complaint said, via the Cowboy State Daily. ""The girls were doing everything they could to dodge Fleming's spikes but still could not fully protect themselves.""

""One thing that's important in this case is really the physical safety issues in volleyball,"" Slusser's attorney, Bill Bock, told OutKick. ""And that's what they're facing in practice every day. So, it's just a crazy, misguided policy that steals athletic dreams from women and gives them to men, and, at the same time, puts women's health and safety in danger.""

Payton McNabb, a former high school volleyball player from North Carolina, has been among the most outspoken about transgender athletes in the sport.

In September 2022, McNabb was injured in a high school volleyball game when a transgender athlete on the opposing team spiked the volleyball and struck her in the face, causing her to fall backward and suffer from a concussion and a neck injury.

She continues to suffer from long-term physical and mental injuries caused by the incident."
Death toll from Hurricane Helene mounts as aftermath assessment begins,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/nx-s1-5132035/death-toll-from-hurricane-helene-mounts-as-aftermath-assessment-begins,2024-09-28T15:56:37Z,"David Hester inspects damages of his house after Hurricane Helene made landfall in Horseshoe Beach, Fla., on Saturday. Chandan Khanna/AFP via Getty Images hide caption

Rescue teams across the southeastern U.S. and southern Appalachia scrambled to respond to the destruction caused by Hurricane Helene, as more than 3 million homes and businesses were without any power Saturday amid a continued threat of floods.

Moody's Analytics said Friday it expects $15 billion to $26 billion in property damage from the hurricane, which by late Friday had been downgraded to a tropical storm.

At least 52 people were killed in five states, including Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, the Associated Press reported. The dead included three firefighters, a mother and her 1-month-old twins and an 89-year-old woman who was struck by a tree that hit her house.

The White House said it had approved emergency declaration requests from the governors of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, giving the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, authorization to provide emergency response assistance. Some 1,500 federal disaster response personnel had also been deployed to the region.

In Florida, beaches along the coast near Tampa remained off limits as rescue and recovery operations continued. NPR member station WUSF reporter Stephanie Colombini spoke to some residents who ignored restrictions. Andrew Swan, who lives in a house near the beach, told Colombini he rode out the storm alone, with waters rising up to his chest.

""I mean everybody is just kind of in shock and just trying to pick up the pieces. I mean nobody really expected it like this,"" Swan said. As the waters rose, Swan said he slept on a kitchen counter with his legs draped over his stove.

In North Carolina, Helene produced unusually heavy winds -- up to 140 mph -- on land, the strongest observed in coastal North Carolina since the start of modern meteorological recordkeeping in the 19th century.

Experts said they were most worried about the flow of debris that was yet to come.

""To me, the biggest concerns around here are debris flows, which are very wet, very fast moving and can travel long distances,"" Brad Johnson, who studies landslides and erosion at Davidson College, told NPR member station WUNC.

Johnson added that the debris flows can travel over a mile, carrying rocks, trees and other hazards.

Heavy rains from Helene set a record in Atlanta, which received its highest 48-hour rainfall on record over the past two days. The Georgia Climate Office tweeted on Friday that the area has already seen 11.12 inches of rain, beating a previous record of 9.59 set in 1886. Recordkeeping started in 1878.

In North Carolina, the rainfall totals Friday afternoon were staggering: 29.58 inches for Busick, N.C.; 24.20 for nearby Mount Mitchell State Park; about 13 inches in Boone, some 55 miles away.

The storm dumped more than 8 inches of rain in Wilmington and wrought serious damage to coastal homes and small buildings, as well as agricultural fields."
Kate Spade Is Missing The Plus Size Market. Eloquii Collaboration Fixes That.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2024/09/28/kate-spade-is-missing-the-plus-size-market-eloquii-collaboration-fixes-that/,2024-09-28T15:11:05Z,"Direct-to-consumer (DTC) plus-size women's fashion brand Eloquii has just dropped a capsule collection in collaboration with Tapestry-owned Kate Spade.

Priced from $99 up to $499 for a feather-sleeve coat, it gives Eloquii's size 14 and up fashion-forward customers access to Kate Spade's inimitable style that they can't get directly from the brand.

While Kate Spade offers up to XXL sizes in some styles, the Kate Spade size chart only goes up to a 36-inch waist circumference. That is still out of bounds of the average American woman who has a waist of 39 inches, according to the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.

The waist size of Eloquii fashions starts at 37 inches in size 14 and extends to 55 inches in size 28, with some styles ranging up to size 32 at 63 inches.

The Eloquii x kate spade new york collection is styled right for holiday celebrations - dressier plus-sized looks being what Eloquii is known for - but will only be available directly from the Eloquii website.

However, Kate Spade is lending Eloquii marketing support by hosting a New York City event to introduce the collection to Eloquii's local top-tier customers first and in two weeks, they are off to Los Angeles for another showing at the Kate Spade store in the Century City Mall.

Having just dropped on Thursday this week, Eloquii customers are over the moon about the collection, as is Eloquii founder and brand lead Julie Carnevale and her team.

""We're doing Black-Friday kind of results on the website today,"" she shared in our call that day, as she noted that Kate Spade is a brand that consistently registers as one Eloquii customers love for accessories but has been off limits to her in apparel.

That's something the Kate Spade team had been hearing too. Their plus-sized customers want to participate with the brand more fully but couldn't. Now they can.

""With a shared commitment to women's empowerment and the celebration of style, we're thrilled to bring our signature aesthetic to the Eloquii community, together creating a collection that not only looks beautiful but feels amazing to wear,"" Kate Spade's vice president North America wholesale, global licensing and collaborations Charlotte Warshaw said in a statement.

""Fashion should spark joy and this capsule does just that,"" she continued. That joy will continue through Valentine's Day when the two brands drop another dress-up party collection, and Carnevale is hopeful it can carry on.

""The synergy between the brands and our groups are great. Both Eloquii and Kate Spade are interested in moving forward as long as it makes financial sense, and so far, things are looking great,"" she said.

To translate Kate Spade's design aesthetic to plus-size, it took more than scaling up the patterns. The Kate Spade team presented Eloquii's with its holiday collection, showing the colors, print, fabric and textures that it would include.

Then the Eloquii team took that as inspiration to capture the look and feel but in styles and silhouettes that work for Eloquii's customer.

""We didn't just do a carbon copy of whatever was being done in straight size. Our teams collaborated together to leverage what we know about the actual fits and blocks that are proven for the Eloquii customer,"" she said.

The result is a collection that tells ""the same story"" as the Kate Spade designs, but are slightly different in silhouette. And happily for the Eloquii customer, the prices are more affordable than one would expect at Kate Spade, though its print pleated gown sells for $499.

Yesenia Leigh, vice president of design at Eloquii shared, ""Designing the collaboration of Eloquii and kate spade new york was the perfect fusion of two distinct yet complementary worlds - blending Eloquii's impeccable fit with kate spade new york's signature prints and playful sense of style.""

The plus-sized fashion market has tripped up any number of regular-sized brands, Old Navy's recent ""Bodequality"" size-inclusive launch being a prime example. Carnevale has been studying the plus-sized fashion market for more than a decade to understand the designs she wants that both fit and flatter her.

While working at The Limited, she was tasked to develop an extended-sizes division to reengage lapsed customers who effectively were ""fired"" by the brand if they outgrew its then size 12 limit. It launched the Eloquii brand in 2011 but after The Limited hit the skids, it decided to focus on its core business.

Instead of folding and going back to what she used to do at The Limited, Carnevale and her core team decided to strike out on their own and buy the brand. ""I never saw so much opportunity in my life,"" she observed.

Current Eloquii CEO Mariah Chase joined the company shortly thereafter and helped the company raise some $42 million in venture capital to grow the business.

After four years of going it alone, Eloquii caught the eye of Bonobos founder Andy Dunn after he sold his company to Walmart and joined it as head of its digital brands. He spearheaded Walmart's acquisition of Eloquii for a reported $100 million in 2018.

But then after the pandemic disruption, Walmart changed strategy and started selling off specialty DTC brands it had acquired, like Bonobos and Eloquii.

FullBeauty Brands quickly snapped up Eloquii last year for an undisclosed sum to fill a gap in its ""digital mall"" to appeal to a younger, more fashion-forward customer.

FullBeauty was founded in 1901 with a mission to serve the plus-sized customer so Eloquii has finally found a home that is a perfect fit.

FullBeauty boosts revenues in excess of $1 billion and has a customer list five million strong. Its other brands include Cuup, Dia & Co, Catherines, June + Vie and most recently it added Avenue to its holdings.

FullBeauty assesses the total available market (TAM) to be an $81 billion opportunity that is growing three-times faster than the regular-sized women's apparel market. And according to Statista, over 20% of Millennial women and 14% of her younger GenZ siblings consider inclusive-sizing personally important to them.

Just like the fashion market doesn't seem to know how to serve the plus-sized customer, many established fashion companies don't seem to know how to manage brands that serve her either. Clearly FullBeauty knows both to do both."
The 10 Best Romantic Movies On Netflix Right Now,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbean/2024/09/28/the-10-best-romantic-movies-on-netflix-right-now/,2024-09-28T15:04:15Z,"October is right around the corner, which means I'm readying myself for a horror movie marathon. But I recently watched an amazing romance on Netflix (it's the first film you'll find on my list), and I can't get it out of my head. So in light of that awesome film, I've decided to cull together ten great romances on Netflix -- some comedies, some dramas, but all love-affirming tales -- that I think are worth checking out. So if you, like me, are looking for something a bit lighter before we delve into the bloody madness of horror movies next month, then check out one (or more) of the following movies. These are what I believe to be the ten best romances available on Netflix.

The first movie on our list concerns the very make-up of romantic movies. The main character of Falling in Love Like in the Movie is Bagus (Ringgo Agus Rahman), a scriptwriter who pitches an idea for a black-and-white rom-com based on an experience he shared with his high school love Hana (Nirina Zubir). This meta-narrative shifts between Bagus' past relationship with Hana, who had just lost her husband, and his current feud with producer Yoram (Alex Abbad), who pushes for a more marketable film. As Bagus pursues his artistic vision, tensions between his personal life and filmmaking ambitions arise, lending to the film's meta aesthetic that blurs the lines between the film's actual plot and the film-within-a-film being created. Directed by Yandy Laurens, this movie film's visual playfulness, which features a constant shift between color and black-and-white, offers a self-referential take on romantic movies, ultimately illustrating how cinema can both mirror and differ from real life.

On one side of this timeless romance we have an aspiring actress named Mia (Emma Stone, who won an Oscar for her performance), and on the other we have a struggling jazz musician named Sebastian (Ryan Gosling). But together in the magical land of Hollywood, they're about to find out what love truly means -- the good...and the bad. After they meet, Mia and Sebastian inspire one another to chase after their dreams, despite the constant setback they face. And as their careers take off, they must learn to balance their relationship with the pursuit of climbing that professional ladder. In the end, La La Land reckons with the painful reality of pursuing one's dreams, and how sometimes love, as much as it can inspire, can ultimately get in the way of our aspirations. A stylist, nostalgic, experience stuffed to the brim with music and color, this honest yet bittersweet story from director Damien Chazelle combines the optimism of romance with the melancholy of life's compromises and missed opportunities.

While Jim (Mark Duplass) is in town to renovate and sell his late mother's house, he and his high school sweetheart, Amanda (Sarah Paulson), unexpectedly run into each other in Alex Lehman's beautiful black-and-white film Blue Jay. As they spend the day together, they reminisce about their shared past and the time they had spent together, gradually rekindling emotions they once shared. As they revisit the moments and places form their past, unresolved feelings resurface as well, and they reflect on how their lives have changed since they split. Their short time together is a quiet, introspective exploration of what happens when people revisit their past and how time shapes love and loss. Intimate and minimalistic, this black-and-white drama filled with naturalistic dialogue offers a reflective, meditative depiction of love that delves into the complexities of rekindled relationships and the impact memories have on our selves.

Us and Them tells the tale of Xiaoxiao (Zhou Dongyu) and Jianqing (Jing Boran), two strangers who meet on a train while traveling home for the Chinese New Year. Over the course of decade, in a narrative that constantly shifts back and forth between past and present, their relationship evolves from a fleeting connection into a complex deeply emotional bond, as they navigate love, career struggles, and the challenges of building a life together. Through flashbacks and current struggles, this weaving story from Taiwanese singer-actress Rene Liu (aka Milk Tea) captures Xiaoxiao and Jianqing's ups and downs, showing how their individual ambitions, as well as pressures from society, impact their relationship over time. This realistic movie captures the bittersweet spectrum of romantic connection, featuring expressive visual contrasts that juxtapose the vibrant beginnings of love with the muted tones of later challenges.

Meet the star of director P. J. Hogan's film Muriel's Wedding, Muriel Heslop: a soilly awkward woman who feels stuck and limiated in her small Austrailain town. In this offbeat and super colorful comedy set to the tune of ABBA's bouncy pop music, she dreams of leaving such an unsatisfying life behind and finding happiness by getting married to Mr. Right. After stealing some money to attend a tropical vacation, Muriel (played by Toni Collette in an all-time great performance) reinvents her self with the help her new friend, Rhonda (Rachel Griffiths). They move to Sydney, where Muriels's obsession with getting married leads her into a series of predicaments that challenge her worldview, her vision of what makes life worth leaving. Through this journey, Muriel leans about self-worth and what it truly means to be happy, beyond the fantasy of weddings and what society expects of you. Quirky with an undeniable strand of dark humor, this heartfelt story is the definition of cathartic joy.

It's 1950s New York, and Therese (Rooney Mara), a young aspiring photographer, and Carol (Cate Blanchett), an elegant, wealthy woman going through a difficult divorce, meet each one another at crucial crossroads in their lives. Despite the constraints of their time and social prejudices, these two women form a deep emotional connection that quickly turns into a love affair. As their relationship intensifies, they are forced to confront the messiness of their looked-down-upon love, including Carol's custody battle for her daughter and the risks associated with love between two women in a conservative era. This romantic drama from Todd Haynes is, per the director's style, elegantly composed as it meticulously captures the essence of New York City in the mid-20th century with lush, atmospheric cinematography. The movie's tender, restrained approach results in an absorbing undercurrent of tension and desire that permeates this sad yet entrancing love story.

I would feel remiss not including a Bollywood musical on this list, and I see no better suitor than the uplifting yet heartbreaking story of Kal Ho Naa Ho, which translates to Tomorrow My Never Come. This film from Nikkhil Advani centers on a romance between Naina (Preity Zinta) and Aman (Shah Rukh Khan). While living in New York City, Naina, a young uptight student living with her widowed mother, disabled brother and hostile grandmother, struggles with her own unhappiness. But when her new neighbor, the cheerful and optimistic Aman, enters Naina's life, he begins to change the way she sees the world. Soon, a love triangle between Naina, Aman and Naina's classmate Rohit (Saif Ali Khan) unfolds, all while Aman keeps a life-threatening heart condition a secret. This vibrant and dramatic experience features a fantastic blend of comedy, romance and deep drama that's expected of Bollywood films.

Love at first sight? How about love at first dream. That's the case in On Body and Soul, which tells of the ethereal romance between Endre (Morcsányi Géza) and Mária (Alexandra Borbély), two workers in a Hungarian slaughterhouse who discover they share they same dream each night, where they meet as deer in a peaceful forest. While shy and removed in their waking lives, this strange shared dream slowly brings them closer together. As they learn to communicated in reality, their relationship deepens, and they confront emotional barriers that have kept them from love and connection in the past. Quiet and visually poetic with its dreamlike approach, this film from Ildikó Enyedi contrasts the cold, sterile environment of the slaughterhouse with the serene, natural imagery of our central couple's shared dream, producing in a a haunting atmosphere that's both longing and vulnerable, that focuses on the characters' inner worlds and their struggle to connect in an emotionally detached environment.

One of the great romantic duologies of recent years, the first part Don't Go Breaking My Heart introduces the love triangle between Yen (Gao Yuanyuan), a young analyst working in Hong Kong who recently broke up with her boyfriend, and her two suitors, Sean (Louis Koo), a wealthy investment firm CEO, and Kevin. (Daniel Wu), an architect who suffers from alcoholism. Both enamored by Yen, Sean and Kevin vie for her attention in increasingly creative ways as Yen tries to choose the man who truly complements her. Directing team Wai Ka-fai and Johnnie To's glossy and playful film employs slick cinematography that captures its modern, urban as it depicts love amidst the dynamic cityscape of Hong Kong. Light, charming and humorous, this Shakespearean romantic comedy, is uplifting yet doesn't shy away from capturing the ultimate complexities of relationships, and in the end delivers a healthy mix of joy, frustration and longing that naturally comes with love.

The final film on our list is Big Eden, which tells the story of Henry Hart (Arye Gross) , a successful New York City artist who returns to this rural Montana hometown to care for his ailing grandfather. While home, Henry, who is fearful of losing his last remaining family member, reconnects with the people from his childhood, including his high school crush, Dean (Tim DeKay), who recently returned to Big Eden with his kids after a divorce, and a quiet local store own who harbors feelings for Henry, Pike (Eric Schweig). As Henry struggles with the impending death of his grandfather while balancing feelings stirred up by his visit home, this warm and idyllic film from director Thomas Bezucha presents a small-town fantasy world where the entire community is accepting and supportive of one's journey of self-discovery. Its tone of positivity and inclusivity might seem cloying to some, but others like me will find the film's sweet, lighthearted approach to be a breath of fresh air."
10 Great Fyodor Dostoevsky Novels,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/entertainment/article/fyodor-dostoevsky-books/,2024-09-28T15:04:03Z,"Fyodor Dostoevsky was anything but a serene figure. He wrestled with faith, doubt and his own flawed humanity, translating those struggles into novels that described the chaos and contradictions of life, and his writing became a mirror for readers who felt adrift in their thoughts -- rich, turbulent and very human. After a near-execution that changed his life, Dostoevsky began his writing career in the 1840s, creating some of the most influential novels in the literary canon.

During his career, Dostoevsky wrote 11 complete novels, three novellas, 17 short stories, and numerous other works. Here are 10 that stand out, not simply for their philosophical weight but for their raw emotionality. Dostoevsky's work compels readers to ask uncomfortable questions, challenging them to engage with the discomforts of their own imperfections.

Dostoevsky's The Adolescent is often overlooked, yet it is probably one of his most philosophically rich works. The plot follows the coming-of-age story of Arkady Dolgoruky, a young man based in 1860s Russia searching for his identity in the shadow of his illegitimate birth. While it may lack the polish of Dostoevsky's major works, it covers many of the classic themes that define most coming-of-age stories, such as the exploration of youth, ambition and moral uncertainty. It also portrays the existential angst of growing up and all the confusion, rebellion and idealism that comes with it. Through Arkady's eyes, Dostoevsky probes the restless energy of youth and the incessant yearning for a sense of purpose.

Who should read this? Readers who enjoy coming-of-age stories with philosophical undercurrents.

Dostoevsky's epistolary debut novel, Poor Folk, is a series of letters between two of his impoverished protagonists, Makar Devushkin and Varvara Dobroselova, who find comfort in their shared hardship. Dostoevsky uses their pen-pal conversations to portray the impact of living a hard, poverty-stricken life and the quiet dignity of those who suffer under its spell. Poor Folk is a novel that goes beyond telling the stories of two financially challenged people but also explains poor people's relationship with the rich and the dynamics between affluence and destitution. The novel lacks the philosophical complexity of his later works, but its raw emotional power and empathy hint at the themes Dostoevsky would actively explore later in his career.

Who should read this? Readers who enjoy an intimate, personal glimpse into Dostoevsky's early development as a novelist.

Dostoevsky's The House of the Dead is a semi-fictionalized, autobiographical account of his experiences in a Siberian labor camp inspired by the four years he was jailed in western Siberia for being a part of the Petrashevsky Circle. After his release and six years of exile, Dostoevsky wrote this vivid, non-glamorized account of the brutal reality of convicts in a way that mirrored his own experiences. Through the perspective of its protagonist, Goryanchikov, the novel looks at the harshness of prison life but also celebrates the flickers of humanity that survive even under the harshest conditions. It serves both as an indictment of the Russian penal system and a meditation on resilience.

Who should read this? Readers interested in stories about resilience, survival and the human capacity to live through and endure suffering.

The Eternal Husband is a tragicomedy novella about guilt, jealousy and manipulation. The story centers around the complicated dynamic between the nobleman Alexei Ivanovich Velchaninov and his acquaintance Pavel Pavlovich Trusotsky, whose deceased wife Velchaninov previously had an affair with before her death. After her death, her cuckolded husband, Pavel, reappears in Velchaninov's life, apparently to torment him, and the previous affair is obviously a major source of tension between the two men. As the psychological cat-and-mouse plot of the story continues, it becomes clear to readers that the dead woman's memory haunts both men in different ways, and Dostoevsky's intelligent approach to this story feels claustrophobic but is also charged with barely contained emotion.

Who should read this? Readers who are fascinated by salacious themes and cat-and-mouse undercurrents in a story.

Dostoevsky's The Gambler is a novella that mirrored his financial circumstances at the time and was written in less than a month to fulfill a contractual obligation. The story follows the life of Alexei Ivanovich, a young tutor who sacrificed his love for Polina Alexandrovna and ultimately ruins his chances with her, as she loses trust and respect for him because of his uncontrollable gambling. The story draws heavily from Dostoevsky's own experience with gambling addiction, and through Alexei's first-person perspective Dostoevsky shows the exciting highs and depressing lows of obsession and the consequences that come with the slavery of impulsivity.

Who should read this? Those interested in the psychology of addiction and self-destruction.

In Notes from Underground, Dostoevsky gives voice to a man who has rejected society -- and himself. The nameless narrator, often called the Underground Man, is bitter, self-loathing and completely cut off from the world around him. The novel is a precursor to existentialism and looks at the relationship -- and tension -- between free will and determinism, as well as the agony of self-consciousness. The Underground Man's confession is both an indictment of society and a personal manifesto of suffering, a reflection of a man at war with the world and with his own existence. The book is split into two parts, with the first depicting the narrator's philosophical ramblings and the second showing him reminiscing about specific incidents from his past, including his interactions with others. Both parts work together to portray his disconnection from society and the futility he feels in his existence.

Who should read this? Readers who enjoy introspective, philosophical stories that analyze the contradictions of human experiences.

Demons, also translated as The Devils or The Possessed, is Dostoevsky's searing critique of political radicalism and is considered one of the top books he wrote following his return from Siberian exile. The plot is set in a small provincial town; it tells the story of a group of nihilists who create chaos and confusion, all in the name of revolution. What begins as a political plot quickly devolves into an investigation of moral collapse, with each character representing a part of the ideological disorder that was becoming prevalent in Russia in the 1860s. Demons is far from a simple political novel; instead, it is a book that questions what happens when society strips away morality in favor of ideology -- and asks what becomes of a soul when it belongs only to a cause.

Who should read this? Anyone fascinated by the idea of ideology and the cost of political extremism.

Prince Lev Nikolayevich Myshkin, the protagonist of The Idiot, is a man of pure goodness whom society cannot accept. After returning to Russia after spending years in Switzerland to be treated for epilepsy, he enters a cynical and dishonest world, bringing with him only his innocence and moral clarity, but his morally upright nature inevitably leads to his downfall. The ironic title of the book reflects how the other characters view Lev -- as naive and foolish. In this story, Dostoevsky engages readers with an important question: Is it possible for goodness to triumph in a world where power, greed and lust are rewarded? Lev's fate suggests not.

Who should read this? Idealists and those who believe in the inherent goodness of humanity -- but are brave enough to see it tested.

It is not surprising that Dostoevsky spent two years writing The Brothers Karamazov because its plot is so rich in philosophical debate, psychological tension and family drama -- and trauma -- that it feels like the culmination of his life's work. In Dostoevsky's final novel, three brothers struggle with the murder of their debauched father and, in doing so, come to terms with faith, doubt and morality. The characters -- Alyosha, the spiritual son; Ivan, the intellectual skeptic; and Dmitri, the passionate, impulsive soul -- represent the fragmented aspects of Dostoevsky himself. At the heart of the novel is an argument: Can human beings find meaning without belief in God? Is faith a crutch, or is it the path to transcendence? With the famous Grand Inquisitor chapter, Dostoevsky delivers one of literature's most compelling examinations of free will.

Dostoevsky's most iconic novel, Crime and Punishment, dives into the feverish mind of Rodion Raskolnikov, a former student who believes his superior intelligence entitles him to commit murder for what he perceives to be a moral calling. Regardless, after killing a pawnbroker, Raskolnikov is consumed by psychological and moral unraveling that drives him to madness. The novel doesn't merely ask whether crime can ever be justified; it compels readers to sit with the weight of their actions, moral hypocrisy and the ways guilt can eat away at our very core. With this book, every page is a battle between conscience and rationalization, with Raskolnikov's sickly psyche as the battlefield.

Bottom Line

Dostoevsky's writing was born from personal struggles and philosophical quests, and those are the two things that have made his works a landmark in literature. His ability to engage in prose that defined faith, human promise suffering and ultimate morality showed a keen awareness about the human existence. Whether through the existentialism of The Brothers Karamazov or the impulsive tension of The Gambler, Dostoevsky has continued to provoke readers to sit with hard questions and understand their underlying answers."
"Monosodium glutamate, or MSG, gets a fresh look from experts",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/monosodium-glutamate-msg-gets-fresh-look-experts,2024-09-28T14:58:47Z,"Monosodium glutamate, or MSG -- a food additive that is often found in Asian cuisine -- has had something of a negative reputation over the last 60 years. Some food experts insist that's unfair.

""To talk about MSG is to tell the history of umami, the fifth basic taste,"" Christopher Koetke, a Chicago-based corporate executive chef at Ajinomoto Health & Nutrition North America, Inc., told Fox News Digital.

Umami, said Koetke, ""was first identified by Tokyo scientist Dr. Kikunae Ikeda in 1908 while enjoying a bowl of traditional Japanese seaweed broth called konbu dashi.""

CHICORY AN ALL-NATURAL ALTERNATIVE TO CHEMICALLY DECAFFEINATED COFFEE, SAYS HOMESTEADER

This soup, said Koetke, had a distinct taste other than sweet, sour, bitter or salty -- so he dubbed it ""umami."" In Japanese, umami means ""essence of deliciousness,"" said Koetke.

""After days of studying various seaweeds, he found that the taste of umami could be attributed to glutamate, a naturally occurring amino acid, which is also present in the human body and in many foods,"" he said.

Ikeda then invented what would now be called MSG by combining one part glutamate with one part sodium, said Koetke.

""By 1909, MSG was patented and commercialized as AJI-NO-MOTO®, to become the world's first umami seasoning,"" he said.

It is added to foods in recipes much like salt and other spices, and MSG is naturally found in many foods, including tomatoes and mushrooms.

But by the 1960s, opinions on MSG began to change, said Koetke.

In April 1968, someone wrote a letter to the editor of The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), claiming to have ""Chinese Restaurant Syndrome.""

""The letter's author described symptoms like weakness and flushing experienced after eating at a Chinese restaurant, speculating that these symptoms may have been due to any number of ingredients in the meal, including MSG,"" said Koetke.

The letter's author described symptoms like weakness and flushing experienced after eating at a Chinese restaurant.

This letter sparked a fear of MSG, said Koetke, which, coupled with ""anti-Asian xenophobia - at a high in the 1960s"" - resulted in many Chinese restaurants advertising they had ""no MSG"" in their products to stay in business.

""Since then, extensive research has verified MSG's safety, and sensitivities to the ingredient have never been consistently replicated in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials,"" he said.

Fox News Digital reached out to The New England Journal of Medicine for comment about ""Chinese Restaurant Syndrome"" and MSG.

The change in view on MSG is typical of ""our world of nutrition research and trying to understand exactly how our diet influences our health,"" Linda Van Horn, PhD, RDN, a professor at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine. (See the video at the top of this article.)

""There have been tremendous breakthroughs over the last two decades related to understanding more clearly the relationship between food additives and their impact, not only on how we feel, but some of the more objective data related to the microbiome,"" she told Fox News Digital in a Zoom interview.

""In other words, [there is] more objective information that allows us to better understand these relationships between diet nutrients and their impact on our health,"" she said.

MSG has considerably less sodium than table salt, noted Van Horn, something the food industry is ""very interested in"" amid a push to ""reduce the amount of sodium in the diet and look for ways to enhance flavor,"" she said.

""We eat far too much sodium in our diet, which relates to the No. 1 burden of disease, which is hypertension,"" she said.

Van Horn stopped short of giving MSG a green light, saying that ""it's really not clear at this point"" if the additive is safe for humans in unlimited amounts.

""There really isn't a definitive answer when it comes to, 'Is it or is it not something that should be regulated, reduced and otherwise prevented in terms of our overall diet,'"" she said.

""So as usual, I think we come away with the understanding that this is a research work in progress.""

""Limit the intake of sodium in general.""

The consumption of some MSG, she said, ""probably isn't all that harmful.""

""However, I would continue to remain"" aware of how much MSG is being consumed, she said.

"'American Gothic', famous piece by artist Grant Wood, is displayed to visitors at the Art Institute of Chicago",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/american-gothic-famous-piece-artist-grant-wood,2024-09-28T14:24:29Z,"""American Gothic"" is a famous piece of artwork by Iowa-born Grant Wood.

The painting by Wood depicts a man and a woman standing in front of a house.

The man, a farmer, wears overalls, with a pitchfork in his hand, looking straight at the viewer, where the woman's head is turned slightly with a stern look on her face.

WHO WAS THE MONA LISA IN REAL LIFE? STORY BEHIND LEONARDO DA VINCI'S FAMOUS PAINTING

Though there is a clear age gap between the man and the woman in the painting, the relationship between them is unknown. The painting could depict a husband and wife, or a father and his daughter.

To create his famous work, Wood used his sister Nan, and his dentist, Dr. B.H. McKeeby, as models for the pair standing in front of the house in the painting, according to Britannica. The two posed separately as Wood worked on the painting.

The house in the background of the painting was inspired by one Wood saw in Eldon, Iowa, according to the Art Institute of Chicago's website.

The house was built in the Carpenter Gothic style, one that was popular in the 1880s.

The painting was completed by Wood in 1930. Upon completion, Wood submitted it to the Art Institute of Chicago, where it was accepted into a major show, according to the art institute.

Wood won the Norman Wait Harris Bronze Award for his painting and won $300 as his prize.

The painting has remained at the Art Institute of Chicago to this day. When it was first put on display, it quickly grew in popularity.

Much of the public interest in the painting came from viewers trying to fill in the blanks of the story. Not much is known of the background story of the painting, so many have made their own guesses.

One popular belief of the painting is that it was meant to be a satirical take on the Midwest, according to the Art Institute of Chicago. Wood repeatedly rejected this throughout his life, according to Britannica.

The Art Institute of Chicago says on its website that Wood wanted to ""convey a positive image of rural American values, offering a vision of reassurance at the beginning of the Great Depression."""
Ji Jin-Hee Describes 'Romance In The House' As A Unique Divorce Drama,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanmacdonald/2024/09/28/ji-jin-hee-describes-romance-in-the-house-as-a-unique-divorce-drama/,2024-09-28T12:52:19Z,"Byeon Moo-jin is not exactly welcome when he shows up at the apartment building where his children and ex-wife live. These characters in the k-drama Romance In The House have reasons to be wary. Life has been relatively peaceful since the divorce and his former family has no wish to return to the past. That's not true for Moo-jin. He would love to make things up to his ex-wife.

""Romance in the House tells the bittersweet story of an unwanted divorce, caused from a lack of love and the poor choices made by Moo-jin,"" said Ji Jin-hee, the actor who plays Moo-jin. ""His heartfelt journey to make amends and rebuild his family is what truly sets this story apart. I found the narrative and character setting both compelling and refreshingly unique.""

Moo-jin's sudden appearance after a long and mysterious absence prompts suspicion rather than sympathy.

""Yet, as the story unfolds towards the conclusion, it is his unwavering devotion to the same woman, the heartbreak of his divorce, and his struggle to rediscover love that evoke sympathy from the audience,"" said Ji. ""These emotional threads were seamlessly integrated into the script, shaping Byeon Moo-jin's character and guiding his every action. This allowed me to immerse myself fully in his journey, making the acting process feel natural and effortless.""

Like many 2024 Korean series the focus of this SLL drama is on divorce, but it's perspective differs as it centers on a divorced couple who might potentially get back together. Moo-jin's ex-wife, Geum Ae-yeon, is played by Kim Ji-soo , an actress who played Ji's wife once before. In the 2013-2014 drama Word From A Warm Heart, she was married to Ji's character and knew he was having an affair. Ji enjoyed acting with Kim again.

""We shared so many wonderful and joyful memories while working on A Warm Word, and this time was no different,"" said Ji. ""I trust her deeply, and the chemistry between us on screen is truly remarkable. It's no surprise that every scene we performed together flowed so effortlessly.""

Ji, who made his acting debut in 2000 with the drama Female Secretary, has a long resume of drama roles that includes D.P. Season 2, Move to Heaven, Designated Survivor: 60 Days, Misty, Take Care of Us Captain, Dong Yi and Jewel in the Palace. He also currently appears in the Netflix film Officer Black Belt.

""While I've enjoyed every project I've been part of, my true passion lies in romantic comedies and melodramas,"" said Ji. ""These are the genres I've always loved, and they've always topped my watch list. I hope to keep exploring them in the future. I'm also drawn to films where justice prevails.""

Each role he takes on offers him a new perspective on life.

""I feel that acting helps me grow and mature by allowing me to glimpse lives I haven't had a chance to live,"" said Ji. ""While exploring and digesting the new character, it gives me a chance to understand many different aspects of life that I didn't fully grasp before. This process of 'learning things' offers me immense happiness.""

The SLL drama, which also stars Son Na-eun, SHINee member Choi Min-ho and Astro member Yoon San-ha, can be seen on Netflix."
Inside Democrats' campaign to redefine the word 'freedom',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/inside-democrats-campaign-redefine-word-freedom,2024-09-28T12:07:51Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Democratic presidential candidate current Vice President Kamala Harris used the word ""freedom"" 11 times in a campaign speech this week, emphasizing, as she does repeatedly, the ""freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body.""

It's the latest example of how, according to ABC News and The New Yorker, Democrats are attempting to take ownership of the word ""freedom."" The New Yorker explains: ""Democrats' years-long efforts to reclaim the word are cresting in this year's Presidential race.""

It really takes some nerve for Democrats to try to revamp as ""freedom"" their usual proposals on not just abortion and voting, but also gun control, climate and LGBT issues. In reality, Democrats aim to restrict our First and Second Amendment rights and more.

CNN HOST KASIE HUNT SAYS HARRIS IS 'REPUBLICAN' AND TRUMP IS 'LIBERAL' ON THEIR ECONOMIC POLICIES

Harris has made ""freedom"" the theme of her campaign. She says the word frequently in her speeches. Her campaign's song is ""Freedom"" by Beyoncé. The word ""freedom"" appears 24 times in her campaign website's issues section. Freedom was emphasized in her first campaign video and in her speech at the Democrats' convention.

""In this election, many fundamental freedoms are at stake,"" Harris's campaign website says. Harris and running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz ""will always fight for the freedom to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis,"" according to their campaign website.

Harris's presidential campaign website's policy section makes no mention of our most important freedoms, enshrined in the First Amendment -- the ""free exercise"" of religion, ""freedom of speech, or of the press"" (former President Donald Trump's campaign does). Someone should tell the Democrats that those are first in the Bill of Rights for a reason.

Walz has said he sees ""no guarantee for free speech"" related to misinformation and hate speech. But such speech is constitutionally protected, otherwise the government would be in the position of regulating what is acceptable speech and it could suppress dissent or label information it doesn't like as ""misinformation.""

The better approach is to allow for free speech, but to have open debate and condemn hateful speech. We've seen the alternative play out: The Biden-Harris White House pressured Big Tech companies to censor Americans because of their views on COVID-19. In 2019, Harris called on then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to suspend Trump's account.

Americans likely won't have the freedom to use correct pronouns if Harris wins election. The Biden-Harris administration wants to make it a civil rights violation if someone uses scientifically accurate pronouns contrary to a gender-confused person's preferences.

For Democrats, ""reproductive freedom"" is the freedom they most want to defend. The verbal forced marriage of ""reproductive"" and ""freedom"" is another stretch. Try as they might, reproduction, including via in-vitro fertilization, can't be divorced from its many consequences -- such as producing children. That's just science.

In the presidential debate, Harris used the word ""freedom"" only in reference to abortion. ""I will be a president that will protect our fundamental rights and freedoms including the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do,"" Harris said (she's fine with the government telling you what to do on a host of other issues).

But the freedom to abort an unborn child is not real freedom. In a truly free society, one person cannot be free to take another's liberty. An unborn child is not part of a woman's body or her property -- it is a separate human being with its own rights. In taking the life of an unborn child, a woman is taking away the most basic of all rights.

Twisting the word further, Harris says she wants to defend the ""freedom to vote."" But that's no more true of Democrats than Republicans. Both sides want to enact election laws that favor their party. But Republicans want to make our election system more secure.

In fact, Democrats have taken their own voters' freedom this presidential election. It's the Democratic Party that ousted its incumbent, prevented a real primary challenge, and has fought any independent challenger. Nor have Democrats given Republicans the freedom to vote. Democrats, along with other lawfare, have pushed claims to kick Trump off the ballot.

Harris says she'll also defend ""the freedom to love who you love openly."" The reality is she'll take parents' rights.

Her first campaign video shows crowds waving pride flags as Harris says ""we choose freedom."" But the LGBT community is far from closeted - pride parades often feature half-naked adults in public in front of children.

Conservatives want the freedom to protect their children from ideologies that are counter to their beliefs, including sexually explicit books that are inappropriate for children. Democrats misleadingly call these efforts ""book bans,"" but by this logic, movie ratings are ""movie bans"" because young children aren't supposed to see R-rated movies.

Women won't be free under a Harris administration. She won't defend women's rights to keep biological men out of their bathrooms, locker rooms, sports or sororities.

Harris would restrict the Second Amendment, yet her campaign casts gun control in the light of freedom: ""As President, she won't stop fighting so that Americans have the freedom to live safe from gun violence in our schools, communities, and places of worship.""

Americans likely won't have the freedom to use correct pronouns if Harris wins election. The Biden-Harris administration wants to make it a civil rights violation if someone uses scientifically accurate pronouns contrary to a gender-confused person's preferences.

Harris's promises of freedom and joy (another of her themes) sound as vacuous as former President Barack Obama's campaign of ""hope and change."" The Democrats want to impose more government control on Americans, including with expensive and ineffective economic and environmental policies.

Republicans also want clean air, but acknowledge that more environmental regulation costs Americans money in higher energy, housing and other costs. Being energy-independent prevents funding foreign authoritarian governments.

Yes, Democrats believe in the ""freedoms"" of abortion, being LGBT, and voting without ID -- but they don't believe in First and Second Amendment rights, a woman's right to not have men in female-only spaces, parents' rights or energy independence."
"Opinion: Remembering the marvel, Maggie Smith",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5121901/opinion-remembering-the-marvel-maggie-smith,2024-09-28T12:06:29Z,"English actress Maggie Smith at the Evening Standard Theatre Awards, London, 25th January 1962. Evening Standard/Getty Images/Hulton Archive hide caption

By the time Dame Maggie Smith left the stage yesterday, at the age of 89, a lot of people might have thought she'd been born with that honorific title.

She played the leading roles in Shaw, Ibsen, Stoppard and Shakespeare on stage and screen, including Desdemona to Sir Laurence Oliver's Othello, and of course in recent years, Violet Crawley, the Dowager Countess in ""Downton Abbey.""

""I'm always in corsets,"" Maggie Smith joked, or perhaps was not joking at all, to British critic Barry Norman on the BBC in 1993. ""And I'm always in wigs, and I'm always in those buttoned boots.""

But Dame Maggie was also Professor Minerva McGonagall of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the Harry Potter films; and the Mother Superior in ""Sister Act,"" starring Whoopi Goldberg as a nightclub singer on the run who hides in a convent; and she won an Academy Award for her portrayal of a free-thinking teacher in a proper British girls school in the 1969 film, ""The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie:""

""I influence them to be aware of all the possibilities of life. Of beauty, honor, courage. I do not, Miss McKay, influence them to look for slime where it does not exist. I am going. When my class convenes, they will find me composed, and prepared to review for them a succession of the Stuarts.""

In the 2015 film, ""The Lady in the Van,"" Dame Maggie Smith played a Miss Mary Shepard, a woman who would be called homeless, except she took shelter in the back of a van parked in the driveway of the playwright Alan Bennett for 15 years. She is friendly, but resolutely ungrateful to him:

""You're not doing me a favor, you know, I have got other fish to fry. A man on the pavement told me if I went south of the river I'd be welcomed with open arms.""

Dame Maggie had upper-crust diction, and working class tenacity in a career that spanned seven decades, in which she almost never stopped working. Those of us who work this shift may especially cherish a line she uttered as the Dowager Countess: ""What is a weekend?""

In the theater, it can be when you turn on the stage lights and make people marvel. As Maggie Smith so often did."

Vice presidential debates have produced many memorable moments, but it's hard to say any has made a decisive difference in the election outcome.

This year the anticipation may be higher than in the past, if only because the race is so close and neither candidate seems to have a clear advantage. The debate may provide the moment of decision for some voters and even a tipping point in a closely balanced electorate.

Much of the electorate is still getting to know the running mates chosen by former President Donald Trump and Vice President Harris. Trump's choice, Ohio's JD Vance, has only been in the Senate since last year and Harris' Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota has not previously campaigned for office outside his home state.

All 11 previous running mate debates have taken place in the month of October, just as the media and campaign aficionados find themselves needing a new angle on the presidential race. They have usually been mixed in with multiple debates between the presidential candidates themselves. But after one meeting with Harris, Trump is saying it is too late for another. So the Vance-Walz debate appears to offer the campaign's last live confrontation.

That makes this October 1 match in New York seem far more important than the VP's usual ""undercard"" status: In boxing terms, it could be the main event of the campaign's final month. That expectation and tension have hovered over the Battle of the Twos in every four-year cycle for decades now, and it's worth recalling how much media heat and drama they have generated.

Rewind to the first one

The first vice presidential debate was in 1976, the year of America's Bicentennial, when the political system needed something to restore people's faith. The nation was emerging from a decade of dissension, dispirited by the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandals that forced President Richard Nixon from office.

The 1976 presidential contest was between the unelected incumbent Republican Gerald Ford, who had been Nixon's vice president, and a newcomer named Jimmy Carter, the former governor of Georgia. (Carter will turn 100 on Tuesday, the day of the Vance-Walz debate.)

In that year, both nominees reached out to the disaffected in their own parties with their vice presidential picks. Ford chose Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, a conservative he hoped would placate those who had preferred Ronald Reagan as that year's GOP presidential nominee. Carter, a Southern moderate, chose the well-known liberal Sen. Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Both men would later rise to the top of the ticket in their respective parties, but neither would ever win the White House.

Their debate in 1976 has been remembered chiefly for a phrase uttered by Dole when talking about foreign policy. A decorated veteran of the Second World War, Dole referred to the several conflicts of the 20th century as ""Democrat wars."" Indeed, there had been Democrats in office when each of the world wars and the Korean conflict began, but support for U.S. participation had been generally bipartisan. Dole seemed to be tapping a well of isolationist sentiment long dormant in the GOP - but never extinct.

The Dole controversy lasted a few days and provided videotape for later discussions of his career, but if it did any damage it was hard to discern in November's outcome. Ford, who had been far behind Carter in the early fall, closed the gap in the closing days and nearly won.

1980 and 1984: Mondale, Bush and Ferraro

In 1980 the VP nominees were Mondale and former congressman and CIA Director George H.W. Bush, the No. 2 for Reagan, who had won the Republican presidential nomination on his third try. The debate was scheduled for Louisville, Ky., on October 2 but canceled three days earlier when both Mondale and Bush declined to attend. There had been disagreements over the inclusion of a third candidate, Patrick Lucey, the former governor of Wisconsin who was the running mate of independent candidate John Anderson that year.

Bush was back as the incumbent vice president in 1984 and game for a debate with the first woman ever included on a major party's national ticket, Rep. Geraldine Ferraro of New York. Ferraro, a former prosecutor, was poised and assured and gave Democrats a shot in the arm. At one point she took exception to Bush's dismissive tone: ""I almost resent ... your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy.""

Mondale was also back that fall, at the top of the Democratic ticket, and having done well in his first debate with Reagan, he took to featuring that performance and Ferraro's in his campaign appearances. ""Have you been watching the debates?"" he would ask, and the crowds, such as they were, would roar.

Bush generated a ruckus after the debate when an open microphone overheard him saying he had ""tried to kick a little ass."" But none of the back and forth over the debates that autumn could have mattered much Reagan was cruising toward a second term and won every state but Mondale's Minnesota, where he came within one-fifth of one percentage point.

VP debates' single greatest hit

Perhaps the best illustration of vice presidential debates elevating a candidate who would still lose in the election Lloyd Bentsen, the silver-haired Texas senator who ran with Democrat Michael S. Dukakis in 1988. Bentsen had the stature in Washington and also the appeal to the heartland that Dukakis lacked. He had also taken the measure of the youthful senator from Indiana whom Bush, now his party's pick for president, had added to the GOP ticket.

Quayle had been elected to the Senate at age 33 and was just 41 when he faced Bentsen, 26 years his senior. Answering a question about his experience, Quayle said he'd had ""as much experience in Congress"" as John F. Kennedy had when he was elected president at 43 in 1960.

Bentsen fixed his opponent with an appraising stare as he said: ""Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.""

The crowd whooped. A crestfallen Quayle recovered enough to say: ""That was really uncalled for, senator."" But if there had been a referee he would have stopped the fight right there.

Still, in November, the Bush-Quayle ticket carried 40 states and won easily.

No vice presidential debate since then has produced quite such a dramatic highpoint, but there have been several that left an indelible impression.

In 1992, Quayle was back as the incumbent vice president and as Bush's designated attack dog against the Democratic ticket of Bill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, and running mate Al Gore, then a senator from Tennessee.

But both Quayle and Gore were upstaged by the presence of a third debater, the only such addition to the format in the history of vice presidential faceoffs to date. He was retired Adm. James A. Stockdale, a hero of the Vietnam War who had been a prisoner of war and an organizer and spokesman for other POWs at the time. Stockdale was the running mate for independent candidate H. Ross Perot, a billionaire businessman who also took part in the presidential debates with Bush and Clinton.

But on debate night, Stockdale looked uncomfortable on stage and had trouble with his hearing aid. His opening -- ""Who am I? What am I doing here?"" - came across not as introductory so much as genuinely confused. It was fodder for parody and was being mercilessly mocked almost before the debate was over.

Did Stockdale hurt Perot? Not visibly. The Clinton-Gore ticket won in 1992, but Perot-Stockdale got 19% of the popular vote in November, the best showing for a third-option ticket since the 1912 ""Bullmoose"" heyday of Theodore Roosevelt.

Surprises abound but prove inconclusive

Gore returned in 1996 as the incumbent vice president to debate Rep. Jack Kemp, the vice presidential choice of Dole, who was back as the GOP nominee against Clinton. Gore and Kemp had served in the House together before Gore's election to the Senate in 1984. Their debate was spirited but cordial, and many Republicans later said their guy should have been more aggressive. In any event, the incumbents won the vote that mattered that November.

In 2000, Gore was at the top of the ticket and surprised many by choosing Sen. Joe Lieberman, a party moderate from Connecticut who had been critical of Clinton. It appeared to be an effort to distance Gore from Clinton, in part because Lieberman had been outspoken in criticizing Clinton for the relationship with a White House intern that led to Clinton's 1998 impeachment.

Lieberman was the government official in his debate with Dick Cheney, who was at the time the chairman of a private company servicing the oil-and-gas industry. But Cheney had also been in the Republican leadership in the House and been Bush's secretary of defense during the first Persian Gulf War. He asserted a kind of seniority over his Democratic rival in the debate, even though Lieberman was just a year younger and a sitting senator at the time. If there had been any doubt about Cheney when picked by GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush, such doubt was dispelled in the debate.

A few weeks later, in one of the closest elections in U.S. history, the Bush-Cheney ticket lost the popular vote but squeaked by in the Electoral College thanks to a 537-vote edge in Florida that took five weeks and a Supreme Court Decision to decide.

As the incumbent vice president four years later, Cheney was every bit as much in command when paired with Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, the running mate choice of Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts. With the memory of the terror attacks of September 2001 still vivid in voters' minds, Cheney had an advantage and kept a grip on it, knowing his reputation for glowering toughness fit the moment better than Edwards' freshness and Southern charm.

That November's outcome was not quite as close as in 2004, but the early exit polls had pointed to a Kerry-Edwards win. It was only when Ohio went for Bush-Cheney late that evening that the Electoral College had a winner.

Renewed interest in 2008

The atmosphere in the country was notably different four years later in 2008. Feeling the wind at their back as a party, Democrats fought almost all the way to the convention over whether to nominate Hillary Clinton, bidding to be the first woman president, or Barack Obama, bidding to be the first Black president. Obama prevailed and chose a Senate colleague old enough to be his father, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware, to be his running mate. Biden had connections to the white, working-class voters Obama had been losing in the primaries that year.

And Biden did well in his debate with the Republican running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who had added verve and excitement to the ticket headed by Sen. John McCain of Arizona. While Palin was bound to be the focus of the debate, Biden had opportunities and made the most of them.

At the time, Wall Street was experiencing a crisis over mortgage-backed securities that would trigger a credit crunch and a downturn soon to be dubbed ""the Great Recession."" So Biden's gravitas as a six-term senator was as welcome as his roots in blue-collar America. A month later he was the vice president-elect.

In 2012, Biden's task was entirely different. Obama's reelection was opposed by former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, and Biden found himself onstage with the brainy and capable Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee and almost 30 years Biden's junior. Ryan had first come to Washington as a congressional intern for Jack Kemp, and like him, he would be criticized for not attacking the incumbent vice president he faced in the debate. In any event, the Biden-Ryan meeting produced no surprises and probably no effect on the Obama-Biden reelection the following month.

This low-impact trend has continued in the last two vice presidential debates. It takes a moment to even remember the 2016 debate between Mike Pence, then the sitting governor of Indiana, and Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia. Pence had little trouble keeping the emphasis on the man who had put him on that stage, Donald Trump, and on the social issues that Trump wanted him to promote.

Kaine, who had been governor of Virginia and chairman of the Democratic National Committee moving on to the Senate in 2012, also made Trump the centerpiece of his debate performance, saying Trump was ""scary"" as commander in chief and far too well-disposed toward dictators and authoritarians in other countries.

But a few weeks later, when Trump-Pence had prevailed over Clinton-Kaine, no one was talking about what had happened in the running mates' debate.

Pence's Democratic rival was Biden's running mate, Kamala Harris, then a sitting senator from California, who was equally loyal when defending both Biden and herself. And she was not shy about taking on the social issues such as abortion that were so important to Pence's portfolio.

Just three months later, a crowd of rioters would chant ""Hang Mike Pence"" and erect a makeshift scaffold on the steps of the U.S. Capitol because Pence had refused Trump's urging to block the certification of the Electoral College results. Pence refused to leave the Capitol that night and in the wee hours of morning he supervised the process by which the Biden-Harris ticket formalized its win.

Pence also returned to the campaign trail to seek the GOP's 2024 presidential nomination as an alternative to Trump. Pence took part in several of the debates among the candidates, separating himself from Trump on the question of certifying the 2020 election but otherwise defending the Trump record. Unable to make much headway in polls or amass a competitive war chest, he dropped out months before the first primary was held.

Despite the frustrations of Quayle and Pence, the TV-era tradition by which former vice presidents have gone on to be their party's presidential nominee is impressive (Nixon, Hubert Humphrey, Ford, Mondale, Gore, Biden and the first President Bush).

And it continues this year with Harris, who will note that four of her seven predecessors in this group made it to the Oval Office."
Four celebrities who have rejected conservative fans: 'I have no respect for you',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/four-celebrities-have-rejected-conservative-fans-i-have-no-respect-you,2024-09-28T10:12:58Z,"Former President Trump discusses how several celebrities and talk show hosts, like Howard Stern, have gone 'anti-Trump' on 'Gutfeld!'

The November presidential election is less than 40 days away and liberal celebrities are increasingly speaking out. Howard Stern drew controversy recently after he attacked Donald Trump voters as ""stupid"" and said he didn't care if he lost them as listeners. But Stern wasn't the first liberal celebrity to tell conservatives not to listen or watch.

Here are four prominent celebrities from radio, television and music, who've bluntly told conservative fans that they are unwelcome.

Earlier this month, SiriusXM radio host Howard Stern said that he hates supporters of former President Trump.

""I don't agree with Trump politically, I don't think he should be anywhere near the White House. I don't hate the guy. I hate the people who vote for him. I think they're stupid. I do. I'll be honest with you, I have no respect for you,"" he said on ""The Howard Stern Show.""

The liberal shock jock said he doesn't mind losing ""half [his] listeners"" who disagree with his politics and fully expects ""hate mail"" from Trump supporters, after delivering that polarizing statement.

It isn't the first time Stern has lashed out at Trump supporters. Ahead of the 2020 election, he said, ""I don't hate Donald. I hate you for voting for him, for not having intelligence. For not being able to see what's going on with the coronavirus, for not being able to see what the Justice Department is doing. I hate you. I don't want you here.""

HOWARD STERN SAYS HE 'HATES' ANYONE THAT VOTES FOR TRUMP: 'THEY ARE STUPID, I HAVE NO RESPECT FOR THEM'

In 2017, ABC late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel was asked if he was concerned he was driving away his audience with his increasing turn to the left after former President Trump entered the White House.

""I saw -- I don't know if it was a study or a poll or some combination of those two things -- that, like, three years ago, I was equally liked by Republicans and Democrats, and then Republican numbers went way down, like, 30% or whatever,"" Kimmel told ""CBS Sunday Morning"" in the 2017 interview.

""And, you know, as a talk-show host, that's not ideal, but I would do it again in a heartbeat,"" he continued.

A January 2024 study by the Media Research Center found that 81% of all political jokes told on major late night comedy shows in 2023 targeted conservatives. Kimmel's show had the highest rate of anti-conservative jokes for a single show out of the six. Of the 2,215 political jokes made on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!,"" 1,960, or 88% were directed at conservatives.

""Paramore"" lead singer Hayley Williams has gone after supporters of Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as well as former President Trump, while performing on stage.

During a concert in Atlantic City, New Jersey in 2023, the rock singer cursed out those in the audience who were thinking of voting for then-presidential candidate DeSantis in the 2024 presidential race.

""And if you vote for Ron DeSantis, you're f---ing dead to me,"" she said.

This past week during her band's iHeartRadio Music Festival, Williams lectured listeners to vote against Trump unless they wanted to ""live in a dictatorship.""

""Project 2025 is Donald Trump's playbook for controlling and punishing women, poor people, people of color, and the LGBTQ+ community. It is time for all Americans to band together and to finally defeat the Trump agenda,"" she said directly to the camera. ""And the only way to do that is by confronting him at the polls.""

'REACHER' STAR GETS POLITICAL AGAIN, DECRIES AN 'ENTIRE PLATFORM BY THOSE WHO MOSTLY CLAIM TO BE CHRISTIANS'

Singer Pink went on a rampage against pro-life conservatives after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in June of 2022.

""Let's be clear: if you believe the government belongs in a woman's uterus, a gay persons business or marriage, or that racism is okay- THEN PLEASE IN THE NAME OF YOUR LORD NEVER F---ING LISTEN TO MY MUSIC AGAIN. AND ALSO F--- RIGHT OFF. We good?"" the singer wrote on X (then Twitter), according to People Magazine and other outlets. The social media post has since been deleted.

The singer recently performed at the 2024 Democratic National Convention.

Conservative film critic Christian Toto, host of The Hollywood in Toto podcast, told Fox News Digital these celebrities should be ""careful of what they wish for.""

""Today's stars live in bubble-like communities where they don't get to see, meet or be challenged by those with opposing viewpoints. They read only a select number of news outlets and have mentally demonized 'the other.' For Stern, his millions are already deposited in the bank, and all he cares about now is the approval of corporate Hollywood. Rockers who take this pose think they're being edgy. The reality? It's just the opposite.""

""Kimmel recently predicted the end of late-night TV is coming sooner than you think. His willingness to kiss off half his audience helps explain why,"" Toto told Fox News Digital."
Meet the astronauts preparing to travel farther from Earth than any human before,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5100867/nasa-moon-space-artemis-2-mission,2024-09-28T10:01:14Z,"From left to right: Astronauts Reid Wiseman, Jeremy Hansen and Christina Koch settle in inside the Orion spacecraft mockup. Danielle Villasana for NPR hide caption

NASA's Orion space capsule is not a place you would describe as ""roomy.""

The not-quite-cone-shaped spacecraft is about 12 feet across on the inside, and, aside from the center that slants up toward a hatch door, it's mostly less than five feet tall. Moving around it -- in gravity at least -- is an awkward process of crouching and ducking.

""""It's a lot bigger in 3D, when you can float around,"" mission specialist Christina Koch says. ""That's what I'm telling myself.""

As soon as a year from now, Koch will be in that chrome-colored capsule, flying toward the moon at thousands of feet per second. She and two of the four total Artemis II crew members were available on a recent late-August day to show NPR how they're preparing for their mission around the moon and back, which will be the first human flight to Earth's satellite in more than half a century.

The capsule Koch and other NASA employees showed NPR isn't the real thing, though. It's a full-scale training mockup at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, where the crew has been spending hours at a time familiarizing themselves with the layout and running through the paces of their upcoming mission.

Mission commander Reid Wiseman explains a dizzying panel of screens, knobs and switches. He points to the velocity monitor.

""When we leave planet Earth we're zero miles an hour and when we hit low-Earth orbit we're doing 17,000 miles an hour. And then when we come back into the atmosphere we're doing 39 times the speed of sound, 25,000 miles per hour."" Wiseman says. ""Crazy numbers.""

This time next year, if all goes according to plan, Wiseman will command a key moment in NASA's Artemis program. Over the course of 10 days, the crew will travel to the moon, swing around its orbit, and slingshot back to Earth.

Along with Koch and Wiseman, mission specialist Jeremy Hansen and pilot Victor Glover round out the crew. Koch, Hansen and Glover will be the first woman, Canadian and Black astronauts, respectively, to head to the moon.

The mission's high ambitions also come with equally high stakes, as the spacecraft is designed to travel more than 250,000 miles, taking them farther away from Earth than any human before, all while moving at incredible speeds.

This mission is the second phase of NASA's broader Artemis program: the first sent the Orion space capsule along this path uncrewed in 2022. The goal of Artemis II will be to test out the Orion capsule and all the other equipment, so that by 2026, Artemis III can put astronauts back on the moon.

The program's overall ambitions go far beyond replicating NASA's Apollo glory days.

""The goal is not just to go back to the moon,"" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson told NPR in May. ""The goal is to go to the moon to learn so we can go farther to Mars and beyond. Now it so happens that we're going to go to a different part of the moon. We'll go into the South Pole, and that is attractive because we know there's ice there in the crevices of the rocks in the constant shadow or darkness. And if in fact there is water, then we [can create hydrogen] rocket fuel.""

The further the plans stretch out, the more they may seem like science fiction. A key eventual component of Artemis will be a moon-orbiting space station.

But first, NASA needs to make sure it can get a human crew to the moon and back. That's where the four Artemis II astronauts come in.

They've been training since April 2023, spending hours inside the mockup capsule, practicing the various physical tasks they'll need to carry out on the mission. That means hours of looking around its small interior, thinking about what it will be like to share the space with three other people.

The astronauts laugh knowingly when asked about this, because for all the high-level science they're cramming on, they're intently focused on this human chemistry, too.

""We just have to trust each other,"" Wiseman says.

The crew has spent a lot of time talking intentionally about how to give each other the personal space they'll need during the high-stress mission.

""If I can't physically go to a different space, because we're all in the same 'Hershey kiss' together, then I can put on my headphones and that's my way to signal [to the rest of the crew] that I'm in my cabin right now,"" says Koch, giving one example.

Training has taken the astronauts to the Pacific Ocean, where they've practiced how they'll get out of the capsule and into helicopters after their mission ends in a splash down. They've hiked in Iceland, to learn more about the volcanic geology they'll be observing on the lunar surface.

The most critical training, though, happens in the high-tech simulator on the Johnson Space Center campus -- the same building that has housed simulators going back to NASA's Gemini program.

""The goal in this building is to serve the needs of the flight control team, to train them so that if they have a bad day in the real mission, it's like automatic to them,"" says Grace Lauderdale, the simulator manager for the Orion, where she heads a team of NASA engineers, physicists and computer scientists. Lauderdale and her team come up with different scenarios that have one unexpected problem or another flare up at different points, so that if and when something does go wrong in space, it isn't unexpected.

The windows of the simulator are fitted with monitors that display a digital rendering of Earth, the moon and stars. The astronauts can then use the controls to operate simulated thrusters and virtually fly through space, practicing the rocket burns and docking maneuvers they'll eventually carry out while orbiting Earth.

""The purpose is to train the crew in all of the devices that they have to interact with during a mission,"" Lauderdale explains. ""The training team takes that simulation and creates all of the training scenarios in order to train the crew, train the flight controllers, to work as a team to understand what they need to do in case something goes wrong.""

And things can and do go wrong in space exploration. The world got a vivid reminder of that reality this summer: Two NASA astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, will end up spending eight months on the International Space Station -- instead of their initially planned eight days -- because of problems with the Boeing Starliner capsule they were testing.

Artemis II is a much more complicated endeavor than Starliner, so if anything goes wrong for the Artemis II crew between Earth and the moon, the contingency plans are much more limited.

""There isn't this kind of backup system because they're going to be very far away,"" says Moribah Jah, a professor of aerospace engineering and engineering mechanics at UT Austin.

""We don't have more of these Orions just sitting on shelves to go launch and rendezvous with them and all this other stuff. They're going to have to figure it out or not.""

And the high stakes and limited room for error is exactly why preparation on the ground is so essential.

""Part of the preparation of going to do something like this is understanding that there's a ... very real chance you don't come back,"" says mission specialist Jeremy Hansen. ""We're trying to understand the risks that we're taking and make an intentional decision to accept that risk or not accept that risk. And I feel really good about this program and the leadership and their courage to make hard decisions.""

Assuming everything goes according to plan, though, the crew has quite the to-do list -- and quite the view.

""Our primary task is observing, observing the moon,"" said Koch. ""Our job is to tell the scientists back home the things that lunar probes can't see or tell. And that is, what colors do human eyes see? What observations, large scale, do we see? And we're being trained to do just that, to describe and observe.""

""It's a supreme responsibility to have eyes on the far side of the moon,"" she adds.

Which leads to a key question: how often is the Artemis II crew overwhelmed by the magnitude of their upcoming task?

""I like to allow space for that every once in a while,"" says Koch. "" And for me, allowing about two seconds every couple of months is enough. The enormity when it hits me is there and it's important, but for the most part, I'm focusing on the mission and my role in it, just like any other mission.""

Wiseman admits that he sometimes dwells on it for a little more than two seconds at a time, including a recent night where he couldn't easily get to sleep, ""thinking about riding this gigantic rocket, going all the way out to the moon with Christina, Victor, Jeremy, and I had to get up and go for a walk around my living room for a second because I just couldn't get myself back into the mode of going to sleep. And I knew I needed to rest. But sometimes it does. Sometimes it hits you.""

Besides the enormity of the mission, after more than half a century some Artemis II crew members also say going back to the moon feels long overdue.

""For me, when I look at humanity and the call to explore that humans have put out there, we were always going to go back to the moon and go back to stay,"" says Koch. ""There was never a time in our history as a species when that wasn't going to happen, when we weren't going to push further. And so our role is just really answering that call."""
Woman caught smuggling more than 700 pounds of bologna at southern border: CBP,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/woman-caught-smuggling-more-than-700-pounds-bologna-southern-border-cbp,2024-09-28T09:25:08Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

A woman was busted in Presidio, Texas, for smuggling more than 700 pounds of prohibited Mexican bologna and more than 280 boxes of undeclared prescription medications through the Southern Border.

The suspect, a 43-year-old U.S. citizen, was caught at about 4 p.m. on Monday at the Presidio Port of Entry, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

She was arriving from Mexico driving a 2023 GMC Yukon when she was stopped, and she declared only a cooked meal during the initial inspection, CBP said.

CBP agriculture specialists initiated a secondary inspection and discovered several suitcases in the vehicle that appeared heavier than expected.

OVER 13K IMMIGRANTS CONVICTED OF MURDER HAVE BEEN RELEASED INTO US

The specialists opened a suitcase and found several rolls of Mexican bologna inside. A total of 40 rolls were found in the suitcases, which ended up as 748 pounds of the illegal meat.

Mexican bologna is prohibited because it is made from pork and could bring foreign animal diseases to the U.S. pork industry, CBP said.

""We stress that it is important that travelers educate themselves on what products are allowed to be legally entered from abroad,"" CBP Presidio Port Director Benito Reyes, Jr. said in a statement. ""And even if they believe an item is allowed travelers should still declare all items they are transporting to the U.S. to avoid fines and penalties.""

""The concern with pork products is that they have the potential to introduce foreign animal diseases that can have devastating effects to the U.S. economy and to our agriculture industry,"" he continued.

More than 280 boxes of undeclared medication were also found hidden inside various panels of the vehicle. These medications include Tramadol, which is a schedule IV controlled substance, as well as Fentermina, Alprazolam, Clonazapam, Diazapam, Farmapram, Ampigran and Sulfamethoxazole.

The bologna was seized and destroyed by the CBP agriculture specialists.

Golden-age rappers make a digital-age leap  --  and survive,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-23940/ll-cool-j-mc-lyte-review,2024-09-28T09:16:10Z,"LL Cool J's 2024 album The FORCE finds the rapper looser and more agile than he's sounded in years, assisted by eclectic production from Q-Tip. Cory Grimes hide caption

In 2016, De La Soul, one of rap's most elemental groups, had to start from scratch. After elevating hip-hop in the late 1980s and '90s with a four-album run that rivals any in the history of the genre, the trio found itself snake-bitten by its own inventiveness -- specifically its copious use of samples as inlays in a fanciful mosaic, which swept it into protracted legal battles that kept the music inaccessible well into the post-Napster digital age. As the members continued to seek restitution (even releasing the albums for free at one point out of frustration), they crowd-funded a new album on Kickstarter. And the Anonymous Nobody..., a largely sample-free affair in silent protest of the hostage situation around their catalog, overhauled the De La sound for an internet-connected era, taking 200 hours of recorded audio from the soul band the group toured with and melding it into a sweeping amalgamation of funk. Both their misadventures and eventual sonic migration charted the distance between the hip-hop world that De La Soul helped build and the one it found itself navigating online, challenging its very identity in the process. If the group was doomed to be anonymous to a generation of young rap fans, it would lean into that obscurity in pursuit of creative freedom. ""This is about a person selflessly giving everything they could to make something cool or new or fun or better happen,"" Trugoy the Dove told The New York Times that August. Being unplugged from the archive proved liberating.

Selflessly making something cool or new or fun or better happen in the autumn of one's artistry has been a challenge for many of De La's golden-age peers. Rummage through the late-career work of artists like Public Enemy, Ice Cube and KRS-One, and you will feel a pretty dramatic drop-off from the punchy provocations of their groundbreaking days. Some of that is a given: The fire can't burn forever, artists often fade with age, and rap has often been quick to carbon-date prospects who can't even rent a car yet. But there is also an obvious threshold requiring reorientation, a point of no return where one's grasp of their own art and its function no longer aligns with an impetuous zeitgeist. It is quite difficult to be on the cutting edge of a creative movement twice in a career, because movements change. Comparing rap in the '80s to rap in 2024 is like comparing the NBA across those same eras: They are two different games, played at different speeds and to different standards. Often, new albums from elder rappers have the feeling of still playing by the old rules, too restricted in their movements to keep pace.

In recent weeks, two pioneers of the golden-age rap revolution have released new albums that buck the pattern: LL Cool J's The FORCE, a dynamic showcase of adaptive evolution, and MC Lyte's 1 of 1, a personal manifesto for surviving the times. Both pull off an acrobatic feat of staying true to the identities that defined them as artists without feeling bogged down by all the history: up-to-speed but not trend-chasing, mature but not fossilized. Instead of self-indulgently doubling down on past triumphs or desperately chasing relevance, these albums benefit from a recommitment to craft, with slight but sharp shifts in perspective that refurbish their still-potent voices.

Once described by Alan Light in Rolling Stone as ""something rap has never seen before -- a genuine pop superstar,"" LL Cool J set the archetype for the charismatic hip-hop stud, a crossover artist standing at the center of Def Jam's foundational dynasty with a voice as booming as his lyrics were suave. Since the death of MTV, his magnetic pull has gradually waned: There hasn't been an LL album in over a decade, when 2013's Authentic seemed to cement a steady descent into obsolescence for the legend.

Throughout the 2000s, he'd continuously put out records in search of one last hit. The music was heavy on slow jams, angling for radio and packed with head-scratching features. The period was epitomized by the Brad Paisley collab ""Accidental Racist,"" a clumsy conflation of white stereotyping and Black anxiety in which he literally rapped the words, ""If you don't judge my gold chains, I'll forget the iron chains."" The song felt not just cringey but swagless, seemingly exposing a loss of the ranginess he once radiated.

By that point, he didn't need the work. Since 2009, LL has starred in the CBS procedural NCIS: Los Angeles, fronted the reality competition Lip Sync Battle and served a five-year stint as Grammy host. He was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2021, and has moved into a liminal space between artist and effigy -- ascending like Snoop Dogg to a level of cultural ubiquity that makes stepping away from rap music not simply viable but justifiable, his hip-hop legacy becoming a kind of avatar for eternal unc status. In the interim, he seemed noncommittal about rap's position in his expanding job hierarchy and conflicted about just how much he had left in the tank. In 2016, he announced a short-lived retirement, and in 2023 he appeared to scrap a comeback record for fear that it simply wasn't up to snuff: ""I'm really Trying to figure this album out. SMH,"" he wrote in a deleted series of tweets. ""Just not feeling this album is worthy of being released. I tried.""

It was shortly after that spell of doubt that he announced the mulligan that would eventually become The FORCE, a project for which he's said he had to teach himself how to rap again. The learning curve clearly wasn't too steep, because the album feels like an athlete rediscovering his limberness, his dormant muscle memory activating all at once. It is the kind of work that wouldn't have even felt possible around the time of Authentic: LL hasn't sounded this loose and comfortable since the '90s, and he does so while trying on new hats -- the Kangol still fits, though -- and reckoning with where he fits into rap now. ""It's like I died and came back, different faces and ages / On their phones and computers, no one is readin' the papers,"" he raps on ""30 Decembers."" ""And these kids don't even know who I am / You don't know you in the presence of a real made man."" It's this slight in particular that seems to be driving him the hardest. I often think of LL's 2017 tweet providing younger generations of rap stars with an ultimatum -- ""If I hear one more terrible rap record I'm gonna have to do it to these meatballs."" At the time, it felt more like a finger-wagging reprimand than a genuine threat -- but The FORCE is animated by that very desire to show the kids how it's done, and remind everyone else who he was -- and still is.

His first and perhaps pivotal act was commissioning Q-Tip as his primary producer. Seemingly ageless, Tip remains among the most ingenious beatmakers in rap, vintage yet chic. Having succeeded once already at this kind of revival exercise with the farewell A Tribe Called Quest album, We Got It from Here... Thank You 4 Your Service, here he leads LL through a series of beats that sound like rumbling, tagged-up train cars. LL treats each one as his own canvas, and it can be awe-inspiring watching a master cut loose. He goes stride for stride with Eminem on ""Murdergram Deux,"" playing around in Shady's backyard with shuffling, multisyllabic raps carried out with a mischievous air. Songs like ""Saturday Night Special"" and ""Passion"" are coolly and calmly executed, and there is a smoothness to all he does that honors his standing as a playboy charmer. The two halves of his persona -- a ladies' man of all-around appeal soaking up a lavish life, and a commanding entertainer dead-set on substantiating his timelessness -- are in perfect balance.

If The FORCE finds LL Cool J affirming his reputation, then 1 of 1 finds MC Lyte reappraising hers. A prodigy who wrote her incisive crack era polemic, ""I Cram to Understand U (Sam),"" when she was only 16, the rapper has struggled to recoup what is owed to her, on the back end and in the public consciousness. She was the first woman rapper to release a studio album, to be nominated for a Grammy as a solo artist and to have a gold single. Despite honors like BET's I Am Hip-Hop award, her impact countering rap misogyny and helping to usher in a more grounded rap movement have not been weighted as heavily as the accomplishments of her male contemporaries, and she has been transparent about her label and publishing disputes, officially reclaiming her name from First Priority Music in 2021. Only the third MC Lyte album of the 21st century and the first since 2015's Legend (which was released independently and is not available on streaming), 1 of 1 exudes a clarity of purpose befitting an artist who, on the one hand, has nothing left to prove, but on the other, is painfully aware that she has yet to receive her due. Lyte has described the album as ""a second coming of age,"" which feels fitting: The songs are charged by self-improvement, full of accumulated wisdom from an underrated overachiever.

Lyte made the album with her pastor, the Grammy-winning producer Warryn Campbell, who has existed at the intersection of gospel and rap his entire career, and together they bring her mission-minded music to a devotional place. Campbell ushers her toward reflection with beats that jump across time, from boom-bap to jazz rap with soul sampling and choir direction, and she struts through each with a matter-of-fact delivery that suggests fortitude. On ""To RockThe Mic,"" Lyte paints rap as a calling that she answered and cannot ignore: ""Can't be stopped by even what I been through / What I been through coulda shook my mental / But I kept it all together, I was meant to."" The pent-up restlessness of nearly 30 years spent on rap's margins is unleashed in bobbing verses that casually deploy her technical savvy. For every song about the obstacles she has faced throughout a tumultuous career there is one on the character-building of enduring such complications. On ""Lyte Ghost Lil Mama,"" she raps indignantly but with composure, as if trying to explain her situation to a friend -- being between deals, a label losing faith in her and scrapping a song with The Neptunes, not owning the publishing for a hit song -- but the sashaying follow-up ""Kick Back Relax"" is eased and unwound, carrying the relief and release of unclenched shoulders. ""Stress ain't nothin' but a test,"" she pledges, and in both modes her flows feel sturdy and battle-tried, moving with artisan-like grit and efficiency.

That persistence comes with a hunger for reform. At one point on 1 of 1, a skit finds Lyte canvassing in New York City to become Mayor of Hip-Hop. ""My platform is change,"" she tells a prospective voter on the streets of Flatbush. It would be more accurate to say that her platform is restoration. She wants a rehabilitation of the rapper, and reinstatement of old school values -- not an uncommon stance among rappers of a certain age, but Lyte comes at the call to action from a more empathetic place. ""We got the whole world lookin' at our game, lookin' crooked / While the man overtook it,"" she raps on ""Music Is,"" before asking, ""Can we take it back, claim it for keeps?"" The question is rhetorical. The album plays like the first step in Lyte's master plan to get things back on track. You don't have to believe what she believes to feel the weight of her efforts, which seek out a higher cause -- or rather, see rap as a means to greater advocacy.

Both LL and Lyte are anchored by the same ideals on their new albums: faith and activism. Across the two records, there is spirited music of praise and protest grounding the comebacks. The FORCE opens with the militant ""Spirit of Cyrus,"" a vision of taking on the cops later underscored by the Pantherisms of ""Huey in the Chair."" ""Nucleus of the culture, so he is African sculpture / Carved by the gods and clappin' at all these vultures,"" LL raps, drawing a line between his stature and the responsibility that comes with it. A song later, on ""Praise Him,"" he teams up with Nas, seeking to solidify himself as a rap savior. 1 of 1 opens with the gospel-infused ""Thank You,"" where Lyte turns rap into a holy undertaking: ""You're the Lyte because I made you, never be afraid to / Stand tall against 'em all and protect what I gave you,"" she raps, quoting His words to her as she takes up her mantle with renewed vigor. With protection as her mandate, she, too, stands up against violent policing and corruption on ""Change Your Ways,"" before asking other rappers to do more. Though the song veers dangerously close to respectability politics, this resolve for all rappers -- including her -- to put the needs of their constituency before personal gratification provokes bold exhibitions that treat rap as the crusader practice she has dedicated her life to.

For each artist, thinking of themselves and of rap as vessels for some kind of higher power seems key to their renewed focus. It's right there in the title of the LL album -- The FORCE, as if he is tapping into some kind of sacred continuum like the one from Star Wars. The cover art has the phrase that acronym represents, ""frequencies of real creative energy,"" scrawled in squiggly lines that imitate wavelengths. In activating those frequencies, MC Lyte and LL Cool J are able to draw upon the ever-elusive essence, the flow that pours out of all great hip-hop, no matter the era. Drawing it out requires a certain flexibility, so much confidence in one's artistic identity that there is no fear in modifying it. These new records feel like evidence that such conviction can sustain rappers through shifts in form and approach, keeping them tethered to an ever-changing world without losing a grip on the essential qualities that made them originals in the first place."
Olivia Newton-John's daughter says 'dark side' of fame led to certain lifelong struggles,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/olivia-newton-john-daughter-says-dark-side-fame-led-lifelong-struggles-self-identity,2024-09-28T08:14:30Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Two years after the death of her mother, Olivia Newton-John, Chloe Lattanzi is continuing her legacy in many ways, all while discovering new sides of herself.

In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, the 38-year-old actress and singer opened up about healing after loss, shared why she chose to fulfill a promise to her late mother on what would've been the actress's 76th birthday and explained how she's managed to find herself amid the ""dark side"" of fame.

Growing up in the spotlight, Lattanzi said she often felt like a ""chameleon"" who found herself conforming to what others wanted or expected her to be like.

OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN'S DAUGHTER SAYS MOM CONTINUES TO SHOW UP FOR HER: 'IT DOESN'T JUST END WITH YOUR BODY'

""I think we're on a constant quest. Finding yourself is really just being authentic,"" said Lattanzi, whose first solo track, ""Phoenix,"" was released Thursday. ""And when you're a child, you're authentic. You say what you think and you feel, and I think that fame is great. And, also, there's a dark side. And, for me, the dark side is I didn't feel the freedom to just be me. I felt like I had to be what the world would -- and this is all in my head -- but I had to be what the world wanted me to be, or I had to be exactly like my mother.

""I just found out what boundaries are a year ago, and I think -- I can't speak for everyone -- but, as a woman, a human being, I've shied away from conflict or not said what I really felt to appease someone and finding yourself is standing in your authenticity, always being kind. But if you don't like me or what I say, that's OK. I'm still going to say it. I'm going to be me.""

""I've struggled with being a chameleon my whole life,"" she added. ""I wanted to make everyone happy. And I'm realizing my mom dealt with that too. Being sensitive souls, you want everyone to like you, but you reach a point where that ends up killing you. ... I'm definitely on an upward trajectory in the health arena. Mind, body, spirit, because I am living in my authenticity.""

Two years after her mother's death, Lattanzi said she very much still feels her presence. The beloved ""Grease"" actress died in 2022 after a long battle with breast cancer. She was 73.

""I'm always experiencing her,"" said Lattanzi. ""I mean, she knows the truth of my reality. So, we talk, and I ask her if I'm struggling with something to kind of guide me towards the right person energetically. And I'm always guided to where I need to be to heal, to overcome whatever it is.

""She always appears in the form of an orb in a photo or through an introduction meeting a person randomly on the street,"" she continued. ""So, she is ever present and very powerfully present in my life, in spirit. I used to make her watch the paranormal shows with me, and I was like, 'That's an orb, Mama.' I said, 'It's going to be a long time, long time until you're in orb, but when you're in that place, will you please show up like that for me?' And she took a photo with my phone, and then this beautiful giant bright blue orb flying around my dog's head.

""And then the next day she was flying up the side of my dad, Matt Lattanzi, his wife, she's also a cancer survivor twice. And the same exact blue orb is flying up the side of her. And my dad is like, 'I can't explain this.' ... So yeah, she was like, 'Chloe, I'm going to go everywhere and show you that I'm here, and I'm looking out for everyone.'""

In honor of what would've been her mom's 76th birthday, Lattanzi released her first solo track, ""Phoenix.""

""I co-wrote the song with Dave Audé and another fantastic writer, and the song was, for her, it was a promise,"" Lattanzi said. ""She would always say that we were symbiotic. We were one heart and two bodies, and the most important thing to her was that she saw her baby happy and thriving and shining. So, it was a promise to her that I would be true to myself, be gentle with myself, use my talents, get rid of the negative self-talk, essentially.

""Most of us humans, we need that message, that reminder every day that we're incredible and capable of any dream that we want to achieve,"" she continued. ""And it was a promise that I'll be happy. You don't have to worry about your little girl.""

OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN'S DAUGHTER CHLOE REVEALS 'PROMISE' SHE MADE TO MOTHER BEFORE HER DEATH

Lattanzi, who shared the demo with Newton-John before her death, said she hopes the song can lift up others who are struggling.

""I also wrote it to uplift other people, to remind them that the light is much more powerful than the dark,"" she said. ""And you're not defined by trauma, you're not defined by what has happened to you in your past. You're defined by what you choose to do with it.""

""And my mom was moved to tears, and she said, 'This is the best work you've ever done,'"" Lattanzi recalled. ""She always loved hearing my voice upfront, and her and I have that in common production-wise in music. We like it. Very simple. Vocals upfront, keep production at a minimum. So she wept, and I said, 'This song is for you, Mom. I wrote this for you. This is my promise to you.' So releasing it on her birthday is very sacred.""

In addition to the song's release, Lattanzi will continue to carry on her mother's legacy in a special way.

On Oct. 6, Lattanzi will lead the annual Olivia's Walk for Wellness in Melbourne, Australia, to benefit the Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness and Research Centre.

""I feel like I'm keeping my mother alive, and she taught me that,"" said Lattanzi. ""Her and I, we both suffered different ailments, but we both wanted to help others who were suffering from what we were suffering. So, I'm similar to her in that way. And I don't feel there's any greater purpose than to be of service and to connect to other beings, whether they human or animal.""

Israel strikes Hezbollah in blast targeting the militant group's leader,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25272/israel-strikes-hezbollah-in-blast-targeting-leader,2024-09-28T07:58:55Z,"BEIRUT -- The Israeli military said it struck Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut on Friday in a series of massive explosions that targeted the leader of the militant group and leveled multiple high-rise apartment buildings.

At least six people were killed and 91 were wounded, Lebanon's health ministry said. It was the biggest blast to hit the Lebanese capital in the past year and appeared likely to push the escalating conflict closer to full-fledged war.

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was the target of the strikes, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity, including one United States official. The Israeli army declined to comment on who it was targeting. It was not immediately clear if Nasrallah was at the site, and Hezbollah did not comment on the report.

The death toll is likely to rise significantly as teams comb through the rubble of six buildings. Israel launched a series of strikes on other areas of the southern suburbs following the initial blast.

After the strikes, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abruptly cut short a visit to the United States to return home. Hours earlier, he addressed the United Nations, vowing that Israel's intensified campaign against Hezbollah over the past two weeks would continue -- further dimming hopes for an internationally backed cease-fire.

News of the blasts came as Netanyahu was briefing reporters after his U.N. address. A military aide whispered into his ear, and Netanyahu quickly ended the briefing.

Israeli army spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the strikes targeted the main Hezbollah headquarters, saying it was located underground beneath residential buildings.

The series of blasts at around nightfall reduced six apartment towers to rubble in Haret Hreik, a densely populated, predominantly Shiite district of Beirut's Dahiyeh suburbs, according to Lebanon's national news agency. A wall of billowing black and orange smoke rose into the sky as windows were rattled and houses shaken some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Beirut.

Footage showed rescue workers clambering over large slabs of concrete, surrounded by high piles of twisted metal and wreckage. Several craters were visible, one with a car toppled into it. A stream of residents carrying their belongings were seen fleeing along a main road out of the district.

Israel provided no immediate comment about the type of bomb or how many it used, but the resulting explosion levelled an area greater than a city block. The Israeli army has in its arsenal 2,000-pound, American-made ""Bunker Buster"" guided bombs designed specifically for hitting subterranean targets.

Richard Weir, crisis and weapons researcher with Human Rights Watch, said the blasts were consistent with that class of bomb.

Israel's air forces followed with a new set of strikes early Saturday, also in the southern suburbs, shortly after warning residents of three buildings to evacuate. It said they were being used by Hezbollah to hide weapons, including anti-ship missiles.

Israel's military announced additional attacks on Beqaa in eastern Lebanon and Tyre in the south.

To a degree unseen in past conflicts, Israel spent the week pushing to eliminate Hezbollah's senior leadership. But an attempt to assassinate Nasrallah -- successful or not -- would be a major escalation. The Pentagon said the U.S. had no advance warning of the strikes.

Nasrallah has been in hiding for years, very rarely appearing in public. He regularly gives speeches, but always by video from unknown locations.

The site hit Friday evening had not been publicly known as Hezbollah's main headquarters, though it is located in the group's ""security quarters,"" a heavily guarded part of Haret Hreik where it has offices and runs several nearby hospitals.

Four hours after the strike, Hezbollah had still not issued any statement referring to it. Instead, it announced that it had launched a salvo of rockets at the Israeli city of Safed, which it said was ""in defense of Lebanon and its people, and in response to the barbaric Israeli violation of cities, villages and civilians.""

The Israeli military said a house and a car in Safed were hit, and officials said a 68-year-old woman sustained mild shrapnel wounds.

Israel dramatically intensified its airstrikes in Lebanon this week, saying it is determined to put an end to more than 11 months of Hezbollah fire into its territory. The escalated campaign has killed more than 720 people in Lebanon, including dozens of women and children, according to Health Ministry statistics. A predawn strike Friday in the mainly Sunni border town of Chebaa killed nine members of the same family, the state news agency said.

The United Nations said the fighting has displaced 211,000 people, including 85,000 now staying in public schools and other shelters. Airstrikes have forced 20 primary health care centers to shut down and disrupted access to clean water for nearly 300,000 people.

The scope of Israel's operation remains unclear, but officials have said a ground invasion to push the militant group away from the border is a possibility. Israel moved thousands of troops toward the border in preparation.

At the U.N., Netanyahu vowed to ""continue degrading Hezbollah"" until Israel achieves its goals. His comments dampened hopes for a U.S.-backed call for a 21-day truce between Israel and Hezbollah to allow time for a diplomatic solution. Hezbollah has not responded to the proposal.

Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, saying it was a show of support for the Palestinians. Since then, it and the Israeli military have traded fire almost daily, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee their homes on both sides of the border.

An Israeli security official said he expects the campaign against Hezbollah would not last for as long as the current war in Gaza, because the military's goals are much narrower.

In Gaza, Israel aims to dismantle Hamas' military and political regime, but the goal in Lebanon is to push Hezbollah away from the border -- ""not a high bar like Gaza"" in terms of operational objectives, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to military briefing guidelines.

In the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, civil defense workers pulled the bodies of two women -- 35-year-old Hiba Ataya and her mother Sabah Olyan -- from the rubble of a building brought down by a strike.

""That's Sabah, these are her clothes, my love,"" one man cried out as her body emerged.

Israel says its accelerated strikes have already inflicted heavy damage on Hezbollah's weapons capabilities and its fighters. A strike Tuesday in southern Lebanon killed a Hezbollah missile unit commander, Muhammad Ali Ismail, and his deputy, Israel's military said Saturday. There was no immediate confirmation from Hezbollah.

But Hezbollah boasted a large arsenal of rockets and missiles and its remaining capacities are unknown.

Hezbollah officials and their supporters remain defiant. Not long before the explosions Friday evening, thousands gathered in another part of Beirut's suburbs for the funeral of three Hezbollah members killed in earlier strikes, including the head of the group's drone unit, Mohammed Surour.

People in the giant crowd waved their fists in the air and chanted, ""We will never accept humiliation,"" as they marched marched behind the three coffins, wrapped in the group's yellow flag.

Hussein Fadlallah, Hezbollah's top official in Beirut, said in a speech that no matter how many commanders Israel kills, the group has endless numbers of experienced fighters. He vowed that Hezbollah will keep fighting until Israel stops its offensive in Gaza.

""We will not abandon the support of Palestine, Jerusalem and oppressed Gaza,"" Fadlallah said. ""There is no place for neutrality in this battle."""
College football team stranded in buses on flooded interstate amid Hurricane Helene destruction,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/college-football-team-stranded-buses-flooded-interstate-amid-hurricane-helene-destruction,2024-09-28T07:24:25Z,"Fox Weather's Kendall Smith provides an update on the 'extremely impactful' and 'very devastating' storm on 'America Reports.'

A college football team was stranded on buses in the middle of a flooded interstate in North Carolina on Friday night, as Hurricane Helene continued to bring flash flooding across multiple southeastern states.

The team, East Tennessee State University (ETSU), was on its way to a game in Charlston to play The Citadel. But the team's buses only made it as far as Exit 44 on I-26 when they hit floodwaters and were forced to stop on the shoulder.

""We have been stranded on our buses outside of Asheville since 11AM today because of the flooding. We were headed to Charleston to play The Citadel tomorrow at 2PM, but are stuck and sleeping on the buses tonight in the parking lot,"" ETSU quarterback coach Tyler Dell said in a text message to OutKick's Clay Travis. ""...No hotels with capacity or power and no food anywhere near. We haven't had cell service all day and it's still down throughout the area.""

The team's head coach, Tre Lamb, said the team was finally able to get out of the ""flood trap"" after 14 hours.

""It got very scary on some low ground for a few hours, we had to find high ground. Shoutout to our bus drivers, athletic trainers, staff, officers for keeping everyone calm,"" he wrote in a post on X.

Lamb said a random stranger gave the coaches a ride to shelter and later let them know the highway was open. He said they had no access to any information.

""Have yet to speak with families or loved ones but we are on the way and ready to play @Citadel1842 whenever they decide,"" Lamb wrote. ""Prayers for all affected. What an awful storm we saw first hand. Lots of stranded families.""

Hurricane Helene has already resulted in the postponement or cancelation of more than one other college football games this weekend. The storm was downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone.

Lady Gaga Previews 'Joker: Folie À Deux' With Companion Album 'Harlequin',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cmalone/2024/09/27/lady-gaga-previews-joker-folie--deux-with-companion-album-harlequin/,2024-09-28T01:39:51Z,"Lady Gaga hasn't taken her foot off the gas this year. Her concert film Gaga Chromatica Ball dropped in the spring and she wrapped up her Jazz + Piano residency in Las Vegas in July; a few weeks after that, she gave an unforgettable performance in French at the Opening Ceremony of the Olympics in Paris. And just last month, she teased her return to music with the Bruno Mars collab ""Die With a Smile.""

Now, the highly anticipated release of Joker: Folie à Deux is just a week away, and Gaga is starting the celebration early with Harlequin, her companion album for the movie containing soundtrack songs and two new original tracks.

The album largely consists of covers of beloved jazz standards and other classics from the past century that are featured throughout the film in some way. From ""Good Morning"" and ""Get Happy"" to ""That's Entertainment"" and ""Smile,"" Gaga -- or rather, her character Lee -- puts her own spin on Great American Songbook.

In the lead-up to the album's release, Gaga dubbed the project ""LG 6.5,"" a cheeky indication that this project is something completely separate from her upcoming studio album, codenamed LG7, due out in February. When speaking to Rolling Stone about the distinction and whether this qualifies as a Lady Gaga album or a Harley Quinn album, she explained how the creation of this album itself is emblematic of her artistic career as a whole.

""I view this as both, actually,"" she said. ""It's a Lady Gaga record, but it's also inspired by my character and my vision of what a woman can be. It's why the album does not adhere to one genre.""

She expanded on that idea in an interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music.

""For me, this idea of dual identities was always something that was a part of my music-making, and I was always kind of creating characters in my music. And when I made Lee for Joker, she just really had this profound effect on me,"" Gaga said. ""I was able to discover the character through the [movie's] story, through the music that we did live every day as well as dance and the costumes and the makeup.""

After it was all said and done, Gaga wasn't able to step out of the Harley Quinn character. So, while she was still mentally living as Lee, she created something that the iconic comic book figure herself would be proud of.

""I kind of had this deep experience with the character, and she just didn't really leave me creatively, and I decided I wanted to make a whole album inspired by her,"" Gaga said. ""She's a really complex woman."""

The University of Colorado's football team, led by head coach Deion Sanders, will play the University of Central Florida Saturday in Orange County, Florida. Hurricane Helene has wreaked havoc in recent days across multiple states, including Florida, with a death toll near 40 and an expected $15 billion to $26 billion in property damage.

Despite this destruction, Colorado's social media team posted on social media Friday a computer-designed graphic showing safety Cam'Ron Silmon-Craig standing on a Florida beach with water up to his knees.

The post said ""24 hours,"" an apparent reference to the countdown to the game Saturday. The post was later deleted from Colorado's social media account. The image also had a sign in the background that said ""Beware of Sharks,"" an apparent reference to Silmon-Craig's nickname, ""Shark.""

Legislation for the award passed in September 2023 on the 50th anniversary of King's victory over Bobby Riggs in the ""Battle of the Sexes."" The bill passed unanimously in the Senate.

President Biden signed the legislation into law Thursday.

King relentlessly advocated for equal pay in tennis. Her efforts led to the U.S. Open becoming the first Grand Slam tournament to offer men and women equal prize money in 1973.

In 2014, she founded the Billie Jean King Foundation, a nonprofit creating an equitable future through sports, education and activism.

King was dominant, winning 39 Grand Slam titles, 12 singles titles, 16 titles in women's doubles and 11 titles in mixed doubles. She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1987.

King is also the first woman to have a major sports venue named in her honor. In 2006, the USTA National Tennis Center in Flushing, New York, home of the U.S. Open, was rededicated as the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center."
California man accused of throwing bomb in courthouse said government took his firearms away: DOJ,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-man-accused-throwing-bomb-courthouse-government-took-firearm-doj,2024-09-28T00:47:58Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here.

The man who allegedly threw a bomb inside a California courthouse this week, injuring five people, said he was upset about his firearms being taken away, authorities said.

Nathaniel James McGuire, 20, of Santa Maria, is charged with maliciously damaging a building by means of an explosive, the Justice Department said Friday.

He was expected to appear in a Los Angeles federal court Friday.

""This defendant will now face justice in federal court for his alleged attack that injured at least five people and struck fear across a county courthouse and an entire community,"" said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland.

McGuire entered the lobby of a Santa Maria courthouse Wednesday, and threw a bag with a bomb, which exploded, federal prosecutors said. After the blast, he fled on foot.

Five people were injured.

McGuire was arrested a short time later while trying to get into a Ford Mustang parked outside the building, authorities said. He allegedly yelled that the ""government had taken his guns and that everyone needed to fight, rise up, and rebel,"" the Justice Department said.

Police say McGuire's motive stemmed from a previous arrest for having an unregistered firearm. He was due in court the morning of the incident.

Inside McGuire's car, a Santa Barbara sheriff's deputy allegedly spotted ammunition, a flare gun, and a box of fireworks. Inside, authorities found a shotgun, a rifle, more ammunition, a suspected bomb, and 10 Molotov cocktails, prosecutors said.

Law enforcement later rendered the bomb safe.

At McGuire's home, authorities allegedly found an empty can with nails glued to the outside, a duffel bag containing matches, black powder, used and unused fireworks, and papers that appeared to be recipes for explosive material.

None of the five people hit by the explosion faced life-threatening injuries, police say. Four were transported directly to the hospital from the scene, and the fifth traveled to the hospital on their own.

The victims were treated for injuries including burns, and they have now all been released from the hospital.

McGuire faces up to 40 years in prison.

'Harry Potter' star Maggie Smith receives tributes from Hollywood: 'We will never see another',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/harry-potter-star-maggie-smith-receives-tributes-from-hollywood-we-never-see-another,2024-09-28T00:32:20Z,"The actress best known for her roles in 'Harry Potter' and 'Downton Abbey' leaves behind an enviable body of work. (Credit: AP)

Actress Maggie Smith died ""peacefully"" Sept. 27, and Hollywood did not hesitate with tributes.

Daniel Radcliffe, Smith's ""Harry Potter"" co-star, issued a statement honoring the star, who portrayed Professor Minerva McGonagall, the head of Gryffindor House, in the franchise.

""The first time I met Maggie Smith I was 9 years old and we were reading through scenes for 'David Copperfield,' which was my first job. I knew virtually nothing about her other than that my parents were awestruck at the fact that I would be working with her,"" Radcliffe said in a statement to Variety.

""The other thing I knew about her was that she was a Dame, so the first thing I asked her when we met was 'would you like me to call you Dame?' at which she laughed and said something to the effect of 'don't be ridiculous!' I remember feeling nervous to meet her and then her putting me immediately at ease. She was incredibly kind to me on that shoot, and then I was lucky enough to go on working with her for another 10 years on the 'Harry Potter' films.

MAGGIE SMITH, 'DOWNTON ABBEY' AND 'HARRY POTTER' STAR, DEAD AT 89

""She was a fierce intellect, a gloriously sharp tongue, could intimidate and charm in the same instant and was, as everyone will tell you, extremely funny. I will always consider myself amazingly lucky to have been able to work with her, and to spend time around her on set. The word legend is overused but if it applies to anyone in our industry then it applies to her. Thank you, Maggie.""

King Charles III honored Smith in a statement to GBN Friday.

""The word legend is overused but if it applies to anyone in our industry then it applies to her. Thank you Maggie.""

""My wife and I were deeply saddened to learn of the death of Dame Maggie Smith. As the curtain comes down on a national treasure, we join all those around the world in remembering with the fondest admiration and affection her many great performances, and her warmth and wit that shone through both on and off the stage,"" his statement said.

Hugh Bonneville, who starred alongside Smith in ""Downton Abbey,"" said in a statement to The Associated Press, ""Anyone who ever shared a scene with Maggie will attest to her sharp eye, sharp wit and formidable talent. She was a true legend of her generation and thankfully will live on in so many magnificent screen performances. My condolences to her boys and wider family.""

Rob Lowe took to X, formerly Twitter, and wrote, ""Saddened to hear Dame Maggie Smith has passed. I had the unforgettable experience of working with her; sharing a two-shot was like being paired with a lion. She could eat anyone alive, and often did. But funny, and great company. And suffered no fools. We will never see another. God speed, Ms. Smith!""

George Takei wrote, ""A grand star of screen and stage has departed. Maggie Smith, known most recently for her unforgettable roles as the Dowager Countess in Downton Abbey and as Professor McGonagall in the Harry Potter films, passed away at age 89. Fans both old and young shall miss her dearly.""

Ariana Grande shared a photo of Smith on her Instagram story and included several hearts and infinity signs.

""Maggie Smith was a great woman and a brilliant actress. I still can't believe I was lucky enough to work with the 'one-of-a-kind.' My heartfelt condolences go out to the family...RIP,"" Whoopi Goldberg, who starred in ""Sister Act"" with Smith, wrote on Instagram.

Mark Cuban spars with Riley Gaines over Harris' handling of the border crisis,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mark-cuban-spars-riley-gaines-over-harris-handling-border-crisis,2024-09-27T23:59:56Z,"Billionaire investor Mark Cuban unpacks the dueling economic plans pitched by Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump on 'Your World.'

Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban used his X platform Friday to respond to 24-year-old former college swimmer and conservative activist Riley Gaines over criticisms of Vice President Kamala Harris' handling of the southern border.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) released data to lawmakers Friday revealing that tens of thousands of illegal immigrants with sex offenses and homicide convictions have crossed the border into the U.S. under the Biden-Harris administration. These include 13,099 convicted of homicide and 15,811 of sexual assault.

Cuban, who has been a staunch advocate for Harris, Joe Biden in 2020 and Hillary Clinton in 2016, has defended the VP's record on the border. Cuban even said he thinks the actions she has taken to reduce the flow of illegal migrants across the southern border ""have actually worked"" in a recent CNBC interview.

Gaines called out Cuban for his praise of the vice president in a post on X Friday.

""We might have different standards for what qualifies as a 'good job,' but I don't think the illegal entrance of 15,000+ rapists, 13,000+ murderers, and 320,000 missing children fits the bill,"" Gaines, the host of OutKick's ""Gaines for Girls"" podcast wrote.

Gaines' reference to the 320,000 missing children is from another report from the Department of Homeland Security released Aug. 21 that revealed the Biden-Harris administration has lost track of that number of migrant children who crossed the border without parents.

Cuban responded to Gaines in his own X post just 90 minutes later. Cuban admitted the current administration ""waited too long to fix the border."" But he then criticized Trump for his promise to carry out the largest mass deportation in American history if elected.

""I have said many times they waited too long to fix the border. The good news is that the latest crossing numbers are lower than Jan 21 and staying near 1,500 a day,"" Cuban wrote, along with screenshots of two articles covering a statistical reduction in illegal border crossings.

""And the VP has been clear she will sign the bi-partisan border bill. It's a fair argument to criticize them for waiting too long. But you also have to acknowledge that they are now having success. Which leads to the question of deportations. The Republican nominee says he is going to deport the 21 million people here illegally. He hasn't said how he will do it.""

TRUMP'S MEAL FOR ALABAMA-GEORGIA FOOTBALL GAME INCLUDES NEARLY 800 CALORIES FROM MCDONALD'S ALONE

Cuban referenced a border bill that Senate Democrats failed to pass through Congress in May when all but one Republican senator, along with six Democrats, voted to block it.

Democrats argued the bill was intended to reduce border crossings, raise the standard for migrants to qualify for asylum and empower officials to rapidly send away those who fail to meet that standard. It would give the president power to shut down the border if migration levels exceed certain thresholds. But concerns about the bill were raised with earlier drafts having the border provisions attached to funding for Ukraine and Israel.

Gaines responded to Cuban's defense of his praise for Harris in another X post Friday evening, discrediting the statistics Cuban offered and slamming the border bill.

""They're flying in illegal immigrants and dropping them into the heartland of America, often in places we don't even know about,"" Gaines wrote. ""The bi-partisan border bill is a Trojan horse. The first time it was voted on it included funding for Ukraine. She campaigns on securing the border acknowledging (indirectly) the problems that have been created under the Biden Harris Admin. she's been in the White House for 3.5 years. Why not take action now?""

Gaines also called out Cuban for not addressing the 320,000 missing children statistic she mentioned in her first post.

Cuban had not responded to Gaines again at the time of publication.

Cuban's defense of Harris and Democrats has ramped up in recent weeks. He has done several interviews endorsing the VP in the upcoming election, making statements that have raised eyebrows from conservative voters. Cuban has suggested Trump is ""a socialist"" and even said he believes the mainstream media ""leans right"" in a recent CNBC interview.

Earlier this year, when Biden was still the presumptive Democratic nominee, Cuban went so far as to say he would vote for Biden over Trump even if Biden was ""being given his last rites.""

""If they were having his last wake, and it was him versus Trump, and he was being given last rites, I would still vote for Joe Biden,"" Cuban told Bloomberg News in March.

However, Cuban has also said he supported Trump at the outset of his first candidacy in 2015.

""In 2015, I was like, 'He's great. He's not a typical Stepford candidate. I thought that was a positive,"" Cuban told Vivek Ramaswamy in an interview on X Aug. 7.

Gaines has been an advocate for Trump in this election cycle. Gaines even spoke at one of Trump's rallies in Glendale, Arizona, Aug. 23. There, Gaines made a speech in which she claimed she was voting for Trump ""because I'm a woman.""

""They don't believe in school choice; they don't believe in parental rights or the safeguarding of children; they don't believe in freedom unless it's the freedom to have an abortion or chemically and surgically castrate children,"" she said.

""You have one ticket that knows what a woman is and has vowed to take decisive action at protecting our sex-based rights, compared to the other ticket that thinks men can become pregnant, and that tampons belong in boys' bathrooms.""

Harris will make a rare visit to the southern border in Arizona as she seeks to blunt criticism from former President Trump on the matter and renews her call for the bipartisan border bill. Conservatives were not swayed by the visit.

""Border Czar Kamala Harris has had nearly four years to protect America and failed,"" RJ Hauman, president of the National Immigration Center for Enforcement (NICE), told Fox News Digital in response to the data. ""She is allowing tens of thousands of murderers and rapists to roam free. She puts criminals first and the safety and security of you and your family last."""
Boise State women's volleyball forfeits upcoming match against SJSU amid controversy surrounding trans player,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/boise-state-womens-volleyball-forfeits-upcoming-game-against-sjsu-amid-controversy-surrounding-trans-player,2024-09-27T22:46:16Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The Boise State women's volleyball team forfeited its game against San Jose State University Saturday amid controversy surrounding a transgender member of the Spartans' roster.

It's the second team this month to opt out of playing against SJSU.

Boise State Athletics released a statement exclusively to OutKick less than 24 hours before the Mountain West Conference match.

The statement did not provide an explanation for the forfeiture.

""Boise State volleyball will not play its scheduled match at San José State on Saturday, Sept. 28,"" the statement said. ""Per Mountain West Conference policy, the Conference will record the match as a forfeit and a loss for Boise State. The Broncos will next compete on Oct. 3 against Air Force.""

The NCAA also provided OutKick with a statement in response to Boise State's decision.

""College sports are the premier stage for women's sports in America, and the NCAA members will continue to promote Title IX, make unprecedented investments in women's sports and ensure fair competition for all student-athletes in all NCAA championships.""

Friday's news follows controversy surrounding SJSU's women's volleyball team after a current player joined several other female athletes in suing the NCAA for Title IX violations.

Blaire Fleming, a redshirt junior at San Jose State University, plays as an outside and right-side hitter on the women's volleyball team. Fleming, a transgender athlete, has played two seasons at SJSU after previously playing at Coastal Carolina.

SEN BLACKBURN CALLS ON NCAA TO REQUIRE THAT ONLY 'BIOLOGICALLY FEMALE STUDENTS' COMPETE IN WOMEN'S SPORTS

Earlier this week, Fleming's teammate, Brooke Slusser, joined former NCAA swimmer Riley Gaines and several other female athletes in suing the NCAA over its policies regarding transgender athletes that they claim compromise the fairness and integrity of women's competitive sports while also putting women at risk.

""I commend Boise State's athletic department and everyone involved in the decision to forfeit their match against undefeated San Jose State,"" Gaines said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""Some principles transcend winning on the court, and the safety and well-being of female athletes is one of them. It's encouraging to witness a growing number of institutions prioritizing fairness and athlete safety over forced inclusion. I hope to see more universities follow the lead of Boise State and Southern Utah, standing up for what's right and protecting the integrity of women's sports.""

According to the complaint, Slusser claimed she was not aware that Fleming was transgender despite sharing rooms together on team trips. Slusser also expressed safety concerns for opponents playing against Fleming.

""Brooke estimates that Fleming's spikes were traveling upward of 80 mph, which was faster than she had ever seen a woman hit a volleyball,"" Slusser's complaint said, via the Cowboy State Daily. ""The girls were doing everything they could to dodge Fleming's spikes but still could not fully protect themselves.""

""One thing that's important in this case is really the physical safety issues in volleyball,"" Slusser's attorney, Bill Bock, told OutKick. ""And that's what they're facing in practice every day. So, it's just a crazy, misguided policy that steals athletic dreams from women and gives them to men, and, at the same time, puts women's health and safety in danger.""

Boise State is the second team to opt out of playing against SJSU. Earlier this month, Southern Utah was participating in the Santa Clara Tournament but only played against two of three opponents, choosing not to play against SJSU.

""The Southern Utah University volleyball team has opted to compete in just two non-conference games at the Santa Clara Tournament this weekend,"" the school said in a statement to OutKick at the time.

""The Thunderbirds are eager to make the most of these matches and continue building momentum for a successful season. Southern Utah has informed the tournament directors and opposing teams of this decision, and we wish them well with the remainder of their respective seasons.""

The Spartans remain undefeated this season with a 9-0 record. In their latest win over Fresno State, Fleming led the team with 16 kills. SJSU did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment."
How Generosity Helps Pinky Cole Hayes Wins At Business,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lydiatblanco/2024/09/27/how-generosity-helps-pinky-cole-hayes-wins-at-business/,2024-09-27T22:28:35Z,"Aisha ""Pinky"" Cole Hayes, founder and CEO of Slutty Vegan, has risen to prominence in the restaurant industry. And if you ask her, she'll tell you it's partly due to her generosity that surpasses a personal need to be successful. Since opening the doors to the first Slutty Vegan, a casual food chain restaurant, in Atlanta, Georgia, Cole Hayes has raised $25 million in Series A funding, opened 14 locations across the nation, and has built the vegan hamburger company into a $100 million business. Along the path to multimillions, Cole Hayes has built her philanthropic and media portfolio by giving back to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, former employees by gifting them with franchises, and her platform, American Sesh.

As the face of Slutty Vegan and the brains behind the operation, Cole Hayes stays grounded by being authentic and transparent about who she is as a woman and business owner. However, she has tapped into a new level of clarity to experience a renewed sense of freedom in life.

""I haven't always been clear. That lack of clarity resulted from caring about what people thought about me, how I showed up in the world, and what I created. I've always been a people pleaser because I'm in the consumer-facing business. It's important to please people. On the flip side, that has also been a thing that has held me back. So, these days, I have a different level of mental clarity that is at peace with showing up in my authenticity. It's a different layer of authenticity that gets me excited every day - because no matter what happens, I will always be real. I'm always going to be honest. I'm always going to be me. That is a piece of clarity that money cannot buy,"" said Cole Hayes.

In addition to being clear about her boundaries and business decisions, Cole Hayes is firm and unwavering about helping small business owners and entrepreneurs get the knowledge, access, and support they need to be efficacious.

That inclination to give and share freely often shows up in the form of Cole Hayes attending community meetings and sharing business tips with her million-plus following on social media and her media platform, American Sesh. Most recently, she and her husband (and fellow restauranteur) Derrick Hayes took centerstage at REVOLT WORLD in Atlanta, Georgia, to help other entrepreneurs unlock the secrets to building a business from the ground up.

Cole Hayes' traditional Jamaican mother is also to thank for her core values to uplift others.

""My mother was just such a giving spirit. I didn't even realize that my mother was teaching me how to show up in the world - and how to be a steward, a lender and not a borrower. In business, board members have a fiduciary responsibility. As a successful entrepreneur, I have a moral responsibility to be able to support those who look like me and who want opportunities,"" said Cole Hayes. And she said that is something she's not willing to bend on. ""I don't think that will ever change, which is why not many people like me get to make it this far. I don't take that for granted. I'm able to go into rooms that not a lot of Black women have been able to enter. Now that I'm in the room, I'm welcoming other people in. And I'm very strategic and intentional about that.""

On any given day, she advocates for small business owners who might struggle to stay in business by spreading the word by mouth. And it has been proven to be effective. In fact, according to research conducted by Dynata in 2021, 42 percent of Black-owned businesses are discovered by word-of-mouth marketing.

When asked what inspires her to show up the way she does as a leader, Cole Hayes shared that it's the responsibility that comes with access for which she's worked hard.

""I am touching the helm of billion-dollar garments, and I have a different level of access. If I fumble that access, it affects every single person who is trying, praying, and working to get the kind of access I have. What keeps me motivated is that there are people who believe in me to continue to make it,"" said Cole Hayes. ""So, my business decisions are no longer just about Pinky and what's best for Pinky. It's about what's best for the culture. I'm not just selling burgers and fries. Any move I make will affect how people look at Black-owned businesses, women founders, and Black women founders.""

Running a multi-million-dollar business and being a servant leader is not for the faint of heart. That is why Cole Hayes centers her spirituality, husband, children, and family at the core of everything she does.

As a businesswoman, she trusts her intuition when making decisions. She also leans into the most important relationship in her life and in business, which is with her husband Mr. Hayes, who is the CEO of Big Dave's Cheesesteaks. Together, they have been recognized as a powerful couple within the restaurant industry. In recent months, the Hayes' have landed residencies in Las Vegas and signed deals with the National Basketball Association's Orlando Magic team.

""I don't know what I did to deserve my equal, but he is a person who dreams like me, who wants to win like me, who feels like the underdog like me, who has to prove himself to the world like me, but is also passionate like me,"" said Cole Hayes.

She hopes their public display of love will inspire others to win at business with their partner. And she is grateful to be doing life and business with Mr. Hayes. ""Some people think it's hard because we're in two different food genres within the industry. It's easy. He makes meat, and I make vegan food, but we both have the same goals. When you find someone who thinks like you and enjoys what you do, even when you disagree, that becomes a safe space. You hold on to people like that. So, I'm grateful and blessed to be able to meet somebody with whom I could bear children. I'm grateful for him and everything that we've created together.""

As a mother of three, Cole Hayes values spending quality time with her family and experiencing significant moments with her children as they reach milestones.

Every so often, the 2017 report by Prosperity Now and the Institute for Policy Studies regarding wealth in the Black community by 2053 resurfaces. As the 2024 presidential election nears, the conversation about the projected median income for Black people in America reaching zero dollars has come about again.

While Black business owners own 3.5 million businesses and employ more than 1.2 million people, according to the US Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy, Cole Hayes believes that people in high places within equity firms and those with access can help combat the 2053 projections.

""I think private equity firms are at the helm of the future of Black wealth. If people in power at private equity or investment firms are not predatory, that creates a safe space for Black entrepreneurs to raise funding for their businesses, sell their companies, and build generational wealth,"" said Cole Hayes. However, she said that one challenge that can arise is when Black people don't hold the door open for one another. ""By the time investors who look like us get to the top, they often have gone through so many hills and valleys that they become cold. And when they become cold, at that point, it becomes about self. When it becomes about self, it's less about opening the door for other people and more about securing their spot so they don't lose it.""

So, how do Black founders sustain themselves?

""There needs to be more people that are intentional about wealth creation for Black people. The more spaces I go, the more people I can bring. Now, if there are 15 or 20 Pinky Cole Hayes', we can solve the problem. But people who are intentional about growing wealth rarely get into spaces with a lot of money to be able to give it back,"" said Cole Hayes.

Nevertheless, many would testify that she is doing her part.

When Cole Hayes enters a room or a conversation, confidence precedes her.

""Confidence goes a long way. If I go flat broke today, I know that I have my personality and confidence. I can walk into every room like I own it,"" said Cole Hayes.

To women looking to start or level up in their business, she implores them to go against the grain and take charge of their future by showing up boldly and politically.

""This game (business and entrepreneurship) isn't designed for us. But now that we know it isn't designed for us, we have to take it by the balls and make it about us. We have an opportunity right now, more than ever, to own, dominate, and take control. That's why it is so important to vote. It's essential because we have the opportunity to have a woman in a position that would change how women show up in America."" said Cole Hayes."
College football Week 5 preview: Five best games to watch this weekend,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/college-football-week-5-preview-five-best-games-watch-weekend,2024-09-27T22:21:47Z,"Week 5 is here with plenty of exciting matchups between ranked opponents. There's the SEC championship rematch from last season between No. 2 Georgia and No. 4 Alabama, there's a critical Big 12 showdown between No. 20 Oklahoma State and No. 23 Kansas State, and there's an intriguing meeting in the Big Ten when No. 19 Illinois visits No. 9 Penn State.

This is the last weekend of September, which means that the season is really only just heating up. And we're going to learn a lot more about which teams are legitimate College Football Playoff contenders as October approaches.

There won't be any surprises here. Michigan is going to run the ball, so Minnesota needs to shut it down to have any hope of leaving Ann Arbor with a win.

As we learned last week, first-year Wolverines coach Sherrone Moore is going to ride with QB Alex Orji over Davis Warren for the foreseeable future. Orji doesn't throw the ball very much, but he and Michigan's running backs can move the chains with their legs. Last week, Kalel Mullings got hot and had 17 carries for 159 yards with two touchdowns in a huge win over USC. That seems to be Moore's offensive game plan, and he's sticking to it.

The Gophers have the nation's No. 2 passing defense, but that's not going to matter much here. They're giving up nearly 125 ypg on the ground and allowed four rushing touchdowns in last week's 31-14 loss to Iowa. Transfer QB Max Brosmer gives Minnesota an edge in the passing game, but it might not be enough to overcome the talent Michigan has on its defense.

No. 20 Oklahoma State at No. 23 Kansas State (12 p.m. ET on ESPN)

Both teams are still very much in the hunt to win the Big 12 despite entering this game fresh off losses. Oklahoma State is coming off a tough 22-19 result vs. Utah, while Kansas State fell short on the road at BYU, losing 38-9.

A key matchup will be Wildcats quarterback Avery Johnson against the Cowboys' defense. Johnson had a poor performance last week, throwing for 130 yards with no touchdowns and two interceptions. OSU has one of the worst defenses in the country, though, allowing more than 460 yards per game, so this would be an opportunity for the young QB to get back on track.

Mike Gundy said his offense was ""awful"" vs. Utah. Veteran QB Alan Bowman finished with 206 yards and two interceptions, and was benched for the third quarter and part of the fourth before returning for the final 10 minutes to help his team try and rally. Running back Ollie Gordon II, who won the Doak Walker Award last season, hasn't been able to get going, rushing for less than 50 yards in each of the last three games. This week, he faces another top-25 run defense, so those struggles could continue.

No. 15 Louisville at No. 12 Notre Dame (3:30 p.m. ET on Peacock)

Notre Dame is trying to do everything in its power to stay alive in the CFP race. After a stunning 16-14 loss to Northern Illinois at home in Week 2, the Fighting Irish must rack up wins to stay in the selection committee's good graces, and prove to fans why they should cheer for this team instead of boo them (as was the case last week).

A year ago, Notre Dame was in a similar position entering its matchup vs. Louisville. The Irish had one loss, but went on the road and were upset by the Cardinals, 33-20. That one probably still hurts a little bit in South Bend, especially since the Irish were expected to win. This year's matchup pits one of the top scoring offenses in Louisville (47.3 ppg) vs. one of the top scoring defenses in Notre Dame (9.8 ppg). Cardinals QB Tyler Shough, a transfer by way of Texas Tech and Oregon, has eight passing touchdowns and zero interceptions so far this season.

Irish QB Riley Leonard, meanwhile, is coming off a stellar performance against Miami (Ohio). He passed for 154 yards with one touchdown and ran for 143 yards with two rushing scores, including a 50-yard sprint up the middle of the field in the final minutes of the game.

No. 2 Georgia at No. 4 Alabama (7:30 p.m. ET on ESPN)

The most highly anticipated game of the week. Last year, Alabama beat Georgia 27-24 in the SEC title game, clinching a spot in the CFP and ending the Bulldogs' hope of winning three straight national championships. Since then, Nick Saban has retired and Kalen DeBoer has been hired to sustain the winning culture in Tuscaloosa. This is DeBoer's first major test as Saban's replacement, and it's probably a bit unfair that his SEC debut has to come against Kirby Smart and the Dawgs.

Off-field story lines aside, the game itself promises to be entertaining, as it always is. QB Jalen Milroe is running even more under DeBoer, so Georgia's defense is going to need to get pressure early and often and limit explosive plays. Alabama has the nation's fifth-best scoring offense right now, averaging 49.0 ppg, while Georgia has the nation's second-best scoring defense and hasn't allowed a touchdown in three games. However, the Bulldogs will need QB Carson Beck, whose only loss as a starter was to Alabama last year, to get into a rhythm quickly. The Bulldogs have not scored touchdowns in the first half of two of their first three games this season, but they have a chance to succeed here against an unproven Bama secondary.

No. 19 Illinois at No. 9 Penn State (7:30 p.m. on NBC)

James Franklin has called for ""White Out energy"" ahead of Penn State's first conference clash of the season, a Saturday night matchup against 19th-ranked Illinois. The last time the Fighting Illini paid a visit to Beaver Stadium in 2021, they upset the then-No. 7 Nittany Lions 20-18 in an unprecedented nine overtimes.

Three years later, both teams enter this showdown undefeated, ranked in the top 20 with their CFP hopes intact. Illinois has already knocked off two ranked teams in the first four weeks of the season, first beating then-No. 19 Kansas 23-17 in Week 2, and then edging then-No. 22 Nebraska 31-24 last Friday night in Lincoln. The Illini aren't intimidated by rowdy environments, even though Penn State fans will try their hardest to impact the game.

Penn State, meanwhile, is looking for its first quality win of the season. After taking care of West Virginia in Week 1, James Franklin's team struggled to put Bowling Green away in Week 2. Following an idle week, the Nittany Lions crushed Kent State 56-0 at home last Saturday. If PSU can get past this weekend unscathed, it will only have two top 25 teams left on the schedule: at No. 13 USC (Oct. 12) and vs. No. 3 Ohio State (Nov. 2).

Iranian Immigrant Becomes Billionaire As Her Biotech Firm's Stock Soars. Plus: Why Expressing Pride Could Hurt Your Career,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2024/09/27/iranian-immigrant-becomes-billionaire-as-her-biotech-firms-stock-soars-plus-why-expressing-pride-could-hurt-your-career/,2024-09-27T21:50:56Z,"This is this week's ForbesWomen newsletter, which every Thursday brings news about the world's top female entrepreneurs, leaders and investors straight to your inbox. Click here to get on the newsletter list!

his week has marked the 79th United Nations General Assembly high-level debate, and as has (unfortunately) been the case in prior years' meetings, women account for very few of the speakers on the main floor. On Tuesday -- the day President Biden addressed the gathering -- just two of the 35 leaders who spoke were women (Switzerland's president, Viola Amherd, and Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni); yesterday (where the headline event was Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky's address), the number ticked up to four.

ForbesWomen contributor Stéphanie Fillion points out in her coverage of the disparity that UNGA's speakers reflect the world's leadership landscape: Just 27 of the UN's member states have heads of state/government that are female. Gender equality in these high positions of power will not be reached for another 130 years, according to UN Women.

As I've been meeting with my own sources this week, they've been telling me that the real work is getting done in the side meetings. And here, women are well-represented: At one such side meeting, Oscar award-winning actress and activist Meryl Streep addressed the dire situation of women and girls in Afghanistan, saying, ""Today in Kabul a female cat has more freedom than a woman."" At another, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced, in conjunction with the European Investment Bank, five years' worth of new financing for global contraceptive access.

""People in the world believe that a lot is happening [for gender equality],"" Anita Zaidi, the president of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's Gender Equality Division told me during an event yesterday. But the issue with big gatherings like UNGA is that they often contain a lot of words, and very little action or accountability after. ""I'm interested in action,"" Zaidi says.

Cheers to that!

P.S. Speaking of big gatherings, the 11th annual Forbes Under 30 Summit also took place this week, in Cincinnati. If you missed the livestream or attending IRL, you can catch a written recap here! Of particular interest to those of you who read this newsletter: I interviewed Honey Pot cofounder and CEO Bea Dixon, who sold a majority stake of her company for $380 million earlier this year. It was one of the largest exits for a Black female founder, and she told us that she hopes she can be an example to other Black founders. ""If you see me, and you see that it's something I can do,"" Dixon said, ""then I believe it's something you can do.""

In hundreds of groups across Facebook, women with unwanted pregnancies turn to one another for pills and herbal remedies. Many say they are getting scammed instead, according to a new investigation from Forbes senior writer Emily Baker-White. But as Baker-White tells ForbesWomen editor Maggie McGrath in this ""Forbes Talks"" segment, this story is less about Facebook and more about human rights -- and what happens when stigma and restrictive health policies interfere with women's access to the care they need.

Shares of Summit Therapeutics, whose cancer drug candidate turned heads after it outperformed a blockbuster drug from Merck, have been on fire. That has in turn made its co-CEO, Maky Zanganeh, a new billionaire -- worth an estimated $1.1 billion. An Iranian immigrant, Zanganeh is one of just 34 self-made U.S. women billionaires, and one of three American women to have made a billion-dollar fortune in the healthcare sector.

Former crypto bigwig Caroline Ellison received a jail sentence Tuesday for the financial crimes committed alongside her ex-boyfriend Sam Bankman-Fried, landing time behind bars despite some legal experts suggesting Ellison may skirt jail time for her extensive cooperation against Bankman-Fried, the former billionaire head of the $32 billion cryptocurrency exchange FTX.

A recurring sentiment stands out among undecided voters who've been polled in recent weeks: Many remain unsure about Kamala Harris, citing a need for more information in spite of her performance in the debate against Donald Trump and her media appearances. But according to research on female leadership, their hesitation could be more about her gender than her policies.

Neha Kumar is the cofounder and COO of Full Glass Wine Co., a direct-to-consumer wine retailer that owns brands like Winc and Splash Wines. Kumar recently sat down with ForbesWomen editor Maggie McGrath, to talk about her company's two newest acquisitions and how -- despite not having a background in wine -- she came to run a digital wine seller that's projected to bring in $125 million in revenue this year.

In continued coverage from our Forbes Sustainability Leaders list, check out this profile on U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. The former Michigan governor has tried to turn the Department of Energy, flush with billions of dollars from energy and infrastructure legislation, into a catalyst for America's clean energy future and new jobs.

1. Build bridges. Christine Cox, the cofounder and executive director of contemporary ballet company BalletX, recently spoke to me about how she pivoted her career as a dancer to one of entrepreneurship: ""The people around you are your roadway to the things you want to do,"" she says. Catch our full interview -- which also touches on how to make ballet more accessible to more people -- here!

2. Think twice before judging someone's ability by their age. According to the new McKinsey/Lean In Women in the Workplace report, early-career women -- meaning those who are 30 and younger -- experience ageism in the workplace at higher levels than their more mature counterparts.

3. Be strategically humble. We all want to own our successes, but new organizational behavioral research sheds some interesting light on how we should frame those wins: Expressing pride can unintentionally signal that you've reached your limit, while remaining humble can make you seem like you have untapped potential. The study's authors therefore have this advice: ""When you get to the end zone, act like you've been there before."""
"MSNBC contributor: Trump appeals to men with 'retro, macho' views, while Emhoff embodies 'supportive' men",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-contributor-trump-appeals-men-retro-macho-views-emhoff-embodies-supportive-men,2024-09-27T19:36:49Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

MSNBC contributor Katty Kay said Vice President Kamala Harris' and former President Trump's campaigns were appealing to voters with ""different"" ideas about masculinity.

During a segment on ""Morning Joe"" on Friday, Kay teased her interview with second gentleman Doug Emhoff on her ""The Rest Is Politics: US"" podcast with Anthony Scaramucci. In the interview, Emhoff talked about giving up his career as an attorney when Harris was tapped as President Biden's running mate in 2020.

""What would you say to young men who the Trump campaign is appealing to with a kind of slightly retro, macho view of what masculinity is?"" Kay asked him. ""Young men who might want to be in a position one day of supporting their spouse but are worried that it would diminish their own masculinity? Do you think now that you're in a position to reach those young men?""

""It's something I think about all the time,"" Emhoff responded. ""For me, it just came very naturally. I think it's the era we kind of grew up in...For me it was very normal...and I think that's why Kamala and I really bonded.""

DOUGLAS EMHOFF IS A 'PROGRESSIVE SEX SYMBOL' AND 'MODERN FEMALE FANTASY,' WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST FAWNS

""I've also learned I can't lecture, I can't be a scold. I can't tell people what to do, especially in this area, I just have to say, 'Look, here's what I do, here's why I do it, here's why it's important to me.'...Women succeeding doesn't hurt men. It actually helps all of us...the economics prove it out.""

Emhoff added that men can be strong and defend their families while also being supportive of their wives' careers.

""Both things can exist at the same time,"" he said.

""Morning Joe"" co-host Mika Brzezinski reacted to the interview on Friday's MSNBC show, saying, ""Boy, a contrast in many ways, between the two campaigns.""

There seems to be ""two different views of masculinity,"" Kay said, about the GOP and Democratic presidential campaigns.

""There's this kind of alpha, retro view of masculinity we're seeing from the Trump campaign, and then you got Tim Walz and Doug Emhoff, who are both professional men but are in sort of supportive roles of a woman who's the principal candidate,"" she continued.

Earlier in the program, Kay said that the Harris-Walz campaign was making efforts to reach male voters, as some polls show Harris' support is being driven by likely female voters.

Kay said that Emhoff is hoping to ""lead by example"" with his own representation of masculinity to attract more male supporters to the campaign.

""But he hopes that, leading by example, by talking about the fact that he loves his wife, that you can make space for women to the rise to the top and it wont diminish your masculinity. That's really what he's trying to do...and he's authentic about it,"" she said.

""He does a great job at that,"" Brzezinski said. ""I think he's like a secret weapon for the campaign, in many ways.""

During the Democratic National Convention, CNN's Dana Bash made a similar argument, saying that Democrats want to win over men who ""understand that it's OK in 2024 to be a man comfortable in his own skin who supports a woman.""

""They are doing so in trying to put forward male figures, Tim Walz being one of them, Doug Emhoff last night, who can speak to men out there who might not be the sort of testosterone-laden, you know, gun-toting kind of guy who wants to listen to Hulk Hogan and the kind of players that came out at the RNC,"" she said."
6 Must-Visit Women's Sports Bars Across The Country,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/claudiaalarcon/2024/09/27/top-womens-sports-bars/,2024-09-27T19:03:09Z,"As the popularity of women's sports continues to rise, fans have started looking for venues where they can watch their favorite teams. Now, sports bars dedicated to showing these events are popping up across the U.S. by popular demand, providing safe places for fans to watch the game while enjoying food and drinks in a classic sports bar atmosphere.

From international soccer matches to WNBA, NWSL, the Olympics and more, these lively locales - mostly women owned and operated - cater to fans hungry for a convivial spot to cheer for their favorite women's sports teams. Here are six trendsetters paving the way for more to come.

The one that started it all, The Sports Bra is owner Jenny Nguyen's dream come true. Frustrated by the lack of bars showing women's sports, and often feeling out of place at traditional sports bars, she decided to take matters into her own hands. With her life savings and a succesful Kickstarter campaign, The Sports Bra was not only able to open, but has actually become a profitable endeavor, with customers lining out the door for events like the NCAA basketball finals.

Decked with sports memorabilia from teams and leagues around the country, the vibe at The Sports Bra is one of inclusion rather than exclusivity. Expect bar food like burguers and nachos, with plenty of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options, with Mom's ribs and the tempeh Reuben sandwich among the most popular. The bar program focuses on women-owned taps and spirits, including signature cocktails made with Freeland Spirits.

""We welcome everyone! We are a bar for women's sports NOT a sports bar for women!"" says Nguyen.

Jen Barnes' story is similar to Nguyen's. She searched all over Seattle for a sports bar showing the Reign's semifinal match in the National Women's Soccer League playoffs, but could not find one. An avid fan who also played sports throughout her youth, she knew she had to do something to change the status quo.

Located in the historic Henry Whyte building, Rough and Tumble Pub is a convivial bar that shows all sports, with priority given to women's matches, shown on big screens and with full sound. Here you'll find all the local teams, from the Reign and the WNBA's Storm to the Kraken and the Seahawks. A few pool tables provide entertainment when games are not on TV.

The farm-to-table menu is eclectic, featuring a weekend brunch - the fried chicken and waffles is a must, and the Bloody Mary looks like a garden salad that will bring back the dead. For lunch and dinner there's everything from corn riblets to bahn mi, burgers, wings, and a kids' menu, plus craft cocktails and non-alcoholic creations, local taps and wines.

Lifelong sports fans Veronica Sayes and Anthony Fushell named their long-awaited bar after the Rockford Peaches, the women's professional baseball team that inspired the movie ""A League of Their Own,"" which in turn inspired the bar. Set in a 1950s building the bar oozes nostalgia, with a vintage vibe that makes the large space, covered in the duo's collection of sports memorabilia, seem like a cozy neighborhood pub. A pool table and retro arcade games add even more sportsy charm.

Food and drinks at Peaches Sports Bar are not an afterthought. Elevated takes on hotdogs, nachos, and wings mirror the baseball inspiration, and are made with locally sourced ingredients. The TV screens prioritize women's teams from the WNBA and PWHL, but Raptors and Blue Jays fans also find a friendly space to cheer for their teams, in a queer-safe environment that welcomes everyone.

Jax Diener had dreamed of opening a sports bar for at least 30 years before she was finally able to do it, alongside her wife Emme Eddy, earlier this year. Filling a niche in the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Orange County area, Watch Me! has become an instant hit in the L.A. women's sports community, forging partnerships with Angel City F.C. and the L.A. Sparks even before opening, and offering a place for young athletes and fans to enjoy their favorite sports.

Hungry fans will find a chef-driven menu, with tasty items with fun baseball references; sandwiches come from the ""In the Mitt"" section- a vegan cauliflower burger and a breakfast burger with bacon jam stand out - while salads like a classic wedge are ""On the Green."" The drink menu features lots of women-made spirits and beers, classic and craft cocktails and unique offerings like Jax's Breakfast Shot - a shot of Jamesons with a butterscotch floater, orange juice back, and a slice of bacon.

Stop me if you've heard this one before. A group of friends goes to a Minneapolis sports bar to watch the University of Minnesota Gophers softball team play in the national tournament. But they could not get it on any of the multiple screens, with bartenders prefering to show football reruns and even a cornhole tournament. Sports fanatic and former athlete Jillian Hiscock was not having it any longer.

She opened A Bar of Their Own hoping to create an inclusive, family-friendly space for women's sports fans to cheer for their favorite teams, loudly and proudly. The space is simple and spacious but comfortable, filled with screens showing everything from NCAA volleyball and soccer to WNBA finals and NWSL matches.

Salads, cauliflower wings, queso burgers and even a kimchi carnitas sandwich are in the food lineup, which also includes a kid's menu. Craft cocktails, mocktails and plenty of local seasonal beer and ciders on tap round out the beverage options.

Whiskey Girl Tavern is a woman-owned and operated, LGBTQ-friendly sports bar showing games from the WNBA's Sky and the NWSL's Red Stars, as well as local Chicago sports plus NFL Sunday Ticket. Named after owners' Christina and Heather Roberts doggy Whiskey, the bar has a comfy neighborhood vibe with leather couches and banquettes clad in blue velvet, and an adjacent space with pool tables.

They keep the menu small but there are some real gems, like the hot honey pepperoni pizza - the most popular item - plus chicken tenders, fried pickles and other seasonal items, with everything made in house from scratch. Drinks include local taps and seasonal craft cocktails, and, of course, a whiskey flight for those so inclined.

Although Parlor Sports doesn't exclusively show women's sports, they feature WNBA and PWHL games prominently alongside local teams like Patriots, Celtics, and Red Sox, plus Premier League and NCAA football. They are so commited to the theme that they even have TVs in the restrooms so you don't miss a minute of the action.

Local brews on tap and cocktails are served alongside traditional sports bar fare like cheese curds, nachos, burgers and dogs. The queer-friendly bar also hosts watch parties for TV shows like The Bachelorette and House of the Dragon."
Opinion | Why Maggie Smith's turn on 'Downton Abbey' was the best acting in a generation,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/maggie-smith-dies-89-downton-abbey-rcna173025,2024-09-27T18:48:13Z,"Seemingly a peripheral character, Smith's Dowager Countess Violet Crawley often stole the show with her biting wit, one liners and comedic timing.

British actor Maggie Smith died Friday at 89 years old. While her acting career spanned over 70 years, it was her roles in the Harry Potter franchise and the series ""Downton Abbey"" -- that is, roles she played later in life -- that propelled her to global fame and, she said, made it nearly impossible for her to go anywhere without being recognized.

The Dowager Countess Violet Crawley, her character in ""Downton Abbey,"" is one of the most exquisitely acted roles of a generation. Seemingly a peripheral character, she still managed to often steal the show with her biting wit, one liners and comedic timing. She offered audiences both light relief and pithy or searing aphorisms, becoming in many ways the moral compass of the Downton world. (""Do you enjoy these games, in which the player must appear ridiculous?"" asks Sir Richard, Lady Mary's then-fiancé, as an aside during a game of charades. ""Sir Richard,"" the dowager responds, ""life is a game in which the player must appear ridiculous."")

Notably, the dowager embodied tradition while still embracing progress -- a balance I think many of us yearn for as these two ideas are fallaciously presented as being in opposition to one another.

My friend Hannah, a fellow Downton aficionado, noted that our yearning for both tradition and progress -- and our collective resistance to this false dichotomy -- is why people liked the dowager. And it's the same reason why so many Americans have embraced Minnesota Gov. Tim Waltz, the Democrats' vice presidential nominee: He appears to represent tradition and progressivism at the same time. In this increasingly disorienting world, in which previously fixed points and ideas and systems are disintegrating, preserving some things of the past can be a necessary and grounding exercise. Similarly, the dowager represented that duality, that expansiveness, many of us long for.

Smith's skill as an actor enabled her to embody this range with such humility, humor and conviction. As ""Downton Abbey"" show creator Julian Fellowes said on NPR's ""Fresh Air"" in 2012, Smith ""has an extraordinary skill to bring many different aspects of a character into her delineation, but they never seem contradictory ... a lesser actor would, you know, find it difficult to be kind and cruel simultaneously or superficial here but quite deep here. But she manages to synthesize all these elements into a believable woman.""

Her character was hardened and pragmatic, but fiercely loving and heart-centered. ""I am not a romantic,"" she says to Cousin Isobel, ""but even I will concede that the heart does not exist solely for the purpose of pumping blood.""

Isobel, ardently insisting on progress and modernity, was the perfect antagonist for the dowager. The irony, of course, was that Isobel was ultimately more rigid (and therefore, in her own way, conservative), while the dowager was more flexible and expansive, traveling across greater ideological distances in her lifetime.

In one contentious moment during supper, in which the younger characters begin arguing, the dowager attempts to put an end to the disruption. ""But I admire it when young people stand up for their principles,"" Isobel declares. ""Principles are like prayers,"" the dowager quips, ""Noble, of course, but awkward at a party.""

And there's the both/and. I'm not suggesting we laud respectability politics or discourage disruption. In fact, I think those are deeply important. But the truth this quip contains feels deeply humbling (not to mention funny) to someone like me, who can easily veer into self-righteousness.

In another scene, Lady Edith, the dowager's granddaughter, questions the ""suitability"" of having a Black singer perform at Downton. ""My dear, us country dwellers must be wary of being provincial,"" her grandmother responds. ""Try and let your time in London rub off on you a little more.""

The dowager's forward-thinking worldview was expressed in privileging action over words, which can, in itself, exemplify its own kind of openness -- a willingness to engage with the world rather than recoil from and resist it. And accountability was just as important to the character. As she notes, ""Meaning well is not enough.""

Smith's dowager countess was the show's moral compass. And the show's seemingly stuffiest and most classist character. She was rooted to the past while reaching toward the present. There's no better proof of Smith's brilliance as an actor than her ability to embody both of those things at once."
Rhiannon Dixon Faces Rival Terri Harper In First WBO Lightweight Title Defense,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennnelson/2024/09/27/rhiannon-dixon-faces-rival-terri-harper-in-first-wbo-lightweight-title-defense/,2024-09-27T18:25:05Z,"Rhiannon Dixon is set to make the first defense of her WBO Lightweight World Title in a highly anticipated clash against domestic rival Terri Harper on Saturday the main event at Sheffield's Canon Medical Arena, September 28, broadcast live on DAZN. This all-British bout promises to captivate fans worldwide, as Dixon, with an unblemished record of 10-0, looks to solidify her reign as a world champion. Having claimed the vacant WBO title by outpointing Karen Elizabeth Carabajal last April, Dixon now faces one of the toughest challenges of her career in Harper.

For Dixon, boxing wasn't always part of the plan. It wasn't until the age of 21 that she first laced up gloves, inspired by a chance encounter with an interview featuring MMA star Ronda Rousey. Rousey's words, ""Every muscle in my body serves a purpose,"" struck a chord with Dixon, motivating her to step into a gym in Wigan, where she began participating in White Collar Boxing events. What started as a casual interest soon blossomed into a passion for the sport, and with the encouragement of her coach and close friend James Moorcroft, who had recently turned professional, Dixon made the leap into the pro ranks in 2019.

Her early career, however, was marked by a delicate balance between her professional life as a hospital pharmacist and her growing ambitions in the boxing world. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020, Dixon's role as a frontline healthcare worker took precedence, and boxing had to take a backseat. Yet, despite the demands of her job, the drive to compete never waned. Once the pandemic subsided, Dixon committed fully to her boxing career, joining forces with renowned coach Anthony Crolla, a former WBA Lightweight World Champion.

This decision proved pivotal. In March 2023, Dixon captured the vacant Commonwealth Lightweight Title with a technical knockout victory over Vicky Wilkinson. She followed this success by claiming the European Lightweight Championship just months later, defeating Katharina Thanderz by unanimous decision. In April 2024, Dixon achieved the pinnacle of her career by winning the WBO Lightweight World Title, outclassing Karen Elizabeth Carabajal over ten rounds.

Ahead of her first title defense, Dixon reflects on the challenges she faced as a woman entering the sport. ""When I first started boxing, I was self-conscious, feeling like one of the only women in the gym,"" Dixon recalls. ""But over time, I realized those barriers were mostly in my head. The environment was incredibly welcoming, and it became a second home for me."" Inside the ring, Dixon credits her team for her success. ""I'm incredibly fortunate to work with such a close-knit group. I know they have my best interests at heart, and that sense of trust and camaraderie is what gives me confidence when I step into the ring."" While she acknowledges that boxing, like many sports, remains a male-dominated field, Dixon doesn't allow it to define her experience. ""People are often surprised when they learn I'm a boxer, but I don't let it bother me. Boxing is my passion, and I'm proud to represent women in the sport.""

For young women and girls aspiring to follow in her footsteps, Dixon offers simple but powerful advice: ""Give it a try. You never know where it might lead. Don't place limitations on yourself."" As for her ultimate goal as an athlete, Dixon remains pragmatic. ""I take each fight as it comes. I never imagined I'd get to where I am now, but I'm focused on continuing to improve and pushing my limits."" Now, with her first title defense fast approaching, Rhiannon Dixon is ready to continue her remarkable ascent in the world of professional boxing."
A meteorologist in Atlanta rescued a woman from Helene floodwaters on camera,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/g-s1-25028/helene-atlanta-weather-meteorologist-bob-van-dillen,2024-09-27T17:50:24Z,"FOX Weather meteorologist Bob Van Dillen was broadcasting from Atlanta early this morning when he heard a woman crying for help in the dark.

As the city woke up to torrential rain and its first-ever flash flood emergency, the unidentified woman drove her car into deep floodwaters and got trapped.

The half-submerged car was visible, and her cries for help were audible, in the background of Van Dillen's live shot.

He hollered to her -- and explained to viewers -- that he had called 911 and was awaiting the fire department on its way.

""You're good, you're good,"" he yelled over to her, then paused and sighed to the camera. ""I'm gonna go see if I can help this lady out a little bit more, you guys.""

He walked off camera.

Moments later, the meteorologist could be seen wading through chest-deep water, carrying the woman on his back.

Afterward, Van Dillen -- who is 6'1"" -- said he overcame his initial concerns about the current and the water temperature; it was warmer than he expected.

""As soon as I started going there, I was like, 'Screw it, I'm getting her,' and unbuckled her seatbelt, pulled her out, put her on my back and she was fine,"" he said. ""Everything worked out fine.""

He said the woman was OK, just cold. He gave her his shirt and put her in a car, where they waited for a firetruck and her husband.

When the husband arrived, Van Dillen pointed him out to the camera. The man came over to hug and shake Van Dillen's hand, thanking him repeatedly."
Emergency landing prompts United Airlines pilot to order dinner for 150 passengers,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/emergency-landing-prompts-united-airlines-pilot-order-dinner-150-passengers,2024-09-27T17:14:31Z,"Serena Kerrigan, 30, recently attended two weddings on opposite coasts within 24 hours. The content creator flew from California to New York, had a no-show taxi issue and still made it in time for both events. See the highlights.

A plane full of passengers was forced to make an emergency landing, delaying their arrival by seven hours, but a gesture from the pilot may have made the situation not so bad.

Tanya Stamos, a 44-year-old United States Navy veteran from Woodlands, Texas, said she was recently flying from San Francisco to Houston on a United Airlines flight when things took a turn.

Stamos told Fox News Digital that the nonstop flight was scheduled to arrive in Houston at 7:00 p.m., but the flight had to make an emergency landing soon after takeoff.

""Not long into our flight, the captain had come on and asked if there were any healthcare professionals, [and] if so, please let the flight attendant know and head to the back of the plane,"" she said via email.

Stamos said that after learning that a man had passed out and collapsed in the bathroom, they were told by the pilot that the plane would be making an emergency landing in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to seek medical help for the passenger.

Around 3:30 p.m., the flight landed in New Mexico where the passenger was taken off the plane by medical officials.

""The pilot then gets on and says they are going to refurbish the medical equipment that was used, and we will be departing by 5:00 p.m.,"" Stamos said.

However, a short time later, the passengers were asked to exit the plane and were not given an explanation as to why, Stamos said.

Stamos said she and fellow passengers walked into the New Mexico airport and learned that they would have to wait for a new flight crew to board the plane.

""After sitting there for a couple hours trying to figure out what was going on and the captain to find other flight attendants to serve us so we would not be stuck there overnight, it was near 7:30 p.m. or so,"" she said.

Stamos said United Airlines gave passengers a $15 food voucher, but the airport restaurants and food options were closed by then.

The pilot ended up taking matters into his own hands and ordered pizza.

""The captain said it was a really disheartening situation, and we may be tired, but he would make sure he personally got our bellies full,"" Stamos said.

Stamos said 30 pizzas for the 150 passengers showed up to the gate and everyone was ""completely shocked.""

""Most organizations do not go above and beyond, but that captain did not hesitate,"" she said, adding, ""His display that evening is what we should have more of: selfless acts of love, compassion and humanity.""

Stamos said new flight attendants arrived, and the flight was able to take off at 11:00 p.m. The plane safely landed in Houston at 2:00 a.m. the next morning.

She said the pilot stood at the front of the aircraft upon deplaning in Houston to thank the passengers for being patient.

""As it was my turn to exit the plane, I shook his hand and thanked him,"" she said, adding, ""Everyone behind me then followed suit and shook his hand as well.""

A representative from United Airlines told Fox News Digital that the company ""loves to see our pilots going above and beyond for our customers when the unexpected happens."""
Study: Companies In States Legal For Medical Cannabis Could Save Thousands In Health Premiums,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanoleck/2024/09/27/study-companies-in-states-legal-for-medical-cannabis-could-save-thousands-in-health-premiums/,2024-09-27T16:12:40Z,"If you own a company - or work for one - in any of the 38 states (and District of Columbia) that have legalized medical cannabis, you could be saving thousands: A new study from Leafwell examining U.S.companies from 2003 to 2022 found:

· Health premium costs were 3.4 percent lower for individual coverage plans for companies in medical cannabis states compared to states prohibiting medical cannabis. That's $238 savings per employee per year, the study reported.

· Premium costs for employee-plus-one coverage plans were 2.9 percent, or $348, lower per year.

A company with 50 employees in a medical cannabis state could therefore spend $14,650 less, the study said. And obviously this savings figure could soar as a company grows. ""A business in a state with medical cannabis that employs 500 employees who are covered under a single health insurance plan is likely to have $119,000 lower health care costs compared to a similar business with a similar number of employees in states without such a law,"" Mitchell Doucette, senior research director at Leafwell, said by email.

""Whether it's chronic pain or cancer, we believe that ensuring access through insurance can profoundly impact the well-being and productivity of employees,"" Doucette added. ""Not only is investing in cannabis care beneficial to patient care, it's also good for business efficiency.""

Miami-based Leafwell is a medical cannabis telehealth company that helps customers obtain required medical cannabis use cards. Leafwell's study, ""Measuring the Impact of Medical Cannabis Law Adoption on Employer-sponsored Health Insurance Costs: A Difference-in-Difference Analysis,"" was published this month in the journal Applied Health Economics and Health Policy.

The data used come from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (annual) Medical Expenditure Panel Survey from 2003-2022. The survey, whose sample-strategy and size, and response rate, are described here, asked employers to report the total average cost per employee of their health insurance premiums and deductibles stratified by health insurance plan type.

In 2022, a total 39,969 businesses nationwide were included in the expenditure survey. Notably, Leafwell also looked for insurance savings on family insurance plans in medical cannabis states but findings there were not statistically significant.

The big question, of course, was and is the ""why"" behind these premium costs savings in medical cannabis states. Are employees in those states simply saving their insurers money because they are looking for natural forms of relief for their ailments rather than billing insurance for more costly standard medicine?

""We cannot tease apart where the savings come from as we do not have individual-level data,"" Doucette said by email, addressing the ""why?"" question. Nor could he specify whether the findings were related to medicines with CBDs, THC, or both.

However, he did speculate as to several possible explanations:

· Reductions in health care spending on prescription medications

Research reports have shown decreased prescription numbers in the Medicaid and Medicare populations, including opioid prescriptions, illustrating the transfer of treatment costs to the patient, for better or worse.

· Medical changes among medical cannabis patients

Risky behavior may be trending downward because people seem to be turning to cannabis in place of beer and alcohol and cigarettes. More study is needed, but the positive implications for healthcare spending - and related negative events like fewer DUI crashes - are clear.

· Reductions in the use of mental health and/or substance abuse treatment

Medical cannabis laws seem to be associated with fewer opioid hospitalizations, indicating lowered expenditures for costly addiction treatment.

Human suffering, too, is certainly part of the mix. The Leafwell study looked at a woman it called Sarah, a cancer patient who began using medical cannabis to alleviate the nausea and anxiety standard treatments like chemotherapy caused her. The cannabis cost her $50 to $300 a month, so obviously Sarah saved money with fewer ER visits.

Where is all this headed? Leafwell broadened its findings to explore a ""what if"" scenario. It stated, ""If all 50 states had medical cannabis laws, the impact could have been a collective 0.65% reduction in our healthcare expenditure GDP. In 2022, healthcare spending accounted for 17.3 percent of US GDP, or $4.5 trillion -- [so] a reduction of 0.65 percent is a saving of $29 billion."""
Chef Dominique Crenn Dishes On Her Love Of San Francisco And Chicago-Style Hot Dogs,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestravelguide/2024/09/27/chef-dominique-crenn-dishes-on-her-love-of-san-francisco-and-chicago-style-hot-dogs/,2024-09-27T15:08:26Z,"We imagine breakfast at celebrated chef Dominique Crenn's house playing out like a scene from a delicious dream -- chive-sprinkled eggs, pepper-speckled bacon and golden waffles towering so high they almost fall off the plate. Couldn't imagine the owner of San Francisco Forbes Travel Guide Five-Star restaurant Atelier Crenn and one of the most respected toques in the world doing anything less, right?

""When I wake up in the morning,"" Crenn says, ""I get hot water, lemon and a little bit of apple cider just to settle myself. Then I take a long walk. After that, I come back and get some coffee and go get a little croissant. Or sometimes, I just get toasted bread and a little bit of jam. That's it. No American breakfast. Never.""

The France native isn't against American traditions around the kitchen, though. On the contrary, Crenn enjoys Louisiana étouffée and Chicago-style hot dogs almost as much as you do. It's just that with two active 10-year-old children, she and her wife, actor Maria Bello, don't need to be weighed down with heavy foods.

As further proof of her love for cuisine around the States, Crenn is joining her culinary colleagues for a flavor-filled celebration at Wisconsin's Kohler Food & Wine on October 17 to 20. In addition to talking to us about the foodie festival, Crenn also opens up about the Bay Area dining scene and the things that motivate her to keep getting out of bed (and skipping a big breakfast) every day.

Where in the world are you right now?

I am in California. I've been in California since the Olympics. I took my kids to Paris, and then I've been working my little butt off in my beautiful city of San Francisco.

You've been at the top of your industry for many years. What keeps you motivated to keep doing it every day?

What motivates me every day is people, culture, community, pushing the boundaries and learning. It's being curious and being able to create new things. I don't wake up in the morning to, ""Oh, my God, I'm going to be on top again of my industry."" I wake up in the morning to, ""Wow, let's do something that's exciting, has a purpose and connects me to others."" That's what excites me every day. And being grateful for what you do every day.

For those who've never visited your San Francisco restaurant, what are they missing?

I don't know if they're missing anything. I think they will be curious to discover. I believe that people need to discover and be curious about the things that they don't know. This is a place that's an expression of who I am and the people surrounding me and the community [I'm a part of]. I'm an artist. So, you come to my home and, hopefully, I can show you and help you to discover my language of love and the culinary artistry that we are presenting to you. You will come into my world as soon as you come and sit down.

You will probably have a little bit of time before to be at Bar Crenn, which is next door. You can have a beautiful craft cocktail that we spent a lot of years developing and have some snacks and start the story there. So, [when you dine with me] you come to my home and get a little window into my life. Hopefully, you can leave the place with an understanding and a good feeling of, ""Wow, that was an amazing experience.""

How would you describe the city's culinary scene right now?

San Francisco is always at the forefront of new things, discovery, innovation and community -- which is a word that I will use [to explain] the history of California, especially San Francisco. It's a place where everybody comes together from every place, every corner of the world. They create new things. They [come] from China, Japan, Mexico, other places. It's been always a vibrant place to be, culinary-wise.

I'm very excited today to say that we are still very vibrant and newcomers [regularly] open. COVID has been a very difficult time for the city, but San Francisco has always been a place of resilience and new things happening.

So yeah, it's the place to be. We have everything. We have the beautiful natural landscape that is around us. We have amazing farmers, fishermen, ranchers, a beautiful community from everywhere. It's a unique city in the landscape of California but also in the landscape of the United States. It's still very important to come and discover.

And please do not look at what the news sometimes tells you, which is so politically driven. It's a beautiful city with beautiful people. Yes, there is struggle. There are beautiful people that are on the street, unfortunately. But you know what? It's always been a city of resilience and beauty and, culinary-wise, is on top of its game.

Another great city is Kohler, Wisconsin. Have you been before?

No, this is my first time, but I've been to Wisconsin. I've been to Madison. I just love this state. It has a beautiful landscape, too. And they said that the best cheese is over there. But being a French woman, I will have my thoughts on cheeses.

But the reason why I'm excited about [Kohler Food & Wine] is because it's very intimate. And it's also a food and wine festival that you can connect with the people that come, which is amazing. [You connect] with the farmers, winemakers and the guests. It's like a little community of exchanging ideas and seeing things that, perhaps, you want to learn about. That's what interests me about those types of events. I don't like the expensive events where you are just a number and you can't connect with the people. That's not what I like.

Do you treat events like Kohler like a reunion? Do you get to see chef friends you haven't seen for a while?

I'm going to see a lot of people that I know, I guess. Yes, I think the food world is a community of beautiful people. When was the last time I saw Andrew [Zimmern, one of Kohler Food & Wine's celebrity presenters]? It was not a long time ago, but even if you don't see people for months or years, when you connect with someone in your industry -- it doesn't matter if it's a chef or a winemaker -- and you have a really beautiful connection, it's like a friendship. You don't need to see them every day. When you do see them again, it's just a beautiful moment. I appreciate that. [I find it] a very precious thing to have a connection with someone. I really cherish that.

Can you name a few places you've been where you've been pleasantly surprised by the food?

I went to Madison, Wisconsin, last year. There were a lot of places where young talents understand the need to be in their community and get involved with farmers and ranchers and tell their own stories, which I think is beautiful. They are not just opening a restaurant to cook food.

America is a country that is extremely young, 300 years. It's not a country where they have a food culture that is, like, 1,000 years old. To have those restaurants that pop up all over the country from different areas, different states, it's just beautiful. I'm so excited and I'm so curious to know more about their own story everywhere from Tennessee and Wisconsin to North Carolina and even Kansas. I love to understand the time and place where they are, and then you learn their story.

America is 50 different states and 50 different cultures. Fifty different ideas about how political things should be. I'm excited to go back to Wisconsin and see what's going on out there and to learn more about the local chefs, local farmers and their stories. I'm going back to Louisiana very soon. I love Louisiana. And you know that Louisiana used to belong to France a long time ago.

Every time I go back to France, I say, ""French people, you got to stop judging America about eating fast food and shitty food."" There is a lot of fast food. There are a lot of places that aren't serving good food, but there are a lot of beautiful areas where young people are coming up and want to tell the story. I'm a big advocate for American cooking and cuisine.

Will you have time to visit Milwaukee or Chicago after Kohler?

I want to visit the surrounding areas. I've been to Madison, so I want to do other things. I want to see things that I haven't seen. I've been to Chicago many times. I love Chicago. It's freezing during the winter, though. I have great memories in Chicago. I love it, especially the hot dog stands.

What do you love outside of cooking?

I do a lot of photography. That's what I wanted to be -- a photographer. I love sports. I love reading. I love traveling. I love to get to know new cultures. I love to spend a lot of time with my kids. They're 10 years old. I'm kind of looking at the world through their eyes, but I'm also giving them my experiences. Actually, I took them to Brittany, [France,] the other day -- where my mom passed away -- for the first time, and it was just beautiful.

I'm an advocate for the next generation. I love to be a part of it and learn. I'm a seeker of my own truth. I love to look at new things. I think we have forgotten about how beautiful this world is. I always say to young people to just go out there, travel and learn as much as you can because that's going to open your mind. Me being older, it's still opening my mind."
Women-Only Trips Are A Hot Trend In Active Travel,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryolmsted/2024/09/27/women-only-trips-are-a-hot-trend-in-active-travel/,2024-09-27T14:33:39Z,"In 1966, George and Martha Butterfield and Sidney Robinson launched Butterfield & Robinson, considered the first luxury guided active travel tour operator. Since then, they have led thousands of people on cycling, hiking and other active travel trips around the globe and remain the gold standard in the luxury travel industry, winning countless awards including yet another appearance on the coveted Travel + Leisure Magazine World's Best Tour Operators list in 2024.

58 years after they started leading these trips, B&R has broken new ground and just launched its first ever slate of women-only trips, which debuted for reservations last Monday (September 23).

Called the Women For Women Travel collection, the new trips were created by two female employees, Kristi Elborne and Christina Cain, the Directors of Sales and Trip Design respectively. According to the company's materials, ""Butterfield & Robinson's women-only collection aims to bring together like-minded women who share a passion for discovery. This B&R collection brings together adventurous, discerning women from around the world for unforgettable shared experiences centered around culture, cuisine, and connection. Each itinerary is carefully curated for women travelers, from special experiences with female winemakers in Tuscany and a dinner at the home of a female chef to discovering Cambodia with female tuk-tuk drivers and a visit in Vietnam with a woman who fought in the Vietnam War.""

The collection is launching with one guided, small group trip from each of the company's three core areas, cycling, multi-sport and walking/hiking, each in one of the most popular spots for those trips. The first to depart is Camino de Santiago Women's Walking in Spain in June 2025, then Tuscany & Umbria Women's Multi-Active in October and Cambodia & Vietnam Women's Biking in November.

I recently wrote here at Forbes about the overlooked importance of ""Guaranteed Departures"" in all kinds of group travel, including active, and B&R is one of the companies covered, so read more here.

The category the industry calls ""solo women travel"" has exploded, but this can mean women simply traveling without a companion, whether truly going solo or joining group trips, women-only or not. According to leading travel medical insurance and safety company Global Rescue, more women are traveling without men, accounting for as much as 85% of the customers of some tour operators, and 40% of women surveyed said their spouse was not interested in travel.

In active travel this can be an even bigger issue if one spouse cycles or hikes and the other does not, and a 2022 study by the Adventure Travel Trade Association found that women aged 20-70 comprised 75% of travelers in the categories of adventure, culture and nature-themed travel. Earlier this year travel industry publication TravelPulse reported that 57% of all adventure travelers are women and declared that, ""Women-only tours are beginning a new trend.""

No major player has dove into this trend as deeply as Backroads, America's largest luxury active travel operator and a longtime B&R competitor that launched way back in 1979. Backroads started offering women-only trips more than a year ago and has seen tremendous interest and growth. The company has quickly added new trips and is projecting an increase of more than 200% in guests on its Women's Adventures in 2025 over 2024. In 2025 Backroads will run more than 125 Women's Adventures departures. The collection currently includes more than 40 of Backroads' most popular Walking & Hiking itineraries in bucket-list destinations, along with new biking tours in France and California, and an Active Culinary Adventure in Tuscany, the first women-only trip in this category for the company.

""Women of all ages have been a significant part of the growth in active adventure travel so we expected our Women's Adventures would be well received, but we were thrilled with the overwhelmingly enthusiastic response,"" said Backroads Executive Vice President, Avery Hale Smith."" We've heard from many women -- solo travelers and those who travel with friends or family -- that the trips feel supportive, inspiring and rejuvenating and they love how the camaraderie and bonding is so organic.""

""We do plan to offer more women's-specific trips,"" said Collin Daulong, who founded his active travel company, KC&E Adventures, with his wife and business partner, Caitlin, who was a professional tour guide in Italy for years. The company started as a mountain biking specialist in Vermont but has grown into a top boutique active travel company covering the globe, with an emphasis on the U.S., Italy, Croatia, Morocco and Iceland. They do a full gamut of hiking and road cycling like the other companies in this space, but also a lot of mountain biking and gravel riding, which the bigger companies have mostly overlooked.

I have traveled repeatedly with both B&R and Backroads, and they are wonderful companies, and both have very high repeat customer rates, a telltale sign of doing a good job. I recently did a trip with KC&E, which has grown mainly through very positive word of mouth, and it was a great experience, very personal. Their niche is delivering curated small group private trips for the same price (or less) as their peers charge for group trips that can have over 20 people. This is an excellent value proposition for luxury travel, but the one area in which they are still scheduling group departures is women-only trips. Next up for KC&E is a Women-Only Sonoran Single Track mountain biking trip in Arizona in February, 2025.

""The reason we started doing women's-only experiences is that when we began in Vermont, there was a clear desire from our clients for those types of trips. Whether they're beginner cyclists or seasoned riders, women sometimes prefer to be in an environment that understands the unique nuances of being a woman in the sport -- things like learning styles and comfort on the bike that men don't always relate to. Since our company is 50% woman-owned, it's something we're particularly passionate about. We're also noticing a growing interest in women's-specific trips that are health-adjacent but not necessarily focused on cycling. Wellness experiences like yoga, hiking, and other activities in exceptional locations with amazing food are resonating. Women enjoy having these spaces to connect with other women and share unique experiences together.""

The offerings are growing fast all across active travel. REI Adventures is the group trip travel arm of the famous national outdoor gear retailer, Recreational Equipment Inc, and specializes in domestic travel, Canada and National Parks. They have more than two dozen different women-only cycling, backpacking and multi-sport trips across the U.S., including classics such as hiking the Grand Canyon.

Established cycling specialist The Cycling House offers several women-only departures for its Arizona gravel camps, California wine country road cycling and Montana luxury ranch gravel trips.

Intrepid Travel is a major luxury tour operator that was also covered in my story on Guaranteed Departures and does a huge slate of both active and non-active group travel worldwide. They are a member of the prestigious Virtuoso consortium of luxury travel providers and advisors, and have a division called Women's Expeditions that offers adventurous trips to exotic spots such as Turkey, Morocco, Jordan, India, Pakistan and Nepal.

These are all top companies in the field and major players who I can personally recommend, but there are also a slew of companies entirely focused on this trend, including Adventure Women, Explorer Chick, Wild Women Expeditions, Adventures in Good Company and more."
Navigating LGBTQ+ Support In 2025 Brand Plans,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/michellegreenwald/2024/09/27/navigating-lgbtq-support-in-2025-brand-plans/,2024-09-27T14:30:37Z,"The history of LGBTQ+ brand support/allyship has been a roller coaster. Historically it had been considered risky for brands to express support for the community and whatever support there was, typically was relegated only to Pride month in June. Gradually, over the last two decades, the pendulum swung in the other direction, to the point it was considered risky for brands not to support the community for fear of being called out in social media. In 2023, the pendulum took a significant shift back, as a reaction to some inclusive marketer tactics:

- Bud Light engaged transgender model Dylan Malvaney as an influencer, as did Nike.

- Hershey engaged Fae Johnstone, a 27-year-old trans woman, as one of five women featured on limited-edition chocolate bars as part of their International Women's Day celebration.

- The North Face featured the model Pattie Gonia, a drag artist and activist, in a video running through the woods wearing a North Face rainbow mini-dress with matching rainbow leg warmers as part of its Summer of Pride celebration.

- Target offered a wide assortment specially produced Pride merchandise throughout its stores.

All received significant opposition from right wing conservatives. In some Target stores, displays were destroyed and workers were harassed. Bud Light and Target awkwardly pulled back their support, which then engaged the wrath of the LGBTQ+ community for not being sincere in their support and having the courage of their convictions. A study published in the March 20, 2024 edition of the Harvard Business Review entitled Lessons from The Bud Light Boycott, One Year Later, found that 8 months post Pride event, Bud Light sales and purchase incidence had decreased 28% nationally. The decline was approximately 32% in more Republican counties versus 22% in more Democratic counties. Retailers & distributors permanently reduced its shelf space, and many bars removed Bud Light tap handles. In the case of the North Face, Marjorie Taylor Green tweeted that it made her want to switch to generic brand clothing, and Lauren Boebert called for a boycott of all North Face Products. Despite this, the North Face stood behind their campaign and did not back down.

As Todd Murray, Founder/President of Gaybors Agency shared, 2024 cuts in Pride support have been based on corporate fear. They don't want to be in the bull's eye. According to the 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer, 87% of executives believe that taking a public stance on a social issue is riskier than staying silent. In 2024, many brands decided that making a bold statement of support for the community during Pride month was not worth the perceived risk and they pulled back on support. Significantly less Pride merchandise was produced and marketed at retail, and ad spend, social media and specific content were reduced.

There has also been a pullback in DEI spending and interest by high profile companies such as Brown Forman, Ford, Lowe's, Tractor Supply, Deere & Co. & Harley Davidson. According to Robyn Streisand, Dual Founder/CEO of The Mixx and Titanium, the first certified minority owned and operated agency founded 28 years ago, also a B-Corp, multi-cultural marketing peaked in 2020 during the political unrest associated with George Floyd's murder and the height of the Black Lives Matter movement. In this controversial 2024 election year, she's observed that many brands have pulled away from anything that can be perceived as political support for either party.

Why The Community Should Matter To Brands Economically

Kate Wolff, Founder and CEO of Lupine Creative and Co-Chair and Co-Founder of Do the WeRQ, an LGTBQ+ grassroots organization and platform for change geared toward the advertising and marketing industry, feels it's more important than ever for brands to future-proof themselves by supporting the LGBTQ+ community due to its incredible size, growth rate, and spending power. It's the largest minority in the U.S. and it cuts across every race, ethnicity, gender identity, socioeconomic group, age, and body type. According to a 2024 research report by Mintel, nearly half of the US population has a family member or friend who is LGBTQ+, and the community's spending power is estimated at $1.4 trillion this year. According to a Gallup poll in 2021, 20.8% of Gen Z identified as LGBTQ+ in the U.S., up from 10.5% in 2017. In that study, 56% of the U.S. LGBTQ+ identifying population was between 18 and 34. If younger than 18-year-olds were included, the percent would be even higher.

A 2020 study by Credit Suisse found that the LGBT inclusive stocks basket outperformed non-inclusive stocks. It showed that publicly traded companies that pursued solidarity with the queer community delivered above-average performance. A 2020 report from the U.S. Census found that same-sex couples had higher incomes than heterosexual couples, and a 2017 article in the Harvard Business Review cited that 2017 marked the point at which gay men in the U.S. surpassed straight men in average annual income.

Kate shared that while there's been much progress in LGBTQ+ support nationally, there has also unfortunately been a correlation of hate. According to the ACLU, earlier this year, 527 anti-LGBTQ+ bills were pending in different states and in 2023, 500 bills restricting LGBTQ+ rights were introduced in the U.S., more than in the past 5 years combined. 86 of those bills passed and hate speech about the community has been rising on social media. Industry watchdog GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) in its Advertising Visibility Index, shared that LGBTQ+ people were featured in only 3% of the 436 ads from the top 10 largest advertisers. Advertising spend on community media was reported as only 0.03% of all media, and only 1.5% of all multicultural media spend in the U.S.

Kate Wolff expressed that Gen Z expects brands to behave like people, and more than any other age cohort, they relate to brands through social media. The brands they choose are part of their identity. Micro-affirmations by brands can be powerful and companies need to show they're listening to their audience. As Todd Murray shared, ""Younger community members are more demanding. Brands need to figure it out now, or it will be too late. The world is changing. Social media is holding brands to account and you have to show up. You need to talk to young people and hear their stories.""

Insights from the 5 sector experts I interviewed coalesced around 9 important themes regarding how brands can best navigate planning for 2025 for authentic LGBTQ+ impact, within the context of balancing support for other multicultural groups.

1) As Robyn Streisand shared, if brands are true LGBTQ+ allies, that should be part of the mission, vision and value proposition, and there must be an internal corporate champion at the highest level. Jamie Dimon Chairman of JPMorgan Chase was cited as a role model who speaks frequently about community support both inside and outside the company and walks the talk. As Kate Wolf shared, support must be part of the entire company's commitment, so a Marketing executive who oversaw development of a community initiative that received negative backlash is supported by the organization and not blamed. As she stressed, there needs to be a back-up plan with planned responses and actions if unsurprising backlash happens.

2) Robyn Streisand also stressed that building trust, support and loyalty from the LGBTQ+ community is a long-term proposition. It's all about the long game, requiring from brands consistent actions, authenticity, and less emphasis on the now.

3) The community responds when brands show they care. In the 2024 LGBTQ+ Advertising and Brand Experience Study conducted by the advertising measurement organization DISQO with Do The WeRQ, 17% of the 6,000 individuals surveyed had a negative impression of brands that celebrate Pride month, including conservative activist groups, some of whom are disproportionately vocal. In contrast, 80% of the LGBTQ+ people surveyed had positive views of brands that support Pride Month. When asked ""Have you ever intentionally purchased a product marked with a Pride celebratory message because of the message"", 26% of respondents overall said yes, vs. 73% among LGBTQ+ respondents. As Matt Wagner, VP Client Services at LGBTQ+ marketing and consulting agency Target 10 stated , ""Queer consumers are hyper aware of how brands act"".

Todd Murray shared that the reaction among community members to supportive ads that come across as sincere is ""I'm excited to spend with brands that provide a space and place for me and my family."" Brands can show they care through authentic programing, dedicated sections on websites with relevant content from and for the community beyond the basics, and by providing a safe experience and place to meet others.

4) LGBTQ+ support should be year-round, not one month or one event that uses the rainbow logo. In the previously mentioned DISQO study, when asked how important it was that brands show support for the LGBTQ+ community year-round, 50% of the general population said yes vs. 88% of the LGBTQ+ population. As Matt Wagner shared, ""companies are trying to figure out what consistent engagement outside of celebrating Pride in June looks like, when it stops being Pride marketing and becomes authentic LGBTQ+ engagement.""

5) Robyn Streisand expressed that support should extend beyond marketing to include supplier diversity programs and ongoing community focused ERG's (Employee Resource Groups) internally in companies. According to the DISQO study, inclusive workplace policies were the #1 action that brands can take to show support. In advertising, the community should be involved in all roles that impact ultimate success of the message, including writing, storyline, language, intonation, message nuances, and the fine points of production that can all make a difference in making the community feel heard. Matt Wagner shared that involving LGBTQ+ directors, copywriters, graphic designers, and community experts in the project from start to finish ensures not only the right LGBTQ+ insights are harnessed, but the look and feel is authentically and uniquely queer. ""A wide variety of identities involved can mean that not just one particular queer POV shines through, but many. There needs to be a real connection in the work, and lived experience from those within the community can best result in campaigns that will resonate and not appear tone-deaf.""

6) The entire community should not be painted with one broad brush as there are significant differences among different gender identifying subsegments. A well-received effort involves showing more nuanced understanding and representation. It's essential to have different shades of the rainbow on the marketing team. While it's unrealistic to market to all the nuanced identities, one strategy is to let different members of the community ""speak"" alternately in marketing communication. Matt Wagner shared Kenvue's CARE WITH PRIDE® program for brands including Neutrogena, Tylenol, and Listerine to elevate diverse voices year-round. In a partnership with Jubilee Media, it focused on individualized storytelling and authentic representation by 5 diverse key opinion leaders through a ""pass the mic"" type podcast series on Spectrum. Todd Murray gave the example of a program for BetterHelp Online Therapy, where people shared their challenges and how therapy has helped them.

7) Todd Murray expressed that brand investment in LGBTQ+ causes and organizations should be a mix of top-tier organizations like the Trevor Project and Human Rights Campaign (HRC), but also very importantly, investments in smaller, more local organizations that really need the support to survive and do good. Smaller non-profits can address the challenges and uplift the voices of real, everyday people on a very local level.

8) Understanding the queer media ecosystem can be just as important as the actual message. As Matt Wagner pointed out, context and environment matter for reaching micro targets with nuanced messages, and getting the best return on media spend. He suggested exploring not only legacy queer platforms, but also smaller, newer ones like Autostraddle, a news and entertainment site for the community, and So.Gay, a site that focuses on gay culture.

9) There is a lack of creativity and innovation in LGBTQ+ marketing - but LGBTQ+ community members can amplify that creativity. The typical message is Brand X is proud to support the LGBTQ+ community, and the same mega LGBTQ+ influencers tend to be utilized by different companies which can create confusion. Micro-influencers can better reach micro-targets. They're known to have higher engagement rates, can generate more creative and engaging messaging, and can span interest realms from performance art, to graphic arts and fashion. As Matt Wagner pointed out, ""general marketing agencies tend to develop creative that talks to queer people about queerness, and there are other messages that can engage the community.""

Key Take-Aways

In spite of some recent opposition, brand support for the growing and economically huge LGBTQ+ community matters more than ever, yet it's undeniably challenging to figure out how best to show up. What's key is that that companies articulate their support throughout organizations and embed it in the company's mission, vision and values. What's needed is having:

To quote Graham, ""The pressures of election year communications and the general need to reassess given tense discussions in the marketplace creates new challenges for CMOs. But wise marketers seeking growth will use this time to strategize and determine what committed investment and policy look like in the face of backlash. The stats and the spend are firmly in favor of committed support for diverse experiences, but leaders need a decisive map of how to connect to that spend so they can stop reacting and start acting."""
Opinion | A new documentary highlights America's complicated reality with trans identities,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/netflix-doc-will-harper-wrestles-trans-identity-trumps-america-rcna172939,2024-09-27T14:21:12Z,"About an hour into the new Netflix documentary ""Will and Harper,"" Hollywood actor and comedian Will Ferrell and his close friend Harper Steele take stock of the cross-country trip the two have embarked on. Steele, a former ""Saturday Night Live"" writer, reads off a handful of hate comments people had posted on social media following a string of public appearances by the two.

They share a look, and Ferrell says he hadn't much considered that his usual humorous antics would expose his trans friend to difficult public sentiment. It's the most impactful scene in a solid film documenting what it's like to be a trans American in close proximity to a celebrity. As Steele notes toward the end of the film, not many trans people have a legendary funnyman like Ferrell to help shield them from direct harassment.

The film centers on Steele's identity as both a trans woman who came out during the pandemic-era lockdowns and someone who has historically enjoyed cross-country, sometimes sketchy, travel all over the U.S. While most people may see the film as a Will Ferrell ""trans 101"" learning experience, in which he gets to ask his trans friend the usual curious questions about her identities, to me the film is more about Steele's relearning how to exist in some of her favorite types of places as a trans woman, using her celebrity friend as a sort of soft landing toward that goal.

Before her transition, Steele used to love stopping at random dive bars in the deepest red areas of the country, sometimes even hitchhiking from place to place. But after her transition, she's been afraid to go back to those places, sticking closer to the safety of her home just outside New York City.

This is a real problem for many trans women, me included. Though I came out half a decade before the pandemic, I haven't been up for going out much since the Covid era. Where I used to be a frequent traveler around the States, now I would rather stay at home as the country has descended further and further into Republican-driven hatred for trans people.

I imagine Steele's story will be relatable to many trans women. But interestingly, in the documentary, her actual interactions with folks out in public don't match up with the many hate comments online or the reports of danger that we read so often.

In one scene, Steele decides to walk alone into a bar somewhere in deep red rural America while Ferrell waits in the car. As she enters, the camera captures some sketchy glances from some of the bar's patrons, a Confederate flag and a bunch of Trump paraphernalia on the walls. Eventually, Steele works up the nerve to strike up a conversation with another bargoer nearby, and it goes well. Only after she attaches herself to a group at the bar does she call in Ferrell, who obviously captured the attention of everyone there.

The conversation was genuine and full of personal curiosity and not related to her trans identity. In another scene shortly after, Steele and Ferrell go to a stock car race on a dirt track in Oklahoma. There, Steele mentions to a couple of guys in the stands that she used to attend races like that all the time before her transition but since then she hasn't been sure how people would react.

The men she's talking to, who look straight out of central casting for rural white American men, encourage her to come back. ""Don't be afraid. If you want to come out, come out,"" one says, implying that they're all just racing people.

In another scene earlier in the film, Steele and Ferrell meet and take photos with Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb, a Republican, at an Indiana Pacers basketball game. Afterward, the two discuss how Holcomb signed legislation outlawing gender affirming care for trans minors and talk about how they wish they had thought of it in the moment so they could have asked the governor about the issue.

Overall, ""Will and Harper"" tells an interesting story about how America is tangling with the issue of trans rights. In face-to-face conversation, Steele's trans identity seemingly isn't an issue. The film captures genuine connections with strangers, while all the hate and vitriol are reserved for keyboard warriors who never bother to interact with Steele face-to-face, having only seen her from afar at the Pacers game or at a steakhouse in Texas.

Personal contact and connection have always been the best weapon for LGBTQ acceptance in the U.S., and trans issues are no different. While the documentary tells a touching story about friendship enduring a major change, to me it's also a story about America enduring a transition of its own: finding a fit for trans people in red state America. If only every trans American could have a celebrity like Will Ferrell around for safety."
"Sharp tongued, indomitable, and beloved actress Dame Maggie Smith, dies at 89",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/1228377614/maggie-smith-dead,2024-09-27T14:11:12Z,"Dame Maggie Smith - whose acting career spanned seven decades and traversed the stage and screen - has died at age 89. She passed away peacefully surrounded by family and friends on Friday morning, her publicist confirmed.

Smith was once so slender and delicate as Desdemona that Laurence Olivier's Othello could easily smother her with a pillow. By the end of her career, no one would've dared try.

Though she was fine-featured and stood barely five-foot-five, casting directors realized early-on that her characters would inevitably appear indomitable, whether she was bristling with epithets in Shaw, casting spells as Harry Potter's Professor McGonagall, or silencing opposition with sideways glances as Downton Abbey's formidable Lady Violet.

What Maggie Smith learned about holding audiences rapt, she learned early. She arrived on the professional stage in her teens, and graduated quickly to Britain's National Theater, the West End and Broadway, where her precise diction proved ideal for delivering the barbs of restoration comedy, and the epigrams of Noel Coward. Let her play the sort of chatterbox that George Bernard Shaw wrote in The Millionairess, and it was sometimes hard for her co-stars to get a word in edgewise.

Almost as nonstop was the title role that won her a Best Actress Oscar in 1970 -- her deluded teacher at a Scottish girls' school in The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.

""Give me a gherll at an impressionable age,"" she purred, ""and she is mine for life.""

The character was not, in fact, in her prime, but Smith most definitely was. In the next eight years, she starred in six films, including Travels With My Aunt and Death on the Nile, triumphed on TV in everything from Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice to The Carol Burnett Show, and on stage, held title roles from Hedda Gabler to Peter Pan.

All of this before winning another Oscar in Neil Simon's California Suite, for playing multiple characters including a conniving actress who is herself up for an Oscar, and who practices a delicious, hammily self-deprecating acceptance speech at one point, saying she doesn't want to ""sob all over Burt Reynolds.""

No sobs in Smith's actual acceptance speech at the Oscars. She thanked her writer, director and co-star.

All of this was well before a sort of second act in Smith's career that found her prim and proper as a chaperone in A Room with a View, primly comic as the mother superior in Sister Act with Whoopi Goldberg, cranky in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel movies, crankier still as the woman who came to stay in Alan Bennett's driveway in The Lady in the Van, and downright viperish as mother to Ian McKellen's King in Shakespeare's Richard III.

Though he'd been slaughtering all comers for most of the movie at that point, there was such venom in her declaration that he was ""proud, subtle, sly and bloody,"" that McKellen looked shaken. As well he might.

Contemporary playwrights had also taken note. Peter Shaffer, the author of Amadeus and Equus, remembered he was once asked by Smith at a party why he kept writing plays about two men talking. He responded by going home and writing Lettice and Lovage specifically for her, about an extravagantly over-imaginative tour guide ""to celebrate her glee and glitter and perfect timing,"" he told interviewers. ""And above all wit -- her presence is witty. ""

And then Smith's career -- for which she'd been made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and later a Dame and a member of the Order of the Companions of Honor -- had a third act. One in which her fame grew out of all proportion to what she'd known before. Children recognized her on the street from the Harry Potter movies (she was in all but one of them).

And while she was casting spells on kids, their parents and grandparents awaited her every utterance on TV's Downton Abbey, where for six seasons, she brought a capricious sense of humor to the sort of woman she never was in real life -- aloof, entitled, un-diplomatic, impatient, argumentative, hidebound, and so thoroughly winning, audiences couldn't get enough of her.

That, at least, Lady Violet had in common with the woman who played her. Maggie Smith left audiences craving more of her presence for seven decades, though she worked so constantly that the dowager countess' most famously clueless question -- ""what is a weekend?"" -- might almost have been her own."
Her state bans gender-affirming care for teenagers. So she travels 450 miles for it,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5104225/transgender-teens-gender-affirming-care-bans-iowa-minneapolis,2024-09-27T14:05:08Z,"DES MOINES, Iowa - In the future, Veronica sees herself in a big city.

""I like chaos and spontaneousness,"" she says, and she doesn't get much of that in her town surrounded by farmland outside of Des Moines. It's slow and boring, she says. Matching rows of ranch houses line wide manicured streets, with SUVs parked in the driveways.

Veronica is 17. She has two more years of high school, then she can graduate and leave.

Hers is not just the usual adolescent wanderlust. This Iowa town has turned out to be a punishing place to be a transgender teenager. Her mom, Emily, has fought to change her name in the high school's system. There's no good option for which bathroom to use at school. Emily says neighbors and classmates have made cruel comments.

NPR has agreed not to use the family's last name because of concerns for Veronica's safety.

Iowa was part of a wave of states that passed laws related to transgender young people in the last two years. Currently, 26 states have laws on the books banning gender-affirming care for trans teens, and an estimated 110,000 trans teenagers live in states with bans in effect. Virtually all major U.S. medical organizations, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, support access to gender-affirming care for young people.

Iowa's ban took effect in March 2023. Teenagers like Veronica who were in the midst of treatment had a few months to find an out-of-state option or stop their treatment.

""You never think, as a mom, 'I can't wait for my kid to grow up and leave the state,' but that's where I'm at right now,"" Emily tells Veronica. It's dusk, and they sit next to each other on the couch in the living room, surrounded by pillows. Thin-crust pizzas bake in the oven.

Emily's voice catches: ""I can't wait for you to find your people, your support, your health care providers -- everything you need. I want that for you, even if it's far away.""

For now, the family is rooted in Iowa. Veronica is the oldest of four children - her parents are divorced and the kids are at their dad's house in the same neighborhood half the time. All their grandparents live in Iowa, too.

So when Iowa's gender-affirming care ban took effect last year, the family made a decision: Veronica and her mom would travel out-of-state every few months to keep getting the care Veronica needed.

The day of Veronica's appointment in Minnesota starts before dawn. The residential streets are empty and dark. Cicadas chirp. Inside the house, Emily rushes around -- making sure the younger kids have a plan to get to school, finding snacks and tea bags for the day's road trip (she's not a coffee drinker). By 6:44 a.m., she is at the wheel of her Jeep, with Veronica riding shotgun, headed for the interstate. They have almost four hours of driving ahead of them to get to the clinic.

Mom and daughter have catching up to do - where Veronica went when she snuck out a few months ago, how she talked her way out of a speeding ticket, what music to play in the car.

""It's good,"" her mom, Emily, says. ""One-on-one is hard with four kids.""

Before Veronica even came out as trans, her mom sensed it. She remembers the specific moment -- a transgender woman came and spoke to a class she was taking in 2017. ""It was like I was hit by a bolt of lightning. I was like, 'This is my child. I know this in my soul, in my heart,'"" she remembers. ""I was kind of just waiting to hear -- I wasn't pushing it, but I just knew.""

Years passed. Quietly, Veronica told her friends that she is trans in 2020, right as the pandemic was starting. ""I kind of just held it between me and them during that time,"" she says. ""I wanted to be sure about it, you know? I didn't want to jump into something that I wasn't sure about and, like, tell everyone and then it's like, 'Oh, wait, never mind.'""

A year later, she was ready to tell her family members: ""I was like, 'OK, it's been a year. Nothing's changed. I don't think it ever will.'""

She started eighth grade with her new name.

Even though her mom was expecting it, ""when you came out to me, I had such a mix of emotions,"" Emily tells Veronica. ""I had this part of me that was like a cheerleader, 'Let's do this. Let's get the flag in the yard.' And then there is the mom part of me that felt so afraid of the targeting, the bullying and all these terrible statistics for this marginalized group -- it was scary.""

She also had grief she needed to work through, she realized. ""This is my oldest child, who's also at the same time entering into this adolescent stage -- so I am grieving my baby boy on a couple different levels.""

""Was that hard to hear?"" Emily asks, and Veronica answers, ""a little.""

Iowa is where Emily grew up, and where she moved to raise her own family. Then her home state started to pass laws affecting her family. In March 2023, the state passed a law dictating which bathroom students can use at school, and another banning gender affirming care for minors.

""We need to just pause, we need to understand what these emerging therapies actually may potentially do to our kids,"" Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds told reporters right before she signed the bills into law. ""My heart goes out to them. I'm a parent, I'm a grandmother, I know how difficult this is. This is an extremely uncomfortable position for me to be in. I don't like it. But I have to do what I believe right now is in the best interest of the kids.""

When Iowa's ban took effect, Veronica was taking puberty blockers. By that point, she had been out as trans to her friends for three years - out to her parents and siblings for two. She had also developed an eating disorder so severe she has gone to residential treatment twice.

Her mom Emily thinks these two challenges are related. ""I wonder if -- just knowing that you don't want to use the bathroom [at school], and so then the way to avoid using the bathroom would be not to drink and not to eat during the day.""

Veronica shrugs. ""I think they were just both happening simultaneously, separately,"" she says.

Regardless, the past few years have been difficult for her. ""Struggling with an eating disorder, on top of that, having gender dysphoria -- it's like two things just working together to ruin you,"" Veronica says.

The ""pause"" in gender affirming care, as Iowa's governor put it, was at odds with Veronica's own biological timing. After the ban became law, the family got a message from the clinic explaining that they needed to stop Veronica's gender care. Her doctors said if she couldn't find a way to keep getting puberty blocker shots on time out of state, she would have restarted testosterone-driven puberty. That would have meant bodily changes like voice deepening, the growth of her Adam's apple, facial hair, shoulder-broadening and more -- some of which could be changed later with surgery or other procedures, some of which would be permanent.

Emily says her family's path forward was always clear to her. ""It was just never a thought that we wouldn't continue,"" she says. ""As your mom I'm going to do everything I can to help you -- I love you."" The idea that legislators are making medical decisions for her family ""doesn't seem right,"" she says.

""I see it almost like a necessity,"" Veronica adds quietly. ""Not having access to it just seems terrifying, in a way.""

Their support network in Iowa helped. ""I ended up with a list of resources, a couple of them, actually,"" Emily says. ""It was a Facebook, Zoom, call-to-action sort of thing."" She called around until she found a new pediatrician in Minneapolis who could take over Veronica's gender treatment.

The first order of business was continuing puberty blocking shots, which she needs to get at an in-person appointment every few months. Then, in December of last year, her new doctor started her on hormone therapy. She started taking daily pills of estradiol, a type of estrogen, while she continued getting puberty blocker shots to keep her testosterone levels down. Since then, she's essentially been going through female puberty.

September's appointment was their third one in Minneapolis. Her mom thinks intervening now will help Veronica look more like someone who was born female when she's older, which will hopefully make her safer -- less likely to be the target of violence or discrimination for being a trans person.

Veronica is really happy with all of it. ""I feel like it's helped me feel a lot better about my body,"" she says, ""and made the eating disorder less prominent in my life.""

Emily says she's noticed. ""I just feel like your trend has just been up and up and up since you've started your estradiol,"" she says. ""You're much more social and out and about with friends, you're not home in your room as much. You seem happier. You're not picking at your little brother all the time.""

More than three hours into the drive, the cornfields give way to warehouses and, eventually, high rises as we arrive in Minneapolis.

In the exam room, Veronica sits cross legged on the paper-lined exam table - her doctor starts by checking in with her - about her friends, her after school job, school. NPR has agreed not to name the clinic or doctor because of their safety and security concerns. He asks about her eating disorder recovery and whether she has enough support with that. He takes her blood pressure and other vitals.

""How is estrogen going?"" he asks. ""Great,"" she beams.

He asks if she's noticing effects -- if the medication is doing things, ""and those things are the things that we want and we're feeling good?""

""Definitely,"" she answers.

He asks about side effects, and she says she hasn't noticed any. ""Any change in overall goals?"" he continues. ""Still feeling like this is what we want, this is making life feel more tolerable, and feeling better in my skin, all that kind of stuff?""

She heads to another room for a blood draw and the puberty blocker shot, which is a painful injection, given with a large-gauge needle into her leg. She asks to hold her mom's hand for that part.

Veronica's pediatrician says he's pleased with how her gender care is going. ""She is having the result that we hope she would have, which is feeling more peace with her body and being seen by people the way that she sees herself and wants to be seen,"" he says.

Not all gender diverse teens want these kinds of medical interventions, he notes. ""The medical piece of gender care is all driven by patient goals and embodiment goals, and the truth is, not everybody wants this kind of binary transition.""

In Veronica's case, her vital signs and mental health have also improved since her appointment in the spring. ""She's doing well -- in an ideal world, I would see her more often, but it is a burden [for her] to get here,"" her doctor says.

Three of the four states bordering Minnesota have gender affirming care bans for youth -- Iowa and North Dakota and South Dakota. Minnesota has gone in the opposite direction. Minnesota's legislature passed a ""trans refuge"" law last year, and since then, hundreds of trans people and their families have moved to the state.

But not every family can move. Even traveling for appointments is difficult, with airfare or gas expenses, hotels, taking time off work.

For Veronica's family, moving is not possible, but traveling is, although it's grueling. Her doctor says that she is one of 15 patients he's currently treating for gender dysphoria who travel in from out-of-state.

Her mom says part of what makes the travel tolerable is that Veronica will turn 18 next summer. ""Then hopefully she can have more freedoms and have more access in Iowa, assuming that the laws don't change before then."" At the moment, gender affirming care for adults is legal in Iowa.

After about 45 minutes at the clinic, Veronica is all done with the appointment. She and her mom stop at a Minneapolis pharmacy to pick up a six month supply of estrogen pills. They aren't allowed to get the refills in Iowa because of the health care ban.

Then, it's back in the car and back on the highway to go all the way back to Des Moines. They both seem relieved to have the labs done and refill in hand.

Before long, Veronica leans against the window and falls asleep. Along the highway, the ""Welcome to Iowa"" sign appears. Emily notes the tagline on the sign is ""Freedom to Flourish.""

""Should have a little asterisk by it,"" she murmurs.

More interstate, more cornfields, more hours. ""It's so boring, I'm just ready to be done,"" Emily says. Veronica wakes up and bugs her mom to drive faster. She's pleased her leg doesn't hurt from the shot, but she thinks it probably will tomorrow.

Finally, they reach their exit. Veronica starts putting her sneakers back on. They pull into the driveway, and she bolts out of the car. She's off to meet up with friends.

Emily climbs out of the car more slowly, gathering together cups and snacks. They've been gone for nearly ten hours and traveled 450 miles. ""Long day,"" she sighs.

Big picture, she says, it's worth it. She's happy to do it for her daughter."
Netflix's Best New Show Has A Near-Perfect 95% Critic Score,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/27/netflixs-best-new-show-has-a-near-perfect-95-critic-score/,2024-09-27T13:32:02Z,"Netflix has been on a bit of a roll lately with its movie offerings, and now we have a great new TV show to add to the mix, racking up impressive critic scores.

The show is Nobody Wants This, which would make for a funny title if the show bombed, but instead, it's doing great with a 95% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes and an also-solid 84% audience score.

The ten episode series of 30 minute episodes has a stellar cast which is led by The Good Place's Kristen Bell and The OC's Adam Brody (sorry I will always know him from The OC even if it was 20 years ago). It also features the likes of Veep's Timothy Simmons (Jonah!) and Succession's Justine Lupe (Willa!). Great lineup.

The show was created by Erin Foster, an actress turned showrunner whose outing here is stellar, it seems. The show is described as ""semi-autobiographical. Here's the official synopsis of the comedy:

""Nobody Wants This centers on the unlikely relationship between an outspoken, agnostic woman, Joanne (Golden Globe nominee Kristen Bell), and an unconventional rabbi, Noah (SAG nominee Adam Brody). From the moment they meet at a friend's dinner party, both can tell there's something between them. But also potentially between them are their differing outlooks on life, all of the modern obstacles to love, and their sometimes well-meaning, sometimes sabotaging families -- including her sister Morgan (Justine Lupe) and his brother Sasha (Timothy Simons).""

The show has debuted at #2 on the Netflix Top 10 list, but it's unclear if it will make it to #1 with the relative popularity of Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, given how big Ryan Murphy's previous killer outing, Dahmer, proved to be on the service. It was the third most-watched English series on Netflix ever, and if this follow-up gets even a fraction of that, it may be on top for a while.

Nobody Wants This is going to be polar opposite in terms of subject matter and tone, perhaps a refreshing change of pace if you did just want the Menendez story. Or the Mr. McMahon documentary about the fallen-from-grace WWE owner. Or the very bad Ellen DeGeneres special. Really, it's the best show on the list right now, that much is clear. Time to give it a watch and see if it lives up to these scores."
Kerry Washington On The Messaging Of Her Simpson Street Productions: 'We See You',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffconway/2024/09/27/kerry-washington-on-the-messaging-of-her-simpson-street-productions-we-see-you/,2024-09-27T13:22:37Z,"For seven captivating seasons, Kerry Washington took the phrase ""damage control"" to a whole new level as crisis-management leader Olivia Pope on the smash-hit Shondaland/ABC drama series Scandal.

These days, Washington is still making waves across our screens, as a devoted pioneer in bringing the stories of marginalized groups to our world with an entertaining and thought-provoking approach, through her Simpson Street production company.

Founded by Washington in 2016, Simpson Street has paved the way in bringing critically-acclaimed shows like the Little Fires Everywhere limited series to Hulu in 2020, as well as UnPrisoned and Reasonable Doubt to the popular streamer.

Being also the CEO of Simpson Street, I sat down with Washington and her Executive Vice President of Production and Development Pilar Savone (who joined Washington's team in 2018) to discuss the past, present and future of their production company. Knowing that the pair worked together on Quentin Tarantino's 2012 film Django Unchained, I began our conversation, curious of their own origin story together.

Washington said, ""It's Django - we met on Django! What an exciting project to be a part of, but also really challenging, creatively - really challenging, logistically. I think we really bonded on just the intensity and the challenge of bringing that material to life, especially as women together on that set. So, we worked really well together and I saw that Pilar & I had really good chemistry, but I also saw that she had great chemistry with other members on my team because we were always navigating a lot of shifts & changes and tiny crises on-set. So, that was kind of the beginning of working together.""

Savone added: ""It was fun! We worked on this one project together and I think we realized that we had a lot of chemistry in that way, and kind of wanted to be putting the same thing out into the world. I really got along with her team, which I think is really important. Then, we went through a process - Kerry put me through the ringer, really making sure we were the right partners. It was really great because I think you need to [do that] when you make a decision like this. You have to really make sure that you want to be in a business with this person and make sure that it's successful and that you have the same goals & aspirations.""

So, over these eight years of Simpson Street's existence, what is it about the current television landscape and the state of our democracy that makes Simpson Street so vital, in their opinions?

Washington said, ""Oh, that's such an interesting question. I never thought about in that context, like our work is vital to a democracy in some way because I think there is this assumption that Simpson Street has like a strictly political mandate - that we're coming at things at a participant-like lens, but we're not. We gravitate toward a lot of different kinds of materials and genres and tones and themes, but I think often because we are centering marginalized folks, in particular Black women but all kinds of marginalized folks, that we get thought of as political because it's a political act to center people that society doesn't always want to put in the center of the story.""

She added about Simpson Street's ongoing mission: ""We look for stories that are about very unique people, cultures, situations, but developing stories - frameworks that are about the things we all share. We all want to be loved, we all want to belong - we all have fear. We all go on these heroes' journeys, so it's that intersection of like what makes us different and what makes us all the same.""

Savone said, ""It's interesting - I'll use UnPrisoned as an example. When we first read that script, it was really about a father and a daughter. It was something that we had never tackled before. Kerry and I both have really great relationships with our dads, so I think it really spoke to that, more so than anything. Then, as we started to dig in even more, it started to become about the criminal justice system and what does it feel like and look like for people to be in families with people who were previously incarcerated. So again, it's all about relationships and characters, and then as we start to unpack these stories, they all begin to mean something and say something, organically.""

With both UnPrisoned and Reasonable Doubt having both of their second seasons out on Hulu this year, as well as Simpson Street's new documentary Daughters now on Netflix, a Sundance prize-winning documentary about a group of girls reuniting with their dads behind bars, I wondered why Washington believes that these stories are ones that audiences from all walks of life should take a chance on, if they have not done so already.

""Because they're great entertainment,"" Washington said. ""I love when you point to those three projects - they could not be more different. One is a really heartbreaking, heart-opening documentary. One is a really sexy, thrilling one-hour drama and the other is a poignant, heartfelt half-hour dramedy. They're all very different projects - and yet, they do all have these themes of justice and what it means to be a young, Black girl or a Black woman in society today. I think part of great entertainment is something that is not just exciting to watch, but also something that leaves a real impact on your heart and on your mind - that it changes you a little bit by making you think more and feel more and live more fully because you are so fully brought into these lives of these characters, or in the case of Daughters, these real people.""

Pivoting back to the entertainment industry, following last year's writers' and actors' strikes, I was curious what is it about the industry today that gives this hardworking duo optimism and excitement right now, as well as what they are seeing that they are watching carefully, to ensure that things do not go in the wrong direction.

Washington said, ""I think for me, in terms of optimism and excitement, I think one of the gifts of these really challenging years, whether it's coming out of Covid - coming out of these strikes - is that we have had to be much more discerning and specific about what we really want to do. The landscape is hard - the ecosystem can be really challenging right now. People are a little bit more risk-averse - budgets are tighter. So, when we take on material, we have to really challenge ourselves to make sure we are taking on material that we 100% love and are ready to fight to the end to make it live. And that's great - to wake up with that kind of clarity about your slate, it really gives everybody at the company a deeper sense of purpose.""

Savone said of the more cautious side of entertainment, ""I think to the other end of that is that part of the challenge is that we will often hear something that somebody on our team will love and think, This is it - this is a slam dunk! Sometimes, we have to be the ones to say this is really great and there is something there, but I think getting this made right now is going to be really challenging, whether it's an unknown writer or it's not a story that feels like it's going to hit the masses. I think because everybody is so risk-averse.""

Speaking to the evolution of Simpson Street thus far, Washington prides herself on how her team has been able to thrive on innovation and within their partnerships over the years.

""We really believe in the power of partnership,"" Washington said. ""Reese's [Witherspoon] company Hello Sunshine on Little Fires Everywhere and we have a really exciting project with Elisabeth Moss's company [Love & Squalor Pictures] for Apple. We love partnering with other artists who are as committed to carrying water and operating, as both actors and producers, as we are.""

Savone added when reflecting on Simpson Street's evolution: ""We've actually been able to get things done and get things made and get them on the air. When you first start, we made a couple of pilots that never saw the light of day but we were in there, we were making things, we were doing something - we were creating and we were learning from that, right? A lot of times, what we made was really great and we got caught in a regime change, so it would never move forward. As we have evolved in the past couple years with have two shows on the air right now in this time, which is remarkable and we feel really grateful, I think knowing that there's content that we have that's out there that can be examples of what we've made and what we want to make is us being evolved, right? It's not just about wanting to get stuff out there - we actually are doing it.""

As Washington and Savone look at the Simpson Street content that is already available to us viewers, as well as the projects in the works, I was curious of the overall messaging that they hope their increasing number of titles are having on our society as a whole.

""We want people to feel like they belong,"" Washington said. ""We want people to feel like no matter who you are or where you come from, that your story matters and that you belong. We want you to see yourself in stories that look like you and sound like you and reflect your particular life experience, but we also want you to see yourself in stories that look nothing like you or where you come from. We want people to connect more deeply with themselves and with their shared humanity with others.""

As Simpson Street has grown, I asked Savone and Washington if there have been any parts of their journey so far, where they have maybe been caught by surprise, seeing how the effect of Simpson Street has gone beyond their initial goals, purpose and expectation over these eight years?

Washington said, ""That's such a good question! We have such big goals, dreams and expectations - I don't know if we have surpassed them yet.""

Savone said, ""Exactly! I feel like we're not there yet - like it's great to see what we have out in the world, but I think we also are like, Okay, well what's next? What can we do next? It's a drive to keep going.""

Washington added: ""I will say there are 'pinch me' moments though where like - there are a few women who have been lighthouses for me in my career - women who have been role models and mentors. I'll say they're like Rita Moreno or Barbra Streisand or Cicely Tyson or Diahann Carroll - that's my Mount Rushmore of incredible women in the business and I've been really lucky to be in relationships with most of them. Diahann Carroll, in particular, was somebody that I was very close to and her passing was a real loss for me. I would say one of the 'pinch me' moments of our company, and Pilar knows this, is when [Diahann's] daughter came to us with the idea of developing a show - like a really sexy, exciting show inspired by her life and her work that we're developing now. I was like, Wow, this is a 'pinch me' moment, right? Those kinds of moments where like the people you admire most say that they want to collaborate with you, creatively and professionally. Those are the moments where you stop and go - Okay, this feels like a full-circle moment to acknowledge how lucky we are to be doing the kinds of things we love to do, with the kinds of people we want to do it with.""

Washington continues to utilize her voice and her elevated platform as she tours the country, speaking out with her former Scandal co-stars about reproductive rights in America. She also hosted the final evening of the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago back in August, showing her support for U.S. presidential hopeful and current Vice President Kamala Harris. So, I wondered what Washington's beloved Olivia Pope character would think of having a Black and Asian woman at the top of a party ticket?

Washington said, ""I think that Olivia Pope would be trying to do everything in her power to strategize to make sure that we protect democracy right now.""

Looking even further ahead, I was curious what Savone and Washington would say is next for their Simpson Street team, as they set their sights on the future.

Savone said, ""It's to continue to grow. We're lucky that we have two shows on the air right now. Next year, we want three. We have a movie in development at Netflix called Rockaway that we're really hoping will go. The Diahann Carroll project is something that we are really, really excited about. It's to continue to put really great content out there that we feel proud of - that we can stand behind and put our heart & soul into.""

Washington added: ""In our work, we don't shy away from having difficult, nuanced, complicated conversations. We're not afraid of complexity in the stories that we tell and the characters we bring forward.""

As we concluded our conversation, I left these Simpson Street leaders with one last question - What would you both want to say to industry creatives out there that are having difficulty getting their stories told and being seen within entertainment? What do you want to say to these individuals that are striving to hold onto their hope and tenacity, but struggle within the roughness of an industry at the moment?

Washington said, ""We see you. We relate - it's tough! I want to be honest - I guess that's part of it, right? Sometimes, there's the assumption that like because you're a Kerry Washington, everything's a slam dunk and that is just not the case. It's hard for all of us right now and I think it's important to say that. I think I want to say to more of the kind of industry gatekeepers - I want to remind folks who are making decisions at the highest level to remember while you're keeping in mind your bottom lines and your fiduciary responsibilities - obviously as producers, we understand the importance of that mindset, but remember that this is a creative landscape. We should not give over all of our decision-making power to algorithms. We have to make sure that we stay human and stay creative and have the courage, even in the risk-averse environment, to take risks."""
Britney Spears' Comeback Single Goes Platinum,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2024/09/27/britney-spears-comeback-single-goes-platinum/,2024-09-27T13:22:33Z,"After years of quiet -- at least when it came to releasing new music -- Britney Spears returned to the medium that made her a superstar in 2022 with a high-profile collaboration. The singer celebrated becoming a free woman once again with ""Hold Me Closer,"" a duet with none other than Elton John. The tune was a quick win, and it showed that the world still loved her.

More than two years after it was released, ""Hold Me Closer"" earns its first certifications from the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America). The organization hands out honors when tunes and albums hit certain consumption thresholds, such as gold (500,000 equivalent units) and platinum (one million units).

""Hold Me Closer"" is now a platinum-certified smash in the U.S. The single collects both a gold plaque and a platinum one at the same time, going from no awards to two in a heartbeat.

Spears earns her first new RIAA-certified single in nearly a year. The last time she saw any of her releases collect any wins from the music industry organization was back in October 2023. That month turned out to be perhaps the biggest in the decades that Spears has been a household name, when it came to these honors.

On October 24, 2023, more than two dozen of Spears' songs earned some kind of recognition from the RIAA. That's most of her well-known hits. Some of her singles collected their first honor, like ""Do Somethin',"" ""Sometimes,"" and ""Overprotected,"" which all went gold. Other smashes advanced much higher, such as ""Womanizer"" (six-times platinum) and ""Circus"" (five-times platinum).

John, meanwhile, hasn't scored a new RIAA singles award in more than two years. He last collected any honor from the organization in May 2022 when ""Cold Heart (Pnau Remix),"" another superstar collaboration with Dua Lipa, went from nothing to double platinum at once.

""Hold Me Closer"" saw John mashing up his past hits ""Tiny Dancer,"" ""The One,"" and ""Don't Go Breaking My Heart"" to create something fresh and new. He paired those lyrics with electronic pop production, which ensured the tune appealed to younger listeners. He tried the same thing with ""Cold Heart,"" and that turned out to be a huge global smash, so it made sense that he'd try it again.

John and Spears sent ""Hold Me Closer"" into the top 10 on the Hot 100, and it still stands as the latest major win for both musicians. While the track wasn't a longstanding win, its lofty debut made it an important win, and it showed that there was still an appetite for pop smashes from Spears -- though she has yet to follow the tune up with another big single."
Hurricane Helene: FOX Weather meteorologist rescues woman from car during live shot as floodwaters rise,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/hurricane-helene-fox-weather-meteorologist-rescues-woman-from-car-live-shot-floodwaters-rise,2024-09-27T13:07:00Z,"Bob Van Dillen joins Fox & Friends from Atlanta as severe flooding affects residents.

FOX Weather meteorologist Bob Van Dillen is being praised as a hero after rescuing a woman from her car as Hurricane Helene floodwaters rapidly rose during a live shot outside Atlanta on Friday.

Van Dillen joined ""Fox & Friends"" to explain why he couldn't sit around and wait for first responders to help when he saw a woman in danger as the deadly storm wreaked havoc.

""I know that we're swamped here with all of the 911 calls, because there are so many high-water rescues that we've already documented so far... [she] called 911 and, five minutes, 10 minutes, and you could hear screaming, right? You could hear through my live shot, real loud"" Van Dillen told Steve Doocy.

TRACKING HELENE: LIVE MAPS, POWER OUTAGES, WIND PROJECTIONS AND MORE

""That's her car right there,"" Van Dillen added with a car that was almost completely submerged in the background. ""So I just said, 'You know what? I realize I'm with you guys on the air, but I can't let it go.'""

The FOX Weather meteorologist ""dropped everything"" to help the woman get out of the situation safely.

""I took my wallet out of my pants, and I went in there, waded in, got chest deep,"" Van Dillen said as he was told by Janice Dean not to be humble about the heroic effort.

""You know how it is. I was concerned that one, maybe there was a nice swift current, but the current really wasn't that bad. But, the water temperature I was afraid of, too. The water temperature is probably about 80 [degrees]. So, all of those things were working pretty nicely, so, that being said, the water came up to about my chest,"" Van Dillen added.

""She was in there, she was still strapped into her car and the water was actually rising and getting up into the car itself, so she was about, almost neck deep submerged in her own car.""

Dean then asked what would have happened if Van Dillen didn't step up.

""She would have drowned,"" Dean said.

""You know, I don't know,"" Van Dillen humbly said. ""I told her 'OK, undo your seatbelt,' she undid her seatbelt. I said, 'Let me have your phone, let me have your bags,' then put [her] on my back and we walked in... she's fine, she was in shock,"" Van Dillen said.

""She was cold, shivering, so I gave her one of my shirts and she was in our car, just warming up, about 20 minutes later the fire department came, saw that we were OK and went on to the next rescue, wherever they're going,"" he continued. ""Her husband just picked her up about five minutes ago.""

VIDEOS: HURRICANE HELENE PRODUCES RECORD STORM SURGE ALONG FLORIDA'S GULF COAST

""It was a good deed for the day,"" Doocy said.

Helene made landfall about 10 miles west-southwest of Perry, Florida, at 11:10 p.m. ET Thursday, and impacts have been felt across the Southeast and into portions of the mid-Atlantic as the monster storm pushed farther inland and began to weaken.

While wind does remain a concern, the greatest threat from Helene continues to be the flash flooding as torrential rain falls across the region, sending rivers and streams out of their banks, onto roads and into communities, trapping residents.

The flash flood threat stretches from the Southeast into the mid-Atlantic, where multiple Flash Flood Emergencies were issued early Friday morning, including the first-ever Flash Flood Emergency issued for Atlanta."
"From Wall Street To TikTok: How Vivian Tu Became ""Your Rich BFF"" And Empowered A New Generation.",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelachan/2024/09/27/from-wall-street-to-tiktok-how-vivian-tu-became-your-rich-bff-and-empowered-a-new-generation/,2024-09-27T12:58:19Z,"Vivian Tu, also known as Your Rich BFF, with 3 million followers on Instagram, didn't set out to be the social media financial guru. Tu's journey began with a viral TikTok video of financial tips, which has made her one of the most influential voices in financial literacy today. Through her platform, Tu educates people on the importance of financial literacy and empowers millions of Gen Z'ers, especially women, to make wise decisions and take control of their financial futures. Now, her influence extends even further through partnerships that blend financial empowerment with beauty -- proving that investment isn't just for Wall Street but also for self-care.

As a young Chinese American woman from an immigrant background, Tu started her career on Wall Street after graduating from the University of Chicago. In a male-dominated working environment, she often encountered and struggled with misogyny and cultural insensitivity. Looking back on her time there, Tu shared her challenges while navigating corporate America as a minority. She also recalls that her superior made racist and offensive remarks. ""The final straw for me was one day I came into the office with a cardigan on, and he looked at me, touched his hands together, bowed, and said, is that a kimono? From Asian woman to Asian woman, that was the moment that I felt like I needed to get out of here. I can't be here. There's nothing for me here. This man is never going to be in the back room demanding that I get a promotion or a raise. He's never going to advocate for me. It was so defeating because it was awful, and I could do nothing about it. This guy didn't like me for things about myself that I couldn't change. I deserve to go where I am going to be treated with dignity and respect."" Tu shared.

Leaving Wall Street behind, Tu found success in her digital media strategy sales role at BuzzFeed. Her performance and hard work were recognized and paid off. Tu explained, ""It was so different because I ate what I killed. And for me, sales was the ultimate meritocracy. If I could send 35 more emails than the guy sitting next to me, I would get paid better than he did.""

Tu started sharing financial tips on TikTok as a fun New Year's resolution in 2021. Her way of explaining financial concepts to Gen Z'ers in an easy-to-understand and relatable manner quickly gained popularity and millions of followers. Consequently, she quit her full-time job to concentrate on expanding her financial education community platform. ""I did not want to be 50 years old and look back on this moment and wonder what would have happened had I done this. I was only going to have the 15 minutes of internet fame to potentially try and make Your Rich BFF a full-time thing. I needed to strike while the iron was hot. And it ended up being the best decision of my life. It was just perfect timing. A little bit of hard work, elbow grease, but also a little bit of luck."" Tu shared. Since then, Your Rich BFF has become a resource for young professionals seeking finance tips.

Tu emphasizes the importance of making intelligent and holistic investments in finances and all areas of life, including self-care. Recently, Tu partnered with SkinCeuticals to celebrate the launch of the brand's new wrinkle-modulating peptide serum, P-TIOX. The campaign encourages people to see skincare as an essential investment, aligning with Tu's message of long-term planning and smart decision-making. The ""Protect Your SkinVestment"" campaign by SkinCeuticals is a collaborative effort that brings together skincare professionals, financial experts, and influencers like Megan Boni. The term 'Skinvestment' refers to the idea of investing in your skin's health, much like you would invest in your financial portfolio. Megan, known for her viral song ""Looking for a Man in Finance,"" has reemphasized the message of self-reliance. Joining this collaboration, Tu becomes part of a diverse group of ""Skinvestor Advisors,"" along with experts like Simran Kaur of Girls That Invest Media, dermatologists Dr. Daniel Sugai and Dr. Mamina Turegano. Together, they aim to empower consumers to make informed decisions about their skincare and financial futures. Tu sees parallels between financial literacy and skincare; both require long-term planning for the best results. ""At the end of the day, investing in your skincare is the same idea as investing in your portfolio for the long term. You want to make sure you are making smart decisions today so that it'll pay off for you in the future like a retirement account would,"" said Tu.

Your Rich BFF's top advice for someone starting out is to understand why they are spending and to consider if the purchases will bring long-term joy and lasting satisfaction. Learning from her own experience, Tu said, ""Do not spend money you do not have on things you don't need to impress people you don't even like."" Tu also encourages young women to talk to each other about money. ""Often, we have been taught as women that there's only room enough for one woman to succeed. Only one girl gets to be in a C-suite or get that promotion. That isn't true. We are going to get farther, be able to negotiate bigger raises, get more promotions, and have a bigger chunk of this pie."" Tu strongly believes that financial independence is a powerful motivator for personal advancement. Additionally, Tu advocates for women to actively support and uplift each other to dismantle the barrier of being the sole woman in the male-dominated room of success. ""If you want to go far, you want to go together."""
Katy Perry's First Single From Her Latest Album Makes A Triumphant Return,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2024/09/27/katy-perrys-first-single-from-her-latest-album-makes-a-triumphant-return/,2024-09-27T12:57:59Z,"Katy Perry's new album 143 is headed for a fair start on charts in most countries, and it will begin appearing on tallies beginning tomorrow (Friday, September 27). Ahead of the full-length becoming available, the singer dropped one last promotional single, ""I'm His He's Mine"" a week before the project arrived. As that track reaches a handful of rankings in the U.K., the first tune shared during this era mounts a comeback, as fans were reminded of the dance-pop cut.

""Woman's World"" reappears on a pair of charts in the United Kingdom this frame. The lead 143 single even manages to become a top 10 hit once more on one of them.

Perry is back inside the loftiest tier on the Official Physical Singles chart. ""Woman's World"" re-enters the list of the bestselling individual tunes on any physical medium in the country at No. 9.

""Woman's World"" nearly cracked the top 10 on both of the rankings it reaches this time around. Perry's single reappears on the Official Vinyl Singles chart at No. 14 this week.

In the past, ""Woman's World"" has come very, very close to bringing Perry back to the top spot on any music charts in the U.K. The single stalled at No. 2 on both of the rankings it sits on this period.

Between the two tallies, ""Woman's World"" has spent more time on the Official Physical Singles list. Perry's recent focus has now reached 10 weeks on that sales-only roster. It's managed just three on the vinyl-specific chart, at least so far.

""Woman's World"" served as the first single from 143. The song launched high on some charts, such as those that only focus on purchases, but it wasn't the comeback she was hoping for. Perry quickly moved on from the title, and has since pushed two more cuts from the album...but neither of them broke out in a major way, either.

""I'm His He's Mine"" is the third tune to come from the full-length -- before 143 dropped, that is. This week, that track opens at No. 46 on the Official Singles Downloads tally and one rung lower on the Official Singles Sales chart. It's the first tune from the project to fail to reach the main songs ranking in the U.K."

The 20 largest Chinese companies dually listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq tacked on $71 billion of market capitalization in the U.S., led by e-commerce giants Alibaba and Temu parent Pinduoduo.

It marks a shift as the Chinese government brings out the ""big guns"" to spur growth, hedge fund billionaire David Tepper told CNBC's Squawk Box.

Hurricane Helene made landfall southeast of Tallahassee as a Category 4 storm late Thursday, with maximum sustained wind speeds of 140 mph -- the most powerful storm to strike the Florida Big Bend region.

TOPLINE When a recall rocks the food industry as much as the deadly listeria outbreak linked to a Boar's Head factory in Jarratt, Virginia has, the CEO or owners typically get in front of the news and try to instill a sense of calm. But the families behind the 119-year-old deli meat purveyor have been oddly silent, underscoring how secretive Boar's Head has become.

A letter about the recall of more than 7 million pounds of ready-to-eat meat products posted on the company website -- ""This is a dark moment in our company's history but we intend to use this as an opportunity to enhance food safety programs not just for our company, but for the entire industry."" -- is signed simply from ""Boar's Head."" A lone company spokesperson has been cited in media reports, and the company refuses to even confirm who the current CEO or chairman is.

Now, in the aftermath of the deaths of at least 10 people and with nearly 60 hospitalized across some 19 states, according to the CDC, the company that took a century to become the biggest deli meat brand in America is facing an existential threat -- with multiple civil lawsuits, and talks of a congressional hearing as well as a Department of Justice investigation that could come with criminal charges.

But the warring families who founded Boar's Head seem more concerned about a series of petty legal battles over the billion-dollar brand.

""All of this was completely preventable,"" says lawyer Bill Marler, whose Seattle law firm, Marler Clark, specializes in claims for food recall victims and filed a lawsuit against Boar's Head on behalf of a survivor. ""They were better at growing listeria than they were at making food for human consumption.""

WHY IT MATTERS ""This is one of the deadliest recalls due to listeria in years -- and lawyers claim it was easily prevented,"" says Forbes staff writer Chloe Sorvino. ""The families of victims want to see Boar's Head held accountable.""

The Stars Of 'Gyeongsang Creature' Were Surprised By The 2nd Season,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanmacdonald/2024/09/27/the-stars-of-gyeongsang-creature-were-surprised-by-the-2nd-season/,2024-09-27T12:08:03Z,"Gyeongseong Creature is a story about monsters, the monsters who create them and the star-crossed lovers who must battle both. The first season of the series is set in 1945 during the occupation of Gyeongseong (Seoul) by the Imperial Japanese Army. The Japanese forces inflict brutal biological experiments on civilians, in some cases successfully turning them into monsters. The second season starts with a dramatic time shift, propelling the plot decades into the future. At a recent press conference for the second season, Park Seo-joon recalled his surprise that his character -- or someone like him -- now existed in 2024.

""It was set in the present day rather than the 1940s,"" said Park.

In the first season Park plays Jang Tae-san, the owner of the House of Golden Treasure, the best pawnshop in Gyeongseong. He's a man with connections. But as the second season starts he's suddenly Ho-jae, a man who exists in present-day Seoul. Is he a reincarnation? Immortal? The character has lost his memories and that may include his memories of the woman he loved, Yoon Chae-ok, played by Han So-hee. In season one Chae-ok was a woman who specialized in finding missing people, but now, because she's not quite human anymore, she must live in the shadows. She's very confused when she sees Ho-jae in present-day Seoul. He looks exactly like the man she loved but that's impossible.

Shifting his performance from the 1940s to 2024 took some adjustment for Park. After embodying a character in the 40s he had to think and act like a person, somehow potentially the same person, who's living in modern day Korea.

""I tried to have that gap between Jang Tae-sang and Ho-jae in the beginning,"" said Park. ""And I think the moments when he has flashbacks of his memory and when he finally got all his memory back were very important moments. So I used my imagination to fill the void, the moments that did not exist in the script. So it was quite challenging, but it was also liberating and fun as an actor to use that freedom to imagine what would've happened between all those times. And I think what was really important for me as an actor was to really nail the moment when he got his memories back. So I thought of things like, should I talk in a way that te talked in season one, or should I speak in a modern way?""

He ultimately decided to use a certain tone of speech with some characters and not others.

""I tried to be flexible with my way of speech and way of action, but it was quite difficult because there were a lot of gaps in the time zone and in the script. So I tried my best to make sure that I look like one character.""

In the second season, the city is no longer occupied by the Japanese Army, but the evil experiments continue at Jeonseung Biotech, where monsters roam the underground corridors. The monsters are terrifying on screen, but acting with the empty space they supposedly occupied was a challenge for the actors.

""Actually, I never got the hang of it,"" said Park with a smile. ""I would imagine that the creature would move in a way and kind of do whatever I could, but it kind of made me very shy. It was very challenging because I would be punching in the air. But when I'm focusing, I feel proud of myself for focusing without anything in front of me.""

Han admits she also never quite mastered acting with imaginary creatures. Not in either season, although viewers might never suspect as much since their action scenes are meticulously choreographed and executed. The very idea made her laugh, especially when she considered how one of the monsters was supposed to be related to her.

""I also never got the hang of it,"" she said. ""In season one, the creature was my mother. Director Chong told me that the creature was my mother. So when he told me that, lots of thoughts went through my head, but I tried to keep my focus and I was also proud of seeing myself being focused in the situation.""

The second season is a heart-pumping succession of such intricate action scenes in which Park and Han enthusiastically battle both monsters and thugs. There was a lot of wire work and CGI played a huge role in delivering the well-choreographed scenes. Park was pleased with how it all came together.

""They did a very impressive job,"" said Park. ""They created something from nothing, and while it was challenging, it was very joyful as well.""

Director Chung Dong-yoon found it much easier to film the second season.

""If I'm filming in an era of 2024, I'm actually living that era,"" said Chung. ""So it was, I guess, easier to approach modern day society. Of course, we had other concepts that we had to create from scratch, for example, the Kurokos. But in general, I think the modern day Seoul was much easier to create.""

For Han the most surprising part of season two as the finale.

""I think the finale was a big surprise to me,"" said Han. ""Because I thought it would not be the finale for this kind of genre, but that happened, so that was a big surprise for me.""

To find out what surprised Han in the finale, viewers will have to watch the second season. Gyeonseong Creature was written by Kang Eun-kyung, and directed by Chung and Roh Young-sub. The second season also stars Lee Mu-saeng as Captain Kuroko and Bae Hyun-sung as Seung-jo. Both seasons air on Netflix."

OB-GYNs decry the 'fearmongering' about Georgia's abortion laws: 'The lies are hurting women',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/ob-gyns-decry-fearmongering-about-georgias-abortion-laws-the-lies-hurting-women,2024-09-27T09:06:13Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Charlotte Lozier Institute Vice President and Director of Medical Affairs Dr. Ingrid Skop is calling out the ""fearmongering"" and ""lies"" of the media that are hurting women who don't understand new abortion laws.

A recent piece from ProPublica blamed the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, following chemically induced abortions in 2022, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits.

Since the story's publication, many members of the Democratic Party, including Vice President Kamala Harris, have been attacking Georgia's laws by suggesting they prevented the women in these cases from receiving lifesaving care.

Skop is one of multiple OB-GYNs Fox News spoke to who have criticized what they see as a misleading story being pushed by the media and Democrats.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

""I was not surprised to see this pro-abortion media try to point the blame at Georgia's pro-life laws, but, in fact, Georgia's laws allow doctors to intervene to save the life of the woman,"" Skop told Fox News Digital.

She continued, ""I think the focus of the Democratic Party upon abortion as an issue is only because the American people do not understand the laws. Many times, women are hurt by abortions. It is not necessary for women to live their best life. And, of course, it's the fearmongering and lies that have led us to this place where we are today, where people even think there would be a reason to point at the law.""

Skop emphasized that Georgia's abortion laws, as well as those of every other state, are ""very, very clear"" that an abortion can be done to save the life of the mother. Further, she said the laws do not apply to abortion procedures such as dilation and curettage (D&C) if the unborn baby is already dead, as was the case for Thurman.

""The law states again that a miscarriage is an exception. It also states that an ectopic pregnancy is an exception. So we should never be reading of women not getting miscarriage care or not getting ectopic pregnancies treated because they are clearly an exception in every pro-life state's laws,"" Skop said.

Skop said that it's the distortions of the laws that have done harm to women, not the laws themselves, leaving women like Miller unsure about seeking life-saving care and doctors unsure about giving it.

""The lies about pro-life laws are hurting women. The pro-life laws are not hurting women, but the lies are hurting women. Because in many cases, the women do not understand. And we've seen that sometimes even the doctors don't understand. They're not reading the law. They're listening to the pro-abortion media,"" Skop said.

Dr. Christina Francis, CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), made similar comments on ""Fox & Friends Saturday.""

""We are seeing the direct results of spreading lies and misinformation about these laws. Women are being harmed by that because they are delaying in seeking care. And so I think it's really important, no matter where somebody stands on the issue of abortion, we should all want women to have accurate information so that they seek care immediately if they're experiencing complications from things like these high-risk abortion drugs,"" Francis said.

ABC NEWS REBUKED BY PRO-LIFE GROUP, ASKED FOR CORRECTION OF ABORTION CLAIM BY DEBATE MODERATOR

In a statement to Fox News Digital, AAPLOG board member Dr. Susan Bane expressed outrage over Thurman's death and the media's lack of interest in properly informing doctors.

""If her care was delayed because of her physicians' understanding of the law, they were misinformed. This highlights the importance of giving medical professionals and the public accurate information about abortion drugs and abortion laws,"" Bane said.

ProPublica defended their story in a statement to Fox News Digital, saying, ""We stand by our reporting. The state's committee of more than 30 experts concluded that the deaths of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller were preventable, a newsworthy finding. Our ongoing reporting is illuminating the challenges doctors face in caring for patients with pregnancy complications in states with restricted access to abortion."""
A mysterious hum and a charismatic leader stoke chaos in Missy Mazzoli's opera,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/26/nx-s1-5120574/missy-mazzoli-listeners-opera-premiere,2024-09-27T09:05:23Z,"Missy Mazzoli and Royce Vavrek's opera The Listeners premiered Wednesday night in Philadelphia. Steven Pisano/Courtesy of Opera Philadelphia hide caption

In a pivotal early scene of The Listeners, two of the opera's main characters discover a desperate commonality. ""So it's not in my head?"" sings Kyle, a teenager plagued by a buzzing noise. His high school teacher, Claire, begins to cry as she reassures him: ""I thought I was the only one.""

The soprano Nicole Heaston, who portrays Claire, and the tenor Aaron Crouch, who plays Kyle, sang through the scene several times during a recent Opera Philadelphia rehearsal at the city's Academy of Music. Standing on a stage set evoking Claire's classroom, they repeatedly landed together on a cathartic refrain: ""You hear it, too. / You hear it, too. / You hear it, too.""

Missy Mazzoli, the heralded composer of The Listeners, and Royce Vavrek, its acclaimed librettist, watched the scene approvingly from off to one side, taking notes. The opera's director, Lileana Blain-Cruz, occasionally darted on set to deliver precise feedback. What they were all intent on calibrating was the mix of torment, commiseration and relief in that moment -- as two chronic sufferers of a mysterious affliction discover they aren't really alone.

""This whole story revolves around this crazy noise that only a certain percentage of the population can hear,"" explained Mazzoli during a break in rehearsals, sitting at one of the classroom desks on set next to Vavrek. ""And this was based on actual noises throughout the world; there's one in Taos, New Mexico, there's one near Detroit. These areas where people report hearing these mysterious sounds.""

The hum, as it's also commonly known in real life, provides the hinge on which this opera turns. Claire and Kyle find community in a local support group for those who hear the hum -- led by a guru named Howard, whose benevolent encouragements drape a thin veil over the controlling designs of a cult leader. Mazzoli and Vavrek developed the story with the Canadian playwright Jordan Tannahill, who also published it as a novel in 2021. (It's now in the process of being adapted into a BBC series.)

""In our initial conversations with Jordan, I said, 'I'm really interested in cults,'"" Mazzoli said, recalling a crop of Netflix documentaries on the subject. ""It's this consistently fascinating idea. I was also interested in the power of charismatic leaders in our society. There was a lot of discussion about that politically and elsewhere: the potential for the manipulation of vulnerable people by these charismatic leaders."" Nodding toward Vavrek, she added: ""And I think at the core of a lot of our work is this figure of a seemingly ordinary woman who finds herself in an impossible and extraordinary situation.""

Mazzoli and Vavrek, who live within a mile of each other in Brooklyn, are seasoned collaborators: their previous Opera Philadelphia premiere was Breaking the Waves, based on the Lars Von Trier film. (In 2017, it won the inaugural Best New Opera award from the Music Critics Association of North America.) Their next opus -- Lincoln in the Bardo, adapted from the George Saunders novel -- will have its world premiere during the 2026-27 season of The Metropolitan Opera.

The Listeners follows Claire as she leaves her husband and teenage daughter in search of healing at Howard's spacious compound. There she encounters not only communion but also new purpose among her fellow congregants, though it comes through a series of uneasy turns. ""The hum is cruel but kind,"" Heaston, as Claire, sings at one point in Act II. ""It has given me the heart of a leader.""

During a break in rehearsals, Blain-Cruz praised The Listeners as a model of suspense, not only for its plot mechanics but also because of a shifting moral center. ""That's what's so thrilling about Missy and Royce's work: they're not afraid to go into the darkest recesses of the mind and psychology,"" she said. ""There's a real fascination: What is our attraction to people who can wield this power? Why do we fall into traps that would seemingly be so obvious in hindsight? How do we get seduced by the mystery of those who know how to manipulate us?""

Those questions unfold within a world that looks and feels disquietingly a lot like our own. The Listeners is set in the present day, in a southwestern suburb abutting the desert. In rehearsals, after the aforementioned moment between Claire and Kyle, Blain-Cruz coached three young singers through a successive scene involving three gossiping teenage girls; among the props she handed out were iPhones, a joint and a vape pen. Later in the opera, Howard and Claire attempt to recruit new followers with a stream on Facebook Live, sounding a playful chord of recognition.

Vavrek, whose libretto has a strikingly conversational feel, replete with common vulgarities, considers relatability a part of his mission. ""A lot of people in the world don't necessarily think that opera can connect with them -- that it is this high art that's sort of lofty,"" he reflected during the break. ""And I really am excited about trying to find ways of storytelling that bring in new audiences and just inspire people to see opera as something that connects with them.""

That jolt of familiarity in The Listeners feels like a sleight of hand, coming as it does with true operatic grandeur. ""Musically, I'm attracted to opera because it illuminates our inner lives,"" Mazzoli said. ""So we might speak in everyday language, but our feelings are huge. Or they're small and far-ranging. What goes on in our minds and our imaginations is much more colorful and wild and weirder than what we present on the outside. And I think opera illuminates that for people, on the stage."""
"Words, sounds and the art of listening with Aja Monet",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/26/nx-s1-5119760/aja-monet-lara-downes,2024-09-27T09:05:20Z,"A few hours before we filmed this conversation, I got a call from Aja Monet's manager. Aja was running a bit late; her grandmother had passed away that morning. I immediately offered to reschedule, but Aja wanted to keep our appointment. When she arrived, a little frazzled and shaken, I invited her to sit and relax for a minute in the NPR green room.

My mom had died just four months earlier, and I was also deep in a vortex of fresh grief. And so we talked, quietly and a little haltingly, about loss, especially the untethering feeling of losing the women who brought us into the world and guided us through it -- the strong women who helped us and challenged us to develop our own strength.

I had recently come to a new understanding in my own grieving process. Something about our relationships with the dead -- the reshaping of things, the time travel that becomes possible, the unbreakable power of lineage that we can only experience with those who are no longer with us on this earth. I was in the process of finding a new way to be together with my mother, and understanding how much I am her.

Lineage and legacy, family and community are at the heart of Aja's work. In her 2015 poem What My Grandmother Meant To Say Was, she wrote: ""I am a woman ahead of her time. I shimmered in the scars. I live in the bloodline."" These lines honor the power of our inheritance, the love and courage that gets passed down to us, as well as the damage and pain. During this conversation, Aja and I were both feeling all of those at their fullest.

So when the cameras started to roll, they found us midstream, navigating the currents of memory and the flow of bloodline. We reflected together about the necessity of surrounding ourselves in community, made up of both the living and the dead, and of listening to the voices, past and present, that tell us the stories of our own lives."
AOC's 'red light' district overrun with prostitutes as locals call out MIA 'Squad' member,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/aocs-red-light-district-overrun-prostitutes-locals-call-out-mia-squad-member,2024-09-27T08:28:35Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

In ""Squad"" member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's district in New York City, those who are described as scantily dressed migrant prostitutes line blocks of a long commercial strip during all hours of the day and night, brazenly soliciting sex to passersby while their pimps strike fear into local business owners, one of whom told Fox News Digital he's been threatened for speaking out and is on the verge of closing his store.

The trash-filled streets of Roosevelt Avenue in Queens, which encompasses the migrant-heavy communities of Corona, Jackson Heights and Elmhurst, has become a veritable hotbed for one of the world's oldest professions, and residents say that most elected officials and police are turning a blind eye to the neighborhood nightmare, which looks more like the famed brothel-filled red-light district streets of Bangkok than one of America's biggest cities.

Illegal vendors also overrun the sidewalks, plying their hustle in what residents have likened to ""Third World"" conditions, cooking hot food out in the open devoid of any health certifications or inspections as hungry birds swoop down in search of leftovers and leaving their droppings along the way.

AOC DISTRICT NEIGHBORHOOD LABELED 'THIRD WORLD' AS MIGRANTS CLOG STREETS AND PROSTITUTES OVERRUN EVERY BLOCK

Known to locals as the ""Avenue of the Sweethearts,"" this epicenter of vice is not some desolate area on the outskirts of a city but rather the heart of the borough of Queens underneath the area's main subway track that serves as a vital cog connecting Manhattan and its local schools to families, many of whom stream down the subway steps and are then inescapably met by armies of prowling solicitors.

Fox News Digital even recorded a man pushing his young son in a stroller past a group of five sex workers.

Residents say that students pass prostitutes every day on their way to school or on their way to local taekwondo centers situated along the busy strip and that the situation has become the norm for their youthful eyes with the alleged sex workers, mostly composed of Asian and Hispanic women, filling the sidewalks.

On Sept. 18, the NYPD raided a brothel just off Roosevelt Avenue and arrested three people. The following evening, Fox News Digital was conducting an interview in front of the raided premises when an alleged sex worker and her reported john casually walked out of the same building.

On one block along Roosevelt Avenue, Fox News Digital cameras recorded a line of no less than 19 alleged sex workers on the sidewalk. Around the corner, there were at least seven more, and a woman on the next block was witnessed soliciting sex for $60.

Nearby, vendors sell everything from used clothes to pots and pans or tools. More recently, female vendors have begun cutting hair and painting nails under canopies on the cluttered sidewalks, with all of these illegal vendors operating feet from legitimate brick-and-mortar stores whose owners rage they are being undercut in prices while also having to pay taxes, unlike the illegal vendors.

Shoplifting and pick-pocketing is also widespread, business owners say, and there's a sense here that lawlessness is breeding more lawlessness.

NYPD SWEEPS VENDORS OVERRUNNING AOC'S DISTRICT -- BUT SELLERS SWARM THE STREETS AGAIN, SELLING GOODS

On Sept. 19, the day after the raid, Fox News Digital witnessed a man being arrested for allegedly groping a 17-year-old girl as she walked down the subway steps.

In police handcuffs, he denied the accusations to onlookers. The girl, who was being comforted by adults, looked visibly shaken.

Ramses Frías, a local resident turned activist, is furious with the deterioration of his neighborhood and says ""it feels like Bangkok with women outside locations and pulling men off the street.""

""This area has been run rampant with prostitution,"" he told Fox News Digital outside the raided brothel. ""It's just been out of control and the lawlessness continues to happen.""

""This doesn't feel like my home. I've been here my whole life, and this feels like I'm a tourist in a Third World country. This is not how this is supposed to look, this is not how it's supposed to feel,"" he insisted. ""This is a neighborhood and a community full of hardworking individuals, immigrants and second-generation Americans that worked really hard to be here and are facing all this evil and all these bad things. ... And it's just causing more issues daily and our quality of life just continues to drop.""

Seconds later, an alleged sex worker and her client emerged from the brothel.

A neighboring business owner then ushered Fox News Digital into his store, warning that ""pimps"" were watching via CCTV. The store owner did not want to be named but said he had reported the cathouse to police and had been threatened by those involved with the brothel.

""I'm so scared, this is my business,"" he said, adding that his business is suffering because customers are avoiding the area and will likely have to close because of it.

Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels and a Republican candidate for mayor, says prostitution has exploded in the neighborhood after the pimps and sex workers were driven out of the nearby area of Flushing, well known for its Asian population.

""It was never like this. It was a family area with a lot of retail,"" Sliwa told Fox News Digital of Roosevelt Avenue. ""The Chinese community pushed it out [of Flushing] and Asian cops were getting busted because they were on the take, so they just decided, the madams, bring the girls over here ... and its open prostitution, 24/7. [It's] lawless. Anarchy. You get to do what you want when you want.""

Two NYPD officers were busted in 2006 on bribery charges relating to the protection of a brothel in Flushing, and there are similar cases stretching back further.

Sliwa says the police and New York City Mayor Eric Adams are not doing enough to clamp down on the racket. In January, the NYPD raided six establishments allegedly engaged in prostitution, which were issued closing orders. The raid was well publicized, with Adams and local Democrat City Council member Francisco Moya present. However, it appears to have done little to curb the problem.

Sliwa slammed it as a ""show raid"" and said there were no arrests.

""They didn't arrest the johns, prostitutes, madams; they never went after the landlords, and they were back in business the next day,"" said Sliwa, who joined Fox News Digital and Frías on a walking tour of the area.

The Queens District Attorney's Office confirmed that no arrests were made, saying it was strictly carried out to serve court closure orders of nuisance abatement over which the NYPD has jurisdiction.

""This would never be tolerated in Manhattan. They tolerate it because it's ... a poor and impoverished area in the eyes of many New Yorkers, but that doesn't give you a reason to allow this to exist,"" Sliwa said. ""This is so unfair ... and the mayor is allowing a culture of corruption to exist. These police officers are on the take. It's the only way they could operate openly. They'll say, 'We deny that.' Well, that's what happened in Flushing and that's why they pushed it over here.""

Adams' office did not respond to a request for comment. The NYPD confirmed the three arrests after the Sept. 18 raid but did not respond to a request for further comment.

No police officers have been charged for being involved in prostitution in recent years. In 2018, seven NYPD officers -- three sergeants, two detectives and two officers -- were indicted in connection with an illegal prostitution and gambling ring in Brooklyn and Queens, which encompassed Roosevelt Avenue.

Separately, NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell told Fox News that it suspects members of the brutal Tren de Aragua are linked to prostitution in the area, trafficking women into the industry to pay off the debts the gang is owed for smuggling them into the country.

Meanwhile, the Queens District Attorney's Office says it is working hard to stamp out prostitution and crime in the area, noting the office has ""evicted 13 prostitution locations this year being used for illegal activity on or near Roosevelt Avenue."" The office says it's in the process of permanently shutting down the raided brothel.

Of Ocasio-Cortez, Frías said the socialist lawmaker has not been seen in the neighborhood since she took part in a rally there in August 2023, where she condemned a city crackdown on illegally operating vendors and called for the city to issue more permits to those vendors.

""She does not visit this area; this is actually an area where she campaigned the hardest and a lot of people went out [to vote] for her, and she doesn't come over here. She has totally neglected us,"" Frías said, noting that other local elected officials are rarely seen in the area, which is only represented by Democrats.

""So, we're totally neglected, we're here to fend for ourselves and this is what we have to do now. We're going to organize. We're going to have a rally coming up on Sept. 29, and we're going to let our voices be heard and make sure that the city understands that they need to come over here and do their job,"" he adds.

Ocasio-Cortez's office did not respond to repeated requests for comment on this story or on a March story in which Fox News Digital brought attention to the neighborhood's plight, featuring the additional publication of a now-viral video provided by Frías showing an almost endless stream of vendors with piles of clothes stacked along the streets.

Police swept the area days later and Frías - a former Democrat who is running for City Council as a Republican next year - said vendors have simply set up shop there again.

Rep. Grace Meng, whose district also encompasses Roosevelt Avenue, said in a one-line statement, ""Quality of life and safety issues need to always be addressed, and I remain in contact with the 110th precinct, Councilman Moya, our local community board and other local elected officials.""

'SHARK TANK'S' KEVIN O'LEARY SHREDS AOC OVER HER DISTRICT LOOKING LIKE A 'THIRD WORLD COUNTRY'

Frías also took aim at state Sen. Jessica Ramos, a Democrat who represents the area and is running for mayor. She has previously labeled prostitution on the strip as ""survival work"" and in 2019 co-sponsored a series of bills that would have decriminalized sex work and vacated the records of people arrested or charged with prostitution or related offenses.

Ramos told Fox News Digital she was happy to see the recent raid take place and pitted blame on the mayor for the unsavory situation, saying Adams' office has been sidetracked by scandals rather than addressing the concerns of the community.

""No one wants to see people selling sex, especially when they're being coerced by traffickers. It's unclear what took so long,"" Ramos said in a statement.

""The underground economy has spiraled out of control,"" she added, referencing the illegal vendors. ""Without work permits from the 'feds,' migrants need honest work to provide for themselves. The fact is the migrants are here, and they want to work.""

Meanwhile, Moya, who attended the January raid and has rallied alongside so-called ""clean streets"" advocates like Frías, said that his fellow Democrats are impeding efforts to shut down the brothels and illegal vendors.

""I've lived my entire life in this district, and I've never seen it this bad,"" Moya said of the prostitution. ""After COVID, the situation has worsened significantly. The influx of migrants plays a part in this issue, as many have no other means of survival. The federal government has turned a blind eye to the situation and there's only so much the city can do, since we don't have the authority to grant work permits or legal status to those in need.""

Moya said other elected officials have been calling up city agencies demanding that all enforcement stop.

""Some elected officials don't see this as a problem, suggesting that 'work is work' and we should let it be. I believe that if a state representative wants to legalize prostitution, it should be done with strict rules and regulations, in designated areas like the city of Amsterdam - not in our community, especially near schools where children pass by and witness these activities daily,"" he insisted.

""I'm doing everything in my power to mitigate this issue, as you can see many have been investigated and shutdown - but what I have been doing is being undermined by these leaders who don't recognize the urgent need for change. Yet, I assure you, I will not stop until significant change is made."""
Princess Diana's friend on devastating Prince Harry paternity rumors: 'It's not possible',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/princess-dianas-friend-devastating-prince-harry-paternity-rumors-not-possible,2024-09-27T08:07:35Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

There was a tabloid rumor that left Princess Diana heartbroken.

For years, some have speculated that her riding instructor, James Hewitt, was Prince Harry's biological father, not King Charles. Both Harry and Hewitt share ginger hair and freckles.

Richard Dalton, Diana's hairdresser, told Fox News Digital that ""it's not possible."" Dalton has a new memoir, ""It's All About the Hair,"" which details their friendship.

PRINCESS DIANA'S SURPRISE BILLY JOEL PERFORMANCE WAS EARLY SIGN OF DOOMED MARRIAGE: AUTHOR

""It was tough,"" Dalton admitted. ""Harry was already born a while before her relationship with Hewitt. And I don't think it's possible.""

""But no,"" he stressed. ""Harry and the Spencer family have red hair. Charles, Diana's brother, had bright red hair when he was [in] college. And I used to cut his hair then. [Diana's sister] Sarah, has bright red hair. [Diana's other sister] Jane was more or less the same coloring as Diana.""

He also shared in his book that Diana ""used to get very upset"" with the tabloids insisting that Hewitt was Harry's father.

""The red hair was a trait from the Spencer family,"" he wrote.

According to reports, Diana first met Hewitt in 1986, two years after Harry was born in 1984. In his book, Dalton wrote that Diana and Hewitt had ""a love affair"" that lasted three years from 1989 to 1991. He stressed that Harry was born ""long before Diana even met James Hewitt.""

When Diana started taking riding lessons from Hewitt, it confused Dalton, who thought to himself, ""Diana didn't like riding horses."" However, he understood that Diana was a young woman ""longing to be truly loved.""

""I knew nothing about their affair and was not involved with any of the rendezvous, other than maybe unwittingly doing Diana's hair each day,"" Dalton wrote. ""She was certainly giddy at times when she talked about him because it was all new to her; however, we need to remember the context in which this all took place.""

""Diana was starved of affection and intimacy from her husband, the man she loved,"" he wrote. ""She was also an heir-making machine for Charles and was coming to terms with the betrayal within her marriage.""

""... It saddened me to see James Hewitt, by virtue of his tell-all book, clearly signal that this relationship was a conquest and not a matter of love at all. He got her at her most vulnerable and, for her, he was just the first man who rolled along - a twist of fate, time and place. If it had not been him, it would have been someone else.""

""He was certainly not the love of her life at the time, Charles was - there is no question in this matter at all,"" Dalton added.

Renae Plant, curator of The Princess Diana Museum, teamed up with Dalton for his book. She told Fox News Digital, ""It must have been horrific for Diana to be faced with the ongoing rumors.""

""She [couldn't] come out there and say anything, but there's all these rumors going around,"" said Plant. ""... She was tormented [by] the press and the hounding of all these stories.""

Plant pointed out that Diana yearned to be like Dalton's friend, British broadcaster Anne Diamond. She had a public platform to address any news to the public.

""[Anne] did breakfast TV,"" Dalton told Fox News Digital. ""Diana used to say, 'Oh, I wish I could be like your friend when something detrimental is written about her. She can put it right on TV.' But that's not how it was.""

""She had to keep it all internalized and deal with it,"" Plant chimed.

In 2023, Harry sued the Daily Mirror for using unlawful techniques ""on an industrial scale"" to score front-page scoops on his life. The British royal became the first senior member to testify in more than a century.

During the trial, the Duke of Sussex admitted that the longtime tabloid rumor speculating that the king was not his biological father was ""damaging"" to him over the years. In a written statement, the 40-year-old cited the 2002 article ""Plot to Rob the DNA of Harry,"" which speculated that the royal was Hewitt's child.

""Numerous newspapers had reported a rumor that my biological father was James Hewitt, a man my mother had a relationship with after I was born,"" Harry wrote. ""At the time of this article and others similar to it, I wasn't actually aware that my mother hadn't met Major Hewitt until after I was born.""

Harry said the paternity rumor was perpetuated in several articles.

""At the time, when I was 18 years old and had lost my mother just six years earlier, stories such as this felt very damaging and very real to me,"" Harry admitted. ""They were hurtful, mean and cruel. I was always left questioning the motives behind the stories. Were the newspapers keen to put doubt into the minds of the public, so I might be ousted from the royal family?""

In late 2023, Harry won his phone hacking lawsuit against Mirror Group Newspapers. He was awarded over $180,000.

In his memoir, ""Spare,"" Harry described how his father, 75, once made ""sadistic"" jokes about the painful gossip. For Harry, it was no laughing matter.

""Pa liked telling stories, and this was one of the best in his repertoire,"" Harry wrote. ""He'd always end with a burst of philosophizing ... 'Who knows if I'm really the Prince of Wales? Who knows if I'm even your real father?'""

""He'd laugh and laugh, though it was a remarkably unfunny joke, given the rumor circulating just then that my actual father was one of Mummy's former lovers: Major James Hewitt,"" Harry shared. ""One cause of this rumor was Major Hewitt's flaming ginger hair, but another cause was sadism.""

PRINCESS DIANA 'RIPPED THE CORSET OUT' OF HER MET GALA DRESS, REFUSED TO WEAR PINK, DESIGNER CLAIMS

""[The press] couldn't get enough of this 'joke,' for some reason,"" Harry reflected. ""Maybe it made them feel better about their lives that a young prince's life was laughable.""

In 2002, Hewitt himself addressed the gossip.

""I have been aware for a while that the issue of Harry's paternity has been a major talking point,"" said Hewitt, as quoted by People magazine. ""There really is no possibility whatsoever that I am Harry's father. I can understand the interest, but Harry was already walking by the time my relationship with Diana began.""

""Admittedly, the red hair is similar to mine and people say we look alike,"" said Hewitt. ""Looking at the pictures I would say he is a much more handsome chap than I ever was.""

He addressed the speculation once more in 2017 during an appearance on an Australian TV show. When asked if he could be Harry's father, Hewitt stressed, ""No, I'm not.""

""It sells paper,"" said Hewitt about the rumor. ""It's worse for [Harry], probably, poor chap.""

KING CHARLES FELT 'UNBEARABLE EMPTINESS' AFTER PRINCESS DIANA'S DEATH

Dalton met Diana when she was just 17. He went on to style her hair for more than a decade. He hopes his book will introduce a new side to the late Princess of Wales - including her sense of humor.

""She would always keep fake vomit, and she'd put it into the private secretary's briefcase,"" he told Fox News Digital about their royal tour of Australia in 1985. ""And dog poop - all kinds of things.""

The pair even got away with being naughty behind palace doors. Dalton described how Charles banned all aerosol sprays from Kensington Palace to help preserve the environment.

The secret behind Diana's royal mane was Elnett hairspray.

""We traveled with it a lot,"" said Dalton. ""... I got to the palace and said to the princess, 'There's a hole in the ozone.' She said, 'Really? What does it look like?' I said, 'About the size of your dressing room. And it goes straight out - that's it, the Elnett hairspray.' We had a laugh about it.""

""We kept using it,"" he said. ""I suppose [Charles] probably didn't know anything about it... We escaped. I'm not in the Tower of London."""
"Ohio Air Force veteran, brother freed from Dubai jail with help from JD Vance: 'They weren't letting this go'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/ohio-air-force-veteran-brother-freed-dubai-jail-help-jd-vance-letting-go,2024-09-27T08:07:17Z,"Joseph Lopez, a U.S. Air Force veteran who was drugged and detained in Dubai along with his brother, tells 'Fox & Friends First' about his experience.

An Ohio Air Force veteran and his brother were finally released from a United Arab Emirates (UAE) jail with the help of GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance after spending months behind bars.

Joseph Lopez and his brother, Joshua, were freed from the Dubai jail on Tuesday, ending the four-month-long legal nightmare. Joseph joined ""Fox & Friends First"" to discuss his reaction to his long-awaited release.

AFTER BEING STRANDED FOR MONTHS DUE TO AN ALTERCATION, HOUSTON WOMAN LEAVES DUBAI

""Land of the free, home of the brave. It definitely feels great,"" Lopez told Carley Shimkus on Thursday. ""I'm a little bit still disassociated, to be honest with you... life doesn't totally feel real yet. I feel like I'm going to wake up from a dream... at any point in time, and I guess that's kind of where I'm at right now. It's going to take a little bit for me to process everything, honestly.""

The Lopez brothers were arrested in June during their trip to the UAE. The pair were leaving a nightclub on June 2 when an Uber driver offered to take them to an ""afterparty"" at a hotel in the area, according to Detained in Dubai.

But shortly after the party ended, the brothers were approached by someone who invited them to a yacht party. After insisting they didn't want to spend any more money, the man told them they would be his American guests.

They agreed to attend, but shortly after arriving at the boat, he said they were slapped with a more than $2,700 bill.

After they pushed back against the steep bill, Joseph said he was handed a drink and doesn't remember the rest of the night.

He woke up in the back of a police car with his brother the next morning. They were ultimately arrested and charged with assaulting an officer, resisting arrest, damaging a patrol vehicle and alcohol consumption, according to the New York Post.

Lopez insisted they were drugged and robbed.

""I think it happened to me because I was obviously I'm an American,"" Lopez said. ""When you're in a place like Dubai, they see Americans and people see money, and basically they tried to extort me, and it didn't go the way they wanted, and I got drugged... Obviously, there's a lot that I don't remember, but basically, I was given charges that I have no memory of whatsoever.""

""I took a breathalyzer. My breathalyzer showed 0.00 by the time it was taken,"" he continued. ""Now I have these charges I have no memory of, and these charges... some of them could potentially be 15 plus years... so it's like this is my entire life that I'm talking about here over something I have no memory of. And the people who drugged me, they were never searched for. They were never held accountable.""

Lopez said the conditions in the Dubai jail were brutal, explaining that the beds were ""infested with cockroaches"" and they weren't given necessities like toothbrushes and soap.

""Literally, they drained me of every penny I had, put me into debt, and then eventually they sentenced us to three months in prison,"" Lopez said. ""We went there and got in processed, and the place that we were in... there's a lot of people sleeping on the floor. The bed that I was given - I'm an American, so you have, like, passport power, so they put me in a bunk bed and the bunk beds are infested with cockroaches.""

""On top of that, there's no hygiene there,"" he continued. ""They don't give you a toothbrush. They give you a shirt. Pants. No, there's no soap, no body wash. You have to eat with your hands.""

Vance worked with the State Department to secure the pair's release, according to his spokesperson, Parker Magid.

""Sen. Vance's office has been in constant communication with the State Department, the Embassy of the United Arab Emirates in the United States and the constituents' family,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Sen. Vance is monitoring the as-yet-unresolved legal proceedings carefully.""

""JD Vance's office, the support of the world and... my communities on social media and my family, they weren't letting this go,"" Lopez said. ""The UAE knew for a fact that... what they were getting out of me, it just wasn't worth the trouble."""
Angel Reese 'lost for words' after Sky reportedly fire head coach Teresa Weatherspoon,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/angel-reese-lost-words-after-sky-reportedly-fire-head-coach-teresa-weatherspoon,2024-09-27T02:40:38Z,"Angel Reese committed a flagrant foul on Caitlin Clark in the Indiana Fever's victory against the Chicago Sky. Nick Wright reflects on the rivalry between Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese and why it's good for the sport.

The Chicago Sky reportedly fired head coach Teresa Weatherspoon less than a year after the franchise hired her, and it's shaken star rookie Angel Reese to the core.

After news broke of Weatherspoon being relieved of her duties, Reese took to X to express how ""heartbroken"" she was that her coach will no longer be in the building.

""I'm literally lost for words knowing what this woman meant to me in such a pivotal point in my life,' Weatherspoon said. ""She was the only person that believed in me. The one that trusted me. Many don't even know what it's like to be a black women [sic] in sports when nobody believes in you. You had a tough job. All the crazy circumstances that we went through this year & when your back was against the wall, you always believed. I came to Chicago because of YOU. You were an unsung hero in my life.""

Reese continued by discussing the deep relationship she developed with Weatherspoon despite only working with her for a season.

""We built a relationship in a short amount of time that will last forever. I'll never question God why he brings people in my life and takes them away from me in the capacity that I need them but i've always believed everyone is in your life for a reason and a season,"" Reese said. ""You were the best reason & season. You didn't deserve this but I can't thank you enough. I love you Tspoon.""

While Reese quickly entered stardom in the WNBA with the Sky, averaging 13.6 points and 13.1 total rebounds per game, the Sky went 13-27 and failed to make the playoffs for the first time in five years.

The Chicago Sun-Times reported Weatherspoon's dismissal late Thursday night.

So, despite winning a WNBA title in 2021, the Sky will now be searching for its fourth head coach since then.

Weatherspoon was someone Sky players were publicly praising during the season, including Reese. But, according to the Chicago Sun Times, there was ""disconnect"" during exit interviews, and the team decided to go in a different direction.

Weatherspoon starred in the WNBA herself from 1997-2004, playing all but one of her eight seasons with the New York Liberty. She won Defensive Player of the Year back-to-back seasons to start off her career, while making five straight All-Star Games from 1999-2003."
Alabama executes inmate who killed 3 in separate workplace shootings by nitrogen gas,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/alabama-executes-inmate-who-killed-3-separate-workplace-shootings-nitrogen-gas,2024-09-27T01:23:25Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here.

An Alabama man convicted of killing three people in separate workplace shootings was put to death Thursday using nitrogen gas, the second time the method has been used in the country.

Alan Eugene Miller, 59, was pronounced dead at 6:38 p.m. local time at a south Alabama prison. He shook and trembled on the gurney for about two minutes with his body at times pulling against the restraints. What followed was about six minutes of periodic gasping breaths.

""I didn't do anything to be in here,"" Miller said in his final words.

Miller was convicted of killing three men -- Lee Holdbrooks, Christopher Scott Yancy and Terry Jarvis, who he believed were gossiping about him.

MISSOURI, TEXAS EXECUTE 2 INMTES OVER KILLINGS OF WOMAN, INFANT AS MORE EXPECTED IN OTHER STATES

The state tried to execute him by lethal injection in 2022. Miller chose to die from nitrogen gas.

Miller was a delivery truck driver for Ferguson Enterprises when he killed the three men on Aug. 5, 1999, in the Birmingham suburb of Pelham.

He walked into the company and fatally shot Holdbrooks, 32, and Yancy, 28, before driving 5 miles away to Post Airgas, where he had previously worked, and killing Jarvis, 39.

""You've been spreading rumors about me,"" Miller said before opening fire, according to a witness.

""Tonight, justice was finally served for these three victims through the execution method elected by the inmate, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said in a statement. ""His acts were not that of insanity, but pure evil. Three families were forever changed by his heinous crimes, and I pray that they can find comfort all these years later.""

SOUTH CAROLINA INMATE DIES BY LETHAL INJECTION, ENDING STATE'S 13-YEAR PAUSE ON EXECUTIONS

A jury convicted Miller after only 20 minutes of deliberation.

Efforts to execute him in 2022 were called after officials were unable to find a vein to connect an IV to him. Miller had initially challenged the nitrogen gas protocol but dropped his lawsuit after reaching an undisclosed settlement with the state.

The method involves placing a respirator gas mask over the inmate's face to replace breathable air with pure nitrogen gas, causing death by lack of oxygen.

Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma have also adopted the use of nitrogen gas for executions, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.

Alabama used the method for the first, and then-only, time earlier this year to execute Kenneth Smith. At the time, United Nations experts condemned Smith's execution, saying it ""amounted to torture or other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment."""

The trans ""baby-faced"" killer convicted of stabbing to death a New York City antiques dealer was sentenced Thursday to 22 years-to-life in prison, months after receiving jail time for a separate, gruesome killing in Oklahoma in which the victim was decapitated.

Alex Ray Scott, 28, who began transitioning into a woman in jail, was previously found guilty of the January 2020 killing of Kenneth Savinski, 64, in his Upper East Side apartment with a decorative plate and kitchen knife.

""Alex Ray Scott will serve a significant prison term for the brutal and senseless murder of Kenneth Savinski - a beloved, friendly person and respected churchgoer,"" said Manhattan District Attorney Bragg. ""Mr. Savinski's loss not only devastated his friends and family but shocked his tightknit community. Although we cannot bring Mr. Savinski back, I hope the resolution of this case offers his loved ones a sense of justice in their ongoing grief.""

NEW IDAHO JUDGE IN BRYAN KOHBERGER TRIAL NO STRANGER TO BRUTAL MURDER CASES

Scott, who was also sentenced in Oklahoma to 45 years in prison for a separate dismemberment killing of a man with a chainsaw, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and multiple counts of criminal possession in Savinski's death.

Scott and Savinski met on a dating app and were sharing a night out together on Jan. 27, 2020 when they went to Savinski's apartment, the New York Post reported.

Savinski was found with wounds on the head and neck, including a broken hyoid bone, a slit throat and large, deep lacerations across his face and forehead. He was found covered in blood and pronounced dead at the scene, prosecutors said.

After the killing, Scott stole credit cards from Savinski and said he didn't remember the attack, according to an indictment, the Post reported.

Scott later walked into a New York police precinct and admitted to killing someone in an unrelated case. He was found with credit cards belonging to Robin Skocdopole, prompting investigators to check Skocdopole's home in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma when he was unable to be reached.

Authorities found his home empty of all its possessions and pools of blood inside. Skocdopole's remains were eventually found in May 2020 on the edge of a creek in Broken Arrow, federal prosecutors said.

He was last seen in August 2019. Scott was renting a room from Skocdopole and told everyone that the landlord had abruptly moved to Dallas for work, in an effort to explain the disappearance.

Jessica Zweig's New Book Empowers Entrepreneurs To Activate Their Light After Burnout,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/yolarobert1/2024/09/26/jessica-zweigs-new-book-empowers-entrepreneurs-to-activate-their-light-after-burnout/,2024-09-26T22:41:27Z,"Jessica Zweig's new book, The Light Work, explores finding your light after burnout without compromising your boundaries. Zweig, opens up about her personal entrepreneurial story starting with her first business, a popular digital magazine for women, that failed to scale, leaving her in massive credit card debt. After taking up a corporate job for four years, which was a golden handcuff, she tried entrepreneurship again. This time it was a success hitting seven figures in revenue in less than 18 months. Growing SimplyBe Agency to a multi-seven-figure business in the five short years following, and to her own astonishment, became a best-selling author, a #1 ranking podcast host, a sought-after speaker, and an award-winning CEO.

Despite all of her success, she became burnt out and was hit with severe depression amongst other health issues. She no longer found joy or motivation in being a CEO and had to learn how to detach herself from the business while still continuing to scale it. Through her own spiritual journey, she experienced a metamorphosis allowing her to find her light and purpose. Zweig eventually scaled SimplyBe to $10 million in revenue and sold it to Hawke Media. The Light Work, which hit number 18 USA Today's National Bestselling List, takes readers through her path from burnout to burning bright again. She teaches them how they, too, can activate their light, especially after burnout.

One of the bigger topics around entrepreneurship Zweig shares in the book is recognizing that women need to tap into their innate strengths rather than trying to operate like men, ""First, it's essential to recognize that we live in a world designed by men for men. The constant pressure to crush, succeed, compete, and win is a paradigm that doesn't necessarily reflect how things should be. We are too focused on profits and growth, always expecting an upward trajectory, but that's not how reality works. I've come to realize that our businesses, much like nature, experience cycles of growth, decline, and renewal. Embracing this understanding has relieved a lot of pressure for me as an entrepreneur. I believe that it's essential for every entrepreneur, especially women, to recognize and accept the inevitable challenges,"" she shared.

""Leading with feminine values in the workplace, such as caring, empathy, and compassion, and creating a safe and supportive environment for our teams is what makes women such exceptional leaders. At the same time, We should acknowledge that masculine traits are not inherently bad. Being a strong woman in business means knowing our value, negotiating, advocating, and thinking strategically. These qualities make us exceptional and well-rounded leaders. Lastly, given the prevalence of burnout among women, it's crucial to establish boundaries and operate with a queen-like mentality. Just as a queen protects herself and takes care of her own needs, we must prioritize self-care and set non-negotiable boundaries to serve both ourselves and others effectively.""

As far as her advice for founders looking to scale and ultimately sell their business without burning out, Zweig emphasizes the need to turn the business into an asset and automate it as much as possible. ""You need to turn your business into an asset. Many women initially start businesses based on their passion and as lifestyle businesses. However, you can't sell your business if it's just a lifestyle business. You must turn it into an asset that can operate effectively without you. This means implementing systems, operations, and processes that would allow someone else to run the business if you were unable to."" Zweig implemented an integrator that could provide a vision and manage the business from day-to-day processes, systems, and people while also utilizing project management tools and creating SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) for everything.

""One of my mentors once said there's a difference between a business owner and a shopkeeper. A shopkeeper has to be there daily to turn the lights on, unlock the door, service the clients, and shut it down at the end of the day. On the other hand, a business owner can fly to Fiji for a month, and their business will still be running. That's because at the end of the day, you're not for sale; your business is for sale."" And if you're intrinsically dependent and the business depends on you, you can't sell it. The second thing is you have to be in the mindset, mentally and emotionally ready to let go and unattach yourself from it being your baby, from your life, and from your staff being your family. You have to cut that energetic cord and be ready to let it go. Because the day you sell your business, it's no longer yours and you no longer have control. It's a big experience that people need to prepare themselves for,"" she added.

Maintaining joy is another lesson Zweig shares with her readers. Learning how to prioritize joy regardless of your stress or external circumstances, ""I prioritize joy. I schedule it on my calendar. I make time for play, creative activities, walks, and moments of slowness, and I give them the same level of importance as my executive meetings. They are all equally important to me and take priority. I can't deprioritize them, and I hold myself accountable for that.

Now, Zweig is teaching entrepreneurial women to activate their light through a 12-week feminine leadership business training and certification and her ""Claim Your Light"" business retreats packed with brand building, marketing, leadership and scaling workshops on top of interactive spiritual experiences. As we enter a new era of entrepreneurship, Zweig helps founders shape the purpose and mission, ""We need to remember why we're doing it. It's to make a difference, positively impact, and become the best person we can be. Leadership is like personal development on steroids, as I often say. Nothing will stretch you like being an entrepreneur. Embracing the personal development side is key. In this new era, we're building businesses not just for our own wealth, but for the good of the world. You've missed the point if you're only serving yourself and thinking about how much money you can make. That's the old paradigm, and that's the toxic masculine, patriarchal paradigm. We have to think about donating, tithing percentages of our profits to causes we care about, giving our teams bonuses, and giving back to our community. Not everything has to be a transaction. Everything is meant to be reciprocal and to circulate your wealth so that we're making an impact, where everyone can thrive, not just you surviving in your new business.""

So how can founders activate their light? Zweig believes it's crucial to focus on doing inner work. This involves spending time with yourself, connecting with your soul, engaging in deep work, seeking guidance from a therapist or healer, reading books, listening to podcasts, and dedicating time to self-discovery are all important. ""Our purpose is to evolve internally while we are here on earth. It's essential to recognize that growth isn't just external; it's also internal, which is the main theme of my book.""

And if there's one thing Zweig wants readers to take away from her new book, it would be to not be afraid of hard work or the dark. ""What we fear, such as failure, rejection, overwhelm, and burnout, are things to embrace as they are where we find our power. The woman reading my book is responsible for doing this work on herself. When you heal yourself, you start to heal the world. Each reader of this book is critical to the healing and evolution of humanity. Recognize how important you are and that you are here on an assignment, not just to build a business, but to activate the light within you and take responsibility for your own life. Stop playing the victim and empower yourself as the co-creator of your own reality. This is what I want people to take away."""
Georgia vs. Alabama: Kalen DeBoer's opportunity to put his stamp on the program,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/georgia-vs-alabama-kalen-deboers-opportunity-put-his-stamp-program,2024-09-26T21:21:40Z,"When Alabama hired Kalen DeBoer to succeed Nick Saban, the program found itself a new serial winner.

That's because DeBoer has won at every level -- from leading his alma mater, the University of Sioux Falls, to three NAIA national championships, to taking Fresno State to a bowl game, to, most recently, winning the Pac-12 and going to the national championship game with Washington.

Now, he faces the first true pressure-packed moment of his tenure in Tuscaloosa when No. 4 Alabama opens SEC play against No. 2 Georgia on Saturday (7:30 p.m. ET).

In case you haven't heard, it's the first time since 2007 that the Crimson Tide are an underdog at home.

""Welcome to the SEC, right?"" DeBoer said this week.

Jokes aside, this game will serve as an early measuring stick for Alabama. What is the state of the program with DeBoer in charge? The Tide enjoyed 17 seasons with Saban at the helm, in which they won nine SEC championships and six national titles. When Saban retired, one of the more astounding stats was the fact that he had 44 first-round NFL Draft picks to just 29 games lost.

It's unfortunate that DeBoer's SEC debut has to come against this particular opponent. Georgia has been the best program in the nation, winning two of the last three national titles. In the past, this showdown always pitted Saban vs. his protégé, Kirby Smart. Two top-tier programs with the most talented recruiting classes and most suffocating defenses comparing themselves to one another. Saban ended his career with a 5-1 record against his former defensive coordinator and won the final matchup in last year's SEC championship game.

While the pregame storylines aren't quite as heated, Saturday still marks a massive moment in the DeBoer era. The coach understands that, but doesn't project stress like his predecessor used to do before these kinds of games.

""This is a new team, this is a new season,"" DeBoer said. ""That's why I always make sure we're emphasizing that this is the 2024 Alabama Crimson Tide football team. But there's certainly learning moments that you have when you've been through the experiences.""

DeBoer said his team will rely heavily on veterans like quarterback Jalen Milroe and defensive back Malachi Moore this week. When Saban retired, those were two players that decided to stay instead of transfer, like many of their former teammates did. They've played against Georgia and know what to expect.

""You try to give them a chance to spread what they've learned to the rest of the team and understand it's going to be a four-quarter game,"" DeBoer said. ""Understand that there's going to be ebbs and flows in the game, that the physicality isn't just going to be here and there, it's every single play. So you've got to be on your A-game the entire game, start to finish.""

DeBoer has talked about embracing the opportunity and carrying on the legacy Saban built. He hears people say that it's not easy to follow a legend, but uses words like ""evolve"" and ""grow"" and feels empowered to put his stamp on the program. He understands the magnitude of the game and is aware that former president Donald Trump could be in attendance. It's why he uprooted his life in the Pacific Northwest to come to Tuscaloosa.

""We came here - all of us different journeys, players, staff - to be a part of something like this,"" DeBoer said.

Both teams enter the weekend dominant and undefeated. Alabama, led by Milroe, has the nation's No. 5-ranked scoring offense and is putting up 49 points per game. Georgia has the No. 2-ranked scoring defense and hasn't allowed a touchdown in three games. Both teams were idle last week and have previously injured players back at full strength just in time for Saturday.

Regardless of the outcome, the Tide and Dawgs could still find their way to the SEC championship and the College Football Playoff. Their respective schedules will look favorable to the selection committee when the time comes. So, while the stakes are high, a loss wouldn't be catastrophic.

However, getting the program's first major win since Saban retired, especially against Georgia, would be huge for DeBoer, and everybody knows it.

""We feel like we have a football team that is a top-tier team that every day is going to compete to get better,"" DeBoer said. ""That's not just this week, that's not just next week, that's all season long. We really feel like the sky's the limit.""

We'll find out how true that is on Saturday.

Kareem Hunt on return to Chiefs: 'I'm excited to shock the world',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/kareem-hunt-return-to-chiefs-im-excited-shock-world,2024-09-26T21:20:53Z,"Signed to the practice squad last week in the wake of Chiefs starting running back Isiah Pacheco going on injured reserve due to a lower leg injury, Hunt has been elevated to the 53-man roster and is pumped to prove himself.

""I believe I'm very capable of that still [playing at a high level],"" Hunt said on Wednesday, according to NFL.com. ""I'm excited to go help shock the world and show them I've still got it.""

Hunt spent the previous five seasons with the Cleveland Browns (2019-23). Last season, he rushed for 411 yards and nine touchdowns on 3.0 yards per carry.

Kansas City selected Hunt in the third round of the 2017 NFL Draft out of Toledo, and he hit the ground running in emphatic fashion. In his rookie season (2017), Hunt rushed for an NFL-high 1,327 yards and eight touchdowns on 4.9 yards per carry, while also registering 53 receptions for 455 yards and three scores and earning a Pro Bowl nod.

In November 2018 (in the middle of his second NFL season), a video became public of Hunt assaulting a woman, who was accused of calling him a racial slur before the incident. Kansas City cut Hunt shortly after the video was released, with the franchise saying that the running back wasn't truthful about the situation with them."
"Over 90,000 people in Lebanon had to flee Israel's bombardments this week",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/26/nx-s1-5127325/israel-hezbollah-conflict-lebanon-displaced-residents,2024-09-26T21:08:38Z,"BEIRUT -- Around the concrete courtyard of Ahliah School in the center of Lebanon's capital, families perch on plastic chairs, sharing news of what houses they've heard have been destroyed in their villages near the southern border with Israel.

Many arrived Tuesday, fleeing south Lebanon amid what Lebanese authorities have called the largest displacement of its citizens in decades. More than 90,000 people fled their homes in intense Israeli attacks that killed almost 600 people in just two days this week, according to the United Nations' humanitarian coordination office.

The attacks that Israeli said were aimed at Hezbollah fighters and installations were an intensification of nearly a year of Israel and the militant Lebanese group trading rocket, missile and drone strikes across the Israeli-Lebanese border since the start of the Gaza war last October.

Many Lebanese fleeing the south took refuge with relatives in Beirut and other places, or searched for apartments to rent. But according to the U.N., about 40,000 of them sought shelter in more than 200 schools, which the Lebanese government asked to accommodate displaced people.

Outside the metal gates of the century-old Ahliah School cars full of exhausted-looking passengers pulled up on Tuesday. An aid official waved them on to other schools serving as temporary shelters. With more than 600 arriving in 24 hours, there was no room left.

It was supposed to be the first day of classes at the K-12 private school. Instead, Ahliah had to clear out desks, piling them up in the hallways, and make room for families to move in.

Children's laundry hung from some of the classroom windows to dry. But most of the families arrived with nothing at all -- only the clothes they were wearing.

One couple sat scrolling through social media videos to try to see whether their home was still standing. For security reasons, they asked to be identified as Um Ali and Abu Ali, which means their son Ali's mother and father, respectively.

Um Ali says she was told that 18 houses in the neighborhood in a southern Lebanese village had been destroyed.

Their 12-year-old daughter was so traumatized by the airstrikes and their escape that she has barely spoken, Um Ali says.

""The airstrikes were right next to our cars and the children were screaming and crying,"" she says. With her husband's arm bandaged and in a cast after being hit by shrapnel a month ago from an Israeli airstrike, the mother bundled 10 family members into a car and drove south on Monday.

She says as they drove away there was blood ""all over the street. You'd see a child lying in front of you bleeding and you can't do anything to help.""

There were so many people fleeing south Lebanon on Monday, Lebanese soldiers turned the divided highway into a single route north. A 50-mile drive which normally would have taken an hour stretched in seven or eight hours, as panicked families crammed into any vehicle they could find.

Um Ali says in addition to not talking, her daughter has been unable to sleep and her heart races. Standing behind her mother, the girl says she's OK, but then buries her face in her mother's shoulder and starts to cry.

Her father says it is understandable that fighters would suffer in a war. But the effect on children is a different matter.

""Suddenly someone comes and makes your kids live in a state of fear, blood and destruction,"" says her mother. ""Nobody accepts living like that -- to be humiliated and see their lives torn apart.""

""Would Americans accept that for their children?"" the father, Abu Ali, asks.

It was too soon for the sense of loss that follows displacement to kick in. Abu Ali, a construction worker, and his wife refer to life in their border village in the present tense.

""We have a normal life,"" he says. ""My wife is at home, my kids are in school, and we have a nice house in the south with fresh air.""

""I grow everything and raise a few sheep,"" adds Um Ali, her face for a moment radiant with the memory of life in the countryside. ""We live a happy and beautiful life.""

The Israeli military says it is targeting Iran-backed Hezbollah, designated by the U.S. and other countries as a terrorist group, and its weapons and rocket launchers in southern Lebanon and the Bekaa region to the northeast. Israel has hit targets north of Beirut and in Beirut's southern suburbs as well. The strikes have also killed and injured civilians, including hundreds of children.

Hezbollah began attacks last October to support Hamas in its fight against Israel in Gaza. Despite intense efforts by the United States and France to broker a cease-fire between Lebanon and Israel, Hezbollah has made clear that it will stop only when the fighting in Gaza stops.

The militant group is still reeling from unprecedented attacks recently, including explosions of thousands of its pagers and walkie-talkies last week that killed dozens of people, including children, and injured more than 3,500 others, according to Lebanese health officials. Israel is widely believed to be responsible for having detonated the devices, but the Israeli government has not confirmed any involvement.

Behind the school, a few boys kick around a blue ball on a concrete soccer field. In the courtyard, two sisters from the border town of Nabitieh sit on a low wall. The younger is 18 -- her nails recently manicured in a bright purple. Her sister, 20, has long dark hair that is carefully styled.

The younger one struggles to describe how terrifying it was experiencing the airstrikes and then scrambling to flee.

""It was so scary -- not a little, a lot,"" she says, adding they slept in their clothes when the strikes began during the night to be able to flee early the next morning.

""Every night the planes would pass by to scare us,"" says her older sister. ""There were sonic booms and strikes that were very close.""

Neither wants their name used out of fear for their security.

On the long terrifying drive to Beirut they say they recited the shahada -- the Muslim prayer before death -- over and over in case their car was hit.

By the time they reached the southern suburbs late on Monday, where they had planned to stay, Israeli aircraft were launching strikes there too, forcing them to seek shelter in the city center. Israel has repeatedly hit the mostly Shia suburb of Dahiya, targeting Hezbollah commanders but also killing civilians in the densely populated area.

The streets of the capital are packed with displaced families. And for those who can afford it, so are the hotels. At the reception desk of one, a man asked for five rooms -- but only for a night until the family figure out their options.

Outside another downtown hotel, the cafe tables are full of families with plastic bags of snacks.

""We have been trying to find an apartment but everyone now wants so much money, or six months in advance,"" says a woman, sitting with her sister at one table. Like most displaced people, they did not want to be identified because they said they were afraid they could be targeted by Israel.

The woman, a supermarket cashier, says she left so quickly she did not even have her identification with her.

""The missiles were falling like rain,"" she says. She and her sister have lived through three wars with Israel.

But this one, she insists, has already been the worst."
"Opinion | American women don't need a ""protector""  --  especially not one like Trump",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-speech-protect-women-gaslighting-101-rcna172883,2024-09-26T21:05:05Z,"Activists rally during a protest against Donald Trump for his 'treatment of women' in front of Trump Tower in 2016 in New York.Drew Angerer / Getty Images file

Donald Trump is a well-documented liar. From crowd sizes and the outcome of the 2020 presidential election to the estimated 30,573 false or misleading claims the former president told while in office, trying to convince the American public that he has a plan to help them is Trump's political bread and butter.

His falsehoods have been dangerous, inciting riots, bomb threats and foiled kidnapping plots. Others have felt more like performance art, like Trump's comments about the alleged increase in the number of toilet flushes or assertion that windmills cause cancer.

Yet somehow, none of those lies and absurd statements have been as outlandish as Trump's latest attempt to gaslight American women.

On Monday, at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, Trump spoke directly to them, claiming that if elected president he will be their ""protector:""

The man accused of sexual misconduct by at least 26 women and found liable for sexual abuse in a court of law went on to claim that if he is elected president, women ""will no longer have anxiety from all the problems our country has today."" (Trump has denied all such claims of sexual misconduct.)

""You will be protected, and I will be your protector,"" he reiterated. ""Women will be happy, healthy, confident and free. You will no longer be thinking about abortion -- that's all they talk about, abortion -- because we have done something nobody else could have done.""

This pronounced if perhaps ill-advised attempt to appeal to women is intentional. A recent 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll suggests female voters are the reason Vice President Kamala Harris holds a slight 3-point lead over Trump nationwide.

""I always thought that women liked me,"" Trump told the Pennsylvania crowd. ""I never thought I had a problem, but the fake news keeps saying women don't like me. I don't believe it."" (The lady doth protest too much, methinks.)

Another New York Times/Siena College poll conducted in August found that a growing number of voters in swing states consider abortion to be their key voting issue in November. Since June 2022, when Roe was overturned, abortion has been on the ballot in seven states -- and people have voted to protect abortion access every single time.

Of course, as is often the case, Trump's recent comments were also rooted in some truth. For example, Trump claimed that ""women are less healthy"" than they were four years ago. And in a post-Roe world, that is in some ways true. An estimated 25 million women live in a state without access to abortion care, thanks to our would-be ""protector,"" leaving women to bleed out in hospital parking lots, slip into comas due to preventable infections, and in the cases of Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, die, all as a direct result of their states' near-total abortion bans.

Trump claimed that women are ""more stressed and depressed and unhappy, and are less optimistic and confident about their future than they were four years ago."" There is also some truth there. While Trump was busy pontificating on the effectiveness of injecting disinfectant to ""clean the lungs"" during the onset of the pandemic, women were experiencing an increase in depression, anxiety and burnout as they tried to work from home while facilitating virtual learning for their children.

Over 170,000 of us have endured the stress of traveling out-of-state for abortion care. An estimated 5.6 million of us are living in a county with limited or no access to prenatal care. Many of us are choosing to travel significant distances so we can safely give birth in a state that will not force a physician to deny us a life-saving abortion if we experience a devastating pregnancy complication, trying to navigate a world where we have less reproductive rights than our mothers.

So yes, many women are scared and tired and worried about their futures -- at least in part because of Donald Trump, his party and their wildly unpopular policies. And while Trump is seemingly hellbent on trying to cast a spell over women voters, conjuring up lie after lie about how his policies will somehow make us healthier, safer and more free, he is not as powerful as the women past generations of sexist patriarchs burned at the stake.

It's not surprising that a man who chose the president of the He-Man Woman-Haters club as a running mate would cling to the misogynistic belief that women are innately helpless. It's not a shock that instead of listening to women voters when they say, in overwhelming numbers, that they want access to abortion care, Trump continues to misdiagnose both the symptoms and the cure to our post-Roe health crises.

What is shocking is that in spite of all of this, some women -- predominantly white women -- will continue to believe they need a ""protector"" to save them. What they really need is the freedom to protect and save themselves."

""This election presents a stark choice that is not easy for any of us. The Republican Party of Dwight D. Eisenhower, Bob Dole, Frank Carlson, Jan Meyers, and generations of Kansas leaders does not exist within the current Republican Party,"" the former officials wrote.

""But, it requires Republicans speaking out and putting country over party when those values are at stake.""

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: THE EDGE IS CLEAR ON THIS KEY ISSUE

They added that the race between Harris and former President Trump presented a ""stark choice"" - but not an easy one.

""No candidate is perfect, and we do not pretend that we subscribe to all the policy positions taken either by the national parties or any individual candidates,"" they wrote.

""However, we fervently believe that we must do our part to try to build a brighter future, which is why we will be voting for Kamala Harris and [Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz] in this election. We believe they most closely align with the aspirations of Kansans and reflect our rich history of working together 'to the stars through difficulty.'""

HARRIS AND TRUMP DEADLOCKED IN PENNSYLVANIA AS FORMER PRESIDENT TRAILS IN OTHER 'BLUE WALL' STATES: POLL

Kassebaum, who now goes by Nancy Kassebaum Baker, served in the U.S. Senate from December 1978 through January 1997.

She was the first woman elected to represent Kansas in the chamber, and her career included a stint as chair of the Senate Labor Committee.

Tacha was nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit by former President Ronald Reagan in 1985 and served as chief judge from 2001 until 2008.

Praeger served as the Kansas Insurance Commissioner from 2003 until 2015.

Harris' campaign has made a point of courting Republicans in a bid to widen her appeal and cast Trump as an extreme and polarizing choice.

A majority of Republicans, particularly those still in elected office, do support Trump.

The vice president has scored support from several notable GOP figures, however - former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., ex-Vice President Dick Cheney, and former Trump administration aides Stephanie Grisham and Olivia Troye have all publicly come out for Harris.

EARLY VOTING BEGINS IN ILLINOIS, NORTH DAKOTA, FLORIDA AND MICHIGAN

Troye is one of several people who headlined a ""Republicans for Harris"" event on Thursday, alongside former Reps. Barbara Comstock, R-Va., and Denver Riggleman, R-Va.

A new Marist College poll found Harris and Trump neck-and-neck in three critical states.

The two candidates are tied at 49% among likely voters in North Carolina, while Trump slightly edges Harris in Georgia and Arizona with 50% to 49% in both states.

Asked for comment on the Kansas Republicans' endorsement, the Harris campaign sent Fox News Digital a broader statement on the ""Republicans for Harris"" initiative.

""The Vice President is bringing together voters from across the political spectrum by running a campaign about freedom, democracy, and opportunity,"" said Austin Weatherford, National Republican Outreach Director.

""Our Republicans for Harris program is taking that unifying, inspiring message to anti-Trump Republicans, moderates, and independents. While we're seeing a surge in support, we aren't taking anyone for granted.""

The Trump campaign said of the Harris endorsement, ""Nobody knows who these people are, and nobody cares."""

Cartier-owner Richemont shares traded up more than 8% while LVMH shares rocketed 10% to $678.50 on Thursday, recovering from a September slump that sent the stock as low as $591.90 per share. LVMH chief Bernard Arnault's estimated net worth spiked a whopping 9.4% to $192.7 billion, bringing his net worth closer to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg ($196.1 billion), who is directly ahead of Arnault in Forbes' billionaire rankings as the fourth-wealthiest person in the world.

34.7%. That is the share of L'Oreal stock owned by Meyers and her family as of December 2023, according to the company.

Walton began her brief run as the world's richest woman about three weeks ago, when she was ranked as the 18th-richest person in the world. Walmart stock is up more than 50% this year, while L'Oreal shares have slid about 9% in the same period. The stimulus package that contributed to L'Oreal's strong day of trading and Meyers' rise in net worth includes a potential $142 billion injection for state banks that aims to help China's struggling real estate industry and cash-strapped local governments."

Police say woman with 2 children arrested at Disneyland after not paying for tickets is a repeat offender,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/police-saywoman-2-children-arrested-disneyland-paying-tickets-repeat-offender,2024-09-26T19:45:40Z,"A woman accompanied by two young children was arrested at Disneyland in Anaheim, California after she failed to show park officials a valid ID. (Tiktok/ @diz.tok)

A California woman who was arrested during a visit to Disneyland previously attempted to enter the park with her children without paying for admission at least four times in a two-month period, police said.

Video footage posted circulating on social media shows Jessenia Diaz, 26, being led away from the California Adventure theme park in handcuffs Tuesday as her two young children were seen crying and pleading for help from bystanders.

Two other officers were seen following behind, one pushing a stroller.

CALIFORNIA LOCALS CONCERNED ABOUT NEW DISNEY DEVELOPMENT: 'CHAOS' IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

Diaz, who was wearing Minnie Mouse ears, allegedly screamed profanities at Anaheim police officers when she refused to provide her identification, authorities said.

""She came in on a valid pass and brought her two kids,"" Anaheim police Sgt. Matt Sutter told Fox News Digital. ""When security tried to question her about her kids' age, she just kept walking and didn't stop. They caught up with her later inside the park.""

Disneyland grants free admission to children under the age of 3 when accompanied by a paying adult. Valid theme park admission and reservation for the same park on the same date are required for guests who are age 3 and older, according to the Disneyland website.

Diaz, a resident of the Los Angeles suburb of Torrance, tried to enter the park without paying for tickets, something she had done before, Disneyland officials told Fox News Digital. When confronted by park security and police, she became uncooperative, they said.

She was ""uncooperative to say the least,"" said Sutter.

""What Disney will do, they'll work with you. They'll try to come up with a solution,"" he added. ""They want their guests to stay in the park and enjoy their day. But she wasn't having any of that.""

""If she had cooperated, had behaved better, she would have never gotten arrested,"" he added.

During the arrest, Diaz appeared to shout, ""You're f***ing hurting me"" as onlookers near the Jumpin' Jellyfish ride in Paradise Gardens watched the scene unfold.

She has entered the park four times in the past two months without paying the full admission, Sutter said.

Creating Real Los Angelenos For The Netflix Series 'Nobody Wants This',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelelspethgross/2024/09/26/creating-real-los-angelenos-for-the-netflix-series-nobody-wants-this/,2024-09-26T19:42:08Z,"The costumes Negar Ali designed for 'Nobody Wants This,' a new Netflix series set in LA, were thoughtfully curated to make the show's characters fit seamlessly into life in Southern California.

At the end of spring the Jacaranda trees in the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles explode into bloom. For a month or so, clouds of purple blossoms float low in the June sky. There are more than 30,000 of these trees in Los Angeles. They are an institution, just like the thin eucalyptus forests that rise with the roads twisting through the canyons, or the cantilevered hillside homes, ubiquitous in SoCal ever since Buck Stahl hired Pierre Koenig to build a house.

I was talking about all of this with costume designer Negar Ali. She met with me to discuss her latest project, designing wardrobes for the characters in Netflix's new romantic comedy series Nobody Wants This. ""We wanted to make sure it felt authentic to LA,"" Ali explained to me. Institutions, I learned, were an important consideration on the production end of the show. Instead of creating characters to inhabit a world built, Ali and her team made fictional characters who could be seamlessly inserted into the real world. ""We made sure to include local LA designers,"" Ali told me, ""it helped us to be specific to the place.""

Without giving anything away, Nobody Wants This is a romantic comedy about the very beginning of an interfaith relationship. Set in southern California's San Fernando Valley, the story revolves around Joanne (Kristen Bell, flawless) and Noah (Adam Brody, adorable). Soon, Joanne's sister Morgan (Justine Lupe, lovely; you will remember her from Succession) and Noah's brother Sasha (Timothy Simons, brilliant; Veep), become friends. Soon, things begin happening and characters develop. Created and written by Erin Foster, the story was loosely inspired by her own experiences dating a Jewish man and later converting her own religion and marrying him. Though Joanne's and Foster's lives diverge basically from the start, it is clear from the opening scene that the subject is personal.

When we meet Joanne and Morgan, we learn that they co-host and produce an up-and-coming podcast about life as a single lady in LA, which is finally beginning to get some traction, interest from a corporate entity is growing. ""Even in that very first podcast scene,"" Ali told me, ""Joanne is wearing a pair of Jesse Kamm army-green pants, she's an LA designer. The gray sweatsuit when Joanne is trying to help the dog, it's from a brand called Hey Gang. There's a scene where Morgan's on the phone with Joanne and she has a Casa Vega t-shirt on."" Using as many Los Angeles designers as she could, Ali built wardrobes for a wide range of characters from the devoutly religious to the cheekily self-proclaimed shiksas. They all feel like real people. Audiences will know that any of the characters they see on screen would obviously have these exact clothes in their closets at home.

""Joanne for us was a really exciting character to design,"" Ali told me. ""She's a multifaceted woman. She lives out loud, she's fearless and very conscious of the way that she presents herself to the world. We knew that we could have a lot of fun with her."" Because the character is so interested in fashion, this show offered an unusual opportunity.

""In costume design,"" Ali explained, ""we don't usually approach projects thinking about trends in fashion. But in this case, Joanne and Morgan are fashion girls, and that was really exciting for me to think about."" Joanne cares about how she looks, she enjoys clothing and feeling good in an outfit she really likes. She likes drawing attention, but she is not flashy or loud. She wears beautiful pieces. And if she feels vulnerable, Joanne will choose an outfit that she loves and wear it like armor. ""Things that typically wouldn't make sense,"" Ali told me, ""Joanne pulls them off because she has this inherent sense of who she is and how she wants to present the world.""

Our leading lady likes layers of woven chains. Every piece feels personal, probably because of how purposefully Ali approaches the task of flushing out her character's wardrobes. ""Everything has been designed in the frame,"" she told me. ""Nothing is by accident, everything is intentional."" If you watch the jewelry, you'll see Joanne wearing her favorite pieces over and over, of course styled to go with whatever else she is wearing. One is a necklace with a charm of the initial 'J,' made by LA jewelry designer Adina Reyter. ""We wanted Joanne to have this personal stack of jewelry,"" Ali explained, ""All the women I know, have jewelry that they like to wear every single day. They have this thing that feels really personal to them. It's collected. We wanted Joanne to have pieces that she wore throughout the whole season.""

Noah, her love interest, Adam Brody, personifies the Cute Rabbi archetype throughout the season. Sweaters over button down shirts, shawl collars, lightweight blazers; its a look Ali worked with Brody to achieve. ""Adam had a lot of input with his character, he saw Noah as a historian. [Brody] has this natural elegance, and his character is someone very much revered in his community."" Conscious that she was designing a religious figure, Ali worked with a rabbi from the Wilshire Boulevard Temple. ""We were so careful in making sure that we got all the nuanced things right,"" Ali told me. The rabbi was available to us for any questions. And he was incredible, so generous with his time. We really wanted to make sure that what we were depicting was authentic.""

This story often highlights the differences in perception that exist between two parties in possession of very different world views. ""We decided,"" Ali told me, ""right in the research phase, that Joanne was going to be in these poppy, bright colors, pinks and reds and yellows. Noah and the Roklov family would be in these beautiful jewel tones to delineate between these two worlds."" At its heart, Nobody Wants This is a misnomer, because when the two worlds collide, the palettes accentuate the best parts of each other. In the first episode, Joanne impulsively decides to walk into a Shabbat (Sabbath) service. She's in an all red outfit, a cropped cardigan and matching pants.

""I spent a lot of time thinking about that particular costume, Ali told me. ""In that scene, she's meant to be a fish out of water, we wanted her to pop. [Joanne is] the 'other' in that moment. Very intentionally, we muted the background costumes so that she would be the only one really in this bright color so he can not only notice her in the congregation, also have it be moment where [Noah's mother, the incredible Tovah Feldshuh] Bina sees her and Joanne is this lady in red. It's this moment, I think it was scripted.""

Morgan and Sasha, who the latter labels ""the loser siblings,"" develop a friendship of their own as the relationship between our main characters grows. For many of the other characters in this series, clothing and accessories have meaning. The connection that is possible between a person and their closet, it can be a wonderful thing. When you love clothes, sometimes you stay home instead of going out, just to play dress-up in your own closet. It's easy to imagine Morgan and Joanne doing that together, they probably have done so a hundred times. All these little details build and together, the story does feel authentic.

Morgan is the taller sibling, as is her counterpart Sasha, Rabbi Noah's brother. Loup was pregnant during some of the filming. I seriously did not know this until I asked Ali about the boxy garments. Which I will make a point of saying, looked gorgeous on Loups long, lean frame. As I have argued here many times before, what the characters are wearing matters. This is a great example of how good clothing and excellent costume design helps all of us suspend that disbelief.

Though I'd rather borrow from a different closet for myself, in many ways, what Sasha Roklov wore was my favorite wardrobe on screen. ""We have to talk about Sasha,"" Ali said, ""Sasha was so much fun. [Simons] is such a comedic talent."" As his family's loser sibling, Sasha is used to being overshadowed by his brother who always manages to do everything the way he was supposed to. Sasha would like to be taken seriously. ""There's a casualness that permeates menswear in LA, where men wear very expensive hoodies and very expensive sneakers."" The Roklov family is well-off, they wear beautiful clothing, but Sasha? ""He's very much influenced by streetwear. We thought that that fit his character.""

There is a dark red color, Roklov Red, Ali named it, which arcs a line connecting the members of this family. Sasha has a sweatsuit in this color, his parents wear it, later in the series his daughter Miriam has a dress made in the same tone. That story is too good to explain, it's more fun to watch as it unfolds on screen. The clothing in this series does exactly what we want costumes to do; they bring characters to life, helping us to see them as real people.

""It might not be something we outright said,"" Ali told me, ""but clothing is such a perfect vessel for communication. We're all asking questions of ourselves. With Joanne, I think that we see that conflict in her choices, one of them being her wardrobe choices. She makes the decision that is right for her, and then she swings wide."""
"Fashion Jewelry Brand Emma Pills Channels A Joyful, Youthful Spirit",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinetell/2024/09/26/fashion-jewelry-brand-emma-pills-channels-a-joyful-youthful-spirit/,2024-09-26T17:58:57Z,"Caroline Tell is a New York-based travel and lifestyle writer.

At 23 years old, Emma Pillemer has already made her mark on the jewelry world. The designer launched fashion jewelry collection, Emma Pills in 2020, where her colorful, irreverent styles garnered the attention of Australian retailers online. Her rise continued at Australian Fashion Week, where in 2021, Pillemer became the youngest designer to showcase her work. By 2022, Emma Pills expanded globally with a second warehouse in California and coveted retail spots at Revolve and Anthropologie.

Pillemer's creative journey began as a young dancer, where she beaded tutus for competitions across Australia before going on to star in Made In Bondi -- a spinoff of Made In Chelsea -- where her jewelry played a key role. Today, her pieces reflect that same vibrant energy - one of color, whimsy and joy. A devoted ""Swiftie"" and passionate philanthropist, Pillemer donates 50 percent of proceeds from her Candy OG earrings to The Breast Cancer Research Foundation, honoring a cause close to her heart.

We sat down with Pillemer to explore the inspiration behind Emma Pills and the next phase of her journey.

What inspired you to create Emma Pills and how did the brand begin?

I come from a family of self-empowered strong women, who have always loved jewelry, styling and creating, but price and color developments was definitely one of the main reason why I created the brand. I found myself struggling to find designs I loved.

I love expressing my individuality and style through jewelry. Color delivers a women's sense of individuality and confidence in their everyday lives and I struggled to find these kind of designs so designed my first pair of earrings- the OGs in different colors and after they sold out decided to follow my dream and focus on designing.

How would you describe the core aesthetic of Emma Pills?

Emma Pills has a unique aesthetic driven by my passion about fashion. I enjoy designing and creating pieces. I love vintage fashion and jewelry, so I definitely draw inspiration from that. Jewelry Its definitely the ultimate fashion accessory for every woman.

Vibrant colors are embedded in Emma Pills aethetics and DNA. Over the years, I have also evolved and developed a love for minimalism but have combined my love of color with creating minimal pieces with a vibrant feel. Every piece in the collection exudes confidence, which I feel is really what the aesthetics of the brand is - confidence in every piece. As I always say ""Wear Emma Pills for increased confidence.""

Can you describe your design process? How do you translate inspiration into a tangible piece of jewelry?

This again is something I love and evolve through time. What doesn't change is the way I see design and where I draw my inspiration from. I will always start with an idea, a piece, a shape and I will then add color or texture. I will then sit down with the team after I have a set base collection on paper with colors, shapes and ideas as well as names. I think names for my designs are so important and help tell the stories. We will then sit and start sampling and building collections. These ideas often spiral into something bigger or sometimes just leads me to more design development.

Are there any particular materials or techniques that you feel define your brand?

Definitely the use of color, enamels, combining different metals and colour finishes. We use recycled metals to create new designs. These elements define Emma Pills.

Do you have a personal favorite piece or collection, and if so, what makes it special to you?

It's so hard to choose. I feel like my creations are like my children. My first design will always be sentimental to me. The OGS are an easy, stackable earring to wear and available in lots of colors. They became a bestseller on Revolve. I love nothing better than spotting someone wearing my pills. Today in New York, I saw a gorgeous lady wearing the Square AF Capri earrings. It's a woven finish on a square stud inspired by beach chairs in Capri. She looked so good, so today they are my favorites.

Have you noticed any cultural shifts that are influencing the way people are thinking about or wearing jewelry today?

I think in an overly saturated market, people want to stand out with something to style that pulls an outfit together. The Sunkissed Necklace (a textured shell on a chunky chain) pulls any beach-to-bar look together. My Red Hot Hearts earrings or necklace give a pop of red to any outfit which is so empowering.

What's next for Emma Pills? Are there any upcoming collections or collaborations on the horizon?

I want to do more, design more, bring out exciting innovative pieces. I don't want what's already out there. I'm all about creating fun, confident designs and I honestly think that's what Emma Pills is all about. We don't want basic jewelry. It's all about exciting jewelry.

I recently designed the Pearls n Pills Collection for my sister's wedding. It is a very beautiful, bold pearl and crystal design with recycled shiny silver.

How do you see the brand evolving in the next five years?

It's been over three years since the launch of the brand and I feel the brand is evolving everyday. It has always been about layering, stacking and loving bold jewelry. I think my plan for the next five years is to bring jewelry that's innovative to people who have the same love of jewelry and fashion as we do. That means new markets, more pop-ups, more collaborations and a design evolution. The next five years are filled with goals. I'm confident we are on our way to achieve them."

The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit Tuesday accusing Visa of illegally monopolizing the debit card market. For more than a decade, the department alleges, Visa has abused its dominant position in the debit card market to force businesses to use Visa's network instead of competitors', and to stop new alternatives from entering the market. According to the new complaint against Visa, more than 60% of debit transactions in the country take place on Visa's debit network. Visa, in turn, is able to charge more than $7 billion in processing fees on those transactions, the department says. To keep that control, Visa imposes exclusivity agreements that penalize vendors and banks who want to run transactions through different systems, effectively insulating the company from competition.

That's up more than 11% year over year. Shoppers are now seeing buy now, pay later everywhere, especially online. Around three-quarters of this spending happens on a mobile device. It's also used more when peoples' wallets are strained. [Marketplace]

Canceling Subscriptions Will Be a 'One-Click' Snap in California Under New Law

A growing number of products and services are being sold by online subscription, offering more convenience and customization but also a new set of problems for consumers. Companies have been accused of signing people up for subscriptions without their consent, renewing their subscriptions without notice, and imposing a gantlet of obstacles to anyone seeking to unsubscribe. Californians will soon be getting more protection against these sorts of abuses, however, including the right to unsubscribe with one click of the mouse. On Tuesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law Assembly Bill 2863, which imposes a series of safeguards. [Los Angeles Times]

Mastercard Enters 'New Frontier' in Sensory Marketing: A Haptic Logo

From sonic branding to perfumes and restaurants in New York and São Paulo, Mastercard has leveraged almost every sense to engage and assure customers. Now, it's turning to touch. The brand is debuting a haptic logo, a distinctive series of vibrations that customers will ""feel"" via their phone when shopping online or using a payment terminal. The Mastercard chief marketing officer said the haptic logo is designed to increase trust, security, and satisfaction among shoppers. It is meant to reinforce the brand in that uncertain moment when a transaction is pending at checkout. [Adweek]

What Would A JPMorgan Apple Card Takeover Mean for The Banking-Fintech World?

JPMorgan Chase is reportedly in advanced negotiations to acquire the Apple Card credit card program from Goldman Sachs, a potential move that could reshape key dynamics in the banking sector, particularly for corporate treasury departments eyeing partnerships and operational efficiencies in an increasingly digital financial ecosystem. The deal highlights how partnerships between large financial institutions and tech giants are not only shaping consumer finance but are also impacting back-office processes and the operational models of large financial organizations. JPMorgan's potential acquisition of the Apple Card portfolio would further entrench the bank as a dominant player in the digital payments ecosystem, a space corporate treasurers increasingly rely on to optimize their cash management strategies and improve liquidity solutions.

Moms Nationwide Are Leaving Gift Cards in Diaper Boxes. Here's Why.

Moms across the country are anonymously buying gift cards or leaving cash in baby items at Target and Walmart stores because Denaesha Gonzalez saw a misplaced purse. The Nashville mom was with her 2-year-old son in her local Target this month when she noticed a familiar sight: a silver clutch handbag that retails for $20 misplaced on the shelf of the baby aisle. To the 28-year-old, this meant something deeper: A mom with a young child sacrificed something she wanted to buy something for her baby. She posted a 17-second video with the text: SHE DESERVED THE PURSE with the sound of a woman exhaling, in the hopes that maybe it would resonate with other mothers. Her video has since gone viral with more than 20 million views. It also has inspired people to hide money in diaper boxes and formula containers to allow a mom who is struggling to buy something for herself. [The Washington Post]

"Overwhelming Majority Of American Catholics Want Church To Change Stance On Birth Control, New Poll Says",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/09/26/overwhelming-majority-of-american-catholics-want-church-to-change-stance-on-birth-control-new-poll-says/,2024-09-26T15:38:29Z,"An overwhelming majority of American Catholics think it's time for the church to change its longstanding ban on birth control, a new Pew Research Center poll showed Thursday, along with a slew of other changes related to marriage and sexuality.

The Roman Catholic Church officially banned all artificial forms of birth control, including condoms, in 1930. At the time, the church preached that any devices tampering with the ""male seed"" was akin to murder. In 1951, Pope Pius XII approved the rhythm method -- or tracking a woman's ovulation using her menstrual cycle -- for couples who had ""morally valid reasons for avoiding procreation."" Since then, the church has had to make exceptions and establish specific rules as available contraceptives and reproductive technologies have progressed. In 1957, the church allowed women with irregular cycles take the pill to regulate them and better enable them to practice the rhythm method but still does not allow the use of the pill solely for birth control. In 1968, the church solidified its ban on all artificial contraceptives -- with the exception of the birth control pill for medical, non contraceptive reasons -- and its stance has largely been unchanged since. The Catholic doctrine preaches that life begins at conception and the church is opposed to abortion, but does allow for ""morally neutral medical procedures designed to save a pregnant woman's life that may have an unintended side-effect of causing a child to die in the womb, such as the removal of a cancerous uterus.""

Church attendance has declined among most U.S. religious groups, a Gallup study found in March, but Catholics showed the largest drop among any religion -- falling from 45% attendance from 2000 to 2003 to 33% between 2021 and 2023. Only two religious groups included in Gallup's research did not see a decline in attendance among Americans between 2000 and 2023: Muslims and Jews. Church attendance actually rose 7% in that time period among Jewish people and 4% among Muslims."
Who Will Replace Hoda Kotb At 'Today?' Here Are Five Possibilities.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonifitzgerald/2024/09/26/who-will-replace-hoda-kotb-at-today-here-are-five-possibilities/,2024-09-26T15:23:33Z,"After six years as co-anchor of Today, NBC's signature morning program, Hoda Kotb is stepping down to focus on her family. She announced the decision Thursday morning, and instantly social media erupted with speculation over who would replace her.

Kotb and Guthrie were the show's first all-female anchor team. Kotb got her start at NBC as a correspondent with Dateline, transitioning to co-hosting the final hour of Today with Katie Lee Gifford, injecting the program with heart and humor.

Finding the right replacement for Kotb, who said she wanted to be home with the two young girls she adopted in recent years, is critical to NBC. Today has been on top of rival Good Morning America on ABC among the key demographic of adults 25-54, and the network doesn't want to lose that lucrative spot.

NBC News has not commented on who could replace Kotb, the daughter of Egyptian immigrants. Here are five possible choices.

Hager seems like the obvious choice. She already hosts the final hour of Today with Kotb, with whom she shares an easy chemistry. Young women love Hager's relatability as a young mother, and she's a popular social media presence. She lacks hard news chops that are often necessary on morning shows -- Kotb had a rare ability to toggle between chugging wine with Gifford and discussing the economy -- but Savannah Guthrie is very strong on hard news, so it may not be an issue.

Jarrett checks all the boxes. Whip-smart and already a member of the Saturday Today crew, Jarrett is NBC's senior legal correspondent as well. She would bring gravitas to the co-host slot, and she and Guthrie would offer a formidable hard news presence. Her frequent posts about her adorable children on Instagram also make her relatable to Today's viewers. The Harvard Law School graduate, who covered Donald Trump's hush money trial earlier this year, got her start at CNN.

Like Hager, Geist is already a member of the Today team, hosting the Sunday edition. He also co-anchors MSNBC's Morning Joe and appears as the fill-in news anchor on weekday Today. He has an easy chemistry with the crew already. But NBC may want to preserve the female-female partnership that pushed it ahead of GMA in the ratings. And Geist's Morning Joe ties could make him too ""political"" (regardless of whether that's true) in a divided time when morning hosts need to appeal to all stripes.

Daly seems a less-likely choice, but he is already a part of Today, and the network has shown in the past that it likes to promote from within for this role. As a former MTV personality, Daly has the pop culture knowledge and contacts that are important to a morning news show. But like Hager, he hasn't shown particular prowess with hard news, and that will likely impact the network's decision.

Jones co-hosts the third hour of Today, and she has become an audience favorite. They love getting updates on her three children, and Jones' down-to-earth approach to balance work-life has earned her a strong social media following. The Philly native is known as a hard worker and has been with Today for 10 years. If she or Jarrett were selected, they would be Today's first Black woman co-host."
Modernizing The Livelihoods Of Female Footwear Artisans In India,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/annefield/2024/09/26/modernizing-the-livelihoods-of-female-footwear-artisans-in-india/,2024-09-26T14:35:54Z,"While the city of Agra in India is probably best known as the home of the Taj Mahal, it's also a major manufacturing hub for footwear. But almost all those jobs are held by men. That's despite the centuries-old tradition of artisanal footwear production done by women, who work on their own from home, as well as men.

That's the situation Arkit Kumar, Hifza Afaq, and Gagan Nukhi pondered about five years ago. Kumar had worked as an ecommerce consultant in the footwear industry and Nukhi had footwear manufacturing experience. Surely, they figured, they could find a way to modernize the livelihoods of these artisans -- especially the women -- allowing them to continue their craft while making more income. With that in mind, they formed Shoegaro (aka Kaarigar Mandi) in 2019 to sell the goods via ecommerce. ""We want to end a cycle of poverty that lasts from generation to generation,"" says Kumar, who is CEO. (Afaq is CTO and Nukhi is COO). Three years later, they pivoted big-time and revamped their strategy.

Under the traditional system, women artisans typically produced embroidery or weaving, skills learned from their mothers and handed down from one generation to the next. Their husbands supplied the necessary materials from their place of work and then, when the tasks were done, they took the finished goods back again. The women didn't get paid directly; their husband received compensation for their wife's work.

In 2019, Kumar and his cofounders formed Shoegaro to sell artisan-made footwear online and create a bigger and more efficient market for those goods. To that end, they cultivated relationships with the husbands of female artisans, building a level of trust to the point where they could start working with those women directly and introduce new basic equipment. Specifically, they lent the artisans basic hand tools, like electric handheld air dryers and electric heat chambers.

Then the pandemic hit. After two waves of shutdowns in one year, the company had to completely shut down. The result: It lost its SEO ranking, while also accumulating a large amount of inventory. The cofounders realized they had to develop a drastically different strategy if they were going to survive.

With that in mind, in 2022, they revamped the company's business model. Instead of selling directly to customers, they would sell in bulk to established footwear brands. During discussions with a large Indian footwear company, however, they received an eye-opening lesson: While the brand appreciated the craftsmanship of the artisans working with Kaarigar Mandi, it wouldn't buy from the company because its footwear products didn't meet the standard, uniform production requirements expected by international buyers.

The co-founders regrouped again. The answer, the decided, was to introduce new quality control systems and upgrade their training programs to ensure that artisans could practice their craft while producing standardized products with, for example, consistent sizing, efficient quality checks, and other practices. The company opened up a center, where women could learn additional, higher-paying skills in the shoemaking process, such as cutting the upper patterns and stitching.

In addition, they provided the artisans with small mechanized equipment, such as electric compressor-equipped pressing machines, electric sewing machines, and electric buffing and polishing machines. And they started paying the women directly.

They also helped artisans borrow financing to fund the purchase of equipment. (Today, 30% of the artisans purchase the tools and machines and 70% borrow them and return the equipment after the work is done). ""This shift allowed us to offer bulk buyers, like major footwear brands, a reliable, scalable solution while continuing to uplift the artisans through access to more advanced tools, machinery, and training,"" says Kumar.

Kumar also aims to provide artisans with entrepreneurial opportunities. One particularly enterprising woman, for example, turned the new system into her own micro-enterprise. After receiving training, she started working with 12 women whom she trained.

Male artisans work in an assembly line of sorts of 12 to 15 people, usually led by a senior artisan who gets the orders and works directly with Kaarigar Mandi.

The cofounders recently participated in an accelerator run by the Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship. According to Executive Director Brigit Helms, its accelerators typically focus on companies with about $50,000 to $2 million in revenue that face ""the valley of death"" -- a stage of development where companies typically have trouble finding financing.

Now, the company works with more than 600 artisans, 30% of whom are women, and the daily wage has increased by an average of 98%, according to Kumar. The goal: to increase that percentage to 50% over the next four years and to 90% by 2035. It also works with two of the largest five footwear brands in India, according to Kumar, and has 30 customers in total."
Suspect arrested in California court explosion being investigated for past arson acts,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/suspect-arrested-california-court-explosion-being-investigated-past-arson-acts,2024-09-26T14:25:02Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Police in Santa Barbara, California, identified the suspect arrested for throwing an explosive device inside a city courthouse, saying he may be connected to previous arson acts.

Police arrested 20-year-old Nathaniel McGuire just moments after he allegedly threw his backpack into the Santa Maria courthouse and it exploded, injuring five people.

""Immediately after throwing the backpack, McGuire ran to the southeast parking lot where he was detained by a court security officer, a Sheriff's Deputy and CHP Officers as he tried to enter his red sedan. McGuire was alone when he was apprehended and was wearing body armor underneath a jacket. He did not have any physical injuries from the explosion,"" police said in a statement.

Police say McGuire's motive stemmed from a previous arrest for having an unregistered firearm. He was due in court the morning of the incident.

""Detectives are working with SBC Fire investigators to explore if the suspect is associated with several recent arson fires, and they are in the process of serving search warrants for McGuire's car and home,"" police said.

McGuire has been booked at the Northern Branch Jail for felonies including attempted murder, manufacturing an explosive device and use of an explosive device for attempted murder.

Investigators say they don't currently believe McGuire's attack was part of a wider conspiracy.

""Although this is an ongoing investigation and we are exploring all possible angles, at this point in time, we believe this to be a local incident committed by a local individual, with a local grievance stemming from his arrest. We are not absolutely ruling out that there is something larger at play, but at this time we believe this is a local matter that has been safely resolved and there are no outstanding community safety concerns,"" a police spokesperson said.

Katy Perry's New Single Hits The Charts-But It's Not The Smash She Was Hoping For,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2024/09/26/katy-perrys-new-single-hits-the-chartsbut-its-not-the-smash-she-was-hoping-for/,2024-09-26T13:49:41Z,"One week before delivering her new album 143, Katy Perry released one more single from the project. ""I'm His He's Mine"" arrived on Friday (September 13), and now it's started appearing on charts all around the world. Sadly, the cut didn't turn out to be the blockbuster that the pop star and her team have been trying to generate throughout this campaign.

""I'm His He's Mine"" debuts on a pair of charts in the U.K. this week. The tune doesn't launch close to the top on either list, though. The single also fails to reach the main ranking of the most-consumed songs in the country, but it did sell well enough to appear on a handful of other tallies.

Perry's latest opens highest on the Official Singles Downloads chart, where it enters at No. 46. ""I'm His He's Mine"" is also new to the Official Singles Sales roster, where it starts its time just one rung lower.

""I'm His He's Mine"" is the first single from 143 to miss the most competitive songs ranking in the U.K. The album's lead cut ""Woman's World"" peaked at No. 47, narrowly missing out on becoming a top 40 win. Second track ""Lifetimes"" stalled at No. 89 and vanished after one frame.

Unfortunately, ""I'm His He's Mine"" also performed far worse than the two tunes that preceded it on the charts it does reach this week. The first two singles from 143 both entered the top 20 on both of the sales-focused rosters, while Perry's new release didn't make it to the top 40.

""I'm His He's Mine"" is credited almost everywhere as a collaboration between Perry and rising rapper Doechii. While the latter musician's name appears on the single and album on streaming sites and download platforms, she, oddly, isn't featured officially when it comes to the U.K. charts. While Perry earns another win -- even if it's a small one -- Doechii apparently misses out.

It's possible that in the coming week or two, ""I'm His He's Mine"" could rise to new heights. It might even be able to finally hit the U.K.'s top songs chart, perhaps when the album impacts the rankings next week. While that is certainly a possibility, it doesn't seem like a likely one at this point."
'Grey's Anatomy' Star Chandra Wilson Reflects On 21 Seasons: 'It Is My Greatest Honor',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffconway/2024/09/26/greys-anatomy-star-chandra-wilson-reflects-on-21-seasons-it-is-my-greatest-honor/,2024-09-26T13:10:13Z,"On March 27, 2005, I remember hearing some light ""buzz"" around a new medical drama premiering that evening on ABC. Like many, the television promos intrigued me enough to tune into the pilot episode and give it a shot. Fast forward nearly 20 years and Grey's Anatomy remains a fan-favorite show, cemented in the coveted Thursday night lineup spot on primetime network television.

Actor Chandra Wilson has been along for the ride since the very beginning. Continuing to play Dr. Miranda Bailey for all 21 seasons, Wilson, 55, sat down with me on Zoom, while she was on a break from filming, to reflect upon her beloved character's elaborate on-screen journey thus far, what motivates her to want to keep telling these stories at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital and if an end to this TV phenomenon is in sight.

Jeff Conway: First, can we rewind to around 2004? When did the Grey's Anatomy project initially get on your radar, Chandra?

Chandra Wilson: I was doing Caroline, or Change at the Public Theater and we had found out that we were going to move to Broadway, so we were taking a break to open on Broadway in April and looking for other things to do in the meantime. So, in the meantime, I went to jump into Avenue Q for a minute as an understudy and while I was on Avenue Q, I got the audition for this untitled Shonda Rhimes project. They were looking for a short, White, blonde female called ""The Nazi"" - that's me!

Because I had auditioned for ABC many times over the years, they agreed to see me and put me on tape. So, that's what I did. I went up to the ABC offices and went on tape - just a regular, old audition and they told me that they wanted me to come out to LA to do the studio and the network audition. I went a day while I was on Avenue Q - flew out to LA, did the auditions and it took maybe a couple of days before I got the word that I got the pilot.

So, the pilot was 15 days, plus a couple extra days. We went to Seattle and then I had to hurry back into the tech of Caroline, or Change to start the Broadway run. That was it! Nothing else was going to happen with this show. There was an upfront and I think the upfront said something about a midseason. There was no airdate - nothing made any sense. So, right when Caroline, or Change was getting ready to close at the end of August, we were going to move to LA and do a run at the Ahmanson Theatre, and that's when I found out - Okay, midseason pickup. We're going to start working in October and see if we get an airdate. So, in my brain, I was like, Okay, so go to LA, do this TV thing during the day and Caroline at night - No!

Then by Christmas, we [on what would become Grey's Anatomy] shut down for a tone change or something - so, to me, that was it. We did two months - no airdate - whatever, whatever - but they did call us back in January [2005] to finish the 13 episodes and we got four airdates borrowed from Boston Legal - just to put four episodes out - say we did it - no big deal. March 27, 2005 after Desperate Housewives wasn't going to go anywhere. So those four weeks, our numbers did better than the Boston Legal numbers, so Boston Legal stayed on hiatus, they aired the next eight episodes, so we could end with Desperate Housewives which was the Kate Walsh [Addison Montgomery TV introduction], ""You're sleeping with my husband"" episode. It's a coincidence - that's how it ended up and that's how we got an airdate, finally.

Conway: Chandra, I'm curious - now going into 21 seasons, we have seen Miranda Bailey's family life, her medical career, but what have you enjoyed most about the evolution she has had throughout this series so far?

Wilson: In real time, we got to see somebody that had goals, right? Had a professional dream - you got to see her achieve that and then some, in the same amount of time it would have taken anybody else to get that thing done and then figure out the ""what next,"" which is another part of the journey that we all go through. And in the middle of that, you thought you knew who she was in the beginning. All of her pink insides have been revealed over the years and she's also a woman living with Obsessive-compulsive disorder and having to manage her mental health. What more relevant can you be in this world, to mitigate that journey, live your life, have a career and still have room to say, ""You know what? I still don't quite know what's next and I'm open to figuring it out.""

Conway: I'm sure you hear it, too. People are always like, ""Ellen Pompeo - she's still playing Dr. Meredith Grey"" but I'm like, with respect, ""Hello! So is Dr. Miranda Bailey, Chandra Wilson - James Pickens Jr., Dr. Richard Webber. Let's not forget everybody in the room."" You are an ""OG"" too, so what does it mean to have been a part of this series from the ground up?

Wilson: It is my greatest honor. I would always say - Look, I want to be there until the end - very last episode, very last moment when the wheels fall off because there's something about that journey that is so exciting to me, to have started a thing and then be through to the finish of it, if that's what it is. I'm just kind of a loyal television person anyway. I'm soaps - I'm looking at General Hospital right now. Look at that [shows me her tablet screen] - you're interrupting my General Hospital time. So, I appreciate an ""OG"" cast member, where I plug in and I don't even care if it's three years later and they're still there. So, that's what that means to me.

Conway: You are a part of of pop culture, Chandra. Obviously, season two - ""O'Malley, stop looking at my va-jay-jay."" Beyond that moment, what have you loved most about the moments that Bailey has had and you have been able to embody as an actor that have meant the most to you?

Wilson: I think probably the most fun I've had as an actor is the season six ending with the shooter in the hospital - being under the bed, being pulled from under the bed, having to say I'm a nurse, banging on the elevator. Her having that eye contact with Charlie [Percy, played by the actor Robert Baker] down there to know that - Okay, my journey right now is not to try and heal him. It's to sit with them and help him transition.

It was exhilarating! I don't care how many times we have to do the take - it was exhilarating and those kinds of moments happen all the time. Bailey getting married, Bailey become the Chief, Bailey becoming the Chief Resident and doing her own little dance. She gets to do a happy dance, too! Getting navy blue scrubs - that's like been a pivotal moment. Oh man! When you get to navy blue, that's something.

Conway: Chandra, you bring up season six - that's when you started directing episodes, as well. What joys do you get out of being a creative in the directing space that you don't get out of acting in the same way?

Wilson: Wow! It's certainly a different part of my brain. As a Virgo, it's my anal retentive part. The joy of directing comes to me with understanding directing for series television is creating the puzzle pieces needed to put together to make the product to give to the producer. Being able to see those puzzle pieces on the floor and know that - Yes, I have that - good! We can move on. I love being able to set the tone of the floor and let everybody know that everything is okay, and if you got a question, guess what? Ask me and I have the answer for you. I'm certainly an actor's director but I'm a crew director, as well.

If I know that props [department] is going out of their way to make sure that we have this certain plant there, well I want to make sure that camera crosses right on through that plant and we highlight that thing because you put a lot of work in that. If you got a dry erase board with a whole bunch of stuff on it and they come in after each take and erase it and put it back down, I'm featuring that board! I have such appreciation for everything that everybody does in order to make this thing happen. That's coming from [my background in] theatre and having that understanding and being able to spill that over into this medium, as well.

Conway: Chandra, we are heading into season 21. Does it feel like there is an endgame coming? Are you hearing things from Shonda Rhimes? Are you hearing things from Betsy Beers? Are you talking to people? Does it seem like this could go 25-30 seasons, or does it feel like we are making a turn for a full-circle moment soon?

Wilson: I honestly do not have the slightest idea. I know from on the creative end, they've written the end of the show so many times and for whatever reason, we get there and the studio will say, ""You sure about that?"" We continue!

We're just always right in the middle of the times. I never would have imagined our Covid season and that was some of the most essential work, I think, that we've done - not only as a dramatic series but as providing a service. It really felt like a service here. Who would've known that we would've needed to provide a service here? So, it just continues to evolve and to roll forward, and until somebody finally makes up their mind that they're done with the thing, we show up and we just read the scripts and bring the babies to life.

Conway: So Chandra, what can you tease, if anything, about what we can expect from Dr. Miranda Bailey in season 21? And the writers - what keeps you interested as an actor that there are still stories to tell as Bailey?

Wilson: As an actor, I still get every script, open it up and learn something new about Miranda. I have never in all these years claimed ownership of Miranda Bailey. I have never been somebody to say, ""You know? She would say such and such."" I don't have the slightest idea what she would say. I open that [script] and that's what she says and that has kept me from being somebody that wouldn't take a risk or would just say no to something. Human beings surprise you all the time and do things that seem out of character. It's allowed me to be able to be that kind of an actor and that's what continues to keep me engaged as an actor.

Conway: And what's coming up for Bailey?

Wilson: That for 21 seasons, I have never known, and I continue to not - and I think that's my secret sauce - because if I knew, I would probably go and mess with it.

Conway: After all you have already done in your career, Chandra, even beyond Grey's Anatomy, what do you still itch to do? Is it in acting, directing, producing? What is in the back of your head that you constantly want to finally scratch?

Wilson: So, the cool thing about me is that in 1991 when I graduated from NYU and I was doing a play off Broadway, and I got my equity card and I got medical insurance because I had enough weeks, I had made it. That was it! Everything that I thought I was supposed to get from college. Seriously! Everything after that has been icing on the cake.

With that said, my mindset is still wide open to what's left out there. I guess I had envisioned dramatic series television, but I certainly hadn't envisioned directing for television - maybe for theatre. I certainly hadn't envisioned producing, so my mind is open to whatever she has got planned for me and hoping that all of this that I've done equips me for wherever that is where I need to be.

Conway: What would you say to the Chandra Wilson that was just getting involved with Grey's Anatomy, unaware of what it was going to ultimately do? If you could go back and give yourself advice, a warning - something that would've been helpful to have known then, after everything you have achieved and accomplished up until now, what would you have said to that Chandra?

Wilson: Basically, I would've said - Baby girl, you're okay and you're ready for this ride - and it's okay. You got a good head on your shoulders and it's okay.

Conway: Lastly Chandra, if you could speak to Dr. Miranda Bailey after playing her for these 21 seasons thus far and could say something to her now - with her highs, her lows - her wins, her losses - after embodying her and learning to understand her, what would you say to Bailey, if only you could?

Wilson: Me as Chandra, say to her? I would go to her if I needed an internist because I think that she would have a great bedside manner and I think that she would do her best to take really good care of me and treat me like family - even if she cursed me out, every now and then. So yeah, I'd let her know that if ever I needed an internist, she'd be the one I'd go to."
"After 'Assassin's Creed Shadows' Delay, Ubisoft Acknowledges 'Outlaws' Issues, Anti-Woke Pushback",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/26/after-assassins-creed-shadows-delay-ubisoft-acknowledges-outlaws-issues-anti-woke-pushback/,2024-09-26T12:23:07Z,"Ubisoft is in an extremely rough spot right now with its stock at a ten year low, a self-investigation into the company beginning to sort out its issues and the announcement that its imminent large-scale Assassin's Creed game, Shadows, will now be delayed three months, out of 2024 to February 14, 2026.

Ubisoft was...unusually candid about the reasons for this, even to the point of admitting its last game had issues they needed to learn from:

""While [Assassin's Creed Shadows] is feature complete, the learnings from the Star Wars Outlaws release led us to provide additional time to further polish the title.""

Outlaws arrived with somewhat middling scores, which put it in the bottom half of all Ubisoft's major releases over the last 10-15 years. The idea was that an open world Star Wars game was almost a can't-miss, but between bugs and criticism of its heavy stealth focus, it just didn't do as well as they wanted, and that includes sales-wise. Now, Massive is patching the game not just to fix technical issues but even to modify some of its stealth sections to be more player friendly, plus additional improvements to combat more generally.

Then, Ubisoft surprisingly, tacitly acknowledged a narrative that its games have become too ""woke"" or agenda-driven, according to a segment of the internet:

""I want to reaffirm that we are an entertainment-first company, creating games for the broadest possible audience, and our goal is not to push any specific agenda. We remain committed to creating games...that everyone can enjoy.""

While Ubisoft already apologized to its Japanese audiences over some questionable promotional materials for Shadows, the pushback was also about the inclusion of Yasuke as one of the two leads, a legendary black samurai where there was an ensuing debate of whether he was actually a samurai, and a stated idea that it shouldn't be starring him at all.

There was similar pushback to Kay Vess leading Star Wars Outlaws as a woman, and a not-attractive-enough woman at that. No uh, historical accuracy complaints there, as it was pretty straightforward ""woke/DEI"" talking points there. But it is surprising to see Ubisoft entertain this at all.

With the Shadows delay, I have seen some talk about how they're using this time to patch out Yasuke or reduce his role in the game as a result of all this. That's...essentially impossible at this point. This is a three month delay for a ""feature complete"" game and you are not going to tear out the entire meat of the story and replace it during that time. That's just not how it works. It will indeed simply be polish, ensuring the game launches with its best foot forward in that department and has fewer bugs that Outlaws did.

It's clear Ubisoft is in a tough spot right now and all-hands-on-deck at this point. Whether they can recover from recent missteps and launch Shadows as a hit remains to be seen."
Why Wolff Olins For 30 Years? It Fits My Brief.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sairahashman/2024/09/26/why-wolff-olins-for-30-years-it-fits-my-brief/,2024-09-26T10:12:50Z,"My life and career have been full of surprises, staying in one company for 30 years is one of them. My colourful background and adventurous spirit make my unfashionably long stint even more confusing and worth a moment of reflection as I mark the occasion.

People look at me and make some understandable assumptions. Thinking I have a very traditional background and upbringing for example - middle class, a straight line from A-levels to university and into my career - the truth is rather different.

My parents were out and proud hippies and the women in my family down the generations have all been wilfully independent-minded, big-hearted and rather fiercely intelligent on occasion (there are less positive traits too but I'll gloss over those for now). My point is that I wasn't short of role models, and I came into the world thinking being a woman was the best thing ever.

I spent all of my early years backpacking around the world to seemingly faraway places including India, living alone in remote mountain villages, beach caves and communes with my free-spirited, perpetually broke and anarchic mother. It was a very nomadic, eclectic, free-range kind of upbringing.

Life called us back to London to socialise me into Western ways and find a path into mainstream education. I didn't settle into school properly until I was nine and left just before my sixteenth birthday having completed my exams as fast as possible. It was too rigid, too boring and lacked creativity. All the classic things you hear from most people who head into the creative industries.

I set out for new adventures in new environments around the world, but travelling on my own this time.

Back then I thought the only way to progress was to job-hop every couple of years in a new place. The idea of staying put and settling in somewhere for the long term never crossed my mind. So that's what I did.

I tried a lot of things, learning what I liked, who I liked to be around, and the kind of places where I fit in. This worked out in my favour as by the time I arrived at Wolff Olins years later I'd packed in a lot, learned a great deal about myself along the way and was ready to start building a career with my preferences largely identified.

Right time, right place

Serendipity brought me along the Regent's canal and through the doors of Wolff Olins in London. After stints in advertising, PR and design, I knew I wanted to build a career in the creative industries. But I hadn't yet found something or somewhere intellectually stimulating enough to get stuck in for any length of time.

Wolff Olins was well known to be a creative and intellectual powerhouse, everyone in design schools around the world knew about the place at the time, and jobs were coveted and fought for.

Meanwhile, I answered a blind ad in a paper (remember those anyone?), got propositioned on the way to the interview in the seedy part of town they were based in, hit it off with Caroline Williams over lunch in what we later dubbed the 'womb room' (it didn't have any windows) and started a few weeks later. Some things are meant to be and if you're lucky, they arrive when you're ready for them and just need recognising for what they are.

Not entirely love at first sight

It took a while for the place to get under my skin. There was a lot to love but also a lot to get used to and a lot to prove. It took some time to find my feet and find my people.

One thing I loved from day one was the ethos and the natural DNA of the place. Right from the off Jane Scruton (the most senior woman in the business) was talking my language during my induction - huge heart, high standards, in at the deep end. It was a fast learning curve and I liked the challenge.

There was an openness to being provocative and having fun with our work; an aversion to conformity or being told what to do; and a willingness to push boundaries and break a few rules along the way.

I liked that while the people working there took what they did seriously, they didn't take themselves too seriously. And with its somewhat maverick culture rooted in the 60s and its belief in making the world better, it felt familiar; a homecoming of sorts.

The winter party was a watershed moment for me. It was my first one, I was late to the in-house dining room and missed out on finding a seat easily. Wally Olins (the founder) spotted me, got up and made space at his table. It was all the things I love and appreciate about the place at its best - attentive, empathetic and generous, regardless of seniority.

During Wolff Olins' evolution from being founder-led, through a management buy-out to acquisition into a holding company, which enabled the business to succeed in the US, it's grown more professional while working hard to keep the culture dynamic and true to its roots.

It's a purposeful and principled place and a cause I've enjoyed flying the flag for all these years - it fits my brief.

Keep learning, keep growing

I was in a hurry to move up the ladder and managed to hit quite a few bumps along the way. On occasion, I just plain tripped over my own feet being in such a hurry. But mostly it had to do with all the usual suspects like not getting onto the best opportunities, not clicking in some teams, politics, etc. etc.

Once I decided to commit to staying for a length of time, two things happened that helped me hit my stride. I nearly burnt out and had to chill out, and I found my groove working with peers I adored and who backed me (thank you Marina Willer amongst many others).

I went back to my early years in identifying my gaps as I saw them and figuring out how to fill them in. I found some wonderful mentors and guides (thank you Wally Olins, Doug Hamilton, Brian Boylan and Karl Heiselman) and focused on improving my practice and being a better advisor to my clients (I've always loved my clients, even the ones in industries I'm not all that jazzed about that dislike change).

This sent me off to Harvard Business School, an attempted then aborted MA in Design due to work pressure and a successful MA in Digital Sociology (having learned how to juggle more successfully the second time). Trial and error as ever.

Never the same year twice

I've changed a lot over the years and so has the company I'm in. While it has the same DNA, it's different in so many ways.

Like me, it's far more interested in looking forward and getting to what's next. Right now that's figuring out where GAI will take us, how brands should evolve, what the world needs more of right now, what modern leadership looks like, and how to champion our industry in a way that makes it far more accessible.

I've had a 30-year career so far but I've never had the same year twice in all those years, whether through my efforts or the world at large.

Time to reflect

First, it doesn't have to matter where you came from, what type of person you are, or your gender if you can find your fit, get committed and get comfortable adapting - give it some time, see where it takes you, even if you're not sure at first. Don't be afraid to experiment.

Secondly, it's easy to confuse what success looks like and think it's all about your achievements alone. That's a big part of any journey for sure. But looking back it's the people and the experiences you've had that will stay in your heart forever.

Other reflections: leadership is a practice rather than a title. It's amazing what you can get done if you stop asking for permission or looking for attention. And results alone don't get you promoted - you need advocates too.

You can find many ways to thrive if you're in an environment you love, with people you respect. Plus if you stick around long enough you can be part of driving and shaping significant shifts, including winding up as a company's first female CEO.

I love the expression 'do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life' but that's not how my career has gone. I've not always enjoyed what I'm doing but I have always continued to learn and grow, and, for me, that's where the real joy and achievement has come from.

My old mentor was with Wolff Olins for 40 years, making me a relative lightweight with my three decades. I wish you a wonderful and meaningful career journey wherever you decide to spend yours, and for however long."
Royal Academy Schools Art Prize Winner Daria Blum Evolves The Art Of Performance,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/leesharrock/2024/09/26/royal-academy-schools-art-prize-winner-daria-blum-evolves-the-art-of-performance/,2024-09-26T09:36:27Z,"Royal Academy Schools graduate Daria Blum talks about the impact of winning the Claridge's Royal Academy Schools Art Prize and her first UK solo exhibition Drip Drip Point Warp Spin Buckle Rot.

Daria Blum didn't just graduate from the RA Schools' Class of 2023, she was also awarded the inaugural Claridge's Royal Academy Schools Art Prize, selected by judges Yinka Shonibare CBE, RA and Eva Rothschild RA and presented in a ceremony at Claridge's last September by Marina Abramović. It feels symbolic that Abramović, the 'Grand Dame' of Performance Art and the first woman to have a solo exhibition in the main galleries of the Royal Academy of Arts, presented the award to Blum, in a kind of passing of the Olympic torch of performance art from one generation to another. Since winning the Art Prize a year ago, Blum has been busy preparing for her solo exhibition at Claridge's ArtSpace in London, titled Drip Drip Point Warp Spin Buckle Rot.

I spoke to Blum on a rainy September morning at a preview of her solo exhibition at Claridge's ArtSpace in London. As well as winning £30,000 which will help Blum facilitate her continuing artistic practice, she was given the opportunity to transform the John Pawson designed Claridge's ArtSpace into an immersive installation. What impact has winning the prize had on Blum's career?

""It's been hugely transformative, being able to put on a show like this. Also, you come out of art school and don't realise how much things cost to produce. And having the whole team at Claridge's and the RA that are there to support me, and the network of people that they are able to reach, has been amazing.""

Blum has created a complex, multi-disciplinary, multi-screen installation featuring elements of performance, cinema, theatre, sculpture and dance. She has transformed the subterranean exhibition space into a theatrical darkened room with a three-channel video piece surrounded by spot lights usually found in the theatre, and sculptural elements featuring multiple microphones on stands, with discs attached featuring printed images of her hands in balletic or performative poses. I asked Blum what the starting point was for the exhibition, and where the title comes from.

""I was watching a documentary of the Claridge's build into the ground. They built five doors down and two floors up. Because the gallery is below ground, and I'd also recently experienced a flood at my own apartment, I was thinking about water leakages and drips, and the home sort of falling apart. In relation to new beginnings but also decay. I'm also thinking about architectural maintenance and architectural decay in relationships to interpersonal relationships and needs, and how they tend to start decaying.""

The video piece at the heart of the Drip Drip Point Warp Spin Buckle Rot exhibition is set in an abandoned 1970's office building, and follows a fictional character (played by the artist) through the deserted spaces. The character comes across various sources including monochrome portraits of Blum's late grandmother, the Ukrainian ballerina Daria Nyzankiwska and archival dance rehearsal footage, which influence her choreography and gestures. Blum does all the filming herself and I asked her how she found the location and what the story was behind the film's character.

""I've concretely been working on the exhibition since March this year. I did a residency at the CAPC in Bordeaux from March until May, and that's where I ended up filming most of the footage for the film. It was shot in a 1970s office building which was adjacent to the museum, that I was passing every day and was fascinated by what was inside. I managed to get access to it, so in the film you see this character walking through empty corridors and rooms. In the subtitles and text I wrote for the film, I'm addressing this jaw pain, physical chronic pain that I've been experiencing, and personifying this pain as this female character who breaks into the space and starts messing about. I don't write the script. It's quite organic. I have these characters that recur. I enjoyed doing this because it's the first time I've worked on a film where I had to think about camera angles and continuity.""

This intriguing site-specific artwork is a continuation of Blum's investigations into intergenerational female relationships, muscle memory and institutional power, and their interplay with dance and architecture. She trained in ballet at her Mother's dance school in Lucerne, Switzerland, and this early training has a huge influence on her artistic practice, which is infused with elements of choreography and movement. She will give live performances during the five-week run of the exhibition.

How does Blum's ballet training inform her artistic practice? ""I suppose I was interested in the institutional power that ballet has and the world of ballet has. I guess I've been questioning what it means to me to have this kind of ballet movement so ingrained in my body. I was looking at these gestures and ways of performing ballet, some of which have to do with relaxing your fingers. My Mother was a dancer and so was my Grandmother. My Mother had a ballet school in Lucerne, so I grew up dancing my entire life. I was kind of thrown into it and never really questioned Ballet and its history, and the fact that Ballets today are performed over and over again, and they have all these outdated power dynamics and misogynistic tropes embedded in them. It's this kind of archaeological site, you could look at dance in that way.""

Drip Drip Point Warp Spin Buckle Rot is a sophisticated and intelligent continuation of performances Blum gave during her time at the Royal Academy Schools, such as her 'Circumbendibus Vol. 1 & 2' live performance at the Royal Academy of Arts open studios in 2022, which chronicled the death and resurrection of the artist's alter ego, and involved a script written by Blum which examined false binaries and gender stereotypes, and her 'On Pointing On' performance commissioned for the 'Festival Académie des Mutantes' at the CAPC Musée d'Art Contemporain in Bordeaux in June 2024, which was influenced by Bordeaux Ballet's 'La Fille Mal Gardée'.

Daria Blum: Drip Drip Point Warp Spin Buckle Rot is open from 24 September until 25 October 2024."

Former Las Vegas Raiders general manager Mike Mayock thinks the Raiders could have had something special after their playoff berth in the 2021-2022 season.

During that season, the Raiders started 3-2 before head coach Jon Gruden resigned after articles published by the Wall Street Journal and New York Times detailed the use of racist, homophobic and misogynistic terms by Gruden in emails reportedly dating back to 2010.

The team then promoted Rich Bisaccia to become the interim head coach, who steadied the ship and led the Raiders to the playoffs. Mayock believes the job Bisaccia did as an interim coach warranted him to be hired full time during a recent appearance on OutKick's ""Don't @ Me With Dan Dakich.""

""I'm entitled to my opinion, and I believe that Raiders team would have been a high-level playoff team the last couple of years had they kept Rich Bisaccia on board,"" Mayock said.

""The players gravitate to [Bisaccia] not because he's easy on them, but because he has their backs at all times, and he loves them just as much off the field as he does on the field. He's one of the few coaches I've ever seen that can kick a guy's a-- for three hours, and that guy will be in his office afterward talking about issues with his girlfriend,"" Mayock said.

Mayock spoke about how Bisaccia led the Raiders organization through some emotionally challenging moments during that tumultuous 2021 season.

SUPER BOWL CHAMPION JON GRUDEN SAYS HE'LL BE 'READY TO GO' IF A TEAM WANTS TO HIRE HIM AS HEAD COACH

""We're 5-2 with Richie, and we have a bye week. We go on the bye week, we come back, we're healthy, we're excited, we got the right guy as our head coach, and that's the week that Henry Ruggs got in the car accident and killed a woman and her dog, and that put an emotional hole in our building that few coaches can come back from,"" Mayock said.

""We had survived the Gruden thing, now we've got the Henry Ruggs situation. We go into to play a horrible New York Giants team, and we lose. And we lost, I think, four of our next five because guys are processing and dealing with one of the worst things in their lives,"" Mayock continued.

""They all loved Henry Ruggs, and that situation was awful. Yet somehow Richie kept us in the game, we win the last four. ... We go 10-7, and we take the Bengals in the wild card game all the way to the final play of the game; and they go on to the Super Bowl,"" the former general manager added.

JENN STERGER BREAKS SILENCE ON BRETT FAVRE'S PARKINSON'S DISEASE REVELATION: 'KARMA NEVER FORGETS AN ADDRESS'

Despite the Raiders' success down the stretch that earned them a playoff berth, the Raiders went in a different direction in the offseason.

""We thought we had something special. We were a young, aggressive, tough team, Richie is a great natural leader, and we thought we had something to build on. The net of it is that Mark Davis wanted a new coach, he wanted a new GM, he fired Richie and I. I told the owner that Rich Bisaccia has got to be our coach, he's our guy. I got fired, Rich got fired, and he hired the two people from New England, [Josh] McDaniels and [Dave] Ziegler,"" Mayock said.

After Mayock and Bisaccia left, McDaniels went 9-16 over 25 games with the Raiders and was fired after Week 8 during his second season.

Ziegler was fired after two seasons with the team, and the Raiders hired former Los Angeles Chargers general manager Tom Telesco as their new general manager.

After firing McDaniels, the Raiders promoted Antonio Pierce as interim head coach. This time around, Davis hired his interim coach as the full-time head coach after Pierce went 5-4 to finish the season.

The Raiders did not make the playoffs in either of the two seasons after Bisaccia's departure and are currently 1-2 this season."
Shania Twain says stage fright could force her to be taken 'off the stage',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/shania-twain-says-stage-fright-could-force-her-taken-off-stage,2024-09-26T08:23:16Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

As Shania Twain prepares to host the People's Choice Country Awards on Thursday, the 59-year-old legend joked that she might have to be yanked ""off the stage"" due to her stage fright.

""I'm not the greatest reader,"" the ""Man! I Feel Like a Woman!"" singer told Taste of Country this week. ""I'm a very spontaneous speaker and thinker, so if I get rambling, they might have to take the hook out and get me off the stage.""

Twain, who has been performing since she was about 8 years old, said she's dealt with stage fright her entire career.

""I've always had terrible stage fright,"" the ""You're Still the One"" singer told CTV in Canada in 2019, ""So, I think the only way to deal with it would be for me to just forget about what I was doing and jump right into 'We're all in this together' to not feel isolated.""

SHANIA TWAIN 'TRAUMATIC' CHILDHOOD LED TO YEARS OF ANGER

She added, ""I'm still the 8-year-old who is afraid to go on stage and as soon as I'm embraced by the audience, then I don't feel like I'm standing alone.""

SHANIA TWAIN'S LIQUID DIET HELPS HER AVOID A 'NIGHTMARE' CONCERT MISHAP

She said at the time that getting herself onto a stage is ""not a step, it's a leap. It's a jump. You know, Pavaratti said every night before going on stage, just before going on stage, 'OK, everybody, it's time to die,' because it feels like you're crossing a threshold, this petrifying threshold and it literally is a leap. It's the unknown every night. That's the thing about live. It's so unknown. I don't even want to say it, but things happen that are unexpected.""

""Sometimes you forget the words. I mean, how embarrassing is that? So, if you think about everything that could go wrong, which is normally what somebody with stage fright does, you go through this panic for a bit, and then once you've crossed that threshold, you've taken the leap, now I feel once I'm there that I'm embraced by the audience, and it's over.""

ADAM SANDLER ON HOW HE BATTLED STAGE FRIGHT, HAVING NO MONEY BEFORE LANDING 'SNL'

Last summer, Twain laughed off a funny mistake during one of her Las Vegas residency shows when she seemingly forgot what hand she was holding her microphone in and started to sing into a drumstick prop.

""Oh my God, that was hilarious,"" she said into the mic after the blunder.

""I'm really glad somebody captured this moment, it's made me laugh all over again,"" Twain captioned an Instagram post after sharing a fan video of it.

She also fell on stage last year while performing ""Don't be Stupid"" in Chicago in knee-high boots. ""Don't be stupid Chicago. You know I love you,"" she joked with the audience as she got up.

"This rural destination is paying people $16K to move there, work remotely",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/rural-destination-paying-people-16k-move-there-work-remotely,2024-09-26T08:20:33Z,"A couple from Warwickshire, England, has spent thousands taking along their two large Dalmatians on vacations abroad. They traveled more than 10,000 miles to France, Switzerland, Italy and other destinations.

A rural region in Spain is paying remote workers $16,000 to relocate and conduct business in a rolling green valley, just under three hours from Madrid.

And it's not the only country offering workers and entrepreneurs money to move -- the list of countries seeking ""digital nomads"" is growing.

Last month, the Regional Government of Extremadura, an autonomous community located in the central-western Iberian Peninsula, announced its new ""Live in Ambroz"" program, designed to attract remote workers by offering about $16,620 in grants if they commit to living and working there for at least two years.

""This phenomenon is going to change where people live, and it's going to change the spatial distribution of talent,"" Prithwiraj Choudhury, a professor at Harvard Business School in Boston, told Fox News Digital.

Choudhury has studied innovation, remote work and the concept of ""work from anywhere"" for more than a decade.

""Many economists thought that talent would all flock to the megacities and that megacities were the future of the world,"" Choudhury said.

""I think that's changing to some extent now. So, of course, megacities will remain important, but some people will live in communities outside the cities, especially if they can work remotely. There'll be a diverse range of places where talent will be found.""

TRAVELERS WILL NEED 'PERMISSION' AND A FEE TO VISIT UNITED KINGDOM AS PART OF NEW DIGITIZED SYSTEM

The people with that talent -- plus the ability to work remotely and a desire to see the world -- are called digital nomads.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, they've formed a sort of symbiotic relationship with countries around the world, trading consumption of goods and services for a lower cost of living in a new and often beautiful environment.

Surrounded by mountains, the Ambroz Valley is made of lush green pasture lands, charming villages with diverse accommodations and local artisan cuisine.

But its largest village, Hervás, has a population of just 3,907, and some municipalities have less than 200 residents.

'HUSH VACATIONS' TREND AS REMOTE WORKERS SLIP OFF FOR TRAVEL GETAWAYS WITHOUT TELLING THE BOSS

It's an issue known as ""Empty Spain"" which ""Live in Ambroz"" aims to combat.

The main objective is to prevent depopulation in rural areas, and the Ambroz Valley is one of the areas that is suffering from a constant loss of population and services, according to a press release from the Regional Government of Extremadura.

""The obvious benefits to the community are that when digital nomads come and spend time in that community, they spend consumption dollars,"" Choudhury said.

""They go to restaurants, they stay in hotels or [an] Airbnb. But I think the much bigger benefit could be to facilitate connections between locals and the nomads in a way that the community can then gain knowledge and even entrepreneurship opportunities.""

Digital nomads are getting their fair share, whether financial or experiential, Choudhury added.

""Some people are just looking for a place they can relocate to and live, which is cheaper than where they [currently] live,"" he said.

""You could move to a cheaper place, and if you're allowed to work remotely, then you can have the same income but spend much less on housing and other things, and then you have more savings.""

Others are in it to see the world, he said.

""There are many people who like making connections in different communities, gaining experiences, life experiences from different places,"" Choudhury said.

""In terms of culture, you can create a portfolio of diverse connections and experiences.""

For Dave Williams, an entrepreneur from Atlanta, it's a little bit of both, he said.

""It's not so far to get here from the U.S., it's a nice time zone, the weather's great, and it's very affordable,"" Williams told Fox News Digital of living in Portugal.

""But it's also about this concept of geo arbitrage, the idea being that you can take your wealth or your income and live in a country where it's a lot less expensive. For example, health insurance policies may only cost like $1,000 a year, whereas in the U.S. it might be $1,000 a month. The cost of living is about half as much or less than half as much as the U.S.""

He and his wife moved to Portugal in 2017 and now run a business called NomadX, which works with local governments to build communities for remote workers while boosting economies.

Choudhury said that before the pandemic, there were just two countries, Estonia and Barbados, offering specific visas for remote workers.

TRAVELERS REFLECT ON VIRAL 9-MONTH-LONG WORLD CRUISE THAT TOOK OVER TIKTOK

Since the pandemic, that number has grown to more than 60, which Choudhury highlighted in an article for Harvard Business Review.

The Ambroz Valley program will award up to 200 digital nomad grants, which can be used for ""available housing, arable land, and everything necessary to expedite their arrival,"" according to the press release.

Candidates must first obtain Spain's digital nomad visa and official residency before they can apply to the Live in Ambroz program. Applications will go live this month and can be submitted online through the Extremadura General Electronic Access Point.

A host of other countries, like Italy, Switzerland, Ireland and Chile, offer financial incentives for workers looking to make a global move and even start a company.

""Chile has had a program for more than a decade called Start-Up Chile,"" Choudhury said.

""It was not announced as a digital nomad program because that is much more recent, but what Chile offered and still offers is a year, year-long visa for foreign entrepreneurs to come and start their companies there. Chile also offers $20,000 equity free capital to each of these foreign entrepreneurs.""

Choudhury noted Williams' program in Madeira, Portugal, as one of the success stories.

""They've even created a digital nomad village,"" Choudhury said.

""The increased geographic mobility of remote workers is shaping communities and leading to potential reversal of brain drain in places that have maybe lost talent for decades.""

Williams said the experience of being a digital nomad has been life-changing.

""When we moved here to Portugal -- or any time I went through a life transition or a move -- it really helped me kind of innovate and break through to the next level,"" Williams said.

""I think it's easy to kind of be comfortable and stay in the same place and live where your work is or live where your family is. While the governments may not always be able to get along, it seems like the people generally are able to get along with each other and are very supportive. It really kind of gives you a lot of faith in humanity,"" he added."
'She deserved the purse': Mom of four starts viral movement to give back to struggling mothers,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/deserved-purse-mom-four-starts-viral-movement-give-back-struggling-mothers,2024-09-26T08:14:29Z,"Mom of four Cecily Bauchmann on what inspired her to leave gift cards inside baby products to help out other mothers.

A mother of four was inspired to give back after seeing a video showing a purse left behind in the baby products aisle.

As a result, Cecily Bauchmann decided to put a $100 gift card in a box of baby diapers and posted it on her TikTok page, and inspired others to do the same.

""I was already going to Target to buy something for my daughter, and it made me think, why not go bless another parent with a $100 gift card?,"" Bauchmann said on ""Fox & Friends,"" Wednesday.

This all started when fellow TikTok creator Denaesha Gonzalez posted on her account a purse left behind with the caption, ""she deserved the purse."" The post garnered more than 20 million views and counting.

Gonzalez wrote that the purse may have been left in the aisle by a mother who could not afford it and had to purchase items for her child instead.

Inspired by Gonzalez's video, Bauchmann placed a gift card along with a handwritten note in between a box of diapers and encouraged others to do the same.

""I slipped it right in between a box of diapers, and I was hoping that this could bless them.""

Bauchmann explained how this was an emotional experience for her because it reminded her of when her family did not have much.

""I remember being in a position with two kids at the time, back in 2015, that we couldn't afford much and my kids always came first.""

""This is a trend, or a movement that has become a movement on its own,"" she told Ainsley Earhardt.

Since the trend started, Bachmann explained in another TikTok video that she received a message from a woman who found a gift card and a handwritten note with her purchase and wanted to find out who the card was from.

However, she said it has been noticed that since this trend began, people have gone through baby items to try to steal the gift cards.

Bauchmann is hopeful that this trend can become more organized to help mothers who are struggling financially.

""We are hoping that 'she deserved the purse' becomes an organization on its own to stop that, so that way we can do something smarter."""
Shakira Celebrates Single Life With New Song 'Soltera',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cmalone/2024/09/26/shakira-celebrates-single-life-with-new-song-soltera/,2024-09-26T05:10:43Z,"Global superstar Shakira released her highly anticipated twelfth album La Mujeres Ya No Lloran earlier this year, her first in seven years and a welcome marker of her legacy today. Later this fall, Shakira will be taking the album -- and her three decades of hits -- on the road for the La Mujeres Ya No Lloran World Tour. But before she hits the road, the Colombian hitmaker might already have another project up her sleeve ready to go.

""Soltera,"" Shakira's newest single, is out now, and while it wasn't featured on the album, the standalone track could be part of a forthcoming release. When speaking to Rolling Stone in June about the album's creation, she hinted that she had some more music in the vault that could be on the way. ""There's a few songs we have laying around,"" she said. ""They've been tucked away. I don't have a new album, but let's just say there's a new project.""

On ""Soltera,"" Shakira sings in Spanish about having the right to behave badly and have a good time, celebrating being free and doing as she pleases, and enjoying living a single life. The song is in some ways a spiritual successor to last year's ""Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53,"" her scathing dismissal of ex Gerard Piqué that became a runaway smash and her first top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 in nearly two decades. Similar to the joy of ""Soltera,"" the track was a moment of great catharsis for the Grammy Award winner.

""I'm an artist. I am a woman. And I'm a wounded she-wolf. And no one should tell me how to lick my wounds,"" she told Rolling Stone of her thoughts on processing her breakup publicly through music. ""We're in a society that's used to seeing women confront pain in a submissive way, and I think that's changed.""

The La Mujeres Ya No Lloran World Tour kicks off Nov. 2 in Palm Desert, CA and wraps up Dec. 15 in Detroit."

This is a full transcript of the exclusive interview of Vice President Kamala Harris by MSNBC's ""11th Hour"" host Stephanie Ruhle. It has been lightly edited for clarity.

RUHLE: Madam Vice President, you just laid out your economic vision for the future.

HARRIS: Yes.

RUHLE: But, still, there are lots of Americans who don't see themselves in your plans. For those who say, these policies aren't for me, what do you say to them?

HARRIS: Well, if you are hardworking, if you have the dreams and the ambitions and the aspirations of what I believe you do, you're in my plan.

I have to tell you, I really love and am so energized by what I know to be the spirit and character of the American people. We have ambition. We have aspirations. We have dreams. We can see what's possible. We have an incredible work ethic.

But not everyone has the access to the opportunities that allow them to achieve those things. But we don't lack for those things. But not everyone gets handed stuff on a silver platter. And so my vision for the economy -- I call it an opportunity economy -- is about making sure that all Americans, wherever they start, wherever they are, have the ability to actually achieve those dreams and those ambitions, which include, for middle-class families, just being able to know that their hard work allows them to get ahead, right?

I think we can't and we shouldn't aspire to have an economy that just allows people to get by. People want to do more than just get by. They want to get ahead. And I come from the middle class.

Look, my mother raised my sister and me. She worked hard. She saved up. By the time I was a teenager, she was able to buy our first home. And homeownership for too many people in our country now is elusive. You know, gone is the day of everyone thinking they could actually live the American dream.

So part of my vision for the economy is, let's deal with some of the everyday challenges that people face and address them with commonsense solutions, such as affordable housing.

RUHLE: Over the last four years, there have been tremendous economic wins. And you have just laid out a big plan.

HARRIS: Yes.

RUHLE: But, still, polling shows that more -- most likely voters still think Donald Trump is better to handle the economy. Why do you think that is?

HARRIS: Well, here's what I know in terms of the facts.

Donald Trump left us with the worst economy since the Great Depression, when you look at, for example, the employment numbers.

RUHLE: It was during COVID, and employment was so high because we shut down the government, we shut down the country.

HARRIS: Even before the pandemic, he lost manufacturing jobs, by most people's estimates, at least 200,000. He lost manufacturing plants. Ask the autoworkers how he lost auto plants.

We have grown over 20 new auto plants. He has an agenda. Let's just deal with it right now going forward, not to mention what happened in the past.

He has an agenda that would include making it more difficult for workers to earn overtime, an agenda that would include cutting off access to small business loans for small businesses, an agenda that includes tariffs to the point that the average working person will spend 20 percent more on everyday necessities and an estimated $4,000 more a year on those everyday necessities, to the point that top economists in our country, from Nobel laureates, to people at Moody's and Goldman Sachs, have compared my plan with his and said my plan would grow the economy.

His would shrink the economy. Some of them have actually assessed that his plan would increase inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year. So, the facts remain that Donald Trump has a history of taking care of very rich people.

And I'm not mad at anybody for being rich, but they should pay their fair share -- but tax cuts for the billionaires and the top corporations in our country, and then not really paying much attention to middle-class families. My perspective on the economy is, when you grow the middle class, America's economy is stronger.

And there's empirical evidence to prove my point correct.

RUHLE: Then let me ask you about taxes, because lots of people will say, I don't like Donald Trump, but he cut my taxes. He didn't just cut corporate taxes. He cut individual taxes.

Now, that expires next year. And there's some people confused, saying, I don't know what's going to happen next year.

Under a Harris administration, at what income level should someone expect their taxes to go up? And that state and local tax deduction that's currently capped and matters to a lot of people in blue states, are you going to lift that cap?

HARRIS: So, first of all, when it relates to anybody making less than $400,000 a year, your taxes will not go up. Your taxes will not go up. And, in fact, under my plan, taxes for 100 million Americans will actually be cut, including $6,000 a year for young couples for the first year of their child's life in a tax cut, a tax credit, essentially, by expansion of the child tax credit.

And why is that? Because during the first year of a young couple -- of a person's -- child's life, they're going to need help buying a crib, buying a car seat. And we all benefit when they're actually able to do what they naturally want, to do to take care of their child.

RUHLE: And expanding that child tax credit, or you mentioned housing before, giving that extra money for a first home, if you can't raise corporate taxes, or if GOP takes control of the Senate, where do you get the money to do that?

Do you still go forward with those plans and borrow?

HARRIS: Well, but we're going to have to raise corporate taxes. And we're going to have to raise -- we're going to have to make sure that the biggest corporations and billionaires pay their fair share.

That's just it. It's about paying their fair share. I am not mad at anyone for achieving success, but everyone should pay their fair share. And it is not right that the teachers and the firefighters that I meet every day across our country are paying a higher tax than the richest people in our country.

RUHLE: Bill Gates just said it this week. If he was in charge of taxes, he would have paid more.

But how do you find that line to make sure corporations are paying their fair share, but they're not leaving our country?

HARRIS: Well, listen, I work with a lot of CEOs. I have spent a lot of time with CEOs.

And I'm going to tell you that the business leaders who are actually part of the engine of America's economy agree that people should pay their fair share. They also agree that, when we look at a plan such as mine, that is about investing in the middle class, investing in new industries, investing in bringing down costs, investing in entrepreneurs like small businesses, that the overall economy is stronger and everyone benefits.

Part of my plan for the economy is investing in new industries in a way that we have active partnership with the private sector. I have worked with the private sector my entire career. I -- even as vice president, working with some of the biggest banks and biggest tech companies to increase by billions of dollars the money going into community banks to increase access to capital for small businesses.

Why do those biggest corporations and CEOs do that? Because they know those kinds of investments, like in our small businesses, in start-ups and entrepreneurs, actually strengthens America's economy overall, and everyone benefits.

So this is not about bilking anybody, but it is certainly about saying, let's make sure that we create opportunities for everyone to grow wealth. I believe that it is not sufficient and it should not be our goal to just make sure everyone is working. That should be the baseline. That should be a given.

And let's create an economy where people have the ability to buy a home, to start a business, to take a nice vacation from time to time, right?

RUHLE: For people who want to buy a home, yes, getting a $25,000 kicker would be great, but it's not just affording a home. We don't have enough in this country.

HARRIS: You're absolutely right.

RUHLE: And one of the main problems are regulations and rules, strict, strict rules at a local level.

How does the federal government cut through all that red tape and get down to, I don't know, the suburbs of Pittsburgh and say, we're going to have to build some affordable housing here? How do you connect the two?

HARRIS: So, you're absolutely right.

So, across our country, people rightly are concerned about the cost of housing. So it's homeownership, to your point. We need more supply. That is, without any question, part of the solution.

Creating more supply under my plan includes creating tax incentives to work with the private sector and homebuilders. Part of my goal and the plan would be to create three million new housing units for rent and for ownership by the end of my first term. It includes also what we must do to cut red tape. You're absolutely right.

It takes far too long and there's too much bureaucracy associated with homebuilding. And I say that as a devout public servant. I know that we have to reduce the red tape and speed up what we need to do around building. And that is going to require working from the federal level with state and local governments.

And it's going to be different in different places, depending on the needs of that community, the needs of that local government, that municipality, but working in consultation and coordination and also around incentives that we can create.

For example, some of the work is going to be through what we do in terms of giving benefits and assistance to state and local governments around transit dollars, and looking holistically at the connection between that and housing, and looking holistically at the incentives we in the federal government can create for local and state governments to actually engage in planning in a holistic manner that includes prioritizing affordable housing for working people.

RUHLE: Then let me ask you a business that matters a lot to this town...

RUHLE: Right? When you think Pennsylvania, when you think Pittsburgh, you have got the Liberty Bell in Philly and you have got U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh.

RUHLE: You are opposed to this idea. Many people are. But if the deal doesn't go through, they have said people could lose jobs. They could close mills. They could leave the state of Pennsylvania.

I mean, that is like moving the Liberty Bell to Newark. So which is more important?

HARRIS: It's most important that we maintain America's ability to have American manufacturing of steel by American workers, for a number of reasons, which includes, again, back to the point of growing our economy and how I think about the economy overall, investing in new industries.

There is not a new industry that I can imagine that is not going to require steel as a -- manufacturing of steel as a fundamental part of what it accomplishes. And having American workers in an American company manufacturing that steel for those new industries is going to be critically important, not only in terms of our economy, but also in the context of national security.

Most people now realize, if we didn't before the pandemic and the strain on supply chains and an over-reliance on foreign manufacturing, that we have to be intentional about U.S.-based manufacturing. And of the products that we have to prioritize, steel is one of them. And that's always going to be my priority.

RUHLE: Steelworkers matter in this country. Unions matter.

HARRIS: Yes.

RUHLE: In 2016, Donald Trump connected with unions. He saw them. He -- there was an emotional connection. But what he didn't do was deliver policy.

In the last four years, we have seen huge wins in this country for unions, but not all unions have gotten behind you. I want to understand. When the Teamsters decided not to endorse you, what was their reasoning? What are they looking for?

HARRIS: Well, let me go back to our just previous conversation. I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the steelworkers and almost every other major union in America, because I stand by workers and I stand by the importance of being able to join a union and to understand the benefit and the value of unions.

And I understand the importance of investing in new industries and working actively with the private sector to grow our economy.

RUHLE: But I'm asking, because there's this idea, we want something more from her. What is it?

HARRIS: Well, here's the thing that -- back to your point about previous election cycles.

Donald Trump made a whole lot of promises that he did not meet and, one would argue, broke. Look at Lordstown. He said he was going to...

And what happened? It shut down. Outsourcing under Donald Trump. His policies that are about putting tens to hundreds of percent tariffs.

So, part of the challenge -- and I don't disagree that it's a challenge, got to earn the vote of everybody -- is reminding people of fact, regardless of what somebody says in a small rally somewhere. And I think that's really important. And that's part of what I'm doing in this campaign, is to remind people, just like here in Pittsburgh, of the reality of who has stood with union labor, who stands for American manufacturing, who stands for American jobs.

RUHLE: Can I ask you about tariffs?

Because you just mentioned it. It's not just with one company. Donald Trump's sort of big idea is this broad-based tariffs across the board. You and many others have said that would be, not only disastrous, but it would be a direct tax on the American consumer.

HARRIS: It would be a sales tax on the American people that -- the independent economists have already measured this by his -- the sales tax of doing a 20 percent tariffs on all imports that he has described, would be a 20 percent sales tax, in essence, on basic necessities for the average American worker, average American family, totaling almost $4,000 a year.

That is no small matter. Here in Pittsburgh, when I'm talking to a group of folks who work here, who live here, and when they hear it might be $4,000 more a year for them, look, people can't afford that.

RUHLE: But tariffs aren't unique to President Trump. President Biden has tariffs in place. He's actually looking to potentially implement more. Where do you come out on, is there a good tariff, a bad tariff?

HARRIS: Well, part of it is, you don't just throw around the idea of just tariffs across the board. And that's part of the problem with Donald Trump.

I -- frankly, I'm going to -- and I say this in all sincerity. He's just not very serious about how he thinks about some of these issues. And one must be serious and have a plan, and a real plan, that's not just about some talking point ending in an exclamation at a political rally, but actually putting the thought into, what will be the return on the investment, what will be the economic impact on everyday people?

And when you look at my plans, you will see what those benefits will be, $25,000 down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers. You know what that means? Then you're creating the ability of that working person to build intergenerational wealth.

Doing the work of a $6,000 child tax credit, doing the work of a $50,000 tax deduction for first-time small businesses, start-ups, because, right now...

RUHLE: That's a real plan.

HARRIS: It's a real plan, because, right now -- and, again, it's about paying attention to the detail and being serious about it.

I'm serious about my enthusiasm and my -- for small businesses and my belief in what they will do as part of America's economic engine. On Friday...

HARRIS: And also looking at the fact that, right now, the tax deduction is $5,000. Nobody in this Year of our Lord 2024 can start a small business with $5,000. Very few can.

So, extending it to $50,000, tax deduction for start-ups, to generate the innovation and the ambition of the ideas that are present and among us, but need the fuel to be able to actually achieve the goal.

RUHLE: His plan is not serious when you lay it out like that, but a serious problem over the last few years has been inflation. Luckily, it's cooling, but prices are still high.

RUHLE: You have said you want to take this on by going after those who engage in price gouging.

HARRIS: Yes.

RUHLE: But as somebody who supports free markets, who's a capitalist, how do you go after price gouging without implementing price controls?

Because, once we get in this zone, people start to get worried and they say, I don't know what she stands for.

HARRIS: So, just to be very frank, I am never going to apologize for going after companies and corporations that take advantage of the desperation of the American people.

And, as attorney general, I saw this happen. In the midst of an emergency, whether it be an extreme weather event or even the pandemic, we saw it, where those few companies, not the majority, not most, but those few companies that would take advantage of the desperation of people and jack up prices.

Yes, I'm going to go after them. Yes, I'm going to go after them. And that is part of a much more comprehensive plan on what we can do to bring down the cost of living, including housing, including the everyday needs of the American people.

RUHLE: On Friday, you are going to the border.

Immigration is complicated. One of the issues is an economic one. And no one is eating cats and dogs in Springfield, Ohio. And I'm glad not to be talking about that. But there are people there that are stressed, that feel that they're at capacity. Communities around the country that have legal immigration, many have said, we're at capacity.

And many feel like the government has said to them, well, adapt, sit down, be quiet, this is how it is.

What would a Harris administration do for those communities who've taken in many, many legal immigrants, but are at capacity?

HARRIS: Well, first of all, we do have a broken immigration system. And it needs to be fixed.

And if we take a step back, months ago, some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress came together with others, proposed a border security bill that would have put 1,500 new border agents on the border to help those hardworking border agents who are there right now working around the clock, would have put more money into stemming the flow of fentanyl, which is killing Americans around our country and devastating communities, would have put more resources into our ability to prosecute transnational criminal organizations, which, in my career, I have prosecuted.

Donald Trump got word of the bill, realized it was going to fix a problem he wanted to run on, and told them to kill the bill, don't put it up for a vote. He killed a bill that would have actually been a solution, because he wants to run on a problem, instead of fixing a problem.

And that's part of what needs to be addressed. And my pledge is that, when elected president, if the American people will have me, I will bring that bill back and I will sign it into law. And we need a comprehensive plan that includes what we need to do to fortify not only our border, but deal with the fact that we also need to create pathways for people to earn citizenship.

RUHLE: And I want to just ask you about a little job and a big job.

RUHLE: Because your opponent almost every day seems to be talking about this. So I just want to ask you, yes or no...

(CROSSTALK)

RUHLE: ... at any point in your life, have you served two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun...

HARRIS: And -- but it was not a small job. Like, I did fries.

HARRIS: But, to your point, if you don't mind, before you get to the big job...

RUHLE: Please.

HARRIS: ... it's a -- there's a -- part of the reason I even talk about having worked at McDonald's is because there are people who work at McDonald's in our country who are trying to raise a family -- I worked there as a student, I was a kid -- who work there trying to raise families and pay rent on that.

And I think part of the difference between me and my opponent includes our perspective on the needs of the American people and what our responsibility then is to meet those needs.

RUHLE: But the economy is an unpredictable beast. And you are running for a job that takes extraordinary instinct and guts.

HARRIS: Yes.

RUHLE: When's the last time you had to make a gut decision? This here is very prescribed. It's very controlled.

HARRIS: Yes.

Probably the biggest gut decision I have made most recently is to choose my running mate, yes. There were lots of good, incredible candidates. And, ultimately, that came down to a gut decision.

RUHLE: I know I'm out of time, but then I just want to ask you a question from my gut.

HARRIS: OK.

RUHLE: Because, today, we're talking about reproductive -- excuse me -- we're talking about the economy.

HARRIS: Yes.

RUHLE: And people don't think often about reproductive rights being an economic issue. But it is, a woman's ability to plan her future, her education, her life.

Today, and in the last few days, Donald Trump keeps talking about it and how, in overturning Roe v. Wade, he helped women, he protected women. He says, they're miserable today. They're poorer today. They're more vulnerable today. He said he will be the protector of women if elected.

Can you respond to that?

HARRIS: So, Donald Trump is also the person who said women should be punished for exercising a decision that they rightly should be able to make about their own body and their future.

So, I think we would all agree that, as a result of that perspective that he has about women, he also then chose three members of the United States Supreme Court who did as he intended, undid the protections of Roe v. Wade.

And now in, state after state, you see laws being passed that do punish women, laws that -- I mean, most recently, a heartbreaking story resulted in a young woman dying, a mother of a 6-year-old, heart-wrenching stories. And that's for the listener, much less their family.

So, look, I think the thing about Donald Trump is that I don't think the women of America need him to say he's going to protect them. The women of America need him to trust them.

I am not perfect, but I will tell you, I'm always going to put the needs of the people first.

RUHLE: Madam Vice President, thank you for your time today."

Brad Pitt's rep calls out 'awful' imposters of actor arrested for allegedly scamming women out of $350K,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/brad-pitts-rep-calls-out-awful-imposters-actor-arrested-allegedly-scamming-women-out-350k,2024-09-25T22:49:45Z,"The ""Friends"" actress is one of several stars featured in Sarah Ditums book, ""Toxic: Women, Fame, and the Tabloid 2000s.""

Brad Pitt's representative is speaking out after five people were arrested by Spanish authorities for allegedly posing as the actor online and scamming two women out of over $350,000.

According to a statement released by Spain's Interior Ministry on Monday, three alleged scammers were arrested last November and two others were taken into custody in July. The Spanish police stated that the individuals were part of a ""criminal organization"" that contacted women on social media while pretending to be the Oscar-winning actor and later swindled the victims out of money.

""It's awful that scammers take advantage of fans' strong connection with celebrities, and this is an important reminder to not respond to unsolicited online outreach, especially from actors who have no social media presence,"" a spokesperson for Pitt told Fox News Digital.

Pitt, 60, does not have authorized social media accounts on Instagram, X, formerly Twitter, Facebook, TikTok or any other platform.

Per the police statement, the alleged scammers contacted the women through a Brad Pitt fan page and posed as the ""Once Upon A Time in Hollywood"" star. According to authorities, the suspects created psychological profiles of prospective victims and identified two women who they believed were vulnerable targets.

""It's awful that scammers take advantage of fans' strong connection with celebrities, and this is an important reminder to not respond to unsolicited online outreach, especially from actors who have no social media presence.""

-- Brad Pitt's rep

The impostors began exchanging instant messages and emails with the women, who thought that they were communicating with the real Pitt. The suspects ""managed to make these women believe they had become so close to the well-known American actor that they believed they had a romantic relationship with him.""

After establishing ""maximum"" trust with the victims, the scammers then asked the women for money to invest with him in ""various commercial projects.""

In a series of money transfers, one woman gave the alleged impostors around $167,000 while another sent approximately $195,500. Authorities stated that they were able to recover around $94,000 so far during the investigation.

Per the Spanish police, the alleged scammers are facing charges including fraud, forgery and money laundering.

Pitt has previously spoken out about his disinterest in using social media. In a 2014 interview with GQ, Pitt explained why he didn't see the need to join Twitter, now X.

""Listen, I see a benefit in it. You could, you know, combat the misconceptions or the misquotes immediately. And if I'd have had that in my younger days, I'd have used it,"" he told the outlet.

""Because I felt quite used, and completely misunderstood, and misread, and not given the benefit of the doubt,"" Pitt continued. ""You know, I felt that a lot in my first years. I would have brought some logic to the table, and brought it immediately. But now, at this point, I don't want to bother with it.""

During a 2019 interview with E! News, Pitt was asked what it would take for him to join Instagram.

""Never gonna happen,"" he said.

""No, I'd never say never,"" Pitt qualified before adding, ""Life's pretty good without it, I don't see the point."""
"College football Week 5 preview: Have we ever seen a duo like Shedeur, Travis Hunter?",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/college-football-week-5-preview-have-we-ever-seen-duo-like-shedeur-travis-hunter,2024-09-25T22:04:36Z,"FOX Sports' ""Big Noon Kickoff"" game takes place in Ann Arbor, Michigan, this weekend as the No. 12-ranked Wolverines, fresh off a victory over USC, take on the Minnesota Golden Gophers in the Big House (Noon ET on FOX and the FOX Sports App).

There are plenty of intriguing storylines heading into this game, including the play of Michigan QB Alex Orji, who is set to make his second career start this weekend. The junior signal-caller attempted only 12 passes in his team's 27-24 win over USC, completing seven of them for just 32 yards. Orji also added 43 yards on the ground, but it was the Kalel Mullings show this past weekend as the Wolverines' senior back carried the ball 17 times for a career-high 159 yards and two touchdowns in the victory.

Michigan earned a potentially season-defining win against USC last weekend while running the ball 46 times and only attempting 12 passes. Is this a sustainable offensive game plan for the Wolverines?

Laken Litman: No.

Yes, Michigan finally showed off its powerful running game, led by Kalel Mullings, who piled up 159 yards on the ground with two touchdowns. But while Mullings figures to be a major part of this offensive identity moving forward, Michigan will struggle if it can't throw the ball downfield. Quarterback Alex Orji, who took over for Davis Warren, is more comfortable running than passing.

Whenever Michigan faces a better defense that can stop the run - Ohio State, Indiana and even Northwestern have better rush defenses than USC - the Wolverines could get into some trouble if they remain one-dimensional.

Michael Cohen: It's sustainable to a certain degree. The way Michigan's offensive line asserted itself against USC was particularly impressive considering just how one-dimensional the Wolverines became with Orji atop the depth chart. Orji, who was making his first-career start, completed seven of 12 passes for 32 yards with no touchdowns, no interceptions and an average depth of target that was only 7 yards downfield, which ranked tied for 88th out of the 119 quarterbacks with at least 15 dropbacks in Week 4, according to Pro Football Focus. His longest completion was a 10-yard connection to tight end Marlin Klein. No other tight end or receiver caught a pass longer than 5 yards. In other words, not only were the Trojans keenly aware that Michigan was going to run the ball on nearly every play -- the Wolverines finished with 46 rushing attempts and only 12 passes -- but they also knew any pass Orji might attempt would almost certainly be within a few yards of the line of scrimmage. Defensive coordinator D'Anton Lynn could sell out against the run without any fear of his secondary being beaten by a vertical passing game.

That Michigan still ran the ball for 290 yards and three touchdowns and averaged 6.3 yards per carry speaks to the brute force its players exhibited in the trenches, a formula that might be replicated against some of the more aerially challenged teams on the Wolverines' schedule -- the kinds of opponents who can be dragged into a rock fight. Minnesota, Illinois, Michigan State and Northwestern all rank outside the top 50 nationally in scoring offense, which suggests that Michigan can lure them into slower, more grinding affairs that transform time of possession into a particularly telling statistic. It's against the more explosive offenses like Ohio State (52.3 points per game), Oregon (36.7 points per game) and Indiana (50.5 points per game) that such a run-pass imbalance becomes more problematic. The Wolverines enter Week 5 ranked 129th in passing offense, worst among the Power 4 schools.

RJ Young: It might be. I say that with all sincerity because I didn't think it was possible for Michigan to beat what was the No. 11 team in the country with a pass-happy offense and play-caller with a record for scoring. But that's what happened. Michigan ran 10 plays for 89 yards on the game-winning scoring drive, completing just one pass while trailing by four and needing a touchdown to win.

If Michigan feels comfortable running against seven- and eight-man boxes for the rest of the season and can still get the result it did, who am I to say this team must use this marvelous invention known as the forward pass? After Week 4, ""man-ball"" is just a euphemism for Michigan.

Colorado is another team that earned a massive win last weekend, defeating Baylor thanks to late-game heroics from Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter. Can you think of any previous example where two players have been so directly responsible for their team's success?

RJ: Baker Mayfied and Dede Westbrook in 2016. Mayfield had 285 completions that season, 80 were to Westbrook. Mayfield passed for 3,965 yards, and 1,524 were to Westbrook. Mayfield threw 43 TDs, and 17 were to Westbrook. Oklahoma won the Sugar Bowl following that season.

They were so formidable that each was invited to the Heisman ceremony alongside Deshaun Watson and Lamar Jackson. Mayfield finished third in the voting, and Westbrook finished fourth -- five spots ahead of Christian McCaffrey.

There is precedent for what Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter are doing. But there is no precedent for what Hunter is doing all by himself.

Michael: The short answer is no. Given what Hunter is doing on both sides of the ball this season, it's extremely difficult -- and perhaps impossible -- to find another duo that is influencing the outcome of games the way he and Sanders are this season. As a wide receiver, Hunter ranks fourth nationally in receptions (37), sixth nationally in receiving yards (472) and is tied for fifth nationally in receiving touchdowns (five) while logging 259 snaps. As a cornerback, he has allowed 11 receptions for 75 yards, zero touchdowns and an NFL passer rating of 59.2 in 265 snaps. He has also tallied one interception and one game-clinching forced fumble in an overtime victory against Baylor last weekend. Sanders, meanwhile, ranks fourth nationally in passing yards (1,340) and is tied for seventh nationally in passing touchdowns (12) while playing behind a shoddy offensive line that is surrendering 15 quarterback pressures per game, according to Pro Football Focus. What they're doing for the Buffaloes is truly incredible.

One other historical duo worth mentioning, however, is the quarterback-running back tandem of Pat White and Steve Slaton at West Virginia, two players who became synonymous with everything the Mountaineers did on offense under head coach Rich Rodriguez. In 2006, White and Slaton were responsible for more than 79% of West Virginia's offensive touchdowns during an 11-2 campaign that ended with a No. 10 ranking in the final AP Poll. In 2007, White and Slaton were responsible for more than 70% of the team's offensive touchdowns during another 11-2 campaign that ended with a No. 6 ranking in the final AP Poll. But neither of them played defense.

Laken: Never. At least not directly in this same way. Last week's win over Baylor was the perfect encapsulation of how critical this duo is, from Sanders' Hail Mary to Hunter's forced fumble in overtime. These two always give Colorado a chance to win, no matter what.

With Kansas State suffering a 29-point loss to BYU in Week 3 and Utah beating Oklahoma State on the road without Cam Rising, it seems like the Utes are the early-season Big 12 favorite, and then everything is wide open after that. Colorado gets Utah, Kansas State and Oklahoma State at home this season. With that, what is the ceiling for Deion Sanders' team?

Michael: It feels like the ceiling is somewhere around a 7-5 overall record which, if achieved, would send Colorado to a bowl game for the first time since 2020 and only the second time since 2007. The Buffaloes have finished .500 or better just twice since former head coach Gary Barnett was forced to resign near the end of the 2005 campaign, so even finishing 6-6 would constitute a massive achievement for head coach Deion Sanders in his second year at the helm. And with his two best players almost certainly leaving for the NFL at the end of this season -- Shedeur Sanders and Hunter will both be draft eligible in 2025 -- there's some added pressure on Sanders to reach a bowl game before they exit the program.

For as spectacular as Shedeur Sanders and Hunter have played thus far, and for as spectacular as they might be in the coming weeks and months, there are still some significant limitations on what Colorado can achieve. Despite revamping the offensive line, the Buffaloes are still tied with South Carolina and Cal for the most sacks allowed in college football (16), a pattern that threatens the health of their star quarterback. Despite adding former Ohio State running back Dallan Hayden in the transfer portal, the Buffaloes are still 130th in rushing offense at 68.8 yards per game, an inefficiency that thrusts even more of the offensive burden onto Shedeur Sanders' shoulders. And a defense that was among the worst in college football last season still ranks outside the top 75 overall despite noticeable improvements to the front seven. Those are difficult problems to overcome in a conference as balanced as this year's Big 12 seems to be. As of right now, three of Colorado's remaining eight games are against ranked opponents.

Laken: Going to a bowl game seems realistic for Colorado this year, as Deion Sanders' team is already halfway to eligibility with winnable games left on the schedule. Of course, the Buffaloes got off to a 3-0 start a year ago before losing eight of their final nine games. But this year's team is an improved group.

However, there are still issues to work out. The offensive line is a liability, just like last season, and has already given up 16 sacks in four games. Shedeur Sanders always gives you a chance to win, but his OL needs to help him out.

Aside from Hunter, the defense has struggled. Ranked No. 79 in the country, it's giving up 359.3 yards per game under new coordinator Robert Livingston. The unit will be tested this week when it goes up against undefeated UCF and the nation's No. 1 running game.

Looking ahead, the matchups don't get easier. On the bright side, the toughest remaining opponents - No. 23 Kansas State, No. 10 Utah and No. 20 Oklahoma State - are all at home. Will they win the Big 12? Probably not. But the postseason is possible.

RJ: I'm reluctant to put a number on this because I want to give that team the benefit of playing through the season and finding out just how far Shedeur Sanders and Hunter can take this program after a year of playing at the highest level of college football. With Colorado traveling to Orlando to take on an undefeated UCF team, the Buffaloes have an opportunity to earn their fourth win before October arrives, and perhaps a fifth game in a season. So, for now, let's make their ceiling five games. And then we can build a new floor if they reach the fifth.

No. 4 Alabama hosts No. 2 Georgia in a top-five showdown this weekend in Tuscaloosa. What do you expect to see in this game and should the winner of this matchup be considered as an early-season lock for the new 12-team College Football Playoff?

Laken: One of the biggest matchups in this game will be Alabama's offense vs. Georgia's defense. The Crimson Tide have a healthy offensive line with left tackle Kadyn Proctor back in the lineup, and the Bulldogs could also return defensive starters, like Warren Brinson and Mykel Williams, who have been dealing with injuries. Jalen Milroe is one of the most explosive players in the country and is effective with his arm and with his legs. He has 14 touchdowns through three games this season (eight passing, six rushing), but Georgia faced him last year in the SEC championship game (and sacked him four times) and knows what to expect.

It's still early in the season and both of these teams have challenging schedules ahead. As we know, things tend to get wild in college football, especially later in October and November. But at this point, it would be safe to assume the winner of this matchup will put itself in an ideal position to become a CFP lock.

RJ: I'd like to see the Georgia I was promised in the preseason. The team that couldn't understand how it could've been left out of the College Football Playoff after losing in the SEC title game. The one that claims to spare no quarter and ask for none as it occupied the vacuum left vacant by Nick Saban at Alabama. The one with a dozen NFL Draft picks on either side of the ball at any time and the one with more five-stars than Michelin counts chefs. I want to see Georgia dominate what many believe is one of the five best teams in the country and an arch nemesis in the era of the CFP. Show me your teeth, Dawgs.

Michael: One of the most intriguing subplots during what should be a terrific football game between two of the nation's best teams is whether an Alabama offense designed by head coach Kalen DeBoer and coordinated by Nick Sheridan can continue generating the type of field-tilting gains it has enjoyed with relative frequency during the early part of the season. The combination of a strong-armed quarterback in Jalen Milroe and a speedy receiving corps led by true freshman Ryan Williams and Washington transfer Germie Bernard means the Crimson Tide launch numerous deep passes each week. Alabama enters the showdown with Georgia tied for 10th nationally in scrimmage plays longer than 40 yards with seven and tied for 10th nationally in scrimmage plays longer than 50 yards with four. Williams, the former five-star prospect, is Milroe's primary target and leads the country in yards per reception with an incredible average of 28.5 yards. He's caught 10 passes for 285 yards and four touchdowns overall.

How that style of football translates against a Georgia defense known for its depth of talent remains to be seen. The Bulldogs lead the nation in passing defense and have surrendered a meager 91.3 yards per game through their first three contests. That includes only one pass play longer than 20 yards, only one pass play longer than 30 yards and zero pass plays longer than 40 yards. The Bulldogs are also one of just four programs that has yet to allow a passing touchdown this season, along with Minnesota, UAB and BYU. Something has to give on Saturday.

North Cascades Is America's Best National Park -- And Its Least-Visited,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lauraannaparker/2024/09/25/north-cascades-is-americas-best-national-park-and-its-least-visited/,2024-09-25T21:47:35Z,"Less than three hours from Seattle, the North Cascades is undoubtedly one of the country's most majestic mountain regions. It's also one of the least visited, for reasons that remain unclear.

In 2023, North Cascades National Park saw just over 40,000 visitors, ranking as the second least-visited national park in 48 states. Some argue the park is too remote; others say there is a distinct lack of infrastructure, hospitality options, or campgrounds.

Whatever the truth may be, there are some -- like me -- who would prefer to keep things this way. There's something to be said about visiting on the country's largest national parks at the tail end of summer, spending long, sun-filled days hiking across peaks, lakes, and rivers, and encountering only a handful of other souls.

It is, in fact, probably a miracle -- one that I am directly threatening by writing this article.

Day 1: Seattle -- > Leavenworth

Just over two hours from Seattle, our first stop is the quirky town of Leavenworth. Nestled against the eastern slopes of the Cascades, this town looks more like it belongs in the Alps than the Pacific Northwest. And that's not by accident. In the 1960s, Leavenworth underwent a dramatic transformation from a struggling logging town to a Bavarian-inspired village in an effort to boost tourism. The gamble worked -- today, it's a full-on alpine wonderland, complete with timber-framed buildings, beer gardens, and lederhosen-clad locals during festival season. It's touristy, sure, but in a way that's so unabashedly festive that you can't help but get swept up in it.

Visitors can spend their time wandering through quaint shops selling everything from German steins to handmade toys, or enjoy bratwurst and pretzels with a side of mountain views. Time your visit right, and you might catch Oktoberfest or the town's famous Christmas lights festival. For a quieter experience, the surrounding area offers scenic hikes, wine tasting, and river tubing on the Wenatchee River.

Stay: Hotel Pension Anna

If you're looking to extend the Bavarian fantasy overnight, Hotel Pension Anna is your spot. This cozy inn embraces old-world European charm with authentic décor and warm hospitality. Each room is uniquely designed, offering an intimate and traditional experience that feels straight out of southern Germany. The hearty breakfasts here are worth the stay alone, with homemade German breads, meats, and cheeses to fuel your day of adventuring.

Eat: Colchuck's

For dinner, Colchuck's is the kind of place where you'll have to make peace with the fact that you're probably going to order schnitzel -- and you're not going to regret it. This cozy spot offers Bavarian-inspired fare with a modern twist, and whether you go for the sausages or the spaetzle, you'll be dining with a view. Pro tip: pair your meal with a pint of local craft beer and act like it's the most normal thing in the world to be having a full-on German feast in the middle of Washington state.

Day 2: Leavenworth -- > Twisp

After leaving the alpine vibes of Leavenworth, our next stop is Twisp, a small town with a big personality tucked into the Methow Valley. Known for its vibrant arts scene, Twisp is home to galleries, artisan shops, and the famed Confluence Gallery, where you can find works from local artists who draw inspiration from the surrounding wilderness.

The town has a laid-back, unpretentious vibe that feels like the perfect counterbalance to the grandeur of the nearby North Cascades. If you're into local craftsmanship, don't miss the Methow Valley Farmers Market, where you can find everything from handmade jewelry to fresh produce and local honey.

Beyond its artistic side, Twisp is also a gateway to outdoor adventures. You can hike along the nearby Methow River, or cycle through some of the region's most scenic routes. Winter visitors will find this area a haven for cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. And after a day of exploring, Twisp's small collection of eateries and breweries provide a cozy spot to refuel with farm-to-table meals and craft beers, all made with the same care and creativity that defines this little town.

Stay: Casia Lodge

Set on a sprawling, 275-acre property with stunning mountain views, Casia Lodge is quiet luxury at its best. The rooms are modern and well-appointed, with rustic touches that make you feel at home. The on-site amenities here include an outdoor hot tub, a game room and private cinema, and a working horse ranch, where guests can get up-close-and-personal with the resident family of horses, including private and guided group rides around the property.

Come dinner time, the lodge's fine-dining restaurant, The Veranda, run by James Beard Award-winning Chef Jason Wilson, serves all local produce, including greens from the lodge gardens. Chef Wilson also hosts private and group culinary classes and experiences for guests. After dinner, relax on the patio with a glass of wine as the sun sets behind the mountains.

Eat: 1908 BBQ

This unassuming spot has become a local favorite for its slow-cooked meats, from pulled pork to brisket, all smoked to perfection and served with classic sides like coleslaw and cornbread. It's a casual, no-frills kind of place where you can dig into a hearty meal after a day of hiking. And don't forget to save room for dessert -- these guys make their own crazy concoctions, like a giant, salty smoked rice krispie square which I am not ashamed to admit I happily munched on for days. (And contemplated going back to get a second one.)

The hike to Cutthroat Lake offers a peaceful escape into the heart of the North Cascades' rugged beauty. This moderately easy trail winds through alpine meadows and dense forests, all while surrounding you with towering peaks that seem to get closer with every step. The final reward is Cutthroat Lake itself -- a serene, glassy oasis tucked beneath jagged ridgelines, perfect for a reflective moment or a quiet picnic. It's a less crowded trail, making it ideal for anyone looking to experience the park's tranquility without too much foot traffic.

Blue Lake Trail

For a bit more elevation gain, the Blue Lake Trail delivers in spades. This moderately challenging hike takes you through ancient forests and vibrant wildflower meadows before opening up to breathtaking views of the North Cascades' rugged spires. When you reach Blue Lake, its crystal-clear waters reflecting the dramatic surrounding peaks will make the two-hour steady climb more than worth it. This trail is popular, but its stunning scenery and rewarding finish make it one of the must-do hikes in the park.

Rainy Lake

If you're looking for something short and sweet, the Rainy Lake Trail is an easy, paved path that takes you to one of the park's most scenic alpine lakes. Despite its accessibility, the views here are nothing short of spectacular. The trail ends at a picturesque boardwalk that overlooks Rainy Lake, framed by dense forests and steep cliffs, with waterfalls cascading down the rocky slopes in the distance. It's a perfect spot for a peaceful, scenic break without breaking too much of a sweat.

Cedar Creek Trail

This moderate trail winds through lush forests and along the banks of Cedar Creek, with occasional glimpses of distant peaks that hint at the grandeur to come. As you climb higher, the trail opens up to stunning views of surrounding mountains and valleys, offering the perfect reward for your efforts. Wildflowers dot the trail in the warmer months, and if you're lucky, you might even spot some wildlife along the way.

Eat: Meza

Located in downtown Winthrop, Meza is woman-owned, family-run business, serving up an array of flavorful small plates, from perfectly charred octopus to classic patatas bravas. Each dish highlights fresh, locally sourced ingredients and Mediterranean flair. The wine list is packed with Spanish favorites and the cozy, inviting space is the perfect spot for a post-hike (or post-ski) lunch, dinner, or happy hour.

Perched on top of a hill with sweeping views of the valley below, Lone Point Cellars is the perfect spot to unwind after a day of hiking. This family-owned winery offers a laid-back atmosphere where you can sip on locally produced wines while soaking in the serene landscape. Whether you're a fan of crisp whites or bold reds, the tasting menu has something for every palate, and the sunsets here are nothing short of spectacular.

Fort Okanogan Tribal Interpretive Center

For a deeper connection to the region's history and culture, Fort Okanogan Tribal Interpretive Center along the Columbia River tells the story of the area's Indigenous tribes and their relationship with the land through captivating exhibits and artifacts. You'll learn about the rich cultural heritage of the Colville Tribes, whose deep roots in the area predate European settlers by thousands of years.

Cedarbrook Lodge

If you're looking to extend your trip and unwind in comfort, Cedarbrook Lodge offers a luxurious retreat adjacent to Seattle's SeaTac airport. Surrounded by lush greenery, this lodge blends modern amenities with natural beauty, offering a serene space to recharge after days of adventuring. The rooms are spacious and cozy, and the on-site spa is the perfect place to soothe any post-hike aches. Plus, the lodge's farm-to-table restaurant, Copperleaf, serves up seasonal dishes that highlight the best of Pacific Northwest cuisine, making it a great way to end your road trip (i.e. indulge away!)"
Kate Winslet Says Biopic 'Lee' Had To Be As Authentic As Possible,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonthompson/2024/09/25/kate-winslet-says-biopic-lee-had-to-be-as-authentic-as-possible/,2024-09-25T21:38:22Z,"""There was no movie magic on this. We were really doing it,"" explains Kate Winslet as we discuss her latest film, Lee. ""It had to feel real.""

The biopic focuses on the life and work of pioneering American photographer Lee Miller. She was a fashion model who became an acclaimed war correspondent for Vogue magazine during World War II. Winslet, also a producer on the project, plays Miller, who captures both the humanity and shocking inhumanity she encountered during the conflict. Many of her iconic photographs are painstakingly recreated in the film.

""We were guided by Lee's images. Every time we include a real image of hers in the film, we absolutely staged our shots that way. We were in charge of creating our own narrative around how those images came to be taken, how she got herself into those situations, what the experience was like for her, and the connections she formed with people,"" the actress recalls. ""There's a scene where Lee's taking the photograph of a collaborator having her head shaved and being shamed publicly in the streets of Saint-Malo. When you look at the images of those poor women, they look into her eyes. She was so extraordinary at forming connections with people where she could see into their soul, and that's where she was so utterly unique.""

""It was important that we honored what her experience was when she was capturing those images,"" she continues. ""How on earth did she have the courage to climb up and into a train carriage, stand amongst the corpses, and photograph the faces of the young, healthy-looking soldiers staring in, but she did that. We had to do whatever we needed to do to replicate exactly what she photographed. In doing so, there were many challenges, as you would imagine, and anyone who has done any work on the Holocaust or has experienced researching it, looking at those images, knows that there are things that stick to you. That happened, but it was unavoidable if we were going to truly honor this woman and the phenomenal work that she did. Lee wanted to make sure those stories were not lost and forgotten, that they were told and shown to the world.""

In order to maintain authenticity, Winslet immersed herself in Miller's legacy and was given full access to the archive at Farleys House in East Sussex, England, where Lee lived and subsequently died.

""Her son, Anthony Penrose, was a pivotal part of the process for me,"" she says. ""He was by my side as a collaborative partner, and he gave me real access to who she was behind everything, including all the available literature written about her. The more I got to know him, the more he shared about his relationship with her and who she was between the cracks."" Josh O'Connor plays Penrose in Lee which lands exclusively in theaters on Friday, September 27, 2024.

Something else Winslet did was learn how to use Miller's trademark Rolleiflex camera.

""I had to learn to use it incredibly well,"" she enthuses. ""I was taking photographs of everything we were shooting as we were within scenes, recreating those images. It had to feel like an extension of my arms. It could not feel like a prop. I had to be able to do it without looking, and I had to know every single part of it. I practiced for weeks with my eyes closed so that I would know how to do that. I was the only person who could change the film in the camera. It's quite a complicated thing to do in a Rolleiflex, and that was great because it meant that if I ran out of film during a take, I would just change the film within the take, and we would carry on shooting. It just had to become a part of me in the way the Rolleiflex was a part of who Lee Miller was.""

The Sense and Sensibility and Heavenly Creatures star carried that into her everyday life long after Lee wrapped.

""I didn't really put it down. I still have it, Winslet confirms. ""I photograph my family with it and other things and people. It's a wonderful, wonderful camera to know how to use, and I wasn't familiar with the camera at all, but I'm not overly familiar, or even necessarily comfortable, with operating contemporary cameras. I love everything about the eccentricities of that Rolleiflex, and I don't know if I'd ever really want to learn how to use a proper, modern camera. It has been a really wonderful thing to have come into my life.""

Lee boasts an incredible ensemble cast that also includes Marion Cotillard, Andrea Riseborough, Alexander Skarsgård, and Andy Samberg in his first dramatic role as American photojournalist David E. Scherman, who teamed up with Miller for several assignments and took the iconic photo of her in the bathtub of Adolf Hitler's apartment in Munich.

""He looks like him,"" Winslet enthuses. ""He looks almost exactly like him. It was one of our writers, Marion Hume, whom I've known since I was 16. She called me and said, 'Have you ever noticed how much Andy Samberg looks like Davy Scherman?' I thought, 'Actually, my God, he really does.' She said, 'You should ask him to play the part,' I thought, 'My God. Well, first of all, he might not want to. Secondly, he's got to read the script and see if he even likes it, and thirdly, would he be comfortable making that jump from comedic performing to something more serious?' I was so lucky. He said yes, and he could do it.""

""Andy was so still. Sometimes, he would say, 'Okay, Winslet, what do we do?' and I would say, 'Trust me. Do nothing with your face.' There were some moments where just doing nothing and letting the story support the scene. He had to really learn to trust that because, as a comedian, you're pushing everything, plot, gags, propelling the story forward. It was a totally different rhythm that he truly had to learn, and he just did it. Andy was absolutely incredible, and we became very close. We had a relationship that was very jovial offset, like Lee and Davey. David was always ragging her, teasing her, and pointing out her faults and flaws, and we had a little bit of that, which was fantastic.""

Lee sees Winslet, who is no stranger to garnering acclaim for performances in films and TV shows such as Titanic, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Mildred Pierce, and Mare of Easttown, give her second stellar turn of the year, the other being as Chancellor Elena Vernham in the HBO political satire The Regime. The characters are polar opposites: Lee seeks to show the people the truth, and Vernham sells lies.

""Lee came first, so we filmed this from September to December 2022, and then we delayed the release because of the strike,"" she explains. ""I really wanted so passionately to be able to talk about it as I am now. I look back on it and I just think I must have been mad. I only had seven weeks between wrapping Lee and starting shooting The Regime, so it was quite a leap. I'm sure, subconsciously, maybe a part of myself thought, 'Okay, if I just do the opposite of what I've felt and been experiencing on Lee, maybe that will be a good thing for my brain?' I have no idea, but you're absolutely right about completely opposing roles. It sometimes happens that way.""

Right out of the gate in Lee, and without being reductive, Miller's awareness of what makes her who she is and what she brings to the table is set out with the line ""I was good at drinking, having sex and taking pictures.""

""You're absolutely right that she lived life full throttle, being exactly who she was, making no apology for that, and I think a lot of that came from a certain degree of defiance after what had happened to her as a child,"" Winslet says. When Miller was seven years old, she was raped by a family friend while visiting relatives. ""That level of trauma made her so determined not to be defined by that horrific event. As such, I think she was able to see the world differently, to look into the eyes of humanity and see evil where it lurked and extreme beauty wherever she found it. She didn't judge people. She believed in revealing the truth and subsequently being truthful about herself to herself. It's quite amazing.""

Understanding Miller's lens, having spent so much time learning about her life and legacy, and with the Rolleiflex now becoming an extension of herself, Winslet has still yet to take the next step and direct something. Is that in her future?

""Not yet,"" she says with a smile, a vocal inflection almost like a question mark, and a pause. ""Bye!"""
Maryland woman gets prison sentence for conspiring to take out Baltimore power grid,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/maryland-woman-prison-sentence-conspiring-take-out-baltimore-power-grid,2024-09-25T21:19:59Z,"Actor Dennis Quaid and producer David Tice discuss their new documentary, 'Grid Down, Power Up,' which explores what would happen if all of the power in the U.S. went out on 'Hannity.'

A Catonsville, Maryland man was sentenced to prison on Wednesday after she conspired to damage or destroy electrical facilities near Baltimore, Maryland, which she and a co-conspirator planned to execute for white supremacist reasons intended to break down society.

The Department of Justice (DOJ) said 36-year-old Sarah Beth Clendaniel was sentenced to 18 years behind bars followed by supervised release for the rest of her life, after she pleaded guilty earlier this year to conspiracy. Her co-conspirator, Brandon C. Russell of Florida, also faces charges of conspiracy to damage or destroy electrical facilities in Maryland and is awaiting trial.

""Those who seek to attack our country's critical infrastructure will face the full force of the U.S. Department of Justice,"" Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said. ""Sarah Beth Clendaniel sought to 'completely destroy' the city of Baltimore by targeting five power substations as a means of furthering her violent white supremacist ideology. She will now spend the next 18 years in federal prison. The Justice Department will continue to aggressively counter, disrupt, and prosecute those who seek to launch these kinds of hate-fueled attacks that target our critical infrastructure, endanger entire cities, and threaten our national security.""

Clendaniel and Russell became acquainted with each other in 2018, and both advocated the white supremacist ideology of ""accelerationism."" The concept is based on the white supremacist believing that the current system is irreparable and without a political solution. Therefore, violent action is required to spawn a government collapse, the DOJ explained.

MARYLAND WOMAN PLEADS GUILTY TO CONSPIRACY IN ALLEGED EXTREMIST PLOT TO ATTACK BALTIMORE POWER GRID

Between December 2022 and February 2023, Clendaniel, Russell and others allegedly planned to attack energy facilities in the Baltimore region to disrupt the distribution of electricity to the city.

When Clendaniel pleaded guilty, she admitted to communicating and planning to carry out the attacks on energy facilities, using encrypted communication applications.

Both Clendaniel and Russell allegedly told a confidential human source (CHS-1) of their plans to attack the Baltimore power grid, the DOJ said. Plans began to come together on Jan. 12, 2023, when CHS-1 and Russell discussed the attack, which involved hitting multiple substations at the same time.

FBI ARRESTS MAN, WOMAN WITH 'EXTREMIST' VIEWS IN ALLEGED POWER GRID ATTACK PLOT TARGETING 5 SUBSTATIONS

Clendaniel used the screen name ""Nythra88"" to send a message to CHS-1, confirming that she supported the attack.

Clendaniel told the source she lived near Baltimore, that she was a felon, and unsuccessfully tried to obtain a rifle. Clendaniel asked CHS-1 to purchase a rifle for her within the next couple of weeks to ""accomplish something worthwhile.""

Throughout the conversations, Clendaniel told the source she had identified a few possible locations to target, adding the source would have to be the driver while she would be the shooter.

On Jan. 29, 2023, Clendaniel told the source she planned to target five substations, including Norrisville, Reisterstown, and Perry Hall, the DOJ said. She described how there was a ""ring"" around the city of Baltimore, and if they hit several of the substations in the same day, they ""would completely destroy this whole city.""

The substations Clendaniel planned to take out were what she called ""cores,"" saying a ""good four or five shots through the center of them"" should ""destroy those cores, not just leak the oil...""

""It would probably permanently completely lay this city to waste if we could do that successfully,"" Clendaniel allegedly told the confidential source.

BALTIMORE POWER GRID ATTACK SUSPECT HAD 'WISH LIST OF GUNS, SOUGHT TO 'COMPLETELY DESTROY THIS WHOLE CITY'

The DOJ also said that during the conversation between Clendaniel and the confidential source, Clendaniel sent five links to the ""Open Infrastructure Map,"" showing the locations of five specific Baltimore, Gas and Electric (BGE) electric substations. BGE utilizes substations like those targeted by Clendaniel, to produce and distribute energy.

While three of the five substations were in Norrisville, Reisterstown and Perry Hall, the other two were in Baltimore City.

The DOJ claims Russell and Clendaniel were under the belief that taking out these five substations would serve as ""accelerationism"" and help break down society.

Law enforcement officials executed a search warrant at Clendaniel's residence on Feb. 23, 2023, and ultimately recovered various firearms and hundreds of rounds of ammunition.

Since Clendaniel is a convicted felon for robbery in 2006 and attempted robbery in 2016, she is unlawfully permitted to possess firearms.

Opinion | Ellen DeGeneres' Netflix special exposes a pain she can't seem to shake,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/ellen-degeneres-netflix-special-disjointed-work-meta-art-rcna172739,2024-09-25T20:52:17Z,"Ellen Degeneres says she doesn't care what people think. Her new Netflix special proves otherwise.

""When you're a public figure,"" sighed Ellen DeGeneres in ""For Your Approval,"" her new Netflix special, ""you're open to everyone's interpretation."" The comedian was reflecting on the radical and somewhat savage reinterpretation of her image after allegations of ""racism, fear, and intimidation"" on the set of ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" were published by BuzzFeed in 2020. She went from being beloved (or is that pronounced belove-ED? she asks repeatedly), to being, arguably, ""the most hated person in America.""

Amid long and amusing bits about how strange it is that magicians are asked to entertain dementia patients in nursing homes, DeGeneres spends a good deal of time in what she calls her ""farewell"" performance processing her newfound infamy. The result is a somewhat disjointed, confusing work of meta-art. Still, ""For Your Approval"" raises valid questions about the intersection of celebrity, gender, mental health and ravenous Twitter mobs.

Questions like: How does an artist truly feel about being canceled? Is Ellen really sorry about what she allegedly subjected others to? Or, does she just wish Americans would be less sexist, less naive about their idols and grow the eff up?

Given that she's been canceled twice -- once involving her show ""Ellen"" and once involving the Ellen DeGeneres of flesh and blood -- she clearly has some perspective to share. Her first cancellation occurred after she came out in 1997 on her sitcom (and slightly before that in real life). She watched her show promptly get a parental advisory and then being canceled. When Oprah Winfrey interviewed her about coming out, death threats and bomb scares ensued. Americans needed to grow the eff up.

In 2003, she rebounded mightily with the launch of ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show."" For most of its 19-year run, the seemingly sunshine-y host basked in fame, good vibes, good ratings, great wealth and the love of a large and loyal fan base. They supported her as she playfully pranked her beautiful guests, danced with her merry audiences and exhorted her followers to be kind.

She was, as she explained in her prelapsarian 2018 special ""Relatable,"" the ""be-kind girl."" Everyone loved her and believed Stage Ellen and Real Ellen were one and the same. During her mammograms, she quipped, fans would drop by and ask her if she could dance for them.

Then came three stories that prompted her second cancellation. There was a 2018 New York Times profile aptly titled ""Ellen DeGeneres is Not As Nice as You Think."" Next came a 2019 interview with Dakota Johnson about, yes, DeGeneres snubbing Johnson's birthday party. Then came that 2020 exposé in BuzzFeed that accused her of overseeing a toxic work culture. That blew her image to shreds. Suddenly, the ""be-kind girl"" was reinterpreted.

The allegations were many: She was abusive to her staff (especially her Black staff), guests, celebrities, waiters, etc. The Dakota Johnson dustup revealed that Ellen, who was virtual LGBTQ royalty, had skipped Johnson's birthday party to hang out with former President George W. Bush, who'd so doggedly opposed same-sex marriage.

Smelling blood, the internet, that instrument of swift vigilantism, got to work reframing Ellen's narrative. Remember that time she made Taylor Swift cry? Or that time she mocked Sofia Vegara's English? How about the short-skirt shaming of Johnson? Earlier whisperings and blind items were recontextualized, and not in ways that made Ellen look good.

DeGeneres works through a lot of this pain in ""For Your Approval."" Except when she doesn't. There are stand-alone bits that have nothing to do with her travails. She recounts how she rescued a soaked dog who didn't need rescuing. To wit, she kidnapped someone's pet who was just minding its own business after a bath.

How this observational material relates to the rest of the set is not entirely clear. What is clear is that DeGeneres is reflecting deeply on her ordeal. She's in therapy to deal with the hatred. She's no longer using Botox and fillers. She feels judged when she dines out. She's gardening to pass the time of day.

Near the end of a set that subtly reminds us that being a woman in entertainment, especially a gay woman, isn't easy, the audience gives her its thunderous and extended applause when she asserts, ""I'm a strong woman.""

But even after this moment of exultation and apparent resolution, DeGeneres returns to the pain that she can't shake. ""I've spent an entire lifetime,"" she sighs as her audience sits back down, ""trying to make people happy, and I've cared far too much what other people think of me. So the thought of anyone thinking I was mean was devastating to me."" Caring too much about what people think is precisely what's tanking her mental health, she says. So she's done with all that! Finished (rapturous applause)!

Then she claws it back: ""But if I'm being honest ... and I have a choice of people remembering me as someone who is mean or who is beloved. Belove-ED? ... I'd choose that"" (more rapturous applause).

She doesn't care what people think. Except she does care. Their contempt inflicts tremendous pain. But no, it doesn't. She's past it all. But she clearly isn't. All of this emotional toggling may be contradictory, but that's also what makes it feel authentic.

It also warns Twitter mobs to mob more intelligently. Not that such a corrective could ever occur. So maybe the proper corrective is for fans and haters alike to never, ever become part of a Twitter mob? It's time to grow up.

""I used to say,"" she explains, ""I didn't care about what people thought of me, but I said that at the height of my popularity."" Now that she's older, she's more reflective. Being more reflective, of course, doesn't necessarily resolve a dilemma, it just clarifies what the dilemma is. In this case, the dilemma is that the critique hurts her. It always will, even though she wishes it wouldn't. The clarification is the resolution."
Harris surrogate Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo says we should 'extinguish' Trump 'for good',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-surrogate-secretary-commerce-gina-raimondo-says-we-should-extinguish-trump-good,2024-09-25T20:03:18Z,"U.S. Secretary of Commerce and Harris surrogate Gina Raimondo slammed Trump's comments about being a 'protector' of women in an interview on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe.'

Harris surrogate and President Biden's Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo called for Trump to be extinguished ""for good"" during an interview on Wednesday, less than two weeks after the second attempt on his life.

In an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" Raimondo attacked former President Trump's policy positions, saying that she felt compelled to speak out in her personal capacity before the election because ""the stakes are so high."" The discussion took a turn when Host Mika Brzezinski asked Raimondo about Trump calling himself a ""protector"" of women at his rally in Pennsylvania earlier this week.

""I don't know how we have gotten here, but we sure as hell have to get out of here and get Kamala in the White House,"" Raimondo replied. ""I'm a woman. I have a 20-year-old daughter. When I read that, when I saw the protector, it is enraging, it is blood-curdling and it is BS. Not only is it wrong and a lie, it belittles us. We're not that stupid. We know he's lying. And we don't need his baloney telling us he'll protect us. We know the facts of how he feels about women...""

""It's just another lie. How did we get here? Let's extinguish him for good,"" she added. ""We have an answer, we have a remarkably talented candidate who is sincere, pragmatic, open. Let's just get it done.""

Brzezinski seemingly understood the severity of Raimondo's comment in the moment, offering her a chance to clarify what she meant.

""You mean vote him out?"" she said.

""Vote him out, banish him from American politics,"" Raimondo replied. ""Yes, just vote him out so he goes away.""

Trump has blamed the ""rhetoric"" from Democrats for causing him to be ""shot at,"" telling Fox News Digital that the suspected gunman in the second assassination attempt ""acted"" on ""highly inflammatory language"" from the left.

TRUMP BRIEFED ON 'REAL AND SPECIFIC THREATS' BY IRAN TO ASSASSINATE HIM, CAMPAIGN SAYS

Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung scolded Raimondo for using the word ""extinguished,"" a day after revealing that Trump was briefed on ""real and specific threats"" from Iran to assassinate him.

""SICK & TWISTED: Kamala surrogate and high-ranking U.S. [sic] government official @GinaRaimondo is demanding President Trump be... 'EXTINGUISHED FOR GOOD.' She just advertised a bounty to be put on him. She is no better than the Iranian terrorists,"" Cheung wrote on X.

Ryan Wesley Routh, the suspect in Trump's second foiled assassination attempt, previously echoed Biden and Harris' anti-Trump comments, that ""Democracy is on the ballot"" on his social media pages this year, and that Democrats ""cannot lose.""

Routh posted about politics often and donated to only Democratic candidates and causes.

Democrats, meanwhile, have repeatedly blamed Trump for raising the temperature and have accused him of being a ""threat to democracy,"" particularly due to his handling of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.

Police say the suspect shot at least one person before holding the driver at gunpoint and forcing him to drive northbound. During the initial stages of the hijacking, other passengers were seen exiting the bus, police say.

The LAPD's SWAT team eventually stopped the bus at 2:05 a.m. in the vicinity of South Alameda Street and 6th Street, about six miles northeast of where the initial hijacking took place.

Police deployed spike strips to slow it down and it eventually came to a stop before the suspect barricaded himself in the vehicle.

Trump has adopted the creepy rhetoric of pickup artists to woo women voters,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-protector-women-pickup-artists-rhetoric-rcna172681,2024-09-25T19:38:48Z,"It's a big red flag that Donald Trump's ""protector"" line sounds like the misogynistic ""pickup artists"" who are popular in the MAGA movement.

Former President Donald Trump's paternalistic remark about his intention to be a ""protector"" for women -- who he claimed are lonely, stressed, depressed and unhappy -- has garnered predictable backlash since the weekend.

""You will no longer be abandoned, lonely or scared. You will no longer be in danger. ... You will no longer have anxiety from all of the problems our country has today,"" Trump said. ""You will be protected, and I will be your protector.""

Trump made the context for those assurances crystal clear when he added that women will ""no longer be thinking about abortion"" if he's elected. New York magazine's Jonathan Chait had an insightful analogy when he compared the comment to ""creepy abuser logic.""

Chait is spot-on, and when I heard Trump's comments, they reminded me of the pickup artists who've become popular in the MAGA movement. These characters are men who market themselves as tutors for men who want to learn how to attract women. Their tactics usually rely on infantilizing women and their desires, promoting the idea that men need to police women's behavior, and, oddly enough, using insults (known as negging) to manipulate women's affection. It's misogynistic stuff.

And Trump's well-documented spiritual alignment with this community has been ongoing for years, most notably when Esquire asked in 2016 if Trump was ""the World's Greatest Pickup Artist."" But more links between Trump and pickup artists have become apparent in recent years.

Zak Folkman, a business partner in Trump's latest cryptocurrency scheme, is a controversial pickup artist whose courses purportedly teach men how to ""Become the Ultimate Alpha Male."" Wired recently reported on the ways in which Trump's rhetoric mirrors notorious pickup artist Andrew Tate's. Another pickup artist, Tariq Nasheed, is known for peddling pro-Trump propaganda and leads the MAGA-friendly group Foundational Black Americans, which works to pit Black Americans against immigrants. Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, also has plenty of ties to the ""manosphere,"" a group of misogynistic content creators that includes several self-styled pickup artists. And back in 2021, Jezebel noted a pair of pickup artists who appeared at the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection.

Indeed, Trump's portrayal of himself as some kind of superhero who can solve every single American woman's problems is emblematic of a broader movement of misogynistic men who see women as meek targets for their manipulation.

"Georgia doctors speak out to challenge misinformation on state's abortion law, death of Amber Thurman",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-doctors-speak-out-challenge-misinformation-states-abortion-law-death-amber-thurman,2024-09-25T18:10:39Z,"EXCLUSIVE: Two Georgia lawmakers who are also doctors experienced in emergency medicine are speaking out against what they say is media ""fearmongering"" about the Peach State's abortion laws in light of recent reporting on the tragic deaths of two women from the state.

ProPublica's reporting on the death of Amber Nicole Thurman last week sparked controversy over Georgia's heartbeat law, which states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

Thurman died in Georgia after taking abortion pills and suffering complications. According to ProPublica reporting, doctors at Piedmont Henry Hospital waited a prolonged period of time before performing the necessary dilation and curettage (D&C) procedure to remove the dead fetus, which is not an abortion, out of reportedly being in fear of facing legal backlash due to the state's abortion law.

HARRIS CALLS FOR ELIMINATING FILIBUSTER TO PASS 'ROE' ABORTION BILL INTO FEDERAL LAW

But Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., and state Rep. Mark Newton don't believe the law had anything to do with Thurman's death, but rather the complications allegedly caused by the abortion pills, as doctors may have waited too long to intercede.

""We never deny a woman an abortion because it's going to harm her in some way. She will always be protected,"" McCormick, who previously served as emergency department head in a Navy deployment in Afghanistan, said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

""You have every right to an abortion, even with that heartbeat law,"" he continued. ""So, let's make that very clear right now. When they say there's no exceptions, there's never any law in any state where there's no exceptions. That doesn't exist. That's simply not the way it works. The mother's life is always protected. With that said, it doesn't mean it's easy to get an abortion just because you have a complication or because something goes wrong.""

Once a baby's heart has stopped, McCormick said, there are no restrictions on performing a D&C to ensure the safety of the mother.

NEW POLL INDICATES WHETHER HARRIS OR TRUMP HAS THE EDGE IN THIS KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE

""In my understanding, is, this baby was already in demise. There was no reason that it had anything to do with whether she could have a D&C or not. That's actually irrelevant to the baby's life because the baby's already gone,"" McCormick said. ""If the heartbeat stopped it's not about this law. Remember, it has nothing to do with this law at that point. It has everything to do with doing the best care for the woman.""

Newton, a board-certified emergency physician, added that there are complex decisions doctors face regarding the risks of surgery versus the risks of not performing it, especially in life-threatening emergencies.

""I do not think there's anything in Georgia's law, unless someone had a complete misunderstanding or just failed to be aware of what Georgia's law was, has nothing to do with the timing of the decision-making,"" Newton said. ""This situation in which the woman presented was clearly a medical or a life-threatening emergency""

Georgia's law should not affect the timing of medical decisions, he said, adding that cases involving septic shock due to complications from a miscarriage or abortion present high mortality risks, and physicians often have to make quick decisions to stabilize patients for surgery, which typically happens immediately in emergency situations.

DEMS LOOK TO FORCE VOTES ON EMERGENCY ABORTION AS ABORTION PILL DEATHS MAKE HEADLINES

Democrats and pro-choice advocates have since blamed so-called ""abortion bans"" for the cause of the two deaths and are seeking to force votes on abortion-related bills on Capitol Hill.

The advocacy group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America released a six-figure ad on Tuesday ""calling out Vice President Kamala Harris and pro-abortion Democrats for spreading misinformation"" relating to the fatalities.

'The Curse Of Cash' Makes Case For A World Without Paper Money,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2016/09/01/492288888/the-curse-of-cash-makes-case-for-a-world-without-paper-money,2024-09-25T18:02:21Z,"NPR's Robert Siegel talks with Kenneth Rogoff about his latest book, The Curse of Cash, in which he argues advanced economies should slowly phase out most paper currency.

How much cash do you have in your wallet right now - $50, $100? How about $4,200? That is not a random number. Actually, $4,200 is the average amount of cash in circulation for every man, woman and child in the United States. So why is your wallet so light?

Well, here's another number that comes from economist Kenneth Rogoff's new book. Eighty percent - nearly 80 percent of the cash in circulation is in 100-dollar bills. And maybe those 42 Benjamins are in the wall safe or under your mattress. Is this a problem?

Well, considering that Kenneth Rogoff's book is called ""The Curse Of Cash,"" he obviously thinks it is. His book is an argument for phasing out cash or at least most of it. And Ken Rogoff joins us now. Welcome to the program once again.

SIEGEL: Your book documents that this huge share of cash being in high-denomination bills isn't just an American phenomenon. It's true of the euro, the pound, the Swiss franc. What does all this tell you?

ROGOFF: Well, I think that a lot of the money - these big bills - is used to facilitate tax evasion and crime. We all use cash in our everyday life, but we don't use hundred-dollar bills. We're not using 500-euro notes. And yet these account for mountains of cash out there. I think they're being used in tax evasion and by criminals of all types.

SIEGEL: Tax evasion, as in hiding the receipts from the business, but also perhaps paying the household helper without paying Social Security tax on it?

ROGOFF: Exactly. I mean, the Internal Revenue Service thinks that they're losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year from cash and businesses hiding the receipts, exactly as you say. And a lot of people pay their household help without paying Social Security - that sort of thing. And it adds up.

SIEGEL: People paying immigrants who enter the country illegally?

ROGOFF: Well, that, too. I mean, you know, if you didn't have employers able to pay off the books and off the record safely in cash, you wouldn't have illegal immigration on nearly the scale that we do.

SIEGEL: So if this is a problem, describe your solution to it.

ROGOFF: So what I propose is very slowly phasing out the larger bills - the hundreds, the 50s, eventually even the 20s - over say 10 to 20 years and leaving, you know, $10 and below so that people who do every day transactions - and lots of surveys and studies show that most legal, tax-compliant transactions are pretty small. And yet making it difficult to run a wholesale business with cash. Cash is very easy to hide. It's easy to hoard. It's easy to move, especially these large bills. And so I'm trying to find a middle ground.

SIEGEL: What about poor people - people who don't have bank accounts?

ROGOFF: That's one of the most important things to take into account. And so my proposal not only calls for leaving around the $10 bills, but in providing for financial inclusion by giving free debit accounts to low-income individuals. The Nordic countries have done this. A lot of countries have. It doesn't cost much, but that's something absolutely you have to pay attention to.

SIEGEL: You argue that if we phased out the big bills, there would presumably be more tax compliance in the U.S., and the government would realize more revenue. The government also loses money in that case if it doesn't make money, as you describe. Creating cash is a profitable activity for the government.

ROGOFF: It is. So central banks do make a lot of money printing money. You know, it ranges depending on how you calculate it from 30 to, say, $70 billion a year, but tax evasion is on the order of 500 billion for the federal government. So if you could cut tax evasion by 10 percent, you know, you'd get the high end of those estimates and at the same time, you know, be putting a blow against crime.

SIEGEL: You know, in the book, as you enumerate the various illicit or tax-evading activities in which cash makes them possible, I thought, yeah, we should be getting taxes on those things, or they shouldn't be done. You do, though, eventually find, at least in me, of some latent libertarian nerve that says wait a minute. Then must every transaction that we do - must it be somewhere digitally on the record for the government to examine and check? It's a tough sell.

ROGOFF: Fair enough, but I'm leaving around the $10 bill, so what kind of transactions are we talking about? If you want to do one to $2,000, that's really no problem. Should you be able to buy a million-dollar apartment, a $100,000 house? And you'll still be able to. You can use gold coins, uncut diamonds, other things. But should the government facilitate it? Where's the balance? That's really what the question is. I don't think it's time yet to eliminate cash, but I propose having a less-cash society, not a cashless one.

SIEGEL: Kenneth Rogoff, thanks for talking with us about it.

"Amtrak announces 'Floridian' train with 2-day route, sparking reactions on social media",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/amtrak-announces-floridian-train-2-day-route-sparking-reactions-social-media,2024-09-25T18:00:20Z,"After spending 274 days on the Royal Caribbean Ultimate World Cruise, visiting 65 countries, a woman has compiled a video to show what she experienced during her voyage.

Amtrak announced a new, temporary route on Monday, causing some social media users to question who would be willing to embark on the full journey.

""Today, we're proud to announce the launch of the Floridian! This train combines two iconic routes -- the Capitol Limited and Silver Star -- and will offer traditional dining throughout the full journey,"" Amtrak officials wrote in an X post on Monday, which was viewed 12 million times.

A map of the route shows the train beginning its journey in Chicago, heading to Washington, D.C., before continuing south to Miami, Florida. There will be one train in each direction per day, said Amtrak, and the train will consist of Amtrak's ""Viewliner"" cars.

TRAVELERS COULD FACE NEW PENALTY FOR EXCEEDING BAGGAGE LIMIT ON TRAINS

The train will make direct round-trips between ""Chicago and Miami with intermediate stops in Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Washington, D.C., Jacksonville, Orlando and Tampa""

""The Floridian offers customers an exceptional and sustainable journey to great destinations between Chicago and Miami, providing the amenities and delicious food our guests enjoy when traveling with us,"" Eliot Hamlisch, Amtrak's executive vice president and chief commercial officer, said in a press release from Amtrak.

Previously, riders on the Capitol Limited train route from D.C., to Chicago did not have a traditional dining car. Instead, the train had a less limited ""flexible dining"" option for its first-class private room passengers, says Amtrak's website.

TRAVELERS REFLECT ON VIRAL 9-MONTH-LONG WORLD CRUISE THAT TOOK OVER TIKTOK

The Floridian came about due to the East River Tunnel (ERT) Rehabilitation Project, which will ""restore the two tubes that were damaged by Superstorm Sandy,"" according to Amtrak.

""The work will modernize the tunnel infrastructure, improving safety, reliability and security and bring the systems to a state of good repair,"" said Amtrak.

Jim Mathews, president and CEO of the Rail Passengers Association, located in D.C., said the Floridian is an ""innovative solution to keeping passengers moving"" during the repair.

Amtrak previously ran a Chicago-to-Florida route from 1971 until 1979, says the website Trains.com. That train was also called the ""Floridian.""

The return of a train route connecting the Midwest to Florida has been a longtime dream of train enthusiasts, Mathews said in Amtrak's release.

""We're thrilled that a new generation of American passengers will be able to experience this service for themselves,"" said Mathews.

On X, users pointed out how the journey from Chicago to Miami on the Floridian was estimated to take 46 hours and 29 minutes - nearly two days - and some said the cost was considerably more than a flight between the two cities.

Amtrak's website lists a one-way coach ticket from Chicago to Miami priced at $466 for Nov. 10, which is the first day of service on the Floridian. But, on Nov. 12, the one-way ticket is priced lower at $113.

""Midwesterners will still be driving the 20 hours,"" said the X account ""Midwest vs. Everybody.""

""For folks out there who have flown from Miami to Chicago and thought 'I wish this took 10 times longer,' check it out,"" said another X user, who followed up with ""I like trains too, guys. Please shut up.""

""I prefer taking a train from Chicago to Miami because it is more expensive, takes longer AND is hard to sleep on,"" said another X user.

""I'd love to not fly. I hate airports, flying, turbulence, etc. But this, for a family of 4, one way... is embarrassing,"" said another X user, showing a price of $2,193.

The train ride will make several stops and last about 47 hours.

Other X users appeared to have a positive take on the announcement.

""Ya know, it still sounds more pleasant than dealing with flying though,"" one man wrote.

""Seems like a cool little trip to take over week or so,"" another user posted.

When reached for comment, a representative from Amtrak declined to say when the service would cease."
Killer mom Susan Smith brags she's well behaved behind bars in early release bid: report,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/killer-mom-susan-smith-brags-shes-well-behaved-behind-bars-early-release-bid-report,2024-09-25T16:16:50Z,"Preview 'The Shocking Story of Susan Smith' exclusively on Fox Nation.

Susan Smith, who has spent the last three decades behind bars for the drowning deaths of her two sons, reportedly plans to tout her mostly good conduct record at her first parole hearing.

""She believes she might be a free woman in less than two months,"" a relative told the New York Post. ""She's hoping that [the hearing] will go her way. She's put all her hopes in that basket, and she's manifesting her freedom.""

Smith intends to argue that she ""has a different moral compass than other people because of her trauma"" from growing up in a sexually abusive household, the relative told the Post.

""It really did a number on her,"" the relative said.

Smith also plans to argue that she was suffering from a then-undiagnosed mental illness in 1994, when she let her car roll into John D. Long Lake in South Carolina with her two sons - 3-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alexander - trapped in their car seats.

The killer mom wrote in a 2015 letter to reporters at The State that she is ""not the monster society thinks [she] is.""

""Something went very wrong that night. I was not myself,"" Smith wrote. ""There was no motive as it was not even a plan yet. I was not in my right mind.""

During her trial, a defense psychologist diagnosed the then-22-year-old with dependent personality disorder (DPD), a disorder characterized by a ""need for others to be responsible for the most important aspects of their life,"" according to the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. People with DPD have ""difficulty disagreeing with others because they fear the loss of support or approval.""

Prosecutors had said Smith was driven to kill her boys a week after her ex-boyfriend and prospective affair partner, Tom Findlay, penned a letter about her sons being an obstacle.

Smith's conduct record in prison is not unmarred - along with citations for drug possession and self-mutilation, Smith was disciplined for having sex with two prison guards in 2000.

Due to differing power dynamics, Smith has maintained that those relations were not consensual and that she was a victim. According to the New York Post, she told a friend in 2023 that she ""had sex with them because [she] felt like [she] didn't have a choice.""

Previously, one of those prison guards told NewsNation that Smith should not be released.

""Her prison record shows just that... she's not really learned anything while being in prison, except how to do illegal things other than the killing of her sons,"" Alfred Rowe said.

The family member said that Smith will argue that she has turned her life around in prison. According to prison records obtained by Fox News Digital, she has not been disciplined since 2015 and has held down a steady job behind bars.

""She's grown into a mature woman,"" the relative told the Post. ""And she thinks she can thrive outside of prison.""

David Smith, the father of Smith's slain children, intends to oppose his ex-wife's release at her parole hearing, either in a written letter or in a speech to the parole board.

""I'm going to remind them what she did and who the victims were in this case,"" he told Court TV. ""Certainly not her.""

Susan Smith and her husband appeared on national television to plead for the return of their children after Smith claimed that a Black man had carjacked her and kidnapped the boys.

However, after nine days, Smith confessed that she had drowned the boys herself.

She was convicted of murder but spared the death penalty, instead given life in prison with the possibility of parole after 30 years.

"Boxer Alycia Baumgardner Gets Riled Up About Fighting, Travel And Korean Food",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestravelguide/2024/09/25/boxer-alycia-baumgardner-gets-riled-up-about-fighting-travel-and-korean-food/,2024-09-25T15:51:47Z,"On the eve of a record-making boxing event, 'The Bomb' discusses pay equality, her favorite places in the city and where she wants to go next.

When Alycia ""The Bomb"" Baumgardner, the undisputed female super featherweight champion of the world, steps into the ring at Atlanta's Trilith Studios on September 27, she won't just battle Belgium's Delfine Persoon. She'll take a swing at boxing's gender gap.

The event will feature the largest purse bid in the World Boxing Council's history for a female bout, amounting to $500,000. But male boxers crossed that threshold decades ago.

We talked to the Las Vegas-based formidable fighter via video call about pay equality, her favorite places in the city and where she wants to go next.

Where are you right now? It looks like a sunny and lovely spot on a patio.

Yes, in Vegas it's 100 degrees, so it's doable right now. I plan to move.

You're heading to Atlanta soon to headline the all-women's card sanctioned by the World Boxing Council. Why is this match important for you?

This fight is important because of the positioning that I'm in currently and with that came a journey of events to lead me here, and I'm just happy to be in this moment to be able to defend my title, to fight a great opponent like Delfine. She is a veteran in the sport, so this fight highlights the pedigree of who she is and also the pedigree of where I'm going.

Also, the fact that it is the largest purse bid for women in the sport's history is a big deal. Why do you think pay equality continues to lag for female athletes?

It's a variety of things. Representation matters, your team matters, who's speaking for you -- these things have to be in order. And oftentimes, it is on the fighter.

As a fighter and a businesswoman, I have to make sure that I have a great team supporting me, negotiating for me and keeping the fighter first. I think sometimes we get away from not representing the fighter and the talent first, and everyone just wants to put their hands in the pot. So again, just be diligent about your circle, aware as a businesswoman and make sure you're asking the right questions.

How did you get your start in boxing?

My dad introduced boxing to me. I grew up in a small town in Ohio. We had a gym that was free for any kid to join, and it was a great opportunity for the community to come together and allow these kids to have some form of discipline and respect. Boxing taught that. Being introduced to something like that at a young age allowed me to build confidence as a young girl.

Do you have any pre-match rituals?

I would say praying. Journaling has been a really big exercise that I've done my whole life, writing down things to remember why I made it this far, the things I've been able to get through, reminders that I'm just being one with the Lord and just understanding that I'm fulfilling an assignment that is to come Friday.

You have a very rigorous workout routine, but what do you do to take care of yourself when you're traveling?

Self-care is obviously No. 1. [Regarding] health and wellness as a woman outside the ring, I'm always making sure that I'm partaking in good things for the body. Good things for the body help with things for the mental. I make sure I'm taking my vitamins daily, drinking my water -- at least a gallon a day -- journaling and getting quality sleep.

When you travel, what do you pack in your carry-on?

This is girl stuff: lip gloss, perfume, eye gel patches, eye mask, maybe even a card game -- I'll throw some Uno in there -- a journal, obviously you need a good pen. Some snacks. I always like the snacks, so that's important. And a good scarf, my bonnet.

I like to be outdoors. I was able to go to one of the mountaintops -- Mount Charleston. That's a good run to do. It's a good five-mile run up the mountain. It was nice to be in that solitude moment to be by yourself and running.

What are some of your favorite travel destinations?

I briefly went to Dubai early this year, and I thought it was an awesome country. The food was done well. The culture is great. I love Mexico because it's just a vibe there, and great food as well.

I plan to travel again after this fight, so I would love to go to Turkey. Hot-air ballooning seems like something I would like to try. It's really big there.

That's fun. Is there anywhere else you want to visit aside from Turkey?

Bali, Indonesia. I would love to go to Egypt. I'd love to travel to Japan. Korea would be an awesome spot -- my grandmother's from Korea. I'd go there just to be [immersed] in the culture. Germany is also part of my heritage. I would love to go to Germany.

When you are not in the ring, what do you like to do in your free time?

Working on my brand, my juice business, shopping, hanging with friends and family. Eating is my go-to. I love to eat.

Do you gravitate to a certain cuisine?

Anything, but recently in Vegas I eat a lot of Korean food. They have a big Asian community here.

What's a Korean restaurant you frequent in Vegas?

There is a place called Soyo. Very tasty. It was one of the first Korean spots I've tried since I've been here. And the kimchi soup tastes almost like my grandma's, so I have to give them a 10.

What do you want people to know about you?

I want to highlight what it is to be a beauty and a beast, and what it also means to not just be prejudged by how someone looks. I think oftentimes in the social media era, we look at things just from one view.

But when people get to know who this person is behind the gloves, it builds for a better story and a better opportunity for a fan to know the fighter outside the ring and it kind of tells a story, and now you know why she's super passionate about what she does, or maybe why she talks the way she does.

Do you think people make assumptions about you and they write you off in that way?

Absolutely. I feel like they write me off.

I would say I have the whole package when it comes to being in a combat sport and for me to be able to do modeling or even do speaking events. I think again people have this notion that a fighter should be a certain way, and I don't fit that criterion. So, I am written off and sometimes I'm also sexualized being in a male world, and that's also been like a struggle because you're not taken seriously.

It's just being strong in who you are as a woman and being confident. Be confident in what you know and continue that because somewhere along the way, someone's going to respect it and they're going to respect you because of the work that you put in and not because you're a woman.

What do you think is the biggest misconception people have of you?

Maybe they think I come off cocky. I'm playing this fighter and this beauty, and [people are] like, ""Oh, she just thinks she's just all that."" In reality, I'm a cool person. I'm down-to-earth. I'm very humble.

But if there's any sport that you would have to adopt that cockiness, it would be boxing. Isn't a part of boxing projecting that persona and confidence so they manifest in the ring?

No, you're completely right. You have to have confidence because, again, you're going into war, you're going into battle and you don't go into a fight thinking you're going to lose. It's something you do have to have. But some people may not understand in-depth what boxing is, what a combat sport is.

And they may just look at it from the outside, like, ""Oh, they're just fighting."" I don't typically fight like a ""girl."" I'm a complete package fighter. I can box, I can brawl. I can do many different forms of boxing. And that's what makes boxing the sweet science -- that's what they call it when you're able to look good doing it. Hit and not get hit is the name of the game. So, as a woman, it's not perceived that way. They look at women's fights as just a brawl or they're just crazy. No technique. I'm completely different. I have technique. I've been boxing since the age of eight.

You are the undisputed featherweight champion. Where do you want to go from here?

The sky's the limit. There's many things we can do. After this defense, I'll be a free agent. As I talked about having the right circle, what do negotiations look like after this fight? Do we go with another promoter? What will going with another promoter look like?

It's building the brand. I think in the social media era, it's important that people associate who you are as a brand as well, not just ""boxer."" Like, who is she outside the ring? I'm a businesswoman. I model. I do these other things. Maybe acting. There's so many other things that I'm able to do. I'm more than just an athlete."
"Sean 'Diddy' Combs May Have Firebombed Kid Cudi's Car, According To Charges",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/09/25/sean-diddy-combs-may-have-firebombed-kid-cudis-car-according-to-charges/,2024-09-25T15:40:05Z,"Prosecutors allege the embattled music mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs set fire to a car owned by an unnamed victim between December 2011 and January 2012, which mirrors an allegation his ex-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, made in her November 2023 lawsuit that Combs blew up a car owned by rapper Kid Cudi.

Ventura said in her lawsuit Combs had discovered her brief relationship with Kid Cudi during a ""freak-off"" -- which prosecutors described in their indictment as coerced, ""elaborate and produced sex performances"" in which Combs would use ""force, threats of force, and coercion, to cause victims to engage in extended sex acts with male commercial sex workers."" Ventura alleged Combs had ""demanded"" she participate in a ""freak-off"" after he returned from a trip, and she acquiesced. During the freak-off, Ventura alleged Combs found her phone and discovered e-mails that had been shared between Ventura and Kid Cudi, prompting him to lunge at her with the corkscrew. Ventura escaped and fled to Kid Cudi's home, the lawsuit states. Combs' staff contacted Ventura, who told her Combs needed to talk to her, and she returned to Combs' home, ""feeling like she could not escape Mr. Combs and his network of enforcers,"" according to the suit. Ventura alleged Combs hit her several times and kicked her in the back as she attempted to run out the door after she returned home. Ventura then fled to her parents' home in Connecticut, where her mother took pictures of the bruises Combs had allegedly inflicted on her, the suit states. Combs told Ventura while they attended Paris Fashion Week in February 2012 that he wanted to blow up Kid Cudi's car, and that he hoped that rapper and his friends would be home for the incident. After the car allegedly exploded, Ventura alleged she was ""terrified, as she began to fully comprehend what Mr. Combs was both willing and able to do to those he believed had slighted him,"" the lawsuit states.

The rapper and actor Kid Cudi, 40, won two Grammy Awards for his hit collaboration with Kanye West and Rihanna, ""All of the Lights,"" in 2012. He is known for his hit ""Man on the Moon"" album trilogy and most recently released the album ""Insano (Nitro Mega)"" in February. In film, he has appeared in ""Bill & Ted Face the Music"" (2020), ""Crisis"" (2021) and ""X"" (2022), and he has executive produced the films ""Malcolm & Marie"" (2022), ""Pearl"" (2022) and ""MaXXXine"" (2024).

Combs was arrested in Manhattan last week on charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, cause or coercion and transportation to engage in prostitution, to all of which he pleaded not guilty. The arrest follows a string of lawsuits filed against Combs, beginning with Ventura in November, accusing him of sexual assault -- all of which Combs denied. CNN published security video footage captured in a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 depicting Combs shoving Ventura to the ground and kicking her, prompting Combs to issue a video apology on his Instagram account. Combs is being held in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he reportedly shares a unit with disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.

"Slamming Harris, Joe Manchin flunks tests on history and democracy",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/slamming-harris-joe-manchin-flunks-tests-history-democracy-rcna172644,2024-09-25T15:36:49Z,"Sen. Joe Manchin insists that the Senate's filibuster rule ""is the Holy Grail of democracy."" History and reality prove otherwise.

More than two years ago, after Republican-appointed Supreme Court justices overturned Roe v. Wade, Vice President Kamala Harris endorsed restoring the rights that the jurists took away. ""If the filibuster gets in the way,"" she declared in June 2022, ""the Senate needs to make an exception to get this done.""

The Democrat's position has not changed. Indeed, the Democrat reiterated her position during an interview this week with Wisconsin Public Radio. ""I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe and get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom, and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body, and not have their government tell them what to do,"" Harris said.

Sen. Joe Manchin, who claimed to be weighing a possible endorsement of his former party's presidential ticket, expressed fresh outrage about the position Harris announced more than two years ago. The New York Times reported:

As a practical matter, Manchin walking back the possibility of a Harris endorsement is unlikely to have any meaningful impact on the race: The Democratic ticket wasn't planning to compete in the independent senator's home state of West Virginia, and it's not as if the senator, who's retiring this year, has vast influence over a huge electoral contingent.

But the merits -- or lack thereof -- of Manchin's comments are worth examining in more detail.

Part of the problem with the senator's perspective is that he appears to genuinely believe in a historical record that simply does not exist in reality.

A couple of years ago, for example, Manchin told Fox News that the filibuster has been ""the tradition of the Senate ... for 232 years."" A week earlier, after rejecting a Democratic voting-rights push, the West Virginian told reporters that he cared about the underlying issue, but he was even more committing to protecting ""the Senate as it has operated for 232 years.""

While I'll concede that debates over Senate procedures can be complex, and fair-minded observers can have competing opinions about tactics and strategies, there are elements of the debate that exist outside the realm of subjectivity. There are certain truths from U.S. history that simply exist. Opinions about them may vary, but they do not change what is demonstrably true.

And what is demonstrably true is that the filibuster did not exist when the Senate was created in 1789. When senators considered proposals, they held a debate and then voted. If a majority of members supported the measure it passed. The institution functioned this way for generations.

Adam Jentleson, a former top aide to the late Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, has flagged several quotes from the nation's Founding Fathers, noting that the Constitution's framers considered the idea of legislative supermajorities, before ultimately rejecting them. This quote from James Madison -- widely recognized as ""the father of the Constitution"" -- is of particular interest:

Alexander Hamilton agreed.

If Manchin wants to argue that the nation's founders were wrong, fine. Have at it. If the West Virginian and those who agree with him genuinely believe that the Senate's traditional model of legislating was wrong, it's preferable to require supermajorities, and restoring majority rule to the institution would be a mistake, they're welcome to make that case.

What Manchin should not do, however, is argue that his position is rooted in the Senate's institutional history. It is not.

Proponents of filibuster reform are not looking to change the Senate, so much as they're trying to restore the Senate to how it used to function.

As for the idea that the filibuster is necessary to protect democracy, I'm at a loss as to understand how the West Virginian arrived at such a conclusion. As things stand, with the routinization of filibuster abuses, Americans can put the House, Senate and White House in the hands of one party, only to find that party unable to approve popular legislation -- backed by most voters -- because of a procedural roadblock that didn't use to exist.

Manchin is apparently convinced that this procedural roadblock helps preserve democracy. He has this backward.

For his part, Donald Trump celebrated the independent senator's statement. ""Congratulations to Senator Joe Manchin for not endorsing Radical Kamala Harris because of her DEATH WISH for the Filibuster and the Rule of Law,"" the former president wrote online.

What Trump neglected to mention is that he's repeatedly called for the elimination of the Senate's filibuster rule, making his missive about Manchin that much more ridiculous."

Four of Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' children are speaking out for the first time since their father was arrested and charged with racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges, refuting ""horrific conspiracy theories"" involving their late mother, Kim Porter and a book claiming to be her own testimony.

Sons Quincy, 33 (whom Porter had with Al B Sure! and whom Combs later adopted) and Christian, 26, as well as the couple's twin daughters, Jessie and D'Lila, 17, wrote in a joint statement that they had ""seen so many hurtful and false rumors circulating"" about their parents' relationship and their mother's death in 2018.

""Claims that our mom wrote a book are simply untrue. She did not. And anyone claiming to have a manuscript is misrepresenting themselves,"" they wrote. ""Please understand that any so-called 'friend' speaking on behalf of our mom or her family is not a friend. Nor do they have her best interests at heart.""

""Our lives were shattered when we lost our mother. She was our world. And nothing has been the same since she passed. While it has been incredibly difficult to reconcile how she could be taken from us too soon. The cause of her death has long been established,"" they wrote. ""There was no foul play. Grief is a lifelong process. And we ask that everyone respect our request for peace as we continue to cope with her loss every day.""

Porter, who had been separated from Combs for several years at the time of her passing, was found dead in her home in November 2018. The Los Angeles County Coroner's Office later confirmed that she had died from lobar pneumonia.

Earlier this month, a book, ""KIM'S LOST WORDS: A journey for justice, from the other side..."" was released by publisher Chris Todd. The 59-page manuscript, allegedly written by Porter before her death, included claims of abuse and detailed depictions of her sexual encounters with Combs.

""The Kim Porter 'memoir' is fake,"" Combs' attorney, Erica Wolf, told Fox News Digital. ""It is also offensive - a shameless attempt to profit from tragedy.

Danner Introduces Women's-Specific Precision Fit Tech In Boots,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/timnewcomb/2024/09/25/danner-introduces-womens-specific-precision-fit-tech-in-boots/,2024-09-25T14:56:28Z,"In the world of footwear there's unisex sizing, which generally doesn't account for the biometric differences between a man and a woman. Then there's footwear with a last designed for women, often accounting for some of the differences between the two genders. Danner has taken it one step further, introducing Precision Fit technology, a last and entire boot design focused specifically on the needs of women. And they've made the technology's introduction in four of the brand's most popular models.

""We took our time getting Precision Fit right,"" Pam Lo, Danner product line manager, tells me about the three-year process, ""which is more refined than previous women's styles built on women-specific lasts. It really came down to when we felt confident in our research, data and prototypes to introduce the technology to the market.""

The goal all along, Lo says, was to make sure everyone could have ""great fitting boots that feel like a true extension of them.""

Lo says that unisex sizing in general overlooks the ergonomic shape differences between men and women, resulting in hotspots for women from heel slippage, tightness in the toe box and instep variations. To find what would work best, Danner studied biometric data from over 40,000 women using the brand's Aetrex 3D scanner and pressure mapping tool and paired it with four internal fit tests to locate the common problems.

During the analyzing, Lo says many of the testers found they weren't wearing the size they should. The Danner team discovered that variations in pressure points within the same size offered insight into how consumers responded to fit trials.

It all added up to major changes in the way Danner approached women's-specific design. ""The foundational change was to make the heel narrower than traditionally found in a men's or unisex fit,"" Lo says. ""Also, widening the toe box and lifting the volume to accommodate for higher insteps.""

Special consideration was given to pressure points and the spacing of the metatarsals to ensure the new Precision Fit shape has a narrower heel capture, wider width in the forefoot and a lower height increase from toes to ankle to accommodate the biometrics and shape of women's feet. The boots also have increased ankle support.

Designing specifically for women in footwear is relatively new as some major brands approach it with a different philosophy. In running, Lululemon designed for women before introducing a men's model and brands such as Asics, Altra, Adidas and Under Armour have silhouettes built on a last for women. In the trail and outdoor space Keen has a range of women's-specific designs. Danner steps it up by bringing the technology into a range of true boots.

The introduction of Precision Fit comes in four models, the Inquire Chukka, Inquire Mid, Jag and Sandy Ridge. ""We wanted to offer a variety of models that featured Precision Fit with the initial launch of the program,"" Lo says. ""We currently offer an assortment of boots that include casual boots, hikers and a work boot. It gives consumers interested in trying the fit some great options with different looks and end uses.""

It's all just a start. Danner plans to continually incorporate Precision Fit into more women's boots across hike, work and tactical ranges, part of a larger push to give women footwear fit for their feet."
London mayor urges Americans against re-electing Trump,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/london-mayor-urges-americans-against-re-electing-trump,2024-09-25T14:41:06Z,"""What I'd say in a respectful way to Americans is: I don't think you realize that the rest of the world is watching because we've got skin in the game,"" Khan reportedly said in an interview with Politico.

""What happens in America is the metronome... that sets the beat of what happens across the globe,"" Khan, who is in his third term as mayor of London, told the outlet while in New York City for the United Nations General Assembly. ""It sets the beat for how other politicians behave in an election campaign.""

Khan, a left-leaning Labour Party member, claimed that Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate accords, efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, and rhetoric about women and immigrants are dangerous, according to Politico. He encouraged Americans to consider Trump's first term.

LONDON MAYOR URGES FOREIGN LEADERS TO CONDEMN TRUMP AS RACIST, SEXIST, HOMOPHOBIC

Compared to other United Kingdom leaders, such as Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Politico said Khan could more boldly support Vice President Kamala Harris as president of the United States. Starmer became the first Labour Party member to address their annual conference as prime minister in 15 years this week, the Washington Post reported. His speech referenced a need for ""joy"" - a catchphrase promoted by the Harris campaign.

Khan, who has been engaged in public feuds with Trump in the past and has outwardly called the Republican presidential nominee a racist, a sexist and a homophobe, categorized the upcoming American election as one of significant importance. Trump has also been critical of Khan, describing the mayor in 2019 as a ""stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London.""

""Make sure you're registered to vote and make sure you vote,"" Khan told Politico this week. ""Because the election that happens on Nov. 5, in my view, is the most important election in my lifetime.""

Politico also asked Khan about some of the worst unrest the United Kingdom had seen in years following the mass knife attack in Southport this summer.

The mayor argued that British and American politicians should focus on responding to issues surrounding health care, housing and education, ""not to play on people's fears.'

""The oldest trick in the book is to blame the other,"" Khan said. ""The oldest trick in the book is to pick on one community and one minority, manufacture a situation where they're blamed for the problems.""

LONDON MAYOR PRESSED BY PIERS MORGAN IN INTERVIEW TO DEFINE 'WOMAN'

London was gripped with mass protests, arson and rioting in response to three young girls being stabbed to death during a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in the Southport neighborhood. Authorities blamed speculation online suggesting the attacker was a migrant Islamic extremist as driving ""far-right"" protests and violent clashes with the police. Nearly 1,000 people were arrested, reports say.

The July 29 knife attack left eight other children and two adults seriously injured. Authorities later identified the assailant as Axel Muganwa Rudakubana, a 17-year-old born in Cardiff to parents from Rwanda, the BBC reported. He is facing three counts of murder and 10 counts of attempted murder.

In the interview, Khan also defended Starmer, who has been mired in controversies in his first three months in office involving accepting donor gifts, slashing winter fuel allowances for retirees and low approval ratings.

""It has been tough. Of course, it's tough. Running things is tough, but I'd rather Keir Starmer make those tough calls, tough decisions, to be straight with the British people now, rather than having things being covered up and buried away,"" Khan told Politico. ""And that means sometimes making decisions that in the short term are unpopular, but leading to medium-term, long-term benefits."""
Meryl Streep: Today In Kabul A Female Cat Has More Freedom Than A Woman,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2024/09/25/meryl-streep-today-in-kabul-a-female-cat-has-more-freedom-than-a-woman/,2024-09-25T14:25:28Z,"On September 23, 2024, when speaking at a side event on ""The Inclusion of Women in the Future of Afghanistan"" at the U.N. General Assembly, Oscar-winning actress and activist Meryl Streep addressed the dire situation of women and girls in Afghanistan. As she noted, ""Today in Kabul a female cat has more freedom than a woman. A cat may go sit on her front stoop and feel the sun on her face, she may chase a squirrel in the park. A squirrel has more rights than a girl in Afghanistan today because the public parks have been closed to women and girls by the Taliban. A bird may sing in Kabul, but a girl may not in public. This is extraordinary. This is a suppression of the natural law.""

Meryl Streep's speech comes as the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan have been suppressed one by one - removing women from the public space and confining them to their homes. Following the Taliban's recapture of Kabul on August 15, 2021, the Taliban revoked the 2004 Constitution, which recognized gender equality, and shut the Ministry of Women's Affairs, replacing it with a Ministry of Promotion of Virtue and Vice, in charge of the enforcement of a strict interpretation of the Sharia law.

Since the Taliban's takeover, over a hundred edicts were issued restricting the rights of women and girls, including restricting education for girls beyond grade six (then banning all forms of education for girls beyond grade 6); instructing drivers (men) not to accept driving women without ""proper hijab"" or women without a mahram for travel more than 72 kilometers; limiting access of women and girls to parks, banning women from boarding domestic and international flights without a mahram; asking women government workers to stay home; banning all forms of education for girls beyond grade 6; suspending women from working for national and international non-governmental organizations; banning Afghan women from working in the United Nations, among others.

In August 2024, the Taliban published its new law on ""promoting virtue and eliminating vice"" that sets up rules for everyday life and adds to the litany of restrictions on women. Article 13 imposes that it is mandatory for a woman to veil her body at all times in public. A face covering is said to be essential. Women are to cover themselves in front of non-Muslim males and females. A woman's voice is deemed intimate, and as such, women are not to be heard singing, reciting, or reading aloud in public. Women are not allowed to look at men they are not related to by blood or marriage and vice versa.

Because of the omnipresent restrictions on women's rights in Afghanistan, experts have been comparing the situation to apartheid, branding the treatment of women in the country as gender apartheid. Karima Bennoune, the Lewis M. Simes Professor of Law at the University of Michigan Law School, defined gender apartheid as ""a system of governance, based on laws and/or policies, which imposes systematic segregation of women and men and may also systematically exclude women from public spaces and spheres."" As she explains, ""gender apartheid is anathema to [the] foundational norms of international law, every bit as much as racial apartheid was to the analogous principles prohibiting race discrimination. Ultimately, as racial apartheid was for Black South Africans, gender apartheid is an erasure of the humanity of women. Every aspect of female existence is controlled and scrutinized.""

In 2023, a group of Afghan and Iranian women launched an international campaign ""End Gender Apartheid Today"", calling for the codification of gender apartheid, and for the recognition of the situation of women in Afghanistan and Iran as such. The campaign received significant support globally, including by several governments. Nonetheless, the Taliban pressed on with the restrictions of women's rights and their exclusion from the society and the future of Afghanistan. The international community must remind the Taliban that Afghanistan does not have a future without women and girls, and without their rights and freedoms being restored."
A Room Of One's Own At Chateau La Coste,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/leesharrock/2024/09/25/a-room-of-ones-own-at-chateau-la-coste/,2024-09-25T14:17:48Z,"A captivating new exhibition titled Une Chambre à Soi has been unveiled in a Richard Rogers-designed architectural gem nestled on a hill overlooking the stunning Château La Coste in Provence. Château La Coste in Le Puy-Sainte-Réparade is a rare jewel in the crown of Provence, uniting contemporary art and architecture with the arts of viticulture and gastronomy on a vast 500-acre site.

More than 40 sculptures by leading artists are positioned around the Tadao Adando art centre and spread over the surrounding vineyards and forest, meaning you could spend an entire day exploring the stunning Provençal landscape covered in olive trees, ancient oak trees, cypresses and stone pines, discovering works of art en route.

Une Chambre à Soi in Château La Coste's Richard Rogers gallery is inspired by Virginia Woolfe's extended essay A Room of One's Own and features more than fifteen artists visualising a soporific journey from sunset to sunrise.

La Galerie is positioned on a hilltop amongst the trees, a cantilevered structure balancing magically on orange stilts and emitting a sense of weightlessness. The legendary architect Richard Rogers made it his life's work to explore how form follows function, making structural features visible, for example in his iconic Pompidou centre design, and sadly didn't live to see La Galerie completed.

Visitors to Une Chambre à Soi are greeted by a sign saying 'good night' and enter the gallery through a pair of dramatic dark curtains, which open to reveal a rectangular box with a glass wall revealing a breathtaking view of the vineyards. Curator Margaux Plessy has skilfully created a womb-like exhibition space with deep crimson walls to evoke the ambiance of a bedroom, and selected paintings, sculpture and installations by artists interpreting their experiences of sleep or insomnia. Plessy juxtaposes established with emerging artists to create an inter-generational dialogue. The curator's love of literature is reflected in the title Une Chambre à Soi, which inspired this visual and literary exploration of sleep and dreams, and the exhibition features quotes from some of the greatest authors of French literature.

Featured artists Etel Adnan, Kenia Almaraz Murillo, Marcella Barceló, Genesis Belanger, Bianca Bondi, Djabril Boukhenaïssi, Louise Bourgeois, Sophie Calle, Dorothy Cross, Tracey Emin, Julian Farade, Alex Foxton, Adrian Geller, Nathanaëlle Herbelin, Victoire Inchauspé, Constance Lafonta, Inès Longevial, Claudia Keep, Simon Martin, Joshua Raz, Kiki Smith, Christine Safa and Xie Lei take visitors on a journey from dawn to dusk.

Une Chambre à Soi is both surreal and humorous, a poetic embrace of the night inspired by passages from literature, veering from slumber to nightmares and giving an insight into the differing nocturnal experiences of the artists. Tracey Emin's painting Thinking More of You , of a nude woman reclining on a bed and emerging artist Claudia Keep's painting 'MARCH' represent sunset, at the start of a visual journey through dreams and nightmares through to sunrise.

Whimsical touches such as Genesis Belanger's Scrub, Spritz, Splash sculpture of cartoon-like washing basin with oversized toothpaste and toothbrush, and references to the artistic legacy of Provence in the form of Victoire Inchauspe's La nuit, le jour, la nuit bronze sunflowers evoking Van Gogh, which are exhibited beneath Louise Bourgeois' text-based series What Is the Shape of This Problem? reflecting the experience of insomnia-related anxiety.

Dorothy Cross's surreal marble sculpture of two pillows with a solitary ear resting on top of each dominates the middle of the room, with Kiki Smith's delicate silver Crescent Bird sculpture lending a sense of mystery. Julian Farade visualises a nightmare featuring a menacing beast in his painting Gardien de mes nuits, and Marcella Barceló also explores night terrors with his canvas The Night Mare.

The exhibition's pièce de resistance has to be Bianca Bondi's eye-catching installation of a dinner setting featuring an abandoned table made purely from salt, with salt crystals and mysterious blue liquid evoking a Dickensian Miss Haversham scene. Upon entering the gallery, the eye is immediately drawn to the dining table at the end of the room, positioned in front of a vast glass window, looking out onto a breathtaking Provençal view.

Apart from Une Chambre à Soi, there is a wealth of art to be discovered at Château La Coste. Upon arrival, visitors are greeted by Louise Bourgeois' spider sculpture seemingly floating on a lake, standing guard like a talisman, while a giant Damien Hirst anatomical sculpture stands like a sentry guard at the entrance.

Every year, Château La Coste invite leading contemporary artists to create a new installation. Some of the world's most acclaimed contemporary architects and artists have created site-specific buildings, sculptures and art installations for Château La Coste including Frank O. Gehry, Renzo Piano, Oscar Niemeyer, Jean Nouvel, Guggi, Richard Serra, Tunga, Ai Weiwei, Jenny Holzer, Per Kirkeby and Andy Goldsworthy. Many of the artworks respond or interact subtly to the natural surroundings, such as Richard Long's Circle of Riverstones, Yoko Ono's Wish Trees, Kengo Kuma's Komorebi, a Japanese term for rays of light filtering through trees and Sean Scully's Wall of Light Cubed.

Damien Hirst is the most prominent artist at Château La Coste, with several sculptures from his legendary Atlantis-inspired exhibition at the Venice Biennale on display in the grounds, as well as a monumental sculpture of a charity box girl that looms menacingly above the vineyards like a giant doll from a horror movie or something from cult horror movie The Wicker Man.

Two of the galleries have exhibitions of Hirst's paintings-one featuring AI paintings of flowers hand-finished with abstract expressionist splashes of paint, and the other with paintings inspired by the Cosmos.

Château La Coste is a temple to contemporary art and sculpture, and the 200-hectare vineyard embraces a wine-making tradition dating back to Roman times. The owners also appreciate the art of gastronomy and when I visited, acclaimed Chef Javier Rodriguez was guest chef at the L'Auberge restaurant, which was offering a delectable tasting menu featuring mouthwatering dishes such as Bouchot mussels with sea bass and Cavalon melon and beet meringue with goat cheese, all presented like works of art."

Rob Walton Just Joined The $100 Billion Club For The First Time,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdurot/2024/09/25/rob-walton-just-joined-the-100-billion-club-for-the-first-time/,2024-09-25T14:10:06Z,"The eldest son of Walmart founder Sam Walton is the first member of America's richest family to boast a 12-figure fortune.

With Walmart stock at an all-time high, Rob Walton -- the eldest son of the retail giant's founder Sam Walton (d. 1992) -- is worth an estimated $100 billion, making him the first member of America's richest family to boast a 12-figure fortune.

Walmart shares are up 54% year to date, with shoppers flocking to the retailer's ""Every Day Low Prices"" to escape high inflation. As a result, Rob Walton, 79, now ranks as the 16th richest person in the world, just ahead of his brother Jim Walton, 76, and sister Alice Walton, 74, who are worth $98.8 billion and $91.3 billion, respectively as of 9:30 am Eastern time Wednesday. On September 5, Alice Walton reclaimed the title of world's wealthiest woman for the first time since May 2022, overtaking L'Oreal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, who briefly became the first female centibillionaire in June and is now worth $87.4 billion.

Rob Walton joins 15 others in the $100 billion club, including the world's richest person Elon Musk (estimated net worth: $265.5 billion), French luxury goods tycoon Bernard Arnault ($175.5 billion) and Nvidia cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang ($106.7 billion). In 2021, only four people held fortunes that spanned a dozen digits and a year before that there was just one, Jeff Bezos.

Walton was two months shy of turning 18 years old in 1962, when his father opened the first Walmart store in Rogers, Arkansas. After graduating from the University of Arkansas in 1966, Walton went to law school at Columbia University, before joining the Tulsa-based law firm that helped take Walmart public in 1970. He joined the family retailer in 1978 and was appointed vice chairman four years later. When his father died in 1992, he took over as chairman.

Walton retired from Walmart's board in June after more than four decades as a director, including more than 20 years as chairman-a role that has been held by his son-in-law Greg Penner since 2015. Penner also replaced Walton as controlling owner of the NFL's Denver Broncos last October, after a group led by Walton bought the team for a record $4.7 billion in 2022.

Despite selling more than $28 billion of Walmart stock -- and giving away more than $11 billion of the retailer's shares -- over the past decade, Sam Walton's heirs still own 45% of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based behemoth, due to significant stock buybacks that have kept the family's stake from being diluted. Forbes estimates that three-quarters of the clan's shares are split almost evenly between the families of Rob, Jim and Alice Walton, and that most of the rest belongs to the heirs of their brother John Walton (d. 2005): his widow Christy Walton, 75, and son Lukas Walton, 37, who are worth $17 billion and $35.1 billion, respectively.

While Alice Walton has dedicated her life to curating art and other forms of philanthropy, Jim Walton was replaced by his son Steuart Walton on Walmart's board in 2016 but still chairs the family's $26 billion (assets) Arvest Bank Group. With Walmart stock on the rise, both Jim and Alice may soon join their brother-who Forbes estimates has given away slightly less of his Walmart shares, cash and other stock-to nonprofits, in the $100 billion club too."
The Novel Way AI Is Helping Immigrants Keep Their Heritage Alive,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lesliekatz/2024/09/25/the-novel-way-ai-is-helping-immigrants-keep-their-heritage-alive/,2024-09-25T13:34:18Z,"Growing up in Nicaragua in the 1960s, San Francisco Bay Area resident Blanca Lorena Perez detonated what she called ""ash bombs"" in her aunt's garden. Beneath a tall mango tree, she and her cousins would drop a heavy rock onto one end of their wooden seesaw, causing a can of ashes balanced on the opposite end to jump, spewing the powdery residue they culled from fallen leaves burned to use as fertilizer.

Perez's aunt was none too pleased to discover the kids' wasteful, messy game, but Perez laughs as she points to a scene of the playful pastime she's painted in watercolor, the palette dominated by vibrant greens.

""These are happy, nostalgic memories,"" she said. She's brought them back to visual life with help from an unlikely source, artificial intelligence.

Like a number of students in a San Francisco art class for older women who immigrated to the Bay Area from Latin America, Perez doesn't have many photos of her early life -- she had to limit the possessions she brought when she fled Nicaragua with her four young children in 1979 aboard a Red Cross plane. ""We left because of one of the worst wars that can exist, a civil war which pits you against your own people, against friends, cousins, and in some cases, your own brothers,"" Perez said.

That many women in the weekly class lack physical mementos of their past gave art teacher Hugh Leeman a novel idea: Use AI to help students recreate photographs they'd left behind, or never had in the first place.

The amateur artists recount memories, and Leeman prompts an AI text-to-image tool such as Midjourney or Open AI's Dall-e to create a visual template of the recollections they can reference as they draw their own versions. With the algorithmically generated images displayed on a large screen at the front of the classroom (and on a Zoom shared screen for those attending remotely), the women follow Leeman's guided instructions, relayed in Spanish, as they recreate the contours in pencil and include their own flourishes. Later, they'll add watercolor or acrylic paint.

""They walk away with a handmade artwork that reflects a lived experience,"" Leeman said. Based on that artwork, Leeman, an artist and art lecturer at Duke University, Colorado State University and Johns Hopkins University, facilitates an oral history interview with his students. He then gives them digital copies of the recorded interviews and the recreated ""photographs"" they can share with family back home, some of whom they have only met over the phone or video chat.

From Leeman's lessons in traditional narrative art making, the women, most in their seventies, learn about fundamentals such as composition, scale and proportion. And they learn, at least in basic terms, about AI, a technology that's dividing the art world, with some artists excited about its potential to steer their work in new directions and others concerned it could steal their work and livelihoods, or alter the very nature of creativity.

But on a recent sunny Saturday in a classroom less than half a mile from the headquarters of OpenAI, a start-up at the epicenter of the fraught debate over AI and art, that conversation couldn't feel further away. The room becomes quiet as engrossed students hunch over sheets of paper, bags of art supplies next to them, keeping their cultural legacy alive.

""When I draw, I feel relaxed and I forget all the bad things I have in my life,"" said Bonnie Perez, 77 and no relation to Blanca Lorena Perez. She left El Salvador in 1978 with her husband and two young children to join her brothers in the U.S. after her mom died. She points to her painting of Cojutepeque, where she recalls a contented childhood climbing trees and playing with dogs. The artwork shows a school, brightly colored houses and the winding path visitors climb during an annual religious pilgrimage to a grotto displaying an image of Mary, mother of Jesus.

She's not the only one who painted her hometown. Leeman has students simultaneously depict each other's life stories, in addition to their own. In doing so, they often discover powerful unifying threads that evoke history, tradition and family bonds.

""It's good,"" Bonnie Perez said. ""Every person uses their imagination a little bit differently.""

On this September morning, a large display at a Mission District community center called MNC Inspiring Success flashes an AI-generated image of a girl ladeling a drink for an older woman. The pair stands in a cemetery surrounded by orange and yellow marigolds.

On closer inspection, AI's uneven imprint becomes apparent in the extra arm with a surfeit of fingers that juts from the older woman's side. Despite the AI glitches, there's no mistaking Ana Miranda's childhood memory. Every November around ""Dia de los Difuntos,"" the Salvadoran name for Day of the Dead, Miranda's mother sent her to local cemeteries to sell cevada, a drink made of malted barley, sugar and lemon, to families gathered to clean graves, lay flowers and celebrate their dearly departed.

Miranda's mom made the beverage at home, and Miranda carried it to the cemetery in an olla, or pot, perched atop her head. Drawing the scene, said Miranda, now 72, ""I feel like I come back to when I was younger and I say, 'Well, this is the way that I can help my mother.""

Miranda's single mom supported her four children by making traditional Salvadoran turkey sandwiches called panes con pavo for a local restaurant. At 18, Miranda came to the U.S. alone to earn money she could send back home. She's eager to tell her story, all of it, from the triumphs to the traumas. She recalls the fear she felt at her first job in this country when the grandfather of the child she cared for as a live-in nanny tried to enter her room in the middle of the night and she rushed to push a sofa up against the door.

""The next day, you know where I slept? Under the bed in the girl's room,"" she said. ""Nobody saw me because the covers go down to the floor. I slept there every night. I locked the door.""

Miranda, and many other students in Leeman's class, had no prior art training, though it's hard to tell looking at their meticulous lines and skillful, striking use of color. As relative beginners, they say the AI-generated images provide a valuable visual roadmap for constructing their paintings' scaffolding.

""What's fascinating to me about working with AI is I can draw from the shapes that AI gives,"" said a student in a similar class for LGBTQ+ seniors who asked that his name not be used.

Leeman teaches both classes through Art With Elders, a program that engages older adults and those living with disabilities in remote and in-person fine arts classes, then publicly exhibits their work. The program originated in 1991, and AI has given it a 21st century spin. Leeman, whose work typically focuses on social issues, had his AI aha moment at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when he started tinkering with newly released text-to-image tools like Midjourney and Open AI's Dall-e.

""I started to be like, 'Wow, this is where you can pull people's very specific experiences into a tangible reality and use that as the visual inspiration for an artwork,"" he said.

The idea emboldened him in his determination to lead lessons that tapped emotions and personal narratives rather than focusing on objects, like some classes for beginners do. Now, with AI, he'd found a way to make those narratives visually accessible.

""I don't think too many people are sitting around thinking 'I really want to engage with the profundity of creativity so I can draw apples for the rest of my life,'"" Leeman said.

Whether it's through immersive retreats, spiritual journeys, or simply being in nature, travelers are placing a premium on destinations that offer rejuvenation for both the body and mind. This shift is part of a broader cultural trend, where vacations are no longer just about relaxation, but about transformation -- with the goal of leaving travelers changed for the better.

One such destination that aligns with this trend is Bhutan. Nestled high in the Himalayas, Bhutan offers a setting for introspection and spiritual growth. The Kingdom of Bhutan is often regarded as a land of deep spirituality, where Buddhism is more than a religion -- it is a way of life. Over 70% of the population practices Buddhism, and its teachings on compassion, mindfulness, and inner peace resonate deeply with those seeking to reconnect with themselves. For wellness seekers, Bhutan provides a profound backdrop for personal transformation.

Bhutan's serene landscapes, from its mist-shrouded valleys to its sacred temples perched on cliffs, create an atmosphere conducive to reflection. The country's focus on Gross National Happiness -- an approach that prioritizes well-being over material wealth -- aligns perfectly with the goals of wellness travelers. Those who venture to Bhutan are often drawn by the opportunity to engage with a way of life that emphasizes mindfulness, compassion, and respect for nature.

The Bhutanese government has recognized the potential to connect their spiritual heritage with the growing demand for wellness tourism. One of the most notable initiatives is the collaboration with Emma Slade, the first Western woman to be fully ordained as a Buddhist nun in Bhutan. Together, they have created the Tour of Compassion -- an immersive experience that allows visitors to explore Bhutan's spiritual landscape while engaging in meaningful self-reflection.

The Tour of Compassion is a 10-night experience designed for travelers looking to combine wellness, spirituality, and cultural immersion. Available through any Bhutanese tour operator, the itinerary offers flexible accommodations ranging from hotels to homestays, providing options that suit different preferences.

The tour includes visits to significant landmarks tied to Emma Slade's own spiritual journey in Bhutan. One such location is Druk Wangyal Lhakhang, where Slade first met Lama Nima Thsering, the teacher who inspired her to embrace Buddhism. In 2012, she became the first Western woman to be ordained as a Buddhist nun in Bhutan, an event that marked a turning point in her life.

The tour goes beyond physical exploration, offering guided meditation sessions, Buddhist retreats at ancient monasteries, and deep dives into Bhutan's compassionate practices. Visitors can also engage with the Draktsho Centre for Special Children and Youth, a vocational training center that works closely with Slade's charity, Opening Your Heart to Bhutan. This charity supports children with special needs in rural Bhutan, providing medical care, disability aids, and educational opportunities.

Emma Slade's focus on compassion as the core of her Buddhist practice is integral to the tour. ""I want the tour to offer the possibility that a journey through Bhutan might light something in the heart of those travelers, expanding the compassion they put into this world,"" she explains. Her commitment to sharing the teachings of compassion through both her charity work and the tour reflects her belief in Bhutan's ability to nurture transformation in its visitors.

The tour takes participants to some of Bhutan's most iconic and spiritually significant sites. A visit to the cliffside Tiger's Nest monastery is a highlight, offering views of the Paro Valley and an opportunity for mindful reflection. Travelers will also hike through Bhutan's landscape, including a stop at the Dochula Pass for panoramic views of the Himalayas.

Wellness aspects of the tour are integrated throughout, from a relaxing hot stone bath to spa experiences that complement the physical and spiritual journey. As Emma Slade notes, ""You cannot beat walking over the cantilever bridge into Punakha Dzong and taking a peaceful, rural walk with huge butterflies leading the way.""

Bhutan offers a unique blend of spirituality, wellness, and cultural exploration that resonates with the modern wellness traveler. As Emma Slade's journey illustrates, the country has the power to inspire transformation in those who are open to its lessons. Through initiatives like the Tour of Compassion, Bhutan continues to foster meaningful connections between travelers and its deep-rooted spiritual traditions.

For those seeking not just a vacation but a life-altering experience, Bhutan provides a sanctuary of reflection, mindfulness, and compassion. ""The clean air and mountain landscape of the Kingdom, filled with the sounds of Buddhist practice, create a very special and potentially life-changing destination for travelers,"" Slade reflects. Indeed, Bhutan stands as a beacon for wellness travelers looking for a deeper connection with themselves and the world around them.

Emma Slade, known in the Buddhist community as Lopen Pema Deki, has lived a life of profound transformation, from a high-powered career in finance to becoming the first Western woman to attain full ordination as a Buddhist nun in Bhutan. Through her work as a nun and the founder of the charity Opening Your Heart to Bhutan, Slade shares her passion for compassion, equality, and helping special needs children in Bhutan.

Her journey, marked by personal and spiritual evolution, offers an inspiring testament to the power of mindfulness and compassion -- values she now helps others explore through her Tour of Compassion.

In June 2022, Bhutan became the first Himalayan nation to fully ordain female nuns, an event that Emma Slade describes as ""historic"" and personally significant. ""I was so honored to be the first, and so far the only, Western woman to attain such ordination,"" she shares. The significance of this milestone goes beyond personal achievement; it reflects a broader movement toward gender equality within Bhutanese monastic life.

""This ordination places nuns on the same footing as monks in terms of their ethical vows,"" Slade explains. ""I feel very passionately that both monks and nuns should have equal chances in their access to teachings and Dharma opportunities. I feel so proud of Bhutan that they took this incredible step forward.""

Slade has visited Bhutan over 40 times, each visit deepening her connection with the land and its people. Out of this bond grew her Tour of Compassion, a journey designed to encourage travelers to explore not only Bhutan's stunning landscapes but also the concept of compassion at the heart of Himalayan Vajrayana Buddhism.

""Compassion is a key area of study and practice in Himalayan Vajrayana Buddhism,"" says Slade. ""I felt Bhutan offered such a great landscape to learn and reflect on what compassion means to each and every traveler. I want the tour to offer the possibility that a journey through Bhutan might light something in the heart of those travelers, expanding the compassion they put into this world.""

Slade has curated the experience to allow travelers to engage with Bhutanese spirituality, history, and natural beauty in a way that fosters mindfulness. From walking over the cantilever bridge into Punakha Dzong to taking rural strolls accompanied by butterflies, her favorite travel moments are those where nature and spirituality intersect.

Slade's connection to Bhutan goes far beyond her personal journey -- she has committed to making a tangible impact through her UK-based charity, Opening Your Heart to Bhutan. The organization focuses on supporting special needs children and those in greatest need across Bhutan. Through her charity, she has spearheaded projects like the Draktsho Vocational Training Centre for Special Children and Youth, the only purpose-built school for special needs children in Bhutan.

""I am so proud of all it has done, and I run it with all my heart and a good dollop of financial efficiency!"" Slade remarks.

Travelers visiting Bhutan can also engage with the charity's efforts by meeting with Ugyen Tshering, a representative who is passionate about the work being done. They can also visit sites where the charity has had a direct impact, including the special needs school in Eastern Bhutan at Kanglung.

""There are a few ways visitors to Bhutan can get involved. They can simply donate or while they are in the Kingdom, they can meet with our representative, Ugyen Tshering, who will happily speak to visitors about Bhutan and the work our charity has done.""

Through both her spiritual and charitable work, Slade's impact continues to ripple across Bhutan, offering travelers a chance to immerse themselves in a country rich with tradition, while fostering a sense of compassion that transcends borders."
First Black country club gets more than love in its coffers,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/25/nx-s1-5116517/first-black-country-club-gets-more-than-love-in-its-coffers,2024-09-25T12:49:27Z,"Shady Rest Country Club was established when a group of Black businessmen bought it in 1921. Golfers and tennis players were active. In the evening, its nightclub in the basement was a haven for entertainers such as Ella Fitzgerald, who gave shows there after performances in New York. The club, Villa Casanova, has to be restored.

Shady Rest Country Club in Scotch Plains, New Jersey was the first Black-owned and operated country club in the United States. The building that sits next to its 9-hole public golf course has a rich history, but the building needs work.

The Preserve Shady Rest Committee was founded in 2013, and has been chipping away at the repair list since then.

In July, the African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund, a program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, awarded $75,000 to help in the restoration. The money is a part of a current $3 million in grant funding to preserve 30 sites across the United States that are significant to Black history.

Sylvia Hicks is the former chairperson of the committee and has moved away from Scotch Plains, but she still keeps an eye on what's happening at Shady Rest. Hicks says the reason to preserve the clubhouse is a no-brainer. ""It's history. Plain and simple. Period. History.""

The building was built in the mid-1700s as a farmhouse, then was converted into a tavern and then the Westfield Country Club. In 1921, the Progressive Realty Company Inc., a group of Black investors, purchased the former Westfield Country Club and established the Shady Rest Country Club, a retreat for sports and leisure.

Through the years, sporting luminaries played at Shady Rest. John Shippen Jr., the first professional golfer and the nation's first Black professional golfer, played at the club. In the 1950s, Althea Gibson, the Grand Slam-winning tennis player, and the first Black woman to cross the color line of international tennis, was also a Shady Rest regular.

After hours, Shady Rest transformed into a hotspot for East Coast entertainment. After musicians played in New York City, they would come out to the Villa Casanova, a club in the basement of Shady Rest, to perform.

Brent Leggs, executive director of the African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund, says there's a huge demand for preservation funding. ""Since inviting proposals, the Action Fund's National Grant Program has received 6,169 funding proposals requesting $709 million dollars.""

The Action Fund must be selective and has supported 304 Black heritage sites with a total investment of $27 million since 2018.

This year's grantees illustrate a diverse mix of regions, sites and stories. The selections go from California to Georgia, to Minnesota to Texas.

""We work with external partners like the Association of African American Museums or the Hutchins Center at Harvard University to help us evaluate the competitiveness and to select our grantees. We are often looking for diversity of geography, of archetypes and stories.""

Tom Donatelli, the current chair of the Shady Rest committee, says this money from the action fund will be used for ""engineering and architecture"".

He says the top floors of the building need to be restored, and are closed to the public. The Villa Casanova is also on the restoration list.

The community is invested too.

Bobby Mendelson, a Shady Rest regular and a young father, and his 6-year-old son, Leo, armed with his blue and white golf bag, were finishing their round.

This sport has a deeper meaning for Bobby Mendelson, who also played golf with his father on the course.

Since Mendelson has come to Shady Rest over the years, he's seen some of the work that has already happened at the historic clubhouse and is eager to see more.

""I think it's really important to the history of the town and the area,"" he said. ""Not to mention, in this case, civil rights, and I think it gives us pride in the area. And honestly, it's really nice. It's important to remember those kinds of important things and to feel good about them."""
Inside Facebook's Scammy Abortion Access Network,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2024/09/25/inside-facebooks-scammy-abortion-access-network/,2024-09-25T12:29:34Z,"In hundreds of groups across the social media app, women with unwanted pregnancies turn to one another for pills and herbal remedies. Many say they are getting scammed instead.

a Facebook group of more than 8,000 strangers, Brazilian women plead for help.

""I'm 15 weeks pregnant I don't know what to do anymore. I tried the medicine at 8 weeks and it went wrong,"" says one message.

""I'm 9 weeks and 4 days pregnant. I've tried all the possible teas that I saw on the internet, and some of them really hurt. I already have two small children, and this one came from carelessness .... Time is passing and I am desperate,"" says another.

A third woman says she cannot afford abortion medicine, so she's seeking other remedies. A fourth says she spent the only money she had on a sale she now fears was a scam.

The group hosting these messages is called ""Safe Abortion -- Helping Women."" In Brazil, where abortion is illegal in most cases, nearly two hundred thousand women have joined similar groups devoted to buying and selling mifepristone, misoprostol and a variety of homemade remedies that they hope might terminate their unwanted pregnancies.

The groups are not for the faint of heart. Many feature photos of bloody sanitary pads and fetal solids, and many more feature cries for help from women fleeing abusive partners or fearing for the health of their existing children. Posts warning of scammers and fake pills are common, as are side-conversations about unprotected sex and contraception. Occasionally, a person opposed to abortion chimes in advising the women to consider adoption.

Brazil is one of many countries where women have turned to a muddied Facebook landscape to seek abortion care. A Forbes review of the platform found nearly 800 groups and pages across 76 countries offering to connect women to abortion remedies -- at least 300 of which operate in countries where abortion is at least sometimes illegal, or even a criminal offense. All told, the groups have nearly 1.8 million members.Forbes found that Facebook groups and pages selling abortion drugs were present in nearly every major region around the world, including abortion-restrictive population centers like Brazil (111 groups; >191,000 members), Kenya (50 groups, >111,000 members) and the Philippines (57 groups; >37,000 members). We also found them in Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Japan, Germany and Norway.

Seventeen groups and pages claimed to provide abortion pills to women in the United States, though it is unclear how many of them actually make the pills available. The largest, which has more than 117,000 members, directed users to an abortion-related URL that subsequently redirected to an adult website. The two admins for the group, one of whom sells live fowl in the Philippines from their Facebook profile, did not respond to interview requests. (Disclosure: In a previous life, I held content policy positions at Facebook and Spotify.)

Many of the groups have made use of a new Facebook feature that enables group members to post in groups as an ""anonymous participant,"" rather than under the name they use on Facebook. Of the group members selling, rather than seeking, drugs and remedies, many have taken other steps to disguise their identities -- which, if revealed, could threaten their safety and liberty. One private group in Brazil listed 10 admins, all of whom used apparently AI-generated profile pictures and four who listed their surnames as ""cyto"" or ""cito"" -- short for cytotec, the Pfizer brand for misoprostol. While some of the groups claim they are run by doctors, many are clearly not, and instead provide places for women to buy and sell pills and other products without a prescription.

Abortion bans don't make people less likely to end a pregnancy, but they do make it harder for them to do so safely. Katy Mayall, the director for strategic initiatives at the Center for Reproductive Rights, told Forbes that there are reliable websites where people can learn how to self-manage abortion and order safe, authentic pills. (She recommended Women Help Women, Women on Web, and INeedAnA.com.) But the Facebook groups, she said, are something of a double edged sword: while they may get some women help, they can be a gateway to scams and fraudsters into the picture, and carry health and privacy risks for people in restrictive countries.

One risk for people in these groups is that Facebook could be required to share their personal information with law enforcement. In August 2022, after the United States Supreme Court made abortion illegal in dozens of US states, Facebook was required to turn over messages between a mother and daughter to Nebraska law enforcement officials, who used them as evidence in prosecution of the women for their purchase and use of abortion pills to terminate a pregnancy. The daughter subsequently pleaded guilty to a felony charge of removing, concealing or abandoning a dead human body, and the mother pled to that charge and an additional one: performing an abortion beyond 20 weeks.

After the U.S. Supreme Court decision, Facebook began removing groups, pages, and posts between women trying to buy and sell abortion drugs. But ongoing policing of that activity has been tricky for the platform: many of the groups no longer refer to the drugs by name, instead using euphemisms like ""candy"" and ""caramelos.""

Facebook's parent company, Meta, does allow businesses in some countries to run advertisements for prescription drugs, including mifepristone and misoprostol, as long as the ads are not targeted to people under the age of 18. Advertisers promoting prescription drugs must provide evidence to Meta that they are properly licensed to sell them and must receive pre-approval before running ads.

Meta does not prohibit women from talking about their experiences self-managing abortions on its platforms, and in the groups and pages reviewed by Forbes, it appears the actual sale of drugs rarely happens on Facebook itself. Instead, sellers typically direct potential buyers to contact them on WhatsApp, Meta's encrypted chat service; ""DM me for candies"" is typical of this type of solicitation. When a person reaches out to the Whatsapp numbers posted in some of these groups, they'll sometimes get an automated welcome message asking for details about where they are located and how far along their pregnancy is.

One provider quoted Forbes with a range of prices between $80 and $200 USD, for various purported drugs and remedies. Women on Web, one of the websites that Mayall recommended, offers combinations of mifepristone and misoprostol for between 70 and 90 euros, depending on the patient's location.

When Forbes reached out to dozens of these numbers on WhatsApp, few responded after we identified ourselves as journalists. One provider we messaged said they were ""saddened to see the death toll from abortion in women."" Another person whose number had been posted in the groups said they weren't a provider, but they ""receive messages every day asking for remedies.""

Meta spokesperson Ryan Daniels said in a statement, ""We want our platforms to be a place where people can safely discuss the issues that matter to them, including topics around health. At the same time, we have specific rules and policies on buying, selling, or trading prescription drugs and protections to keep people safe from scammers, whether in health or other matters. We will take action against any pages and groups we find to violate our policies.""

In some groups, women ask and advise one another about how to end pregnancies with home remedies. While most of these remedies are harmless (though ineffective), some can lead to health problems. Several of the groups reviewed by Forbes contained advice recommending that women use a combination of over-the-counter medication and Coca Cola to end their pregnancies. The remedy does not cause abortion, but can cause vaginal infections and other health problems.

The groups are also filled with warnings about various Facebook profiles that either take money for pills they never deliver, or deliver medicine that is fake. One account -- an admin of several groups in Brazil -- made a series of formulaic posts that appeared to recycle the same desperate story of an eighteen year old woman seeking help as part of a scaled effort to reach other women in need.

In addition to claims of one-off scammers, Forbes also found evidence of larger, more coordinated efforts to reach -- and potentially deceive -- women seeking care. In Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, and other locations, a network of several hundred pages offers ""abortion kits"" using the same set of profile pictures, descriptions and phone numbers.

Some of the groups and pages specifically sought out women with difficult abortion needs -- like those who are 6, 7, or even 8 months pregnant. In a group for South Africa, where abortion is legal, one participant wrote: ""I was 6 months! Now I'm free after being scammed 3 times don't give up ladies."" Several other members of the group also mentioned having been repeatedly scammed, and ultimately terminating later-term pregnancies as a result.

Other groups speak specifically to teen girls who are not ready to become parents -- dozens of posts made by a group admin identifying as a doctor promoted a Zimbabwean service to its more than 800 members: ""Teens welcome & no parental consent."" The message was also included on the group's ""about"" page. Abortion is only legal in the country in cases of rape, incest, when the pregnancy threatens the life or health of the pregnant person, or if the fetus is at risk of serious physical or mental defects.

Groups for buying and selling abortion remedies have also flourished in South Africa, which -- unlike most other countries on the African continent -- has broadly legalized abortion. Of the groups analyzed by Forbes, 142 offered services in the country, with many promising hand delivery of pills or herbal remedies.

A recent post in a 39,000-person South African group read: ""Thank God I'm free but it's painful guys."" A thread of comments followed beneath the post, where others asked what method the original poster used, how to get care for themselves, and how much it would cost. More than 30 comments down, one user questioned the premise of the group at all.

""Just so you know guys the pills are free in hospital and it's safe."""
Nick Cannon 'wasn't ready' for his daughter to become 'a young lady': 'Happened overnight',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/nick-cannon-wasnt-ready-his-daughter-become-a-young-lady,2024-09-25T12:13:30Z,"Nick Cannon's twins are officially teenagers, and he cannot cope.

During a recent interview with Fox News Digital, Cannon discussed his relationship with his two oldest children, 13-year-old twins Moroccan and Monroe, whom he shares with Mariah Carey. One of the biggest hurdles he has experienced so far when it comes to fatherhood is watching his little girl grow up, something he said he ""wasn't ready for.""

""My daughter is a little scary because she's turning into a young lady,"" he explained. ""I wasn't ready for that, and it literally happened overnight. She's like 5'6, 5'7, and then she's still jumping on my back and stuff, like you're a full-grown woman, we gotta figure this out. That was a little scary. I wasn't ready for such a quick turn and all that comes with it. The makeup, the caring about what people think and boys. All that stuff. I'm not ready for any of it.""

The ""Wild n Out"" host and Carey welcomed their twins in 2011 before announcing their separation in 2014, later finalizing their divorce in November 2016.

NICK CANNON, FATHER OF 12, EXPLAINS WHY HE INSURED HIS 'MOST VALUABLE BODY PART' FOR $10 MILLION

The couple began dating after they met at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards, when ""The Masked Singer"" host presented the Grammy Award-winning singer with the award for choice R&B artist. While they did not work out as a couple, the two remain committed to being good co-parents.

""I mean it's amazing. That term co-parenting is so funny, 'cause like why do you have to have the co? It's just parenting. That's what we've always done,"" he said. ""That's what we vowed to each other that we would always put the kids first, and it's always been that way. She's a phenomenal mother, woman, you know, all the things. I have no complaints about her.""

Since splitting from Carey, Cannon has gone on to have 10 more children with five other women. He shares daughter Powerful Queen and sons Golden Sagon and Rise Messiah with former Miss Arizona USA Brittany Bell, daughter Onyx Ice Cole with photographer LaNisha Cole, twins Zion Mixolydian and Zillion Heir and daughter Beautiful Zeppelin with DJ Abby De La Rosa, son Zen, who died at 5 months old from a brain tumor in 2021, and daughter Halo Marie with model Alyssa Scott, and son Legendary Love with model Brie Tiesi.

When it comes to his oldest kids, Cannon could not help but gush, telling Fox News Digital, ""my teenagers are amazing,"" saying, ""I can't take all the credit, I'm gonna give it to their mom."" He went on to explain that they are ""loving"" and ""considerate"" and have very high ""emotional intelligence,"" but adds he sees himself in his son.

What would Barbara Walters think of 'The View' today? Her biographer answers the question,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/what-would-barbara-walters-think-the-view-today-her-biographer-answers-question,2024-09-25T09:18:22Z,"AUSTIN, Texas - What would Barbara Walter think of ""The View"" today?

Fox News Digital asked Susan Page, Washington bureau chief for USA Today and author of ""The Rulebreaker: The Life and Times of Barbara Walters,"" what the late legendary broadcaster would now think of the ABC daytime program Walters created.

""Her concept of 'The View' would be women of different generations with different perspectives,"" Page told Fox News Digital at the Texas Tribune Festival earlier this month. ""So she was pretty careful when she controlled who was on 'The View,' to have women of color on 'The View,' women with conservative points of view, because I think she thought that made for a more interesting conversation.""

""One thing she would like about 'The View' today is that it is so relevant in our politics. It is a place that presidents and candidates go to, to make their cases to voters,"" Page said.

BARBARA WALTERS WOULD EXPECT KAMALA HARRIS TO DO INTERVIEWS, AUTHOR SAYS: 'PART OF THE JOB OF BEING PRESIDENT'

While the show always tackled the news of the day during Walter's tenure, ""The View"" has become a political lightning rod in the Trump era. Conservatives have called out the program that purportedly represented all points of view, but in recent years it has not had a pro-Trump co-host at the table.

""I think that the rise of Donald Trump has created some real difficulties in conversations where you want to have all points of view. And I think that's a show that has struggled with that, as have some others,"" Page said.

BARBARA WALTERS BIOGRAPHER REVEALS WHICH ACTRESS SHOULD PLAY HER IN A MOVIE

Page stressed that Trump supporters should be fairly represented not just on ""The View"" but across the media landscape.

""If 40 or 45% of Americans at a minimum are gonna vote for Donald Trump, it is important to try to listen to the people who are going to vote for Trump and understand where they're coming from because that represents a huge part of the American population,"" Page told Fox News Digital.

Walters launched ""The View"" back in 1997 and served as a co-host for 17 seasons ahead of her official retirement from television in 2016.

""The View"" is now hosted by Joy Behar, Whoopi Goldberg, Sunny Hostin, Sara Haines, Alyssa Farah Griffin and Ana Navarro, all of them outspoken Trump critics.

ABC'S 'THE VIEW' WAS 100% NEGATIVE ABOUT TRUMP FOLLOWING SECOND ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: STUDY

Page spoke about what inspired her to write about the journalism trailblazer.

""For women journalists, no one has been a more iconic figure than Barbara Walters,"" Page said. ""That's true for women in TV broadcast journalism, it's true for women in print journalism, like myself, as well. And there was no real biography of Barbara Walters ever written, and I thought she deserved one.""

Throughout her decades-long career, Walters repeatedly made history, first becoming the first female co-host of NBC's ""The Today Show,"" later becoming the highest paid news anchor ever when she joined ABC News.

""If you grew up watching Barbara Walters, it wouldn't occur to you that a woman couldn't do big interviews, couldn't interview presidents and prime ministers and despots and murderers, and it also wouldn't occur to you that a woman couldn't make as much money or more than her male colleagues,"" Page said."
'ITS REALLY ROUGH OUT HERE': Atlanta woman shares how she doesn't feel safe in the city,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/its-really-rough-out-here-atlanta-woman-shares-how-she-doesnt-feel-safe-city,2024-09-25T09:08:17Z,"One woman in Atlanta, Georgia shared with Fox News Digital how crime has made her feel unsafe in the city.

""It's really rough out here,"" Chelsea told Fox News Digital. ""It's really scary out here.""

She said that the ""crime rate has skyrocketed"" and she does not feel safe living in the city.

""The old Atlanta-it used to be more safe than the Atlanta now,"" she added. ""It used to be certain areas where you go you feel safe, now its everywhere you don't feel safe. Even in the nice neighborhoods, you don't feel safe.""

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

Avery, a gentleman accompanying Chelsea, echoed her sentiments about not feeling safe.

""I don't feel safe in my own city. I don't,"" the life-long resident said.

A Georgia State student, Audrey, expressed similar views, saying crime is more of a problem now than it was four years ago and had gotten ""worse"" since the COVID-19 pandemic. When asked if she feels safe she replied, ""not really.""

Audrey, who lived in Atlanta her whole life, said she can imagine small business owners would be ""terrified"" of coming to Atlanta.

""I'm used to shootings happening ... overtime you're numb to it,"" she said.

A recent study by the Department of Justice showed violent crimes increasing dramatically during the Biden-Harris administration. Across the board, the survey found total instances of reported violent crimes increased from 5.6 per 1,000 individuals aged 12 and over in 2020, when Trump was still in office, to 8.7 per 1,000 in 2023.

However, there are some residents in Atlanta who think crime is not as egregious as others make it out to be.

Marcus, who moved to Atlanta to work in hospitality, said he feels like ""it is just like every other city.""

""You have your good parts. You have your bad parts,"" Marcus told Fox News Digital. ""I feel as if everything could require improvement, but, it is what it is in terms of crime.""

He added that downtown is ""not the safest"" to walk around at nighttime, but, during the day, it's ""beautiful.""

""I think it's been moderate,"" said Lamar, a student at Georgia State University.

One student named Marcellus said crime ""fluctuates"" in the city.

""(Crime) probably got a little bit worse overtime. Sometimes it's OK. Sometimes it's a lot worse than others,"" he said. ""It's kind of mediocre right now. There's a lot more scams going on. There's more online scams. Not too much crime just out and about."""
Ed Burns' advice on surviving 'bittersweet' transition to becoming an empty nester,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ed-burns-advice-surviving-bittersweet-transition-becoming-empty-nester,2024-09-25T08:41:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Ed Burns officially became an empty nester this year.

The 56-year-old actor and filmmaker shares two children with wife Christy Turlington: Grace, 20, and Finn, 18.

Burns, who recently published his first novel, ""A Kid from Marlboro Road,"" told Fox News Digital that he and his supermodel spouse made sure to plan projects and activities well in advance of their kids heading off to college. It has helped soften the blow.

""It's funny, Christy and I were laughing that we both made sure that we were each incredibly busy this fall, so we haven't had to really face it,"" Burns admitted, noting that the transition has been ""bittersweet.""

""Obviously, we're so happy that the kids are happy and off starting their journey and loving their college experiences,"" he said. ""But you can't help but miss them like crazy.""

Burns shared that he's holding up just fine ""for now.""

""Obviously, we're so happy that the kids are happy and off starting their journey and loving their college experiences. But you can't help but miss them like crazy.""

-- Ed Burns

But he has kept his word on staying busy. He's embarked on his first-ever book tour, a ""bucket list"" moment for him as he gears up to enter his 60s.

""I had never really thought about writing a novel, other than maybe when I was a senior in high school,"" he explained. ""I had a great creative writing teacher. She read a short story of mine, and she's the one who encouraged me to be a writer. She said, 'That's what you should study in school.' But when I got to school, I started studying film. I fell in love with filmmaking and screenplays.""

""For 30-plus years, I have been thinking about writing a story like this one,"" he shared. ""I thought the story I was going to write was about the last generation of latchkey kids.""

During the pandemic, Burns was ready to write another screenplay. However, he didn't know when he - or anyone else - would be returning to the set. Now was the time to finally write that novel, he thought.

""My parents were in Florida at the time and couldn't get to New York,"" he said. ""I would speak to them every day on the phone. After about a week or two of just asking, 'What did you watch on Netflix?' 'What did you eat for dinner?' I started to ask my mom very specific questions about her life. 'What do you remember about the day you met Dad?' 'What do you remember the day you graduated from high school?'

She started telling me these wonderful, long stories. I'd get off the phone with her, I would go upstairs and write. All of her stories found their way into the book.""

While ""A Kid from Marlboro Road"" is not a memoir, it draws heavily on Burns' Irish-American background. Burns also got a rare view of his mother's life before marriage and kids.

""My mom was never really lucky enough to get an education,"" he said. ""But she was super smart and very well-read... I asked her, 'Why didn't you go to college?' She was like, 'Edward, I graduated from high school in 1957. I'm a kid with no money from the South Bronx. None of my girlfriends went to college. We had three options: you were going to teach, you were going to become a nurse, or you could become a nun.'""

""The book gets into the thwarted dreams, the dreams that didn't quite come true for her,"" said Burns. ""I think that was the biggest surprise for me... As a young woman, she imagined that there was another world available to her... And maybe not having access to education thwarted some of those opportunities. That said, she... took classes in her adult life. But I think she's someone who would've relished the opportunity to go to college right out of high school instead of going right to work.""

The matriarch, who passed away, never got to read Burns' book.

Burns isn't sure if ""A Kid from Marlboro Road"" will become a film. But he does have big plans.

""I'm already about 200 pages into the second novel,"" he said. ""I see this as a trilogy. I've got a good outline for the third one as well.""

But Burns isn't done with films - far from it. He's working on a sequel to 1995's ""The Brothers McMullen.""

""It's funny with empty nesting approaching in my life,"" he said. ""It's the story of my character. Barry is an empty nester... His two adult kids asked to move back into his house on Thanksgiving. There's a part of him that's overjoyed about having them back. But there's another part of him that is concerned that they have moved back into the house.""

""I read an article about that, where a lot of young adults had been moving back to live with their parents because it's so hard to buy your first home. A lot of them are living at home now to save money. That's what inspired me to tell this story.""

Burns has just finished the script. So far, he's only spoken to original cast member Connie Britton about it.

""Quite honestly, it really focuses on a handful of the characters,"" he said. ""So not everyone will be back. Obviously, some of them will probably be disappointed to find that out.""

Burns is excited about the next chapter in his life. But one thing is certain - he wants to stay busy.

""I'm a tireless worker,"" he said about the secret behind his decades-long career.

""I'm not the most talented, but I will outwork you,"" he chuckled. ""That's been, at least for me, the key to my longevity. I try to write every day. I have a pretty disciplined schedule. From 10 to 1 o'clock, I force myself to sit down and work on something. When I hit the wall in writing this novel, I was able to dive into the sequel to 'Brothers McMullen.' I just forced myself to work every day. The years go by, and you end up with a lot of pages written.""

""The movies that I was attracted to as a kid in film school, and the films I've continued to make are small character-driven stories,"" he reflected. ""It's always been my favorite form of cinema. I know those films still get made, but they're harder to find. They just don't seem to have the same support from the business in the way that there was. When I came up in the '90s, we had dozens of films being made about Gen Xers... now that the generation finds ourselves in our mid-50s, there are no films about us.""

""That's my private little dream,"" said Burns, ""to see more of those simpler character-driven stories about people that my generation and I can relate to, especially as we hit middle age. There are more stories to tell."""

The fatal shooting of District Judge Kevin Mullins in his own East Kentucky chambers underscores the escalation of violence towards the judiciary - since 2019, threats of violence against judges have more than doubled, according to one law group.

Letcher County Sheriff Shawn ""Mickey"" Stines is accused of shooting Mullins, 54, multiple times following an argument in the courthouse. Mullins died at the scene, and Stines was charged with one count of first-degree murder.

According to the American Bar Association, credible threats of harm against judges have skyrocketed from 175 instances in 2019 to 500 in 2023.

""Judges are facing more and more threats - violence has become the rule rather than the exception when defendants are unhappy with rulings. Most jurisdictions are unequipped in dealing with these mounting threats,"" said Belvin Perry, the former chief judge of Florida's Ninth Judicial Circuit, who received a slew of death threats when he presided over Casey Anthony's trial and throughout his career.

SHOCKING ATTACK ON NEVADA JUDGE SHOWS NEED FOR GREATER PROTECTIONS, SAYS JUDGE WHOSE SON WAS KILLED

""Each court's security will do an evaluation of your home to make sure that your home is safe. They'll tell you to make plans for your family if something happens. Those are actual realities that judges each and every day have to live with,"" Perry said.

""I've had, at times, 24-hour security at my house because of death threats. I kept a German Shepard, highly trained canine at home to be with my family when I was not at home. My wife had to take shooting courses.""

Three days before Mullins was shot, Stines was deposed in a lawsuit levied by two women. The suit accuses the sheriff of ""deliberate indifference in failing to adequately train and supervise"" a deputy, Ben Fields, who pleaded guilty to raping a female prisoner while she was on house arrest.

The women allege that Fields repeatedly sexually abused a woman in Mullins' chambers.

It isn't clear whether the argument that preceded the shooting was related to the lawsuit. But if it were, it wouldn't be the first time a judge was attacked over a case.

LAS VEGAS COURTROOM ATTACK HIGHLIGHTS ISSUE OF VIOLENCE AGAINST JUDGES: EXPERTS

Last year, a Maryland county circuit court judge, Andrew Wilkerson, was killed in the driveway of his home following his ruling in a child custody case.

New Jersey federal judge Esther Salas started The Daniel Anderl Protection Project after her 20-year-old son was shot dead in a racially-motivated attack meant for her in 2020. The gunman, who was disguised as a delivery driver, killed Daniel Anderl and seriously injured Salas' husband, Mark Anderl.

""In my opinion, every state and territory in the United States should have laws protecting judges and should have laws that are aimed at judicial security,"" Esther Salas previously told Fox News Digital. ""There are a handful of states like New Jersey that have addressed judicial security head-on, and my hope and prayer is that states will follow New Jersey's lead, follow the federal legislation and create and enact their own laws that are aimed directly at the judiciary.""

In June, the U.S. Senate passed the bipartisan Counter Threats and Attacks on Our Judges Act, which would provide federal funding for state and local judges' security.

""Unfortunately, heightened polarization and partisanship has coincided with a spike in threats and attacks on members of the bench that endangers the independence of our justice system,"" Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat and one of the bill's sponsors, said in a statement.

DEMS ROUNDLY CONDEMN DEATH THREATS AGAINST THE SUPREME COURT THEY'VE REPEATEDLY DISPARAGED

Perry told Fox News Digital that although violence against the judiciary is on the rise, it is not a new phenomenon.

In 1984, Perry narrowly evaded a gunman who opened fire in Florida's Orange County Courthouse.

The shooter, Thomas Provenzano, shot 60-year-old Deputy Sheriff William Arnold Wilkerson dead, left Deputy Sheriff Harry Dalton with brain damage and injuries that led to his premature death several years later and permanently paralyzed Officer Mark Lindsey Parker.

Provenzano had been charged with disorderly conduct five months earlier and intended to shoot the officer that charged him, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page. He was executed via electric chair in June 2020.

Perry said that he happened to step out of the hallway where Provenzano opened fire moments before gunshots rang out.

""Unfortunately, we see that violence has become the ever present factor in the lives of judges,"" Perry said.

Combating the problem is the ""million-dollar question,"" he said - but improved security in courthouses would help.

""It's tragic that the judge in Kentucky got killed, even with a security system in place - the sheriff was the person responsible for providing security,"" Perry said."
Archery To Modern Day Amazons: Why Dior Was Bang On Target At PFW,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephaniehirschmiller/2024/09/25/archery-to-modern-day-amazons-why-dior-was-bang-on-target-at-pfw/,2024-09-25T07:10:15Z,"Opened by an archer firing arrows down an enclosed range in the centre of the runway, the Christian Dior show at Paris Fashion Week was bang on target.

The maison's spring summer 2025 hit the mark with a functional ready-to-wear collection geared to the life of a contemporary woman while the Dior Beauty makeup look highlighted newly released multi-tasking products in sync with the overall concept.

The Amazonian archer (artist SAGG Napoli) -- ever ""a reference point for the notion of an autonomous, courageous femininity"" -- was derived from the starting-point of the collection, the asymmetric Amazone dress Christian Dior created for autumn winter 1951 - 1952. This was one of the archive silhouettes Creative Director Maria Grazia Chiuri chose to interpret anew via asymmetric riffs on the Bar Jacket and bodysuit, and deconstructed shirting.

While the legacy of the Paris Olympic Games was likewise present in elevated track pants and all manner of sneaker permutations, it also resonated more obliquely via jersey fabrics -- often teamed with diaphanous and embellished evening wear.

This marked both an extension of her Olympics themed Haute Couture show in July and a playbook on contemporary dress codes allowing movement without constraint. The classic trench appeared both in its purest form and revisited as a Bar meets combat suit.

Dior Makeup Creative and Image Director Peter Philips interpreted Chiuri's contemporary Amazon as a ""strong, active woman who has just come out of the gym,"" he said backstage before the show.

Just like the ready-to-wear, Dior's beauty offering continues to address contemporary needs. The makeup look architected by Philips showcased two newly released Dior Makeup products that do just that. Dior Forever Skin Contour, the house's first contouring stick which boasts 24-hour staying power and Dior Rouge Blush Color & Glow which features natural origin pigments for ""24-hour hydration and long-lasting wear.""

Philips used a combination of these to create ""a flush just below the cheekbones"" (as opposed to ""a romantic blush that sits on the apples of the cheeks"") which he describes as ""a workout blush.""

The sticks which have been six years in conception, drew inspiration from a shift he'd observed via social media in the gestures of makeup application he said, describing how a younger generation is more likely to use blending and highlighting techniques to achieve their desired effect than the more traditional color matching foundation to skin tone. He added that a stick blush is also in the pipeline.

Like Chiuri's ""choreographing"" of the maison's archives, Philips teamed these new additions with more established hero products including Dior Beauty stalwart and trench coat of the makeup world, the recently reformulated Dior Capture Totale Le Sérum used both to prep the skin and as a last minute addition on top of the Dior Forever Skin Glow foundation for that dewy post workout look. Eyes involved a line of Diorshow On Stage Crayon smudged to evoke a similar effect.

Naples born SAGG Napoli -- as multi-tasking as aforementioned blush -- is a multidisciplinary artist as well as being a competitive archer. She conceived the show's scenography -- installation ""Con il cuore in una mano e l'arco nell'altra"" (""With my heart in one hand and a bow in the other""), which featured texts built into a 70-meter metal and glass structure, alongside her performance executed therein.

One of the set's emblematic phrases: ""May the building of a strong mind and a strong body be the greatest work I have ever made,"" is a reference to the discipline of archery which is known for its convergence of body and mind.

A similarly powerhouse front row featured Black Pink's Jisoo, Brigitte Macron, Natalie Portman, Emily in Paris' Ashley Park and Dior's latest global ambassador Spanish musician Rosalia who was announced in May as the new face of the Lady Dior Campaign."

Missouri and Texas both put inmates to death Tuesday, amid a series of executions that began last week and are expected to continue in the coming days.

A Missouri man on death row was executed for the brutal 1998 killing of a woman inside her home, marking the beginning of a series of executions in several states over the next couple of days.

Marcellus Williams, 55, died by lethal injection, shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court denied his request to intervene. Williams was put to death for the 1998 killing of Lisha Gayle, a social worker and former newspaper reporter who was stabbed more than 40 times during a burglary at her home in St. Louis.

His attorney argued that the state supreme court should halt his execution over alleged procedural errors in jury selection and the prosecution's alleged mishandling of the murder weapon.

SOUTH CAROLINA INMATE DIES BY LETHAL INJECTION, ENDING STATE'S 13-YEAR PAUSE ON EXECUTIONS

St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell had sought to set aside Williams' sentence, citing questions about his guilt.

Gayle, 42, was a social worker and former St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter. Prosecutors at Williams' trial said he broke into her home on Aug. 11, 1998, heard the shower running and found a large butcher knife.

Gayle was stabbed 43 times when she came downstairs. Her purse and her husband's laptop were stolen.

Last month, Gayle's relatives gave their blessing to an agreement between the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney's office and Williams' attorneys to commute the sentence to life in prison. But acting on an appeal from Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey's Office, the state Supreme Court nullified the agreement.

BIPARTISAN GROUP OF TEXAS LAWMAKERS DEMAND CONVICTED KILLER'S EXECUTION BE HALTED: 'SERIOUS DOUBTS'

Republican Gov. Mike Parson and the state supreme court each refused requests on Monday from Williams in an effort to avoid his execution.

In Texas, Travis Mullis was pronounced dead at the state penitentiary in Huntsville at 7:01 p.m. for the killing of his 3-month-old son. Mullis, 38, was condemned to death for stomping his son Alijah to death in January 2008.

Prosecutors said Mullis, then 21, drove to nearby Galveston with his son after fighting with his girlfriend. Mullis parked his car and sexually assaulted his son. After the infant began to cry uncontrollably, Mullis began strangling his son before taking him out of the car and stomping on his head, according to authorities.

The child's body was found on the side of the road. Mullis fled Texas but surrendered to authorities in Philadelphia. One of his attorney's, Shawn Nolan, said he didn't plan to file any further appeals prior to the execution.

He told an appeals court that Mullis had been treated for ""profound mental illness"" since he was 3 years old, was sexually abused as a child and was ""severely bipolar."" The U.S. Supreme Court has prohibited the use of the death penalty for the intellectually disabled, but not for those with serious mental illness.

Texas has sued the Biden-Harris administration's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) for waging war against the state's oil and gas industry.

According to the Texas General Land Office (GLO), the administration's classification of the Dunes Sagebrush Lizard as an endangered species was unlawful and violated the Endangered Species Act.

GLO Commissioner Dawn Buckingham said that the Biden-Harris administration's decision to classify the lizard as endangered negatively ""could have a crippling impact on the oil and gas industry,"" which in turn will result in job losses across the state and decreased revenue for the Permanent School Fund (PSF) and Permanent University Fund (PUF).

""As a mom, I know our children are the leaders and workforce of tomorrow,"" she said. ""Ensuring they have a quality education is one of my top priorities. Part of my responsibility as the Texas Land Commissioner is to provide billions of dollars from our vast oil-rich lands to help fund public education.""

Buckingham said that GLO would use ""all tools at my disposal to fight back and ensure Texas remains the best place to live, work and raise a family.""

Young voters in GA. will have a huge stake in the election. What do they want? : Consider This from NPR,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/24/1201394726/young-voters-in-ga-will-have-a-huge-stake-in-the-election-what-do-they-want,2024-09-24T23:04:57Z,"A young girl holds a ""Vote"" pin in her hands while attending the Atlanta Dream game at Gateway Center Arena in Atlanta.

Consider This host Mary Louise Kelly wanted to find out what young voters in Georgia are most concerned with ahead of the presidential election this year.

Naturally, she found herself at the heart of discourse and democracy: a Mexican restaurant in Atlanta, hosting an event for the Atlanta young Republicans.

There, the group had gathered to eat chips and work towards getting 1000 postcards written and addressed, urging voters to support two down ballot GOP candidates.

At the top of the ticket, group members are divided on Donald Trump. The group president, 39 year old Winslow Jones, says some love him, while others have issues.

""I think what we're all united on is, this is a much bigger picture here that we need to look at. I can tell you, young Republicans are worried about the economy and the border and crime and safety, local crime and safety, especially around here,"" Jones told NPR.

Across the table, was the president of the statewide group, Georgia young Republicans.

25 year old Jacquelyn Harn has a different reply for whether she and her peers are feeling excited about this third Trump run for the presidency.

""We're excited for a change, and we realize we want the life that we had four years ago whenever President Trump was president and his policies, his conservative policies, we need those back and we want those not to be able to achieve our version of the American dream again.""

Housing costs, Harn says, are a huge priority to her and other young voters, who don't feel like things would improve under Harris.

Next, Kelly visits the Harriz/Walz headquarters where a text banking event is underway.

Pizza boxes are stacked on white folding tables. A handful of what look like twenty-somethings are busy typing away on laptops. And at the front of the room, a screen displays dozens more joining via Zoom. This is a joint event, co-hosted by Young Democrats of Georgia and Men for Choice.

Altogether, they tell her, they've fired off 50,000 texts from this gathering. And they're aiming them at a very specific group: men of color, 27 to 50 years old.

Davante Jennings, is the 28-year-old president of the Young Democrats:

""The backbone of the Democratic Party is the black vote, which is why the Republicans are heavily focused on black men specifically. And we know when we show up how elections seem to kind of flip. And right now, it's not 100% guaranteed that we're going to get all of the black vote,"" he told NPR.

He says he's equal parts energized and exhausted at this point in the election cycle. He says the game changer was when President Biden decided to exit the race.

""When VP Harris announced that she was running. I don't know what happened. Things just got crazy out of nowhere. Like more people involved. More support, more work, more canvassing, more text banking. But it's good, it's good.""

Kerwin Swint is a professor of political science at Kennesaw State University, the last stop on this informational road trip.

""Since the Obama years, the youth vote really has sided with the Democratic presidential candidate more often than not,"" he told NPR.

""In 2020, the turnout was up across the board, partly because of mail in balloting, making it easier for people to vote. So participation was up and that was very much true for young voters who had the highest participation rate in about 20 years.""

It was also national voter registration day when the Consider This team visited Kennesaw's campus.

The nonpartisan group Poder Latinx had a tent out, distributing pins and stickers and snacks, waving students over, and encouraging them to register.

It seemed to be working: the group managed to register 81 voters.

Some of them shared what they were most concerned with leading up to the election. For Yahir Rodriguez, his top items were immigration, education, the economy and housing.

He's a first year student at Kennesaw State and a first generation voter whose parents immigrated from Mexico. He belongs to a growing demographic in the state:, almost 10 percent of Georgia's population is Hispanic or Latino, according to the 2020 census.

He says housing is an especially important issue for him and other young voters.

""We see that rent prices are going up, and how housing is getting expensive everywhere. We're seeing that there are more and more corporate landlords and that's raising the housing prices for everyone around us and even if you want to buy a home, that's also raising the prices and everything.""

Rodriguez is looking forward to voting for Harris. But some of his peers don't share that sentiment, like 19-year-old Lambianze Jackson, who says both candidates have bad policies.

Jackson says she'll be voting for Harris this November, and that the overturning of Roe v Wade makes that an easy choice for a young woman of color like herself.

But she adds: there's room for improvement if Harris wants to win over other young voters.

""Kamala, she doesn't really explain her policies well. Like she mainly talks about tax cuts for the middle class but like, she doesn't really have policies,"" Jackson told NPR."

Opening this week's card is a contest between two Brazilians competing in the women's strawweight division. Alexia Thainara is a 26-year-old with a 10-1 record with six subs, one knockout, and three decisions. She faces the 7-0 Rose Conceicao, whose last fight was for the interim LFA strawweight strap. The 27-year-old Conceicao has two subs, one knockout, and four decision wins.

Neither of these women has fought in 2024, so there is some concern about ring rust on both sides of the cage. Conceicao is the -145 betting favorite over Thainara, who comes in as the +114 betting underdog.

Cam Teague vs. Kevin Vallejos

Next up on this week's DWCS card is a featherweight scrap. In that contest, the 7-0 (four knockouts, two submissions, one decision) Cam Teague faces the 13-1 (nine knockouts, two submissions, two decision) Kevin Vallejos. Teague fights out of Alabama, while Vallejos is from Argentina.

Teague turned pro in 2023 and has fought three times this year. Vallejos has been a pro since 2021 and has one fight in 2024.

The more experienced Vallejos is a -345 betting favorite over the +250 Teague.

Vallejos appeared on the 2023 edition of DWCS, where he dropped a decision to Jean Silva, who is now 3-0 in the UFC and coming off a July win over Drew Dober. Teague is coming off a stoppage win over former UFC fighter Austin Lingo on a Fury FC card.

This bout should be an exciting striking matchup. The betting pick is Vallejos via knockout in the second half of the scrap.

Kevin Christian vs. Francesco Mazzeo

A light heavyweight bout sits in the middle of Tuesday's DWCS fight card. In that matchup, Kevin Christian (8-2) faces Francesco Mazzeo (4-0).

Christian turned pro in 2014. He came off a break of more than four years when he faced Miguel Porto on an LFA card this year. Mazzeo has been a pro since 2021. His past three outings have come under the Cage Warriors banner.

Christian is a -160 betting favorite over Mazzeo, who comes into Tuesday at +124.

Something to be aware of when looking at this fight is that Mazzeo only has two ""legit"" wins (for lack of a better term). One of his victories came by disqualification, and another after his opponent was unable to continue due to injury. The reality is that this fight should not be a part of a DWCS fight card.

Don't expect a high-level competition here, but the pick is Christian to win via submission, but there's also a chance of a Mazzeo win via KO if Christian does not employ his grappling.

Daniel Frunza vs. Vadym Kutsyi

A welterweight bout between Daniel Frunza and Vadym Kutsyi is next on the card. Frunza (8-2) has been with LFA for his past two outings. The 30-year-old has seven knockouts and one decision win. He is on a four-fight winning streak. His last fight came in October 2023. Meanwhile, Kutsyi (17-1) has fought for Brave CF in his two most recent scraps. However, he has not competed since December 2022. Kutsyi has five career knockouts, seven subs, and five decision victories.

The oddsmakers have Kutsyi as a -238 favorite over Frunza, who is listed at +180.

Look for Kutsyi to win this matchup via submission.

Danylo Voievodkin vs. Bailey Schoenfelder

In the feature bout of Week 7 of Season 8 of the DWCS we have a heavyweight matchup between two unbeaten competitors in Danylo Voievodkin and Bailey Schoenfelder. Voievodkin (6-0) has five knockouts and one submission. Schoenfelder (5-0) has four knockouts and one submission.

Schoenfelder has fought for more recognizable organizations with two bouts for Bellator, two for LFA, and most recently competing under the Cage Fury banner.

The odds have Schoenfelder as a massive -660 favorite over the +420 Voievodkin.

This is a heavyweight fight so it could go either way, but the betting pick is for Schoenfelder to get a knockout win.

"Shailene Woodley could hardly walk, was losing her hearing during undisclosed health struggle in early 20s",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/shailene-woodley-could-hardly-walk-losing-her-hearing-during-undisclosed-health-struggle-early-20s,2024-09-24T22:38:18Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Shailene Woodley elaborated on a ""personal"" health struggle she went through in her early 20s this week.

The ""Ferrari"" actress, 32, said while she was filming 2014's ""Divergent"" her health began to deteriorate to the point where she could hardly walk, eat or hear.

""I haven't spoken about exactly what it was because that just feels like a personal thing that I don't need to disclose,"" she told Dear Media's ""SHE MD"" podcast hosts Dr. Thais Alialabi and Mary Alice Haney, ""but essentially I was in a position in my early 20s, it got to the point where I was losing my hearing. I couldn't walk for longer than five minutes at a time without having to lay down for hours and hours and hours and sleep. Everything I ate hurt my stomach. It was this conflation of issues and diagnoses and different doctors telling me different things.""

She said because she ""comes from a very holistic background"" and studied herbalism, she decided to work with ""real MDs"" and ""independent healers"" in ""just trying to search for some sense of comfort in my own skin.""

""And it was a long journey, about a decade of unwinding and healing and getting healthy, and throughout that decade a lot of other things came from feeling so much discomfort, which was 'My God, if everything I'm eating hurts my stomach, I'm now suddenly afraid of food.' And then going into the kind of mental f-----y that can happen with that of body dysmorphia and confusion about, you know, identity in feeling safe in my own capsule, in my own skin and what that meant and what that should be.""

She said the ailment ultimately physically ""resolved itself"" and she's now ""very healthy.""

""I'm so happy to be able to say that,"" she confessed.

Woodley starred as Tris in ""Divergent,"" about a woman who realizes she doesn't fit in a dystopian world and her life is in danger. She made two other movies in the series: ""Insurgent"" and ""Allegiant"" in 2015 and 2016.

Woodley told the podcast hosts that her health journey forced her to become more ""introspective.""

""That I guess was the path for me along with the physical healing was acknowledging the mental side of the healing process for myself, which involved looking at real traumas and real PTSD that I had experienced at various times in my life without going into detail about what they were,"" Woodey explained.

She said those traumas ""definitely took a toll on my body and took a toll, I think, emotionally, which then got stuck in my body and affected me, and I've always eaten very healthily and I'm very athletic, so it was a confusing process for me to go 'What am I doing wrong? Why am I passing out every month when I get my period? Why am I hypothyroid? Why am I all of these things?'""

Various doctors had suggested she had endometriosis, a tilted uterus or a heart-shaped uterus, she said.

""Every person I went to was giving me mixed information, and it sent me on my own journey of I kind of, what you just said, I don't feel safe with any of these people that are guiding me 'cause I feel like they actually are figuring it out along the way as well, and so I might as well take this into my own hands and devote myself to educating myself about so many subjects and approaching it from an internal holistic place.""

Woodley said she's no longer on thyroid or any other medication anymore.

""My hormones are so balanced, and everything is pumping in the way that it should,"" she added. ""And I believe ultimately the thing that led me there alongside again the physical aspects was acknowledging that I was in a constant state of fight or flight.

""My nervous system was super sympathetic and very much operating from a place of fear and a place of 'Where's the lion in the room?' constantly approaching every single moment with high alert and with red flags because I hadn't yet established what a calm nervous system could look like and what true safety in myself could look like. And once I focused on that and really became devotional and disciplined in that practice, physically everything began to change and balanced out for me.""

She explained later that when there's an obstacle in her life she tends to ""run headfirst towards it, but in the past I would run towards it with a lack of awareness about needing to make sure I was OK in the process."""
This 100% Mexican Owned Mezcal Celebrates Its Culture Past And Present,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/claudiaalarcon/2024/09/24/this-100-mexican-owned-mezcal-celebrates-its-culture-past-and-present/,2024-09-24T22:11:08Z,"Isabel Santiago grew up among the agave fields in Oaxaca, in the Zapotec region of Santiago Matatlán, considered by many the epicenter of mezcal production. Her great grandfather, Valente Santiago, was a field worker in an agave plantation, where he learned the craft. This knowledge, passed through her grandfather then her father, finally came to Isabel. An engineer by trade, she is proud to be the first woman to distill mezcal in her family.

""My father broke down the barriers imposed by machismo and believed I could follow in his steps,"" says Santiago. ""He has always supported and pushed me to continue forward. Once I understood that being a woman is an asset and not an obstacle, I got the strength to continue this craft that my father taught me. I have proven that anything is possible, but becoming a maestra mezcalera has been a difficult journey.""

Her endurance and hard work paid off big time when young entrepreneur Diego de la Vega came knocking. After earning his law degree, de la Vega left his native Mexico to pursue master's degrees from University of Southern California, Los Angeles. Living in L.A., he missed many things from his upbringing, including the tradition of drinking mezcal. He wanted to share that with newfound friends but could not find a spirit that satisfied the flavor and quality standards to which he was accustomed, so he decided to take matters into his own hands.

After much research, this dream led him to the Santiago family doorstep, where Isabel's knowledge and impeccable craft captivated him. He had assembled a group of like-minded Mexican nationals and first-generation sons and daughters of immigrants living in L.A who were willing to follow in the mezcal path. Forming a bond over their roots and traditions and uniting to create a brand that celebrates the culture and artistry of their heritage was the seed from which ZOMOZ Mezcal grew.

The brand was released last year and is already carving a notable niche in an overcrowded market. The name of the brand reflects the founder's commitment to their unity and heritage. ZOMOZ is an alternative spelling of the word somos, which means ""we are.""

""We are a Mexican owned, Mexican made brand, not another 'white label' mezcal. Many brands today are owned by Americans, made for the U.S. market. For us, ZOMOZ is more than a mezcal, it's a taste of home. It represents family, friends, love, hard work, and our culture,"" says de la Vega.

Using agave espadin grown on the Santiago family plantation, which holds U.S. Organic Certification, the agaves mature for at least seven years before harvesting. Using ethically sourced local wood, the agave is left to roast slowly for five to six continuous days in a traditional conical pit. The cooked agave is crushed by a stone tahona pulled by the beloved family horse.

The resulting pulp and juices are mixed with well water and allowed to ferment in pine wood tanks for another five to six days, depending on weather conditions. To achieve a smooth finish and a 40% alcohol level, ZOMOZ is distilled twice using a proprietary process developed by Isabel before its final quality check.

So far, ZOMOZ has accrued Double Gold San Francisco World Spirits Competition 2024, Double Gold in New York World Spirits Competition 2023 and Gold in Los Angeles Spirits Awards that same year. And all with a low-key, grassroots approach to marketing, which is unusual for a brand developed in Los Angeles.

""I get asked a lot why we don't have a celebrity as the face of the brand. But we do have a celebrity - our culture is the celebrity,"" says de la Vega. ""We aim to be the mezcal brand that represents Mexican identity in today's modern culture, celebrating the immigrant experience and the hard-working Mexican people who have refined the process of making mezcal over generations.""

De la Vega insists that the focus of the brand is on the mezcal and the people who make it.

""We focus on quality. Making an artisanal mezcal is such a complex process that requires significant hard work and depends significantly on natural elements. We like to highlight these [aspects] instead. Our flavor profile is carefully crafted to be the perfect introduction to mezcal and change the consumer perception of it. Smooth, refreshing and friendly, but without losing the essence of the maguey, for those who are looking to try something new.""

The team behind ZOMOZ - de la Vega and Santiago, plus Marlene Avitia, Eloy Cantu and Mike Fonseca - come from different backgrounds and career paths but have come together through their roots to share their traditions of the past, present and future.

""We believe we are living through a Mexican Renaissance, with the eyes of the world upon us and marveling at our traditions, our art, our colors, our food, music and drinks,"" says de la Vega. ""While everything Mexican is now fashionable, we are legitimately and deeply Mexican.""

Greg Seider is the author of Alchemy In A Glass: The Essential Guide To Hand Crafted Cocktails; The Luxury Collection Cocktail Book, co-owns award winning cocktail bars The Summit Bar and Manhattan Cricket Club, and consults on and partners with dozens more programs, events, and brands worldwide.

""The classic French 75 with gin is such an iconic celebratory cocktail. But pivoting with the elegance of the Zomos Mezcal elevates the cocktail with that extra level of hand-crafted terroir. The smokiness is understated, with hints of vanilla, dry lemon and white pepper. It's such a connecting sipping experience to enjoy the celebratory nature of Mexican culture,"" he says.

"New lawsuit accuses Sean Combs of rape, recording assault later distributed as porn",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/24/g-s1-24401/sean-diddy-combs-graves-rape-lawsuit,2024-09-24T22:02:46Z,"Another woman has come forward with sexual assault allegations against Sean ""Diddy"" Combs. Thalia Graves alleges that Combs and his bodyguard, Joseph Sherman, tied her up and violently raped her in a Bad Boys recording studio the summer of 2001, recorded the attack without her knowledge and later distributed the video as pornography.

In both her 26-page civil suit and a televised press conference held by her lawyer, Gloria Allred, Graves says she was 25 years old at the time of the assault and met the Bad Boy owner while she was dating a record producer who was working for the label. Graves alleges Combs invited her to a Manhattan recording studio where he offered her a drink that she believes was laced with drugs; she fell unconscious soon after drinking it. When she woke up, Graves claims she was naked with her hands ""bound and restrained"" with what she thinks was a plastic bag.

Graves says Combs entered the room naked and that he and Sherman, a.k.a. Big Joe, then took turns raping her vaginally and anally. When she tried to escape from under him, Combs slammed her head into a pool table, knocking her unconscious again. When she woke up, Graves alleges that Sherman slapped her and forced her to perform oral sex until she passed out a third time. The civil suit states that ""both men were undeterred by the Plaintiff's cries for help throughout the attack.""

Once she regained consciousness, she claims she found herself alone in the studio and ran out as fast as she could. The lawsuit alleges that she was ""terrified of what Combs would do to her and her family if she reported him"" and did not get a rape kit. When she confided in her then boyfriend, Graves says he discouraged her from disclosing the assault out of fear of how it could negatively impact his own career.

Graves says she never recovered from the 2001 assault, physically or emotionally, suffering from severe depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal ideations. She claims that both Combs and Sherman contacted her periodically over the years and ""warned her to be silent.""

Graves is now the 11th plaintiff to file a civil suit against the hip-hop figure since last fall. In November 2023, singer Cassandra ""Cassie"" Ventura, an ex-girlfriend of Combs, detailed a decade of alleged abuse, coercion and sex trafficking suffered at his hands. Ventura's bombshell filing was settled out of court within 24 hours of news breaking, but her accusations inspired many others to come forward with allegations of Combs' sexual misconduct and violence. Other plaintiffs who've come forward with accusations against him include singer Dawn Richard, choreographer LaurieAnn Gibson and producer Rodney Jones as well as young women from the early 1990s.

Combs has repeatedly asserted his innocence through a firewall of statements made through lawyers in the last year, but when video of the disgrace magnate attacking Ventura in a hotel hallway from 2016 surfaced, he posted a public apology to her on his Instagram account.

In November 2023, around the same time of Ventura's watershed filing, Graves says she learned for the first time that the mogul had videotaped himself and Sherman raping her and had shown the video to multiple men in order to humiliate her and her then-boyfriend. At the time of the attack, Sherman was the founder of Rhymes N Dimes Magazine, Inc. and Graves believes the recording of her assault was also distributed as pornography through the bodyguard's media network. Learning this caused Graves to relive the assault and fall back into suicidal ideation.

Though Graves is now one of many civil filings, her accusations are the first since Combs was arrested on federal sex trafficking and racketeering charges last week in New York. The federal indictment, which alleges that Combs used his record label, Bad Boy Entertainment, to operate a sex trafficking ring for her own gratification, mirrors the narratives in many of the civil court suits.

Combs pleaded not guilty to all charges listed in the indictment and is currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn awaiting trial."
"Sen. Sinema lambastes Harris over call to scrap abortion filibuster: 'Absolutely terrible, shortsighted idea'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-sinema-lambastes-harris-over-call-scrap-abortion-filibuster-absolutely-terrible-shortsighted-idea,2024-09-24T21:36:56Z,"Tricia McLaughlin and Roma Daravi join 'Fox News @ Night' to discuss how former President Trump is nationally polling ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris.

Arizona Independent Senator Krysten Sinema criticized Vice President Kamala Harris after the presidential nominee voiced her support for eliminating the Senate filibuster in an effort to pass a law restoring abortio protections nationwide.

""To state the supremely obvious, eliminating the filibuster to codify Roe v Wade also enables a future Congress to ban all abortion nationwide,"" Sinema, who left the Democratic Party in 2022, wrote on X.

""What an absolutely terrible, shortsighted idea,"" she added.

JOE MANCHIN SAYS HE WON'T ENDORSE HARRIS OVER SUPPORT FOR ELIMINATION FILIBUSTER

Sen. Joe Manchin (I-W.V.), a strong supporter of the filibuster, echoed Sinema's comments, saying that the filibuster is the ""Holy Grail of democracy.""

""Shame on her,"" Manchin said at the Capitol, CNN reported. ""She knows the filibuster is the Holy Grail of democracy. It's the only thing that keeps us talking and working together. If she gets rid of that, then this would be the House on steroids.""

Sinema's sharp criticism came after Harris voiced her thoughts about ending the filibuster on Wisconsin Public Radio (WPR).

The filibuster is a Senate rule that allows a minority to block legislation pending a supermajority vote, so ending it would make it easier to pass laws related to abortion rights.

""I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe,"" Harris said during a WPR interview Tuesday. ""And get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do.""

DEMS LOOK TO FORCE VOTES ON EMERGENCY ABORTION AS ABORTION PILL DEATHS MAKE HEADLINES

In the interview Harris also said it was ""it is well within our reach"" to keep a Democratic Senate majority and ""take back the House.""

""I would also emphasize that while the presidential election is extremely important and dispositive of where we go moving forward, it also is about what we need to do to hold onto the Senate and win seats in the House,"" Harris said.

Harris, who has made abortion access a central issue in her campaign, said in 2022 that Congress needed to codify Roe v Wade into law and, ""if the filibuster gets in the way, the Senate needs to make an exception to get it done.""

""With just two more seats in the Senate, we can codify Roe v. Wade, we can put the protection of Roe into law,"" Harris said in September 2022. ""With two more seats in the United States Senate, we can pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Two more seats.""

ENIGMATIC VOTER GROUP COULD SPLIT TICKET FOR TRUMP, DEM SENATE CANDIDATE IN ARIZONA

""You know, our President, Joe Biden, he's been clear. He's kinda done with those archaic Senate rules that are standing in the way of those two issues,"" Harris said of the Senate filibuster in 2022. ""He's made that clear and has said that he will not allow that to obstruct those two issues. And, you know, for me, as vice president, I'm also president of the Senate.... I cannot wait to cast the deciding vote to break the filibuster on voting rights and reproductive rights. I cannot wait! Fifty-nine days.""

Democrats would need to maintain control of the Senate to change rules affecting the filibuster.

Opinion | The early success of Sally Rooney's 'Intermezzo' proves something much deeper,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/sally-rooneys-new-novel-intermezzo-became-celebrity-obsession-rcna172468,2024-09-24T21:13:22Z,"Kristin Davis and Sarah Jessica Parker on the set of ""And Just Like That"" in New York City in June. James Devaney / GC Images

By all accounts, Sally Rooney's highly anticipated fourth novel was not a typical book release. When it comes to a galley release, most books get the same treatment: paperback advanced copies, called ARCs or gallies, are released five months or so ahead of publication and then once again after the official cover is released. By design, this drums up interest, excitement and media ahead of the publishing date. But frankly, should you have a foothold in the literary world, gallies are generally not that hard to get ahold of.

Not so for this book. Just 2,500 copies of ""Intermezzo,"" Rooney's latest book, were reportedly sent to journalists, critics, influencers, booksellers -- and celebrities. Each galley was named and numbered. The result was sudden, dramatic and frenzied. Sarah Jessica Parker was photographed reading an advanced copy in July on the set of ""And Just Like That."" My social media pages were plastered with photos of ""Intermezzo"" resting aesthetically next to an Aperol Spritz on a wrought iron table, or strategically covering the face of a bikini-clad lit-fluencer reading on a high-pile beach towel. Everyone wanted a copy. ""Intermezzo"" had become a status symbol.

The novel is written in close third person, with chapters that alternate between two brothers, Peter and Ivan. Peter is a 32-year-old Dublin lawyer, torn between his 23-year-old girlfriend, Naomi, and his ex-girlfriend, Sylvia, with whom he is still very much in love. Ivan, a former chess prodigy who, much to his brother's frustration, lacks some social faculties, is in love for the very first time with a woman 14 years his senior. Peter and Ivan's relationship, strained at the loss of their father and plagued by fundamental misunderstandings, is the bedrock of the novel. ""Intermezzo"" explores the realities of generational divide, the push-pull of brotherhood and family, and the constrains of time. Because it's Rooney, ""Intermezzo"" saliently explores love, sex, grief and guilt with her trademark stripped-down writing style.

Whether or not the book is any good is entirely beside the point. By commodifying a novel into a status symbol, its literary merit becomes secondary, maybe even entirely irrelevant. It's like a designer handbag: If you want one and you're going to buy one, reports of subpar craftsmanship and evidence of inflated cost are of little consequence. The reality, though, is that even without the scarcity-model galley frenzy, Rooney was already experiencing increasingly devout internet fandom. For better or for worse.

Like author Colleen Hoover, a comparison I am deeply reluctant to make, much of Rooney's readership is chronically online young women. #Intermezzo, for example, had 130,000 posts on Instagram on Thursday. Now that the book is out, there will be many, many more. BookTok, Bookstagram, and the influencers that drive them, have the power to propel an author from obscurity to literary royalty. The problem is, they're making their money from book reviews too. It might not pay to introduce a more obscure title into the millions of reviews on social media. The result is a revolving door of familiar authors and books, Rooney among them. Does this undermine her? It could -- but it doesn't, because Sally Rooney is an excellent writer.

""Intermezzo"" was destined for popularity and success largely because so many readers, including this one, love Rooney. Often called the ""Salinger of the Snapchat generation,"" Rooney adeptly captures millennial anxiety, aspiration and reality. Readers love her sincere appreciation for love, her nuanced characters, her restrained writing style, and her women-centered sex scenes.

Despite her meteoric success in literary circles, online, and in whatever overlap exists between them both, she is notoriously private. It's ironic, really. Rooney's deliberate attempts to eschew the spotlight are a large part of what has made her shine so brightly. Take her own celebrity-laden book party hosted by actress Emma Roberts, which she didn't even attend. Vogue, which covered the event, attributed her absence to the physical distance between County Mayo, Ireland and New York's 11th Avenue and how Rooney ""prefers to let her work be the star of the show."" Even if that is entirely true, there would have been less to write in the feature had she had just gone to the party.

Rooney has rejected celebrity to the best of her ability since the onset of her career in 2017 with the massive success of ""Conversations with Friends."" Once, in 2018, she deactivated her X account, then called Twitter, after posting, ""novelists are given too much cultural prominence."" And that was before she cemented her place as a BookTok immortal with a historic galley rollout. Rooney has often decried fame as a barometer for success; notable, certainly, in a culture now accustomed to cheap and deliberate fame grabs. But Rooney, now incredibly wealthy and influential, can no longer claim victim to her runaway success. ""Intermezzo"" as a status symbol proves that.

On Monday night, à la Harry Potter and Twilight madness of yesteryear, there were ""Intermezzo"" midnight release parties at book shops across the country. These community events for booklovers, apparently just excited to read the latest from their favorite author, feel much more akin to who Rooney is still trying to hold on to. A real, honest-to-God, Irish writer, just outside of the shine of the spotlight. Whether or not she can, remains to be seen.

Although the list is short, ""Intermezzo"" is not the first novel to go viral before publication. Last summer, for example, we had Emma Cline's ""The Guest."" Aside from what a dizzying example of late-stage capitalism, this galley mania is (sorry to Rooney, a self-proclaimed Marxist), it also speaks to the renewed cultural capital of literature.

Something is happening to books. Between the nonstop attacks on access to books in public schools, the hugely influential rise of BookTok and the emergence of book-as-status, literature has proven to be a key tenant to mid-2020s culture. We say this a lot on MSNBC's Velshi Banned Book Club: books have power. If you don't believe me, go and try to find a copy of ""Intermezzo"" at your local bookshop. I am sure it has sold out."

Welcome back to The Prompt.

In a blog post, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made some bold claims about the promise of artificial intelligence, saying that as models continue to be trained on more data and computational power, they will improve people's lives through a variety of applications, from virtual tutoring to healthcare to scientific discovery. ""Although it will happen incrementally, astounding triumphs - fixing the climate, establishing a space colony, and the discovery of all of physics - will eventually become commonplace,"" he wrote.

But not everyone is optimistic about the impacts of AI. California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a new law making it illegal to distribute deepfake and AI-generated political advertisements. Elsewhere, companies like Cloudflare have rolled out tools to detect and block AI crawler bots from scraping websites without consent in an effort to protect content creators from having their data used for training and to help prevent website owners from facing massive surges in their ISP bills.

Now let's get into the headlines.

Artificial intelligence has a new major backer: Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, also known as the Public Investment Fund, which has acquired stakes in leading AI startups like French AI model builder Mistral and $43 billion data analytics and AI platform Databricks, Forbes reported. The oil-rich middle eastern kingdom plows about $3 billion every year into tech investments and is reportedly planning to push $40 billion into AI startups over the next few years in partnership with top Silicon Valley VC firms.

LinkedIn is scraping user data to train its AI models as well as Microsoft's models, Forbes reported. The professional networking platform is -- by default -- opting its 1 billion users into allowing the company to train its AI models on their data, without getting their explicit consent or informing them before making the change. LinkedIn is following the footsteps of other tech giants like Elon Musk's X and Meta, who've also surreptitiously updated their policies to train their models on people's social media posts.

AI-powered hiring platform Mercor raised $32 million in venture funding from Benchmark and billionaires like Peter Thiel and Jack Dorsey, Forbes reported. The new funding round values the nascent, but profitable, startup at $250 million. That platform uses machine learning to help match the right workers to the right companies for various roles. Founded by three 21-year-old college dropouts Brendan Foody, Adarsh Hiremath and Surya Midha, the startup's AI software has screened and vetted some 300,000 potential candidates and conducted 100,000 job interviews.

In between bites of al pastor tacos and sips of a margarita, Von Ahn, founder and CEO of the language learning app Duolingo, talks about how AI will make some jobs disappear, and workers will need to be retrained.

He speaks from experience: Late last year, Duolingo decided not to renew the contracts of about 10% of its contracted workforce who did translations and lesson writing, instead opting to use AI for those tasks in some cases. ""Our stance as a company is that if we can automate something, we will,"" von Ahn said now of the dismissals. ""A full time employee's job is very hard to automate. But we had some hourly contractors who were doing pretty rote stuff.""

While he firmly believes it was the right call for his company, he's cognizant of the broader problems AI will bring. ""It's a tough situation that'll affect the poor, the less educated,"" he said. ""And not just in the U.S., but in poor countries.""

But longer term, von Ahn is optimistic that AI could unlock new possibilities for learning, bringing high-quality education to the masses. He thinks languages can help lift people out of poverty, noting that, for non-native speakers, learning English instantly broadens a person's earning potential and opens up a whole new world of jobs. He sees Duolingo on the forefront of the transition to AI-powered learning, with the ultimate moonshot of creating an automated AI tutor that can teach anyone a foreign language.

On Tuesday, Duolingo unveiled its first step in that direction: An interactive feature in which users partake in ""video calls"" with Lily, one of Duolingo's beloved mascots -- a purple-haired, sarcastic, cartoon woman. Chatting with Lily allows people to practice conversing in other languages as if FaceTiming with an AI friend, with dialogue generated by OpenAI's GPT-4o model.

This AI company has crossed 100 million in annual recurring revenue by automating rote workplace tasks like looking up information, troubleshooting It issues and submitting PTO requests.

Maria Friedman Returns To Cafe Carlyle After 18-Year Absence,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/janelevere/2024/09/24/maria-friedman-returns-to-cafe-carlyle-after-18-year-absence/,2024-09-24T19:22:26Z,"Olivier and Tony Award-winning performer and director to sing songs by Sondheim, Hamlisch, Legrand, Beatles and others in a space where she says she can perform "" close-up magic.""

Maria Friedman, a multi-talented British musical theater performer and director, is returning to New York's Café Carlyle this week for the first time in 18 years.

Friedman -- who directed the recent off-Broadway and Broadway productions of Stephen Sondheim's ""Merrily We Roll Along,"" the latter of which won four Tony Awards earlier this year -- is also a performer: She has won three Olivier Awards in London, for her roles in ""Passion,"" ""Ragtime,"" and her one-woman cabaret, ""By Special Arrangement.""

According to the Café Carlyle, which is located in the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan's Upper East Side, Friedman is considered ""the unrivaled interpreter of the works of Stephen Sondheim, Marvin Hamlisch and Michel Legrand.

The cafe also said Friedman's original performances there, in 2003, 2004, and 2006, were organized by Sondheim and cabaret singer Barbara Cook, who handled the lighting. The sound for those performances was done by Wally Harper, who was Cook's pianist, music director and arranger.

According to a December 2022 article by Ben Brantley in The New York Times, Friedman was cast as Mary, the female lead of ""Merrily We Roll Along,"" in a 1992 production of the musical at the Haymarket Theater in Leicester. She later staged a student production of the musical at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London, which evolved into a 2013 professional production -- which Friedman directed -- at the Menier Chocolate Factory, also in London. This production traveled to Boston in 2017, leading to its most recent incarnations in New York.

A June 2024 article by Michael Paulson in The New York Times said that the Tony Award-winning production of ""Merrily We Roll Along"" was planned before Sondheim's death in 2021. ""Maria said that when he died, she thought about canceling, but was persuaded that's not what he would have wanted,"" the article said.

The Tony's the production won this year were for best musical revival; best orchestration, by Jonathan Tunick; lead actor, Jonathan Groff; and featured actor, Daniel Radcliffe.

In a phone interview with Forbes this week about her upcoming performances, Friedman said she is ""in awe of the talent that's been in this room. I'm terribly grateful to be asked back.""

She called the cafe ""so intimate. You can get to do close-up magic,"" look into the eyes of audience members who are watching her perform. ""You can cast a wonderful spell in that room,"" she added.

Among the composers whose work she will perform are Sondheim, Hamlisch, Legrand, Randy Newman, Joni Mitchell and the Beatles.

Asked what role music plays in today's politically troubled times, Friedman said she believes society doesn't understand that the arts are ""not an add-on. They are the cake,"" teaching people how to practice empathy, look at humanity in a forgiving way.

She said she teaches young people whenever she can, noting that it is vital for them to experience the different platforms they can perform in.

Friedman will perform her show, ""Maria Friedman: Legacy,"" at the café at 8:45 p.m. nightly from September 24 through 28."
Sean 'Diddy' Combs And Bodyguard Accused Of Filming Drugged Woman's Assault: A Complete Timeline Of Allegations Against Him,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2024/09/24/sean-diddy-combs-and-bodyguard-accused-of-filming-drugged-womans-assault-a-complete-timeline-of-allegations-against-him/,2024-09-24T19:12:21Z,"Rapper Sean ""Diddy"" Combs has been hit with a new civil lawsuit by a woman who claims she was drugged and raped by the music mogul and his bodyguard Joseph Sherman, who are also accused of recording the assault and showing it to others, in the latest in a series of sexual misconduct lawsuits Combs has denied.

An upcoming docuseries. Producer Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson said Tuesday that Netflix had won a ""bidding war"" for a docuseries about the string of recent abuse, rape and sex trafficking allegations against Combs. Jackson confirmed in a tweet Tuesday that the streamer bought the G-Unit Film & Television series about Combs he first started teasing in December, adding that, ""if more victims keep coming out, I'm gonna need more episodes."" Proceeds from the film go to victims of sexual assault, Jackson said in November.

Combs posted to Instagram in May to apologize for his ""disgusting"" behavior in the surveillance video that showed him grabbing, dragging and kicking Cassie in 2016. The video seemed to back up much of the claims Ventura made in her November lawsuit, which an attorney for Combs called ""offensive and outrageous"" at the time. Los Angeles District Attorney's Office called the video ""extremely disturbing"" and ""difficult to watch"" but said no charges would be filed because the apparent assault took place beyond the statue of limitation in California. In his apology video, Combs said the events occurred in ""one of the darkest times"" of his life and said he was ""truly sorry"" for his behavior. Meredith Firetog, one of Ventura's lawyers, later slammed the apology as disingenuous in a statement and said it was ""more about himself than the many people he has hurt."" In Ventura's November lawsuit, she accused Combs of paying the hotel in which the surveillance video was captured $50,000 for the footage.

Combs' former personal chef, Cindy Rueda, accused Combs in a since-settled 2017 sexual harassment lawsuit of having her prepare and serve food to the rapper and his guests while they were engaged in sexual activity or right after they had done so.

The allegations contained in lawsuits against Combs date as far back as the 1990s, when he founded his own record label, Bad Boy Records, which Rolling Stone has called ""one of the most influential hip-hop labels of all time."" The label has signed major artists like The Notorious B.I.G., Janelle Monáe and Cassie, and has put out several of Combs' own albums, including ""Press Play"" and ""Last Train To Paris."" Combs sold a 50% stake in Bad Boy to Warner Music Group in a reported $30 million deal in 2005. Combs has built a fortune through Bad Boy Records, several liquor brands, a fashion label and other ventures. He sold his share in the DeLeón tequila brand for $200 million earlier this year. He was ranked No. 14 on Forbes' list of the highest-paid entertainers in 2022, making an estimated $90 million that year. One of the rapper's raided homes is located in Holmby Hills, an affluent neighborhood where Combs purchased a home for $40 million ten years ago.

Dems look to force votes on emergency abortion as abortion pill deaths make headlines,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-look-force-votes-emergency-abortion-abortion-pill-deaths-make-headlines,2024-09-24T18:55:07Z,"Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich has the latest on the vice president's efforts to highlight the death of a Georgia woman who took an abortion pill on 'Special Report.'

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Senate President Pro tempore Patty Murray, D-Wash., and others revealed on Tuesday their plans to force votes on abortion-related bills in the wake of two pregnant women's deaths after taking abortion pills.

In floor remarks, Schumer said, ""What happened in Georgia is a direct example of how abortion bans continue to exacerbate the racial disparities in maternal death. Amber's doctors didn't perform the medical procedures they knew she needed because of Georgia's law.""

""It was the law overruling their good medical judgment. She went into septic shock and her heart stopped - all while doctors did everything except the medically-sound treatment she needed,"" he said, in reference to ProPublica's reporting on the deaths of Candi Miller and Amber Nicole Thurman.

Both of the women died in Georgia after taking abortion pills and suffering complications. In Thurman's case, according to ProPublica, doctors waited a prolonged period of time before performing the necessary dilation and curettage (D&C) procedure, which is not an abortion. Miller was found unresponsive by her family after suffering from the pill's complication.

""Today, as you heard from the leader, we're going to try and pass this resolution, and we're going to see if the Senate can come together with one voice and tell women, 'women, we want to put your health first,'"" Murray said at a press conference.

The Washington Democrat will attempt on Tuesday afternoon to advance her resolution to affirm ""the basic right to emergency health care, including abortion care"" for a vote by unanimous consent. However, this is expected to be objected to by a Republican.

ACCUSATIONS OF IMPROPER TAX BREAKS FLY IN CRUCIAL SENATE RACE: 'RULES DON'T APPLY'

The Democrats' plan to seek forced votes on abortion items comes in response to the deaths of Miller and Thurman, which have caused a dispute over what is to blame.

""Amber Thurman and Candi Miller are two Black mothers who lost their lives in Georgia due to the state's Draconian abortion ban. Women who could have survived if they had been able to get the health care they needed. These are the consequences of Trump abortion bans,"" Murray claimed earlier this month.

Roe v. Wade was overturned in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision in 2022, which turned the authority to determine limitations on abortion back to the states. Former President Trump's appointment of Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett is largely credited for giving conservative justices the majority and pushing the decision over the edge.

ENIGMATIC VOTER GROUP COULD SPLIT TICKET FOR TRUMP, DEM SENATE CANDIDATE IN ARIZONA

Other Democrats have echoed Murray's sentiment, including Vice President Kamala Harris, blaming the overturn of Roe v. Wade for the women's deaths.

Some conservative leaders and groups have pushed back on Democrats' characterization of the women's deaths, including top pro-life organization Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.

SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement, ""Pro-life laws are clear, yet politicians and the media are sowing confusion at women's expense. Across the nation, pro-life laws allow doctors to provide emergency care, and doctors who fail to provide necessary medical care should be held accountable.""

""Pro-abortion Democrats and the abortion industry fearmonger and exploit tragedies resulting from abortions themselves, like the deaths of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller - leaving women confused about the law and scared to get care in emergency situations. These lies have real consequences, and we urge pro-abortion Democrats to value women's safety over limitless abortion,"" she said.

James Lankford, R-Okla., questioned Dr. Christina Francis, an obstetrician and gynecologist, and CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, on the safety of the abortion pill.

""Obviously, we have recent cases of Candi Miller dying from a chemical abortion. FDA has changed the rules of late, to be able to say, 'don't give us information about consequences. Don't even report that. Don't turn it in.' You don't have to get to a doctor to be able to get access to a chemical abortions. There's been lots of conversations I've heard from my Democratic colleagues saying chemical abortions are as safe as Tylenol. Can you tell me a little bit more about chemical abortions?"" he asked.

""Incomplete abortion, where all of the tissue, from all of the fetal tissue and placental tissue don't pass after taking these drugs, occurs in 5 to 10 percent of women. That may sound like a small number, but when you look at the number of chemical abortions that are done in this country every year, that's a significant number of women that are experiencing this complication,"" Francis responded.

She further warned that abortion pills are not on par with Tylenol, remarking, ""These are not safe drugs, and women deserve to have accurate information about that."""
A lead poisoning mystery: How 2 detectives fingered a surprising culprit,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/09/23/nx-s1-5011028/detectives-mystery-lead-poisoning-new-york-bangladesh,2024-09-24T18:50:22Z,"In Bangladesh, turmeric -- sold as the root or in a powder form -- is a popular spice. In the 1980s, some farmers began adding a dye to make the root more attractive to buyers. But there was a problem with the dye. Jenna Forsyth hide caption

He's not talking about a murder spree, a kidnapping or a bank heist.

Lanphear - an environmental epidemiologist at Simon Fraser University - is referring to the fact that an estimated 800 million children around the world are poisoned by lead - lead in their family's pots and pan, lead in their food, lead in the air. That's just about half of all children in low- and middle-income countries, according to UNICEF and the nonprofit Pure Earth.

For decades, very little has been done about this. But this is the story of how two women - a New York City detective and a California student - followed the data and helped crack a puzzling case that spanned the globe in the ongoing ""crime"" of lead poisoning.

Next to a row of courthouses in downtown Manhattan, there's an imposing gray building. On the 6th floor is an office that houses about 50 detectives. They work for New York City's health department. They tackle thousands of cases a year involving kids exposed to toxic elements. And many of those cases are children who have too much lead in their blood.

The detectives' job is to find the culprit. Could it be old chipping paint that's creating lead dust that kids are breathing in? Could the lead be coming home on a parent's clothes from, say, a factory or construction worksite and, then, the child breathes it in? Perhaps it was a toy from overseas, decorated with lead paint, that the kid repeatedly puts in their mouth?

The city detectives often search the child's home armed with a device that resembles a radar gun - point it at, say, a wall, hold the trigger and you get a lead measurement of its paint.

Every time you go on such a mission, ""it is absolutely a lead detective mystery,"" says Paromita Hore, who oversees the detectives as director of environmental exposure assessment and education in the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.

When the mystery is solved -- when they find the source of the lead -- Hore's team helps the family avoid additional exposure.

In the early 2000s, New York City's health department noticed a perplexing blip: A surprisingly large number of Bangladeshi children in New York City were showing up in their lead database.

""This is a problem,"" Hore recalls thinking throughout the multi-year, multi-country effort to unearth the root cause.

As Hore's team of lead detectives busily collected and analyzed samples from items found in the homes of New York's Bangladeshi families, a student in California stumbled on a similar mystery.

Jenna Forsyth was a Ph.D. student in 2014 when her adviser gave her data on over 400 pregnant women in rural Bangladesh. He'd noticed that about half of the women had high levels of lead in their blood.

""I was kind of like, 'Lead? I don't know. Is that really still that big of a problem?"" she remembers thinking to herself. ""'We don't hear about it much anymore.'""

Then, she started reading the literature. And she quickly understood the severity of the Bangladesh lead levels. Lead can damage nearly every organ -- from the kidneys to the heart -- often irreversibly. In this case, both the woman and the fetus would be affected.

Perhaps lead's biggest impact is on the brain. Exposure can lower a child's IQ and spur cognitive decline in adults. It can cause long-term problems with impulsivity, attention and hyperactivity. When you look at the gap between what kids in upper-income and lower-income countries achieve academically, about 20% can be attributed to lead. Treatment can involve vitamin supplements or prescribing an agent that binds to the lead and helps remove it.

Lead exposure is also linked to cardiovascular disease, kidney damage and fertility problems, to name a few. It's estimated that lead kills 1.5 million people each year in addition to those marked by disability and disease. Plus, a series of studies have linked increased lead exposure to societal ills, like higher crime rates and more violence -- likely because lead has been linked to reduced brain volume and impaired brain function.

The World Bank took a stab at estimating how much this all costs - including the lost IQ points, the premature death and the welfare costs. They found the world's price tag for lead exposure is a whopping 6 trillion dollars annually - nearly 7% of the global gross domestic product.

""I was like, 'Wow! Lead is just incredibly toxic,'"" Forsyth recalls. ""It's one of the most toxic elements in the periodic table.""

And so, she dug into that data from Bangladesh.

""The prevalence of elevated blood lead levels in those women was about six times higher than those in Flint, Michigan, at the peak of the water crisis,"" she says, remembering how Flint's situation was considered horrific. ""There was just this puzzle: Why would there be really high levels of lead poisoning in rural Bangladesh with no obvious source?""

Forsyth became so curious that she got on a plane and went to Bangladesh, where she teamed up with a renowned health research institute based there called icddr,b -- formerly the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh. Together, they interviewed the pregnant women with high lead levels and came up with a number of possible causes:

Perhaps the lead came from agricultural pesticides? ""We sampled hundreds of agrochemicals. Did not find lead in them,"" Forsyth says.

Could it be lead in paint? ""These women were living in primarily unpainted tin homes,"" she says.

Perhaps it was lead-soldering on cans used to store food that can flake off into the food? It happens but it wasn't common enough to explain the data.

Soil? Rice? No evidence found.

None of the investigative work led to a clue that would solve the puzzle. ""So, we went back to square one,"" Forsyth remembers.

She reviewed all the studies done on this population in case there was a hint that had been missed. Poring over scientific papers, she found one small study of 28 kids that looked at heavy metal exposure and found lead in turmeric, the bright yellow powder that's used as a spice and is one of the most common ingredients in Bangladeshi cuisine.

Forsyth's team started doing a bunch of testing and found there was indeed lead in both turmeric powder and turmeric roots they'd obtained in local markets. What's more, the chemical fingerprint of the lead they found in the turmeric matched the lead in the women's blood. Since there are four different types of lead, that was a eureka moment.

""It was like, 'Okay! Yes! Now, we can focus [our attention],"" Forsyth recalls. But there were lots more questions. One of their biggest: How could lead have gotten into the spice?

Forsyth and her colleagues set out to talk to turmeric farmers - including a man in his 70s. His ancestors were turmeric farmers and he'd been harvesting the root all his life. He knew the processing steps intimately - from the boiling and drying of the root to polishing off the outer layer and then eventually grinding, all to make a brilliantly yellow powdered spice.

""I remember we were sitting in the car - there was monsoon rain, splashing outside - and that's when the person said, 'Yeah, back in the 1980s, there was a huge flood,' "" Forsyth remembers.

With so much rain, the farmer told her, turmeric roots wouldn't dry properly in the sun. Instead of turning their usual bright yellow, the roots became black-ish. The farmers were desperate to restore the color so they could sell their crop. They went in search of a solution.

""They found the cheapest yellow pigment available at that time,"" Forsyth says.

The vibrant yellow pigment was lead chromate. It's often used in industrial paints - think of the yellow of construction vehicles.

The farmers made a fateful decision: They started sprinkling lead chromate on the turmeric roots when it was being polished to make them look better. The lead chromate turned the roots a bright yellow. It worked so well it became common practice. The farmers kept using the lead chromate even after the flood waters receded since the lead-laced-roots were more appealing in the marketplace.

""They don't know that this is harmful for human health,"" says Musa Baker, Forsyth's colleague and a research investigator at icddr,b. ""Rather, they want to expand their business"" since their turmeric could now fetch a higher price.

This discovery that lead was routinely added to turmeric came as a shock, especially since the spice is part of daily fare for Bangladeshis, says Baker.

""The chairman of the Bangladesh Food Safety Authority, she took it very seriously,"" says Baker.

What the chairman knew from their travels is that this issue wasn't limited to Bangladesh. It had reached halfway across the world to New York as well.

That same year, in 2019, those New York City detectives had also figured out that spices - and particularly turmeric - played a major role in lead poisoning in New York's Bangladeshi community and in other South Asian communities. In their investigations, they'd tested lots of consumer products used in Bangladeshi households and found that lead in spices emerged as the top culprit. Generally, these spices didn't come from the U.S. Instead, most had been purchased overseas and brought to New York in unmarked containers tucked inside personal suitcases. Hore's team alerted Bangladeshi authorities.

It turned out that Bangladesh was not the only source of lead-contaminated spices.

In 2017, the New York City Health Department helped uncover a major lead poisoning crisis in the country of Georgia that linked back to spices. Testing from New York's Georgian population had set them on that ""crime"" trail. And their team, and other lead experts, have found worrisome spices in other South Asian countries. While Consumer Reports testing shows that spices in the U.S. can contain lead, Hore's team found the highest concentrations of lead came from spices purchased abroad.

What sets Bangladesh apart is how quickly officials acted. In 2019, they met with Forsyth and her icddr,b colleagues. And they also flew to New York City to enter that imposing gray building and meet with the city's health department.

Before the year was over, they'd put out public notices in the top newspapers warning the public and vendors not to buy the brightly colored root - instead buy the duller looking turmeric. (It's hard to tell the difference in color with the powdered form.) They distributed 50,000 fliers with a similar message posting them in market places and elsewhere.

They also reached out to major turmeric farmers and held workshops with mill owners, explaining the dangers of adding lead both biologically and legally.

And then in October of 2019 came a scene that seems designed for a future Netflix series on ""The Turmeric Mystery."" The Bangladeshi Food Safety Authority invited TV crews to bring their cameras to the main spice market in the capital city of Dhaka. A crowd of people watched as officials brandished one of those radar-gun-looking lead-measurement-devices. They pointed it at heaping sacks full of turmeric roots.

There was even a judge present to issue a ruling on the wholesale shop owners right there on the spot. The findings of this so-called ""mobile court"": $9,288 were imposed in fines and nearly 2,000 pounds of turmeric were confiscated for their lead content.

And it worked.

Since then, Forsyth and icddr,b have regularly collected and tested dozens of samples of turmeric purchased from the main wholesale market in Dhaka. And, in the wake of this public campaign to expunge lead from turmeric, they've found that turmeric samples testing positive for lead dropped from 47% to 0%.

They also tested the blood of local turmeric farmers as well as pregnant women in the same Bangladeshi communities that had given those initial blood samples that set the whole investigation in motion. Here too, Forsyth says, they found a dramatic drop in blood lead levels.

""Honestly, we were so excited to see this,"" she says.

Today, Jenna Forsyth runs a global lead initiative at Stanford School of Medicine. She still teams up with icddr,b and, she says, they're really busy.

""In Bangladesh, the case is closed on turmeric,"" says Forsyth. ""But when my friend was like, 'You should take a break.' I said, 'No way. There's more to be done.' ""

Forsyth has found lead in spices in other countries, including parts of India and Pakistan. And in Dhaka, despite the lead-free turmeric, 98% of the kids she's tested have lead poisoning by the U.S. CDC standard. ""It's wild,"" she says.

""It's enough to destroy a nation,"" says icddr,b's Rahman.

She and icddr,b are in the process of teasing apart all the possible culprits that still lurk in Dhaka and in so much of the world: lead acid batteries that are improperly recycled; pots and pans made with scrap metal that contains lead; cookware glazes where it's not fired to a high enough temperature and lead can leach into food; cosmetics - like the eye make-up surma and sindoor, the traditional powder used in Hindu practices - have been found to contain lead.

Paromita Hore's team of lead detectives are hot on the case too. They're gathering data about cosmetics, among other things. She meets with Forsyth - and other lead experts - monthly to compare notes and piece together the next mystery.

And recently they are celebrating some big news on the lead fighting front: This week, UNICEF and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) announced a new $150 million initiative to combat lead poisoning.

""There's been so little done for so long, that this is really huge,"" says Lanphear of Simon Fraser University.

The money - most of it from Open Philanthropy - will go to more than a dozen countries from Indonesia and Uganda to Ghana and Peru. And there will be a new public-private partnership aimed at boosting government buy-in, international coordination and jump starting an effort to get lead out of consumer products.

""It is long overdue that the world is coming together,"" says Samatha Power, who runs USAID.

""There is a broad perception that it requires billions of dollars to transform a national or municipal infrastructure ... to address lead poisoning. But in fact, there is an awful lot of low hanging fruit,"" she says. ""There is lead right now in paint, in spices, in cosmetics in developing countries. We think within just a few short years we can make sure that that lead has been eliminated and that kids are safe to play with their toys, to go to their schools.""

But Forsyth isn't ready to retire. She keeps looking for lead in the usual (and unusual) places. She's motivated, she says, because ""it's just really hard to tell a parent their kid has lead poisoning."" One day, she dreams that she'll never again have to deliver such devastating news."
Opinion | Janet Jackson should know better than to boost MAGA lies,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/janet-jackson-kamala-harris-black-rcna172305,2024-09-24T18:43:25Z,"Nothing in the history of Janet Jackson's political advocacy suggests any alignment with Donald Trump. That's why it's so disappointing that she's repeating his lies.

Music legend Janet Jackson is rightly receiving backlash for mischaracterizing Vice President Kamala Harris' race in an interview with The Guardian, when she was asked about her feelings about the possibility of a Black woman being elected U.S. president.

""She's not Black,"" the 58-year-old five-time Grammy Award winner said. ""That's what I heard. That she's Indian."" Guardian reporter Nosheen Iqbal described herself as ""floored"" when Jackson then claimed that Harris' father, who's Black, is white. But maybe Iqbal shouldn't have been shocked. We like to think that celebrities, especially beloved, or even idolized, ones like Jackson, are savvy enough to tell truth from fiction.

It wasn't so much that Jackson was misinformed, but that she echoed MAGA-fueled lies. Her statement about what she heard sounded eerily similar to former President Donald Trump's lie at the National Association of Black Journalists convention in July that the biracial Harris -- who says she was raised as a Black woman, attended the historically Black Howard University and pledged Alpha Kappa Alpha, the nation's oldest Black sorority -- ""happened to turn Black"" out of political expediency. And that only recently.

Jackson seemed disturbingly unaware that she was spouting misinformation. It's a moment that should cause us to rethink what it means to have celebrities expressing their political views and making political endorsements when, as a rule, those celebrities live radically different lives than the rest of us.

Jackson, the youngest child in a family of entertainers, cemented her public image as a champion for social justice when she lamented George Floyd's murder in 2020 and vocally supported Black Lives Matter. She has repeatedly used her social media platforms and live performances to speak out against sexism, racism, homophobia and other forms of discrimination, including xenophobic attacks on immigrants. Even though her advocacy is mostly tied to heartfelt pleas during award acceptance speeches and concerts, the soft spoken icon has not left any doubt about what outrages and concerns her. And none of it seems aligned with the far political right.

At this point, it's difficult to view any questioning of Harris' race as anything other than an unwarranted personal attack, and it's disappointing that Jackson, who was herself infamously mistreated, isn't making that connection.

After the infamous ""wardrobe malfunction"" during halftime at the 2004 Super Bowl -- Justin Timberlake tore away part of her clothing and exposed her breast -- she had her songs pulled from the radio and was dis-invited from that year's Grammy Awards. Timberlake suffered no consequences and in 2018 was given a solo Super Bowl halftime show.

Even as Jackson's career stalled, for the most part, Jackson's Black fans stood by her, correctly seeing her as the victim of a double standard. Perhaps, that is why her reluctance to support the Black candidate running against Trump -- whose racist language and racist policies are well known -- is so baffling. In addition to questioning Harris' background, she warned that there would be social mayhem regardless of who was elected without stating any preferences. (Here, it's probably important to mention that Janet Jackson was raised by a mother, Katherine Jackson, who is a devout Jehovah's Witness, and Witnesses don't participate in politics. In the past, Janet Jackson has said her religious upbringing was very important to her but that she didn't identify as a Witness.)

But politics aside, Janet Jackson's comments discounting Harris' race shine a light on how isolated celebrities are from the rest of us, how little we can actually relate to each other. There is no reason to disbelieve Jackson's earlier social advocacy but it does lead one to wonder how deeply those commitments are felt when the same person can unwittingly play into what Vice President Harris aptly called the ""same old, tired playbook"" about Black people in leadership positions. It's unnerving when Black people appear to flip through the same book for information about each other. While there are some Black Trump supporters, given her past positions against racism, homophobia and xenophobia, it's hard to imagine Jackson among them.

Instead, she seems to have fallen down those internet rabbit holes that make wild conspiracies sound plausible. Indeed, Jackson said during the Guardian interview that she was told the information she shared about Harris, and that ""they had discovered"" Harris' father was white. As we know very well from her late brother Michael, being a celebrity can be deeply isolating. It's not unlike social alienation in the way that it can leave celebrities disconnected and worrisomely distrustful of social institutions like government and media.

Celebrities like Jackson are among the uber wealthy whose lives bear no resemblance to ours; yet we crave to know what they think about political causes and social issues, assuming, sometimes, that they can change hearts and minds in a way that we cannot. Such endorsements can have a rallying effect on supporters even as the longer term impact is unclear.

When Taylor Swift endorsed Harris immediately after her Sept. 10 debate against Trump, many breathed a sigh of relief. Swift has a massive fanbase, especially among white women whom Democrats are hoping turn out in huge numbers in November. Swift's well-timed endorsement, which was viewed as especially thoughtful and influential, was liked by millions within minutes, prompting Trump to post ""I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!"" on Truth Social. From Susan Sarandon to Harry Belafonte, entertainers have long used their celebrity status to speak out for the causes they believe in, sometimes jeopardizing their careers along the way.

But Jackson didn't speak out as much as she fumbled her way through a bizarre reply to a simple question. If we're to take anything away from that fumbling, it's a reminder that while celebrities seem larger than life, like us, they are susceptible to misinformation, maybe even more so."
Michael Eric Dyson doubles down on accusing Nancy Mace of racism: 'I tried to be nice',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/michael-eric-dyson-doubles-down-accusing-nancy-mace-disregarding-humanity-black-people,2024-09-24T18:41:48Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Author Michael Eric Dyson doubled down on his heated on-air clash last month with Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., insisting during a Tuesday appearance on ""The View"" that he ""tried to be nice"" to the Republican congresswoman while calling her out for mispronouncing Vice President Kamala Harris' name.

""I tried to be nice to the woman,"" Dyson said after arguing that times have changed with regard to what people can say to others. ""I said, 'You're a wonderful woman' - I lied - but I tried to be nice to her and even when I pointed out to her what the repetition of the misnaming of Kamala Harris would do she got defensive, 'Oh, you're calling me a racist.' No.""

During a clash on CNN in August, Dyson told Mace, who had mispronounced Harris' first name during the segment, that she was part of the history of disregarding the ""humanity of Black people.""

'THE VIEW' HOST ATTACKS BRITTANY MAHOMES FOR INDICATING SUPPORT FOR TRUMP: 'SHE'S IN AN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE'

""This congresswoman is a wonderful human being, but when you disrespect Kamala Harris by saying you will call her whatever you want, I know you don't intend it to be that way, that's the history and legacy of White disregard for the humanity of Black people,"" Dyson said during the CNN exchange.

""Oh, so now you're calling me racist?"" Mace asked, adding, ""That is BS."" The professor added, ""No, you do not have to intend racism to accomplish it.""

After the exchange, Mace posted texts Dyson had sent to her on X and accused him of flirting with her.

Mace entered the texts from Dyson into the congressional record on Friday during a discussion about Democrats who have also mispronounced Harris' first name, which some of Harris' backers believe is a deliberate form of racism.

Dyson called Mace a ""bigot"" after she raised the text messages during the congressional hearing.

""The ridiculous lies told by Nancy Mace in the effort to smear my name because of her anger at being checked for her insensitive disregard for @VP... I had no intent with her to do anything but be nice,"" he wrote on X. ""And her White women's tears and mendacity are all in the service of lies and distortions. I was wrong about one thing: she IS a bigot and racist.""

On ""The View"" Tuesday, Dyson identified Mace as a ""White Christian"" and claimed, ""White Christians hate themselves for the past wrongs that have been done, and I'm here as a loving Christian to say, let's grapple with that past, acknowledge the historic legacy of supremacy, don't deny it, don't erase it, don't eviscerate it.""

Dyson reiterated his comments about ""White Christians"" during another segment later in the show and responded to Mace's claims of him sending her flirtatious messages.

""When I said White Christians, I meant White evangelical Christians. I'm a Christian minister myself, so I ain't hating. And this is why I try to extend a compliment to Nancy Mace. I wasn't flirting with you. I was trying to be flattering to you,"" he said.

Co-host Whoopi Goldberg chimed in and said that Dyson could explain it all he wanted to, but that Mace would never understand.

New York rep's ethics mess adds to the House GOP's many troubles,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-york-reps-ethics-mess-adds-house-gops-many-troubles-rcna172491,2024-09-24T18:37:09Z,"The sordid allegations surrounding Republican Rep. Anthony D'Esposito might seem like a personal matter, but the details suggest it's not that simple.

Republicans have struggled badly throughout the current Congress, though there haven't been many sex scandals. Of course, the current Congress isn't over just yet.

The New York Times reported on new allegations surrounding Republican Rep. Anthony D'Esposito of New York, who only arrived on Capitol Hill last year.

According to the Times' report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, the new congressman, just months into his career, paid the woman with whom he was having an affair $2,000 a month for a part-time job, in addition to the $3,800 a month he was paying his fiancée's daughter.

The article added, however, that a few months later his fiancée found about out the affair, and briefly broke up with him, at which point the New York Republican stopped paying both women.

After the Times' report reached the public, D'Esposito issued a statement, describing the article as a ""hit piece"" and ""tabloid garbage,"" before saying, ""My personal life has never interfered with my ability to deliver results for New York's 4th district, and I have upheld the highest ethical standards of personal conduct.""

When he arrived on Capitol Hill the following morning, he had even less to say.

It's tempting to think this sordid tale, if true, is a personal matter, but the details suggest that it's not quite that simple. For one thing, D'Esposito stands accused of potentially misusing $29,000 in taxpayer funds, and as the Times' report added, this has generated ethics questions that probably need answers.

What's more, there are electoral considerations to keep in mind: D'Esposito narrowly defeated Democrat Laura Gillen in 2022, and the two will face off in a rematch in November. This is a district Joe Biden carried by 14 points in 2020, and Republican leaders were concerned -- before this week -- about the incumbent congressman's prospects.

The latest allegations probably won't help D'Esposito's re-election bid."
Harris calls for eliminating filibuster to pass 'Roe' abortion bill into federal law,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-calls-eliminating-filibuster-pass-roe-abortion-bill-federal-law,2024-09-24T17:49:14Z,"Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich has the latest on the vice president's efforts to highlight the death of a Georgia woman who took an abortion pill on 'Special Report.'

Vice President Kamala Harris said she backs eliminating the 60-vote filibuster requirement in order to reinstate Roe v. Wade, which would federalize abortion access nationwide, during a Wisconsin Public Radio (WPR) interview Tuesday.

The filibuster is a Senate rule that allows a minority to block legislation pending a supermajority vote, so ending it would make it easier to pass laws related to abortion rights.

""I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe,"" Harris said on the ""Wisconsin Today"" show. ""And get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do.""

YOUNG SWING STATE VOTERS DELIVER ADVICE FOR KAMALA HARRIS: 'THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE TRANSPARENCY'

The vice president's comments come amid her fourth campaign visit to the battleground state.

Harris also said in the WPR interview that, ""It is well within our reach"" to keep a Democratic Senate majorirty and ""take back the House.""

""I would also emphasize that while the presidential election is extremely important and dispositive of where we go moving forward, it also is about what we need to do to hold onto the Senate and win seats in the House,"" Harris said.

NEW POLL INDICATES WHETHER HARRIS OR TRUMP HAS THE EDGE IN THIS KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE

While Harris first said she would support ending the filibuster to reinstate Roe v. Wade era abortion protection in 2022, she has since made abortion a major issue in her Democratic bid for presidency this election cycle. She also supported ending the filibuster to pass the progressive Green New Deal climate legislation in 2019.

""With just two more seats in the Senate, we can codify Roe v. Wade, we can put the protections of Roe in law,"" Harris said in September 2022. ""With two more seats in the United States Senate, we can pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Two more seats.""

""You know, our President, Joe Biden, he's been clear. He's kinda done with those archaic Senate rules that are standing in the way of those two issues,"" Harris said of the Senate filibuster. ""He's made that clear and has said that he will not allow that to obstruct those two issues. And, you know, for me, as vice president, I'm also president of the Senate.... I cannot wait to cast the deciding vote to break the filibuster on voting rights and reproductive rights. I cannot wait! Fifty-nine days."""
Arizona woman shares 'unpopular airport opinions' on TikTok: 'Clearly triggered from flying today',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/travel/arizona-woman-shares-unpopular-airport-opinions-tiktok-clearly-triggered-flying-today,2024-09-24T17:28:52Z,"Fox News correspondent Matt Finn discusses if passengers that recline their seat are seen as 'rude' on 'Fox News @ Night.'

A woman recently took to TikTok to reveal what she called some ""unpopular opinions"" that are sometimes argued by travelers.

Keegan Acton, of Scottsdale, Arizona, shared the video message with her 65,000-plus followers -- saying ""going to the airport fills me with a type of rage.""

Her most unpopular opinion was that she doesn't mind a crowded plane aisle after the aircraft lands.

'SCREAM TOURISM' TREND HAS HALLOWEEN FANS AND TRAVELERS FLOCKING TO CREEPY SPOTS ALL YEAR ROUND

""I always see TikToks of people being like, 'My God, I can't stand when people immediately stand up once the plane lands,' [but] I think there's nothing wrong with that,"" she said in the video, which she captioned, ""clearly triggered from flying today.""

She continued, ""I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting to stand and stretch your legs. I don't think there's anything wrong with getting your stuff in the overhead bin and having it ready for when it's like your turn to exit the plane.""

The content creator also said she believes travelers have more space in the window seat rather than the aisle seat.

""When I have a window seat, I feel like I can... lean against the wall. There's like a little gap there for me,"" she explained, adding, ""I just feel like I'm more space on the window side and I like a cool view and some entertainment watching the clouds.""

For travelers who enjoy sitting next to their significant other on a flight, Acton said she doesn't think that's necessary.

""I do not think that you need to sit next to your significant other on a plane. I feel like what I always see happens is... the husband has the aisle seat, and the wife has to sit in the middle,"" she said.

She added, ""I don't think the wife needs to be uncomfortable on the flight [and] sit in the middle just to sit next to her husband.""

AIRLINE PASSENGER'S 'AWKWARD' SEATING ARRANGEMENT GOES VIRAL: 'NEVER GOING TO RECOVER'

Acton also addressed how she felt about TSA rules and ""rude"" agents.

""I didn't know the rules. It's different everywhere. Like, please don't yell at me. I'm sensitive. I'm just a girl,"" she said, adding that she has been yelled at while going through security.

Additionally, Acton blasted passengers who don't put their carry-on luggage in the overhead bin correctly.

""You are an idiot if you cannot put your suitcase in the overhead bin the correct way,"" she said.

She added, ""You're supposed to put [it] on your side so it can make room for more people. It's so inconsiderate.""

Acton even called out passengers who recline their seats once in the air.

""I think the people who lean their seat backs are a-------. I know that you have every single right to do that. I know your legs are probably long. It's probably more comfortable,"" she explained.

She continued, ""It's just kind of, like, inconsiderate to the person behind you.""

Acton also said she gets frustrated with inconsistent security line timing, ""anxiety inducing"" boarding processes, space between gates and people who crowd the baggage claim area.

Rosalinda Randall, a California-based etiquette expert and trainer, told Fox News Digital via email that individuals refuse to ""adhere to social norms"" often.

Randall said that when it comes to the proper way to exit an airplane, passengers should wait to deplane until it's their turn unless communicated otherwise to a flight attendant in advance.

""Unless you have a connecting flight, the job interview of a lifetime or are going to be late for your wedding, wait your turn,"" she said.

If you are in a hurry, Tandall said, alert a flight attendant prior to landing of your urgency, politely explaining to others around you that you need to get up first and expect uncooperative passengers in the midst.

Randall also commented on whether it's proper to recline the airplane seat while on a flight.

She said, ""As paying passengers, we should be able to recline whenever we want. However, it becomes an issue when we enter someone else's space.""

She recommended considering a few factors before pressing the recline button on your next flight.

Randall suggested people avoid reclining during meal times, reclining only half-way if the person behind you is working on a laptop or holding a child and seeking assistance if there becomes an issue with space among passengers.

""I didn't join the race to decide who the president is or to tell other people how to decide to vote for the president,"" Missouri Senate candidate Lucas Kunce told NBC's Kristen Welker last week when asked if he would be endorsing the Harris-Walz ticket.

Kunce, who declined multiple times to endorse Harris when pressed by Welker in the interview, is now the subject of a minute-long radio ad in Missouri from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley that will run this week, mocking Kunce for not standing by the nominee of his own party.

""Wait, Lucas Kunce is not voting for Kamala Harris?"" another woman responds.

""He's too scared to answer the question. The press asked him not once, not twice, not three times, but four different times,"" the ad continues. ""What is Lucas Kunce afraid of? Kunce comes into our community asking us for our vote, but he won't tell us about his vote.""

Kunce has previously declined to endorse Harris, including in a recent debate, which Hawley has focused on in social media posts.

""So ⁦@LucasKunceMO⁩ won't endorse Kamala Harris,"" Hawley posted on X. ""Why not? Is he embarrassed of her for some reason? Is he supporting ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩?""

""Walking down the sidewalk I noticed a man on a bicycle on the same side of the sidewalk as me. Before he was about to pass me, he gets off his bike, grabs me by my neck and throws me to the ground where he repeatedly punched me in the face. Not a word was shared,"" Catton wrote.

After the attack, Catton was able to contact 911 and run toward a location where an ambulance eventually picked her up.

Harris says she would support ending the filibuster to bring back 'Roe v.

Vice President Harris says she would support eliminating the filibuster in the U.S. Senate in order to bring back federal protections for a woman's right to an abortion as they existed under Roe v. Wade.

Harris outlined her position during an interview Monday with NPR member station Wisconsin Public Radio, saying that when it comes to the issue of abortion, she believes the Senate should do away with the filibuster rule that requires a 60-vote threshold for most legislation to pass.

""I've been very clear, I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe, and get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do,"" Harris told WPR host Kate Archer Kent.

Harris' comments came as she works to sharpen the distinction between herself and former President Trump on one of the most pivotal issues facing voters in this year's presidential election. And while she has voiced support for ending the filibuster before -- including on the issue of reproductive rights -- it's a topic she has rarely addressed since President Biden's decision to abandon his reelection bid and endorse her instead.

Her message could carry particular weight in Wisconsin, a crucial battleground state where virtually no legal abortions were performed for nearly 15 months in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision in 2022 to strike down Roe.

Harris has blamed Trump for the fall of Roe, saying as recently as Friday that he is the ""architect"" of a health care crisis caused by the Supreme Court's decision in Roe -- a law that Trump's three Supreme Court nominees voted to overturn. In the same speech, she referenced recent reporting from ProPublica about two Georgia women whose deaths, after implementation of the state's new abortion law, were deemed ""preventable"" by a state committee of maternal health experts.

Trump has sought to push back against Harris, telling an audience in Pennsylvania on Monday that ""women will be happy, healthy confident and free"" if he is elected to a second term in office.

""You will no longer be thinking about abortion, it's all they talk about, abortion, because we've done something that nobody else could have done. It is now where it always had to be, with the states and they [sic] vote of the people,"" Trump said.

During her interview, Harris was also pressed on a number of other issues facing Wisconsin voters. On housing, she reiterated her plans to provide $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers, and said she would work with the private sector and home builders ""to build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term.""

Harris said she would reach that goal through a combination of tax credits for builders and eliminating red tape in the construction process.

The vice president was also asked about toxic chemicals known as PFAs that are contaminating drinking water around Wisconsin, and whether she would press for stricter regulations of these chemicals.

Harris said the Biden administration is funding billions in water infrastructure projects around the country in order to clean up drinking water and replace lead pipes. Nearly $2 billion of that funding is going to Wisconsin, she said."

Multiple people have been arrested in Switzerland in connection to the seemingly willing use of a ""suicide capsule.""

Police officials of Schaffhausen canton in northern Switzerland announced on Tuesday that multiple people have been detained following a tip indicating individuals were helped to kill themselves in a cabin in Merishausen.

An investigation into possible incitement and accessory to suicide is underway, and the premeditated death could be attributed to the first-ever use of a Sarco-brand suicide capsule.

TERMINALLY ILL MISSOURI WOMAN, 79, TAKING TRIP TO SWITZERLAND FOR ASSISTED SUICIDE

The Sarco pod is a suicide machine developed by Netherlands-based pro-euthanasia group Exit International.

The group seemed to take responsibility for the alleged crime in a statement, announcing the willful euthanization of an elderly woman who is a U.S. citizen and suffering from an intense immune disease.

""In Switzerland on Monday, a 64-year-old woman died in a specially designed 'suicide capsule' containing nitrogen gas. It is the first time ever that this suicide capsule, called the Sarco, was used,"" Exit International boasted in an online press release. ""The capsule, an airtight cabin the size of a coffin, offers, according to its creators, a 'quick, peaceful and reliable death' without the assistance of a doctor or medication.""

""It is still unclear how Swiss justice will react to this,"" the pro-suicide group's statement continued. ""The conditions set by the country are that the person with the death wish is mentally competent, that they carry out the final deadly act themselves and that the people who help have altruistic motives.""

Exit International founder Dr. Philip Nitschke announced Tuesday that he was ""pleased that the Sarco had performed exactly as it had been designed [...] to provide an elective, non-drug, peaceful death at the time of the person's choosing.""

Exit International said Nitschke personally ""confirmed"" the U.S. woman's death.

Luis Armando Albino was just 6 years old when he was kidnapped from the Oakland park where he had been playing with his older brother, lured by a woman who promised to buy him candy.

Instead, she ""transported him out of state and eventually to the East Coast,"" the Oakland Police Department (OPD) told NPR.

State and federal authorities searched extensively for Albino in the wake of his disappearance, but couldn't find him or his remains.

All the while, his mother, Antonia Albino -- who had moved the family from their native Puerto Rico just the year before -- never gave up hope that he was alive.

She visited the police's missing person bureau to press for information almost daily at first, then weekly, then monthly, and eventually annually, according to the Mercury News, which first reported the news of his discovery last week.

The family renewed their search 15 years after the kidnapping, when Albino would have been 21, SFGATE reported. They made multiple trips to Puerto Rico, where Antonia suspected her son had been taken, but turned up nothing.

""This is a rare situation when a boy disappears and doesn't eventually show up -- alive or dead,"" Oakland police Lt. Dominic DiFraia told The Oakland Tribune in 1966. ""I'd give an awful lot to find out why.""

It has taken seven decades to begin to unravel that mystery. Earlier this year, long after his mother had died and his case had grown cold, it was Albino's niece who finally tracked him down.

Alida Alequin, 63, knew she had a missing uncle because her family talked about it. Her late grandmother always kept a newspaper clipping about his abduction in her wallet and displayed his photo at their family home.

Alequin decided to take an online DNA test in 2020 ""just for fun,"" as she told the Mercury News.

Among the results was a 22% match with a man she had never met. The Oakland resident reached out to him but didn't hear back or pursue it further -- until earlier this year, when she watched a documentary that inspired her to renew her search.

Alequin and her daughters searched the man's name online, pored over microfilm of old Oakland Tribune articles at the public library and became increasingly convinced that the man from the DNA database was their long-lost relative.

OPD says she contacted their missing persons unit in March to alert them about the DNA test results and her uncle's possible identity.

Armed with new leads and technology, police reopened Albino's case.

They searched through public records of the potential match and collected DNA samples from Albino's living siblings, with help from the California Department of Justice and the FBI.

Police said investigators were unsuccessful in their multiple attempts to contact Albino and his family, and eventually were able to get FBI special agents dispatched to contact him at his residence.

The FBI confirmed to NPR that it assisted Oakland police ""by our ability to access ... resources across state lines."" Authorities have not specified where on the East Coast Albino had been living.

The agents were eventually able to interview Albino and take a DNA sample.

His statements and genetics confirmed what police call ""the best possible outcome"": He was indeed the boy who'd been snatched from the park 73 years earlier.

""We didn't start crying until after the investigators left,"" Alequin told Mercury News. ""I grabbed my mom's hands and said, 'We found him.'""

Details about Albino's life on the East Coast are relatively scarce, and police say his case remains under investigation. They are asking anyone with information to contact the OPD Missing Persons Unit.

Mercury News says Albino is a retired firefighter and Marine Corps veteran who served two tours of duty in Vietnam. He spent most of his life believing he was the ""son of another couple,"" according to SFGate.

In June, Albino flew to California to meet Alequin and his other relatives. Police said the visit was arranged and funded by OPD investigators, FBI Victims Advocates and the California DOJ.

""It was an emotional moment for all parties involved and was a family reunion over 70 years in the making,"" they added.

Alequin said her uncle hugged her, gave her a kiss on the cheek and said, ""Thank you for finding me.""

He has some memory of the abduction and his cross-country trip, she added, but had never gotten answers from the adults in his life.

During that trip, Albino reunited with his brother Roger, who had been with him on that fateful February day.

Alequin said the two ""grabbed each other and had a really tight long hug,"" then sat and talked about the kidnapping, their military service and more.

Their reunion came at a bittersweet time: Roger died two months later, in August.

""I think he died happily,"" Alequin said. ""He was at peace with himself, knowing that his brother was found.""

She said she was glad she could bring some closure to her mom and uncle and believed her grandmother -- who died in 2005 -- would be happy, too.

""And who knows, with my story out there, it could help other families going through the same thing,"" Alequin added. ""I would say don't give up."""
'It Ends With Us' Is Now Streaming -- How To Watch The Blockbuster Film At Home,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicamercuri/2024/09/24/it-ends-with-us-is-now-streaming-how-to-watch-the-blockbuster-film-at-home/,2024-09-24T14:04:49Z,"Less than two months after It Ends With Us premiered in theaters, the romance drama is now available to stream at home. Whether you missed the movie on the big screen or want to see it again, read on to learn how to watch It Ends With Us for your next movie night.

It Ends With Us was inspired by Colleen Hoover's bestselling 2016 novel of the same name, which went viral on TikTok in 2020. The story follows Lily Bloom (Blake Lively), a woman who comes from a traumatic childhood who starts a new life in Boston and opens her dream flower shop.

One night, Lily meets a handsome neurosuregon named Ryle Kincaid (Justin Baldoni), and the two fall deeply in love. But Lily starts to see sides of Ryle that remind her of her parents' abusive relationship. When Atlas Corrigan (Brandon Sklenar), Lily's first love, unexpectedly reenters her life, her relationship with Ryle is put to the test. His actions force her make an important decision about her future.

The film had a strong box office performance this summer, grossing an impressive $344 million worldwide, including $146 million in domestic sales. On Rotten Tomatoes, critics rated the movie 51%, while audiences were much more positive, giving it a 91% score.

It Ends With Us is now available to stream on digital video-on-demand sites like Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+, Fandango At Home, and YouTube Movies & TV. You can purchase It Ends With Us for $24.99 or rent the film for $19.99 (for a 48-hour period).

The film is available for pre-order on DVD for $26.99 and on Blu-ray for $24.99, with a release date of November 5, 2024.

It Ends With Us will eventually be streaming on Netflix thanks to a multi-year agreement between Sony and the streaming giant. Sony has not yet announced a Netflix release date, but recent films from the studio have typically have had around a 120-day theater-to-Netflix window.

Sources told The Hollywood Reporter there was a ""fracture"" in post-production and that Lively, who was a producer on the film, wanted her own cut of the film from editor Shane Reid -- who was the editor on her husband Ryan Reynolds' film Deadpool & Wolverine. Fans on social media were also quick to point out that Lively and Baldoni didn't appear together during press interviews.

In mid-August, their co-star Brandon Sklenar responded to the feud allegations on Instagram, stating that ""what may or may not have happened behind the scenes does not, and hopefully should not, detract from our intentions in making this film.""

Sklenar also criticized the people ""vilifying"" the women who made the film and said everyone involved was aware of the movie's heavy themes of domestic violence. His statement came after Lively faced backlash on social media from book fans who felt that she ignored the topic during press appearances.

Despite the rumors of a rift, Justin praised Blake's involvement in the film. ""You can't summarize Blake's contribution in a sentence because her energy and imprint is all over the movie and really, really made the film better, and from beginning to end,"" he told Today."
Sip Birdie: Honoring An Unsung Hero In Spirits History,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/yolandaevans/2024/09/24/sip-birdie-honoring-an-unsung-hero-in-spirits-history/,2024-09-24T12:26:22Z,"The impact of marginalized people is often overlooked or whitewashed in history, across industries. The spirits world is no different: When you take a hard look at the industry, you overwhelmingly hear about white people or their contributions to the business.

If you look deep, many marginalized groups were bootleggers and rumrunners but are conveniently left out of history. Just look how prohibition is glamorized with the idea of white gangsters like Al Capone and Lucky Luciano, but you hardly heard about Black bootleggers or distillers. We know all about Carrie Nation and other white women in the temperance movement, but most people never knew that Black activists like Frances Ellen Watkins Harper were also in favor of prohibition. Finally, however, their stories are being uncovered, thanks in part to newer alcohol brands doing their own research and illuminating the fascinating history of marginalized people that the world should know about.

One such story is that of Bertie ""Birdie"" Brown, a notorious Black moonshiner in Fergus County, Montana known for having the best ""white lightning"" in the area. Unfortunately, she died when her moonshine still exploded in 1933, and with her death, her contribution was lost to history.

This is about to change, as Sip Birdie is bringing her memories back to the minds of drinkers by telling her story, one sip at a time. The company was founded in 2019 by former NBA player Alan Henderson, who created the Henderson Spirit Group intending to diversify the bar scene with its alcohol after he noticed the lack of black contributions in the alcohol industry. It was during his research that Henderson stumbled upon Brown and wondered why her inspiring story had never been told.

""I was like so you're telling me that in the late 1800s, there was an African American lady who went out to Montana by herself, ended up homesteading in the early 1900s, had her own farm, grew her own grains, had her own parlor and was a real entrepreneur,"" Henderson said over Zoom. ""I said, that's a crazy story. I have to share this story, as it's an incredible story of fortitude.""

Henderson found this tale so fascinating that he created Birdie Brown's Plain Hooch so that he could not only pay homage to Brown but other Black distillers whom we are just rediscovering. Tiffanie Barriere, a historian and bar educator from Atlanta and the queen of Black history in the cocktail and spirit world, didn't even know about Brown's story till Henderson called her in 2019 to ask her to work with him on a ""shine"" project. After he shared the work he was doing and the inspiration behind the brand, Barriere knew this was a project she had to work on.

As for why her story is not well known, it might be because she died young, but Barriere believes it is more than likely because she was a Black woman, whose stories are often overlooked. ""Bertie was not only doing what everyone else was doing, as in mass production in moonshine, but she was a woman, a BLACK woman at that, who was in the deserts of the U.S.,"" says Barriere via email. ""The resources and company she kept were diverse and travel quality.""

It's a challenge to find stories and records of Black people in America; these are often lost since most Black history was passed down orally rather than in written records. This is why the alcohol industry needs to share underrepresented narratives as well as acknowledge Black people's involvement with their distilling techniques and their origins, dating back to slavery. It is the industry's responsibility -- and to its overall benefit -- to celebrate their achievements. That being said, there must be brands like Sip Birdie that are bringing untold black stories to light -- especially considering that Black Americans spend a lot of money on alcohol and luxury spirits, particularly Black women, who are often trendsetters.

""Sharing Bertie's story is iconic and is only a step towards more research on Black women and men in distilling,"" says Barriere. ""Black-owned spirits and black stories allow support and more reasons to raise a glass to celebrate."""
In Jason Yu's Film 'Sleep' A Couple Must Confront Supernatural Forces,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanmacdonald/2024/09/24/in-jason-yus-film-sleep-a-couple-must-confront-supernatural-forces/,2024-09-24T12:04:26Z,"Jason Yu was not a fan of horror films before he wrote and directed the compellingly eerie Sleep, a film Bong Joon-ho described as the ""smartest debut film he's ever seen."" In Sleep Jung Yu-mi plays Jin-hyeok, a woman happily married to Hyun-soo, played by Lee Sun-kyun. During her pregnancy Hyun-soo develops a sleepwalking problem that rightly terrifies Jin-hyeok. Is Hyun-soo channeling some unresolved conflict or are there supernatural forces at play?

""The story and the subject matter kind of dictated itself into becoming a horror film,"" said Yu. ""Before that, to be absolutely honest, I wasn't the greatest fan of horror films just because of how traumatized I would get when watching them. I remember back in school, my friends would drag me to a horror film because I wouldn't want to go, and then I would watch it and be haunted by it for days on end. I didn't want to relive that feeling when I was an adult. So, I think I stayed away from the genre for a while. But when I realized that Sleep would become a horror film, I did have a lot of catching up to do. There was a period where I only devoured horror films, and then I realized how much I was missing out on because it's such a great genre. It's safe to say it's one of my favorite genres now and one of the only genres of film that I actively search for and try to watch in cinemas.""

Yu has described Sleep as being about marriage, the trust it takes for individuals to enter into such an emotionally intimate partnership. When he wrote the film Yu was preparing to marry his longtime girlfriend, so his thoughts about marriage seeped into the film.

""Usually in the films about marriage that I watch, the central conflict derives from each other,"" said Yu. ""Usually they have a big fight or somebody makes an irredeemable mistake or they simply fall out of love. I guess because at that time I was at the cusp of marriage and I had a more romantic view about it, I wanted to show a couple who really loved each other, trusted each other, who were best friends, and maybe throw them an obstacle that's nobody's fault and show how they could overcome this problem as a married unit.""

Given Hyun-soo's erratic unconscious behavior, Jin-hyeok has every reason to worry he might inadvertently hurt her, their unborn baby or himself. Yet, Jin-hyeok continues to trust Hyun-soo and together they seek ways to cope with the problem. For Yu, the story relies on Jin-hyeok's trust in her husband.

""Otherwise it wouldn't have worked as a story because if she didn't have that trust, the story probably would've ended in chapter one, where she said, enough, and just headed out of the house,"" said Yu. ""Because of this almost stubbornness, I think the story propels itself forward. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing, I think the audience can decipher themselves. But there is an almost grotesque-like romance to it, how she views her relationship with her husband and just everyday life.""

Trusting Hyun-soo is easier given that he's played by the late Lee Sun-kyun, an actor whose calm, friendly manner evokes confidence. Although Yu dreamt of casting these celebrated actors as his characters, he was sure they wouldn't be interested in a debut film. His producer sent them scripts anyway.

""I thought the natural step would be for him to go find similar actors that we could cast within our budget and within our situation,"" said Yu. ""But he thought about it and said, great actors gravitate towards interesting scripts and I think the script may have a shot. He said, it doesn't cost money to give it to them, so let's just hand it over and pray that they read it. That's exactly what we did and luckily for me, it didn't really take long for them to call back.""

He was very, very grateful they did. ""I don't think I would've been able to make it without them.""

Working with both actors was a revelation, as they had different approaches to acting. ""Their acting styles were completely opposite, which was very interesting to me,"" said Yu. ""For example, Lee Sun-kyun, who played the husband character, was an over-preparer. He wanted to know the backstory of the character. He wanted to know my references for the character, how he spoke, how he acted, what sort of clothes he wore, and he wanted to embody this character before he came to set. So when we did come to set and when he did act, I didn't really have to direct much because he was already the character. When we did eventually have to talk, it was about how we interpreted the characters. Usually he would say something about what he thought the character was. I would say my opinion. In the end, he was usually right. I guess that's just him being a veteran and being such a great actor.""

Lee is best known for popular TV dramas such as Coffee Prince, Pasta, My Mister and the Academy Award-winning film Parasite. Jung Yu-mi appeared in the TV dramas The School Nurse Files and Discovery of Love and the film adaptation of Kim Ji-young: Born 1982.

""On the complete opposite end of the spectrum, Jung Yu-mi, who plays Jin-hyuk, was not like that at all,"" said Yu. ""She was completely free. She didn't really care for those sort of backstories at all.""

What she wanted was a list of one to 10 things Yu needed from her in any scene.

""I thought that was quite far-fetched at first, but for each scene I would say, this scene is about this, I think you are 70% angry at him, 30% sorry. So I would give her all these almost artificial numbers of what I thought she would be going through, but it was like some sort of supercomputer genius in her would just interpret that and give me an even greater performance than I could imagine. So I had the great luck of watching these two geniuses work their craft.""

Sleep debuted in Korea in Sept. 2023. Lee Sun-kyun died in December of 2023. The tragedy shocked his many fans, including Yu.

""I do feel like I owe my career to Lee Sun-kyun,"" said Yu. ""Because if he didn't pick the script up and if he didn't choose to participate in this film, I would not have been able to make it. Even on set, he was very kind enough to give me tips and all these great lessons on directing and how he performed his craft. I have no doubt that I have become a much better director thanks to him, and so for that I'm forever grateful. I do remember after his death, we still had a lot of international festival invitations for Sleep, and I was quite worried whether I would be able to watch the film after his death. But when I saw it with the theater crowd, the audience, it just made me realize how great his acting was and how nonsensical my worrying was because he was really great in Sleep, I thought. I was very proud to show his acting to the international audience. Since then, I no longer worry about those things. Whenever I do get the chance to screen, I always love to join the audience and watch his great acting together.""

Yu worked closely with Kim Tae-su, the film's cinematographer, to create the dream-like -- or more accurately nightmarish-feel of the apartment in which the supernatural story plays out.

""He's a veteran,"" said Yu. ""He made a lot of great Korean films, and I felt very lucky to have him on board for my project.""

They began by drawing the storyboards together shot by shot and quickly dispensed with the idea that a horror film had to be stylish and have flashy camera moves.

""When we really discussed what the movie was about and the environment that we were going to shoot it in being one location, inside this bland Korean box of a house, we realized what we really had to do was almost treat it like a theater piece where the camera accentuates the psychology of each character and the relationship.""

Capturing a shift in an emotion or a change in their relationship had to be the first priority.

""So we really tried to make every beat count with the shots and make every shot matter.""

Every shot delivered in Sleep effectively conveys the emotional conundrum the characters face, the terrifying reality that they may not be able to trust each other or perhaps even trust reality.

Yu is currently working on two new projects he's excited about. One is another horror film in a similar vein to Sleep but on a larger scale. The other genre might surprise Sleep viewers. It's a romcom.

""Although I created a horror film,"" said Yu. ""My favorite genre as a film audience or a spectator would be romantic comedy."""
Duolingo's Billionaire Founder Is All In On AI,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2024/09/23/duolingo-luis-von-ahn-billionaire-ai-tutor/,2024-09-24T10:33:08Z,"Luis von Ahn, who grew up with little money in Guatemala, aims to transform the popular language-learning app into an automated AI tutor.

itting in Duo's Taqueria, a dimly-lit upscale Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh, Luis von Ahn contemplates the end of work as we know it. In between bites of al pastor tacos and sips of a margarita, Von Ahn, founder and CEO of the language learning app Duolingo, talks about how AI will make some jobs disappear, and workers will need to be retrained.

He speaks from experience: Late last year, Duolingo decided not to renew the contracts of about 10% of its contracted workforce who did translations and lesson writing, instead opting to use AI for those tasks in some cases. ""Our stance as a company is that if we can automate something, we will,"" von Ahn said now of the dismissals. ""A full time employee's job is very hard to automate. But we had some hourly contractors who were doing pretty rote stuff.""

While he firmly believes it was the right call for his company, he's cognizant of the broader problems AI will bring. ""It's a tough situation that'll affect the poor, the less educated,"" he said. ""And not just in the U.S., but in poor countries.""

From a table in the back of the restaurant, which was originally designed by Duolingo as a place where diners could practice their Spanish, he notes it will require smart regulation from world governments to make sure AI is equitable. But he doesn't have much faith in the U.S., which will have to ""get their head out of their ass"" to do it. ""It's just very hard right now to imagine that the U.S. is going to legislate this well, given that they can't agree on anything.""

""It may put one-on-one human tutors out of business. I understand that. But I think net-net it is better if everybody has access to one.""

But longer term, von Ahn is optimistic that AI could unlock new possibilities for learning, bringing high-quality education to the masses. He thinks languages can help lift people out of poverty, noting that, for non-native speakers, learning English instantly broadens a person's earning potential and opens up a whole new world of jobs. He sees Duolingo on the forefront of the transition to AI-powered learning, with the ultimate moonshot of creating an automated AI tutor that can teach anyone a foreign language.

""That would be generally good for the world,"" he said. ""It may put one-on-one human tutors out of business. I understand that. But I think net-net it is better if everybody has access to one.""

Von Ahn isn't afraid to voice strong opinions. He delights in memes that Duolingo's owl mascot (named Duo) might break into the houses of users who missed their language lessons, a corporate brand he calls ""wholesome unhinged."" He was a staunch critic of Alejandro Giammattei, former president of his home country Guatemala, who he decried as corrupt (he's also the biggest donor for Giammattei's replacement Bernardo Arévalo, who took office in January). And he has said that he thinks AI will make computers better teachers than humans.

On Tuesday, Duolingo unveiled its first step in that direction: An interactive feature in which users partake in ""video calls"" with Lily, one of Duolingo's beloved mascots -- a purple-haired, sarcastic, cartoon woman. Chatting with Lily allows people to practice conversing in other languages as if FaceTiming with an AI friend, with dialogue generated by OpenAI's GPT-4o model. It's part of a $30 a month subscription tier, called Duolingo Max, which the company debuted last year for its premium AI features, including one that tells people why they answered a question wrong during a lesson. Another new AI addition is a mini-game called Adventures, which puts users in interactive situations to practice their language skills, like ordering a coffee from a cafe or getting their passport checked.

The new features are the latest wave of tools from a generative AI push the company began last year. ""In my mind, the personalized AI tutor is less like a particular feature that we're building,"" Klinton Bicknell, Duolingo's head of AI, told Forbes. ""And more just kind of a vision for what the whole app as a whole becomes.""

The AI push by Duolingo, which went public in 2022, has translated into a surge in users and revenue: Almost 104 million people take language, math and music lessons on the app each month, up 40% year over year. This past quarter, revenue hit $178.3 million, up 41% from last year. The company's stock hit an all-time high on Monday of $270, vaulting the company to a $11.75 billion market cap. Von Ahn, who owns roughly 10% of the company, is now a billionaire, along with his cofounder Severin Hacker.

""It cannot see if a student is experiencing frustration. It cannot see body language. It cannot see joy.""

And while business is booming right now, competitors are also investing in AI. Babbel, for example, last year debuted a speech recognition feature that learns a user's voice to evaluate their pronunciation. Rosetta Stone also added AI-powered language assessment exams, used in enterprise settings.

Elizabeth Birr Moje, dean of the University of Michigan's Marsal Family School of Education, said she's excited about the possibilities of Duolingo's new AI features. But she doesn't believe an AI tool will ever be able to replace the intangible skills of human tutors. ""It cannot see if a student is experiencing frustration. It cannot see body language,"" she said. ""It cannot see joy.""

Von Ahn grew up in Guatemala City with his single mom and grandmother, immigrating to the U.S. in 1996 to attend Duke as an undergraduate math major. He then attended Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh for his PhD, where he co-invented the CAPTCHA verification system that distinguishes humans from robots online. He spun the project into a company called reCAPTCHA and sold it to Google for an undisclosed amount in 2009. Two years later, he started Duolingo, along with cofounder Hacker, a Swiss computer scientist he tapped as the company's CTO.

""My net worth growing up was probably close to zero. So was my mom's,"" said von Ahn, who holds dual U.S. and Guatemalan citizenship. Reflecting on his billionaire status: ""It feels cool. But it's not something I think about all the time. I'm proud of it."" He's one of few Guatemalan-born individuals to reach the billionaire milestone, including Mario Lopez Estrada, a telecom tycoon who died last year.

Von Ahn's 87-year-old mom Norma now lives with him in Pittsburgh. He said she doesn't realize how much money he has, even though he reminds her they are financially secure. ""She asks if it's too expensive to call Guatemala,"" he said, laughing. ""I tell her, call whoever you want!"" In 2021, he established the Luis von Ahn Foundation, which seeks to protect and support women and girls in Guatemala, among other causes, and has donated around $13 million so far. One program, called the Visionary Awards, honors individuals making an impact in Guatemala in areas including health and nature conservation, granting them each a $20,000 cash prize.

But his higher profile has also brought some new precautions. He's famous in Guatemala, often getting recognized on the street and stopped for selfies. And because he's been so outspoken about the country's former president, he's also gotten death threats. Now when he visits the country, he travels with the same security detail used by the United Nations mission, which carries packets of blood on hand that match his blood type, in case he gets shot.

""They think that it makes me feel better,"" he said. ""That does not make me feel better. That makes me feel worse.""

From the rooftop at Duolingo headquarters, where employees sometimes eat lunch on sunny days, you can see the University of Pittsburgh's Cathedral of Learning, a 42-story Gothic revival church converted to classrooms and labs. It's a distant reminder of Duolingo's roots in academia -- von Ahn was a mathematics professor at rival Carnegie Mellon when he incubated the company out of the university, which at one point owned $150 million in Duolingo stock, before divesting after the company went public, von Ahn said.

In addition to its AI tutor efforts, the company has made another big AI investment in its Duolingo English Test (DET), the app's version of TOEFL, or the Test Of English as a Foreign Language, which is widely used to certify English proficiency for university admissions or visa applications. The DET, which costs $59 and first launched in 2016, gained traction during the pandemic because it could be taken remotely. Duolingo now uses AI for every element of the DET exam, von Ahn said, from generating the questions to making sure people don't cheat. One security feature, for example, uses facial recognition to make sure a test taker isn't looking offscreen at notes. Right now, the test accounts for 10% of Duolingo revenue, and von Ahn wants it to become a bigger part of the pie as the company focuses increasingly on non-English speaking users.

""We're prepared. Not in that we have major contingency plans, but I'm prepared for it to happen.""

But creating high-quality AI tools will be a long process. Von Ahn said the company is experimenting with new characters for lessons, created by AI video-generation models, though they are in early prototyping stages. There's also room for improvement with the newly announced ""video call"" feature. In recorded demos, Lily's voice sounds slow and robotic, and there is sometimes a lag before her response loads. But the dialogue seems natural and casual -- important groundwork for von Ahn's vision for a fully automated tutor.

Bicknell, Duolingo's head of AI, said there are three qualities of good private tutors that the company is trying to emulate as it builds out its products: Knowing exactly what the student knows, and how to teach them effectively; being adept enough to answer all of the student's questions; and keeping them motivated to come back.

The video call feature is already trying to tackle the first point. Like a human tutor, the feature learns more about the user with each session. For example, if you told Lily about the wedding you attended during your last call, she might reference that in future calls. Duolingo also tries not to discourage users by having Lily correct their pronunciation or grammar, noting that people get discouraged by their fear of mistakes. As long as the AI ""understands"" what the user is saying, conversations continue without those reprimands. The company said it intentionally keeps conversations short to keep people engaged, capping them at about one minute for beginners and two and a half minutes for more advanced users.

Von Ahn knows things could get messy. He is concerned an AI tutor could go ""haywire,"" and start ""getting into, say, I don't know, some Nazi stuff,"" he said.

Von Ahn said he's ""come to peace"" with the possibility of backlash set off by one of the company's interactive AI features. ""We're prepared. Not in that we have major contingency plans, but I'm prepared for it to happen,"" he said. ""And that's okay."" For the video call feature, the company says it has specific prompting techniques and content moderation guidelines to keep AI responses on the rails.

Matt Skaruppa, Duolingo's CFO, said the company doesn't have to worry as much about pitfalls other companies face when they delve more into AI, because Duolingo is using the technology in a more specialized way. ""Our mission is not to solve AI for the world. It's to apply a certain set of things to education,"" he told Forbes. ""So it's a very focused effort we have when we use AI.""

Still, von Ahn isn't shying away from the inherent risks -- whether that's automating away jobs, or facing down the possibility of its AI saying something inappropriate. ""We'll probably have to stick our foot in our mouth,"" he said. ""The benefits outweigh the potential problems."""
"New Female-Led, Australian 'The Office' Remake Looks Genuinely Terrible",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2024/09/24/female-led-the-office-remake-looks-genuinely-terrible/,2024-09-24T10:03:09Z,"Amazon dropped the first trailer for the Australian remake of The Office, which was itself a remake of the UK version of The Office. This is actually the 13th iteration of the mockumentary series. What a lucky number!

Despite originating in the UK, I think it's safe to say that the American version is not only the most famous, but also the best. Ricky Gervais and Martin Freeman and the rest of the UK cast are all great, but we're number one. We're number one!

The fact of the matter is, you just can't beat Steve Carell and the rest of the American cast. That's incredibly obvious when you watch this trailer, which we shall do before I press on.

I think Australians are often very funny, but judging by this genuinely terrible and unfunny trailer, this remake of The Office is going to be a stinker. There's maybe one funny moment in this entire trailer, and we're just a few weeks away from release.

They have an attractive woman playing the Dwight character here, which makes no sense. And frankly, if you want an Australian version of Michael Scott, you should go watch the excellent female-led cop dramedy Deadloch instead. Madeleine Sami's Eddie Redcliffe is abrasive and obnoxious and inappropriate and great fun all at once. And it's not just another take on a classic, so you don't have to compare it to the previous -- better -- version.

I've also heard good things about the Australian office comedy Utopia, though I've never watched it myself.

If I were to prognosticate, here's how I see this playing out -- admitting, upfront, that one cannot judge a book by its cover and I could absolutely be wrong, and this could be hilarious and wonderful -- but I'm calling this early so I can refer back to it if I'm right.

I could be overly cynical. I'm fully aware that I'm biased in that direction. I've just seen this song and dance play out so many times at this point, it's hard not to be paranoid. It's almost impossible to have a real discussion about the merits of these shows anymore.

Also worth noting that this is not the remake of The Office that we learned about recently. That show is American and takes place at a failing local newspaper. It follows the same fictional camera crew to a new location with an entirely new cast of characters, though it's possible we could see cameos of the original cast."
Megan's life was falling apart. Then a kind stranger swooped in to help,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/nx-s1-5123629/kindness-stranger-help,2024-09-24T09:05:58Z,"This story is part of the My Unsung Hero series, from the Hidden Brain team. It features stories of people whose kindness left a lasting impression on someone else.

One summer day in 2009, Megan Atherton was driving to her hometown of Pittsburgh, Pa., with a friend. She was 23 years old and had just been evicted from her apartment in Annapolis, Md. She was hopeful she'd find a place to stay back home.

But about an hour into the drive, Atherton's car broke down.

""My cellphone was dead because the electricity had been turned off [in the apartment],"" Atherton said.

Unable to call for help, Atherton and her friend were stranded on the side of the road. Eventually, police arrived and helped her tow her car to a nearby mechanic. The prognosis wasn't good: Her car would need major repairs -- repairs that she didn't have money to cover.

""We were too far away from Pittsburgh and couldn't go back, obviously, to the house [in Annapolis]. So we had nowhere to go,"" Atherton recalled.

As she and her friend began to panic about what to do next, a woman in the waiting room approached them.

""She offered to take us to Pittsburgh. The only caveat was that her cat had diabetes, so she couldn't leave just then. She had to go home and give them the medication that [it] needed in the night.""

The woman, who introduced herself as ""Toni,"" brought Atherton and her friend back to her house.

""She took us in, gave us dinner. We watched Young Frankenstein together. And she gave us a place to sleep. And then in the morning she drove us all the way to Pittsburgh.""

Once they arrived in the city, Atherton was able to find a homeless shelter and begin rebuilding her life. She never saw Toni again, but thinks of her often.

""It's not possible that I thanked her enough. It was a very hard time in my life, and I honestly don't know what would have happened if she hadn't gone so far above and beyond for a complete stranger,"" she said.

""I might not be here. My wonderful children and my loving husband, we might not have our family together. And it was all because of Toni, who decided to help someone stranded at a repair shop."""
"Whey Jennings, singer and Waylon Jennings' grandson, says true love helped him beat 27-year addiction battle",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/whey-jennings-singer-waylon-jennings-grandson-love-helped-beat-27-year-addiction-battle,2024-09-24T08:48:51Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Whey Jennings knew he had to get clean after realizing he could lose his true love for good.

The country singer/songwriter has been sober for four years after battling a crippling addiction to drugs for 27 years. Today, the 43-year-old is using music to help others turn their lives around.

The grandson of Waylon Jennings and Jessi Colter has a new single, ""Sleeves,"" an emotional ballad that shines a light on the dark cycle of addiction.

GRANGER SMITH FEELS 'RELIEF' LEAVING COUNTRY MUSIC TO 'SERVE' GOD: 'I NEED TO COMPLETELY SURRENDER'

""My moral structure was horrible for many years,"" the Nashville recording artist told Fox News Digital. ""I even got into the music business for the wrong reasons. I just wanted the cliché sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. It was just a horrible decision after a horrible decision. And you just do more drugs. ... You get to the point where you feel like even though you need help, you don't deserve it.""

Jennings got his wake-up call when he fell in love and lost the woman he loved. That woman would eventually become his wife, Forbes reported.

""Getting her back is what really sent me over the edge,"" he admitted. ""Once I thought she was gone, I nose-dived into my addiction... I was just floating right on top of rock bottom... I needed to go get help.""

Jennings said he had a ""glimmer of hope"" that he would win her back. His manager, who begged him for years to get help, gave him ""all the information I needed"" to get sober. He finally went to rehab.

""I've gotten all my kids back,"" said the father of six. ""I've gotten married... my wife had a baby. All my kids remember me on drugs except my 3-year-old daughter. She's never known me to be intoxicated in any way. And when I say I'm sober, I'm not just sober off of drugs. I'm sober off of absolutely everything.""

""I don't drink, I don't smoke weed, I don't smoke cigarettes, I don't vape. I don't do none of that,"" Jennings continued. ""I'm 100% what they call a helicopter parent. I'm very present in my kids' life. I'm very present in my marriage life. I'm trying to find this perfect balance between work and home and doing what I'm passionate about, which is writing music that helps touch on things that matter.""

Jennings has released his first full-length album, ""Jekyll & Hyde."" He said it explores the life he's led, from facing his inner demons to chasing the woman of his dreams.

But Jennings isn't finished sharing his story. He's teamed up with Mobilize Recovery, which provides direct outreach in communities to help those struggling with addiction. He's playing music and speaking out on Sept. 24 in Las Vegas. He's then heading to Richmond, Virginia, on Oct. 8.

""Mobilize Recovery is a bus tour that's going across America and helping people get the resources they need to fight addiction,"" he explained. ""I feel very strongly about this. I'm sharing my own experiences as a recovered addict. I want to make a difference. I want to tell people that they can do it too. It's possible. You just got to want it. You've first got to admit you got a problem. Then you've got to give it up to a higher power, whatever your higher power may be... If you can't forgive yourself, how are you ever going to move forward?""

""Getting her back is what really sent me over the edge. Once I thought she was gone, I nose-dived into my addiction... I was just floating right on top of rock bottom... I needed to go get help.""

-- Whey Jennings

Jennings said that a common misconception people have about addicts is that ""they do it to themselves."" He stressed that no one ever signs up to destroy their lives and lose their loved ones.

""You go out to have a good time and to quit thinking about all the problems in your life,"" he said. ""You start chasing a buzz. And then you get so deep into chasing that buzz that you wake up one day 27 years later, and you've [given] your life to a drug addiction, and you can't get it back.""

""It doesn't work like, 'I want to be a drug addict. I want to ruin my life. I want to give every waking hour of my life to this addiction and be a horrible father and a horrible man,'"" he said. ""But drugs will do that to you. They sneak up and bite you. It's a horrible thing.""

""I knew I needed help for a long time,"" Jennings continued. ""But did I want it? No - no, I didn't. The thing about it is, that everybody looks at drug addiction as one thing. But it's a step-by-step process into a really dark place... The drugs force you to make this really awful decision, which makes you feel horrible about yourself, which makes you want to forget about how you feel about yourself... You make one horrible decision, and then you want to cover that up.""

Jennings said that sobriety isn't ""instant gratification."" It's an ongoing journey, but one he's proud to walk.

""That's the one thing we want as addicts - we want instant gratification,"" he said. ""We want to solve the problem and get instant results. That's just not going to happen... You've got to prove yourself to people, especially after you've already proven that you haven't been trustworthy for a long time.""

""Today, I'm doing great,"" he boasted. ""I am the man that I am today, and I'm not going back. That's just all there is to it. And everybody that knows me knows it because I'm not only living it, I'm trying my best to help combat the war on drugs.""

""I'm not chasing fame,"" he shared. ""I'm not chasing the Top 40 charts... I do this to support my family mostly, and to follow the path I believe is going to make the biggest difference in the world. If people enjoy it and I end up being a superstar, great. If people enjoy it and I don't wind up being a superstar, great. As long as I can... make a difference in the world, change maybe one or two lives, I'm happy.""

Despite having one of the most iconic names, Jennings didn't always envision himself pursuing music professionally. His father is the late Terry Jennings, Waylon's oldest son. According to Forbes, he grew up loving his grandfather's music but didn't pursue a music career of his own until about a decade ago.

Jennings said he's determined to make his own mark.

""Everybody in our family has fought tooth and nail to be themselves,"" he said. ""I love my grandfather. I'm super proud of him, and I'm super proud of everybody in my family. But I'm super proud of me too. I've accomplished a lot in the last 15 years. It's taken a lot of fighting... to get where I'm at today. I'm just happy to be who I am. I'm proud of where I come from, but I'm happy to be me.""

For Jennings, it isn't just about performing. At his concerts, he often meets fans and curious listeners, giving encouraging advice to those feeling lost.

""I don't only sing my songs from the stage,"" he said. ""I tell stories about who I am, where I come from, why I have a strong belief in God, why I have a strong belief that anybody can get sober... I want to tell people that if it's possible for me, it's possible for you... If you look back at the man I was 10 years ago, I was almost transparent. Not anymore. I'm happy now.""

""If you do all the necessary footwork that it takes to not only become sober, but trustworthy again, then your life will get a lot better,"" he said. ""I promise you - I'm living proof of it."""
"California family reunites with uncle who was abducted at 6, over 70 years ago",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-family-reunites-uncle-abducted-years-ago,2024-09-24T02:31:02Z,"'Common Sense' Department: A new California bill that just passed through the State Senate could help illegal immigrants qualify for up to $150,000 in interest free home loans.

An Oakland, California woman's perseverance paid off after a decades-long investigation helped reunite her family with her uncle, who was abducted from a park in West Oakland in 1951, according to reports.

The East Bay Times first reported the story about Luis Armando Albino, who at the age of 6 was playing at Jefferson Square Park near Seventh Street with his older brother Roger on Feb. 21, 1951.

That day, the publication reported, a Spanish-speaking woman offered to buy him candy and lured Albino away from the park before abducting and taking him to the East Coast, where he was raised.

The woman who abducted Albino, according to family members who spoke with FOX 2 in San Francisco, has since died.

CALIFORNIA CULT LED BY 'MASTER MANIPULATOR' COMMITTED BRUTAL MURDERS, DETECTIVE SAYS: 'ONE BODY AFTER ANOTHER'

Albino's niece, 63-year-old Alida Alequin, spoke with FOX 2 and shared details about the story of her missing uncle, even after efforts to find him had been made by the Oakland Police Department and FBI.

Alequin said her family never gave up trying to find Albino, nor did she.

In fact, in 2020, she took an online DNA test ""just for fun,"" and matched with a man on the East Coast.

The test Alequin took showed a 22% match with the man who turned out to be her uncle.

After learning of the match, she tried to find out who the man was and reached out, though she never received a response.

""My daughter found a lot of pictures of this man, and we started comparing,"" Alequin told the station. ""The resemblance was so strong... how much he looked like my other uncles. And then another picture where he looked so much like my grandmother, that one gave me chills, and I said, 'there's something here.'""

Albino was ultimately found and provided a DNA sample. Also providing a DNA sample was Alequin's mother and her uncle, Roger.

The DNA samples were compared, and it was confirmed that Luis Albino was their missing relative, family members told the station.

The information was provided to the Oakland Police Department, which was forwarded to the FBI. Oakland police said Alequin's investigation ""played an integral role in finding her uncle,"" adding that ""the outcome of this story is what we strive for.""

Last week, police said the missing persons case for Luis Albino was closed, though the kidnapping is still under investigation by the FBI and police.

Investigators reportedly questioned Albino's brother Roger multiple times, though his story about a woman wearing a bandanna on her head taking her brother remained unchanged.

With the help of the FBI, Albino traveled to Oakland on June 24, 2024, with members of his family and met with Alequin, her mother and other relatives, the station reported.

The following day, Alequin took her mother and uncle - a retired firefighter and Marine Corps veteran who served during the Vietnam War - to Roger's home in Stanislaus County, California.

""We didn't start crying until after the investigators left,"" Alequin told FOX 2. ""I grabbed my mom's hands and said, 'We found him.' I was ecstatic.""

The reunited family had a long and tight hug before sitting down and talking about the day of the kidnapping as well as what has happened since.

Albino eventually went home but returned in July for three weeks, marking the last time he would see his brother, who died in August.

Alequin told the station the two brothers were making up for lost time. She also said her uncle did not wish to speak with the media."

The search for a missing Nashville woman came to a tragic end after police confirmed her body was found inside a home that was under construction.

""Some days, I think they took her and some days, I don't really think anything,"" Berrios Orellana's mother, Ines Berrios told WKRN through a translator.

Berrios added that her daughter's car was found parked at her stepfather's house, but the family hasn't been able to get in contact with him.

Pro-police coffee shop owner wins $4 million in free speech suit against university officials,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/pro-police-coffee-shop-owner-wins-4-million-free-speech-suit-against-university-officials,2024-09-24T00:18:03Z,"Staffing plummeted at police departments across the United States following 2020's anti-police protests, but Idaho saw a spike in out-of-state applications.

Boise State University administrators owe a coffee shop owner $4 million after a jury unanimously ruled the school officials violated the woman's First Amendment rights in a conflict over her public support of law enforcement.

The jury awarded Big City Coffee owner Sarah Fendley $3 million for lost business, reputational damage, mental and emotional distress and personal humiliation, in a decision reached Sept. 13. Jurors awarded her an additional $1 million in punitive damages from the school's former vice president of student affairs.

Fendley originally sued the university for $10 million after she closed her campus shop in October 2020, according to local reports, arguing administrators conspired to retaliate against her for expressing pro-police views on social media.

BLUE LINE GETTING THINNER IN WEST COAST STATES AS POLICE TAKE REFUGE IN IDAHO

A lawyer for the administrators denied any retaliation, and accused Fendley herself of trying to get the university to infringe on students' speech rights.

Big City opened an on-campus location in September 2020, on the heels of the nationwide police reform protests that followed George Floyd's killing in Minneapolis. Fendley's support for law enforcement -- she displayed a thin blue line sticker near the door of the shop's downtown Boise location -- immediately stoked anger among student activists, according to the suit.

""I hope y'all don't go there if you truly support your bipoc peers and other students, staff and faculty,"" one student posted on Snapchat after the shop opened. The acronym BIPOC stands for Black, Indigenous and people of color.

A screenshot of the post was shared with Fendley, who responded to it with her own public Facebook and Instagram posts explaining her support for police, the Idaho Statesman previously reported. At the time, she was engaged to a former Boise police officer who had been paralyzed in a gunfight with a fugitive.

University administrators hastily called a meeting with Fendley, worried about the social media ""firestorm"" her post had created, according to the suit. Defendant Alicia Estey secretly recorded much of the meeting, the Statesman reported, but the recording cut off before the conversation ended, and both sides disputed the outcome.

THIS RED STATE IS BECOMING AN 'EXPAT' COMMUNITY FOR FAMILIES FLEEING WESTERN LIBERAL BASTIONS

Fendley claimed the university terminated her contract because of her support for police, a move her lawyer said clearly violated her free speech rights. Hours before the meeting started, administrators were working on a press release about the business leaving campus, Fendley's attorney Michael Roe said, making it clear they had a single outcome in mind.

""Senior administration at BSU caved to a very small number of student activists,"" Roe told Fox News Digital.

Big City's campus shop closed four days after the meeting, the Statesman reported.

But Estey, who took the stand as the last witness before closing arguments, told jurors, ""We didn't retaliate against [Fendley] at all.""

""She made a choice to leave, which was her choice to make, there was no retaliation,"" Estey said, according to a KTVB report.

HARVARD, COLUMBIA RANK LAST IN NONPROFIT'S 2025 COLLEGE FREE SPEECH SCORECARD

Boise State's attorney Keely Duke argued Fendley was actually the one seeking to suppress speech. Fendley wanted administrators to use the student code of conduct to punish students for expressing views she disagreed with, Duke argued, adding that administrators remained neutral throughout the conflict.

""The First Amendment protects everyone,"" Duke said in court. ""It protects Fendley's right to express her support for the thin blue line. It also supports, though, anyone's right to not support Big City Coffee.""

Jurors deliberated for about three hours before unanimously siding with Fendley.

Duke did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but local outlets reported the administrators plan to appeal the verdict to the Idaho Supreme Court."
U.S. officials say Russia is embracing AI for its election influence efforts,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/nx-s1-5123927/russia-artificial-intelligence-election,2024-09-23T23:07:59Z,"Russia is the most prolific foreign influence actor using artificial intelligence to generate content targeting the 2024 presidential election, U.S. intelligence officials said on Monday.

The cutting-edge technology is making it easier for Russia as well as Iran to quickly and more convincingly tailor often-polarizing content aimed at swaying American voters, an official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told reporters at a briefing.

""The [intelligence community] considers AI a malign influence accelerant, not yet a revolutionary influence tool,"" the official said. ""In other words, information operations are the threat, and AI is an enabler.""

Intelligence officials have previously said they saw AI used in elections overseas. ""Our update today makes clear that this is now happening here,"" the ODNI official said.

Russian influence operations have spread synthetic images, video, audio, and text online, officials said. That includes AI-generated content ""of and about prominent U.S. figures"" and material seeking to emphasize divisive issues such as immigration. Officials said that's consistent with the Kremlin's broader goal to boost former President Donald Trump and denigrate Vice President Kamala Harris.

But Russia is also using lower-tech methods. The ODNI official said Russian influence actors staged a video in which a woman claimed to be a victim of a hit-and-run by Harris in 2011. There's no evidence that ever happened. Last week, Microsoft also said Russia was behind the video, which was spread by a website claiming to be a nonexistent local San Francisco TV station.

Russia is also behind manipulated videos of Harris's speeches, the ODNI official said. They may have been altered using editing tools or with AI. They were disseminated on social media and using other methods.

""One of the efforts we see Russian influence actors do is, when they create this media, try to encourage its spread,"" the ODNI official said.

The official said the videos of Harris had been altered in a range of ways, to ""paint her in a bad light both personally but also in comparison to her opponent"" and to focus on issues Russia believes are divisive.

Iran has also tapped AI to generate social media posts and write fake stories for websites posing as legitimate news outlets, officials said. The intelligence community has said Iran is seeking to undercut Trump in the 2024 election.

Iran has used AI to create such content in both English and Spanish, and is targeting Americans ""across the political spectrum on polarizing issues"" including the war in Gaza and the presidential candidates, officials said.

China, the third main foreign threat to U.S. elections, is using AI in its broader influence operations that aim to shape global views of China and amplify divisive topics in the U.S. such as drug use, immigration, and abortion, officials said.

However, officials said they had not identified any AI-powered operations targeting the outcome of voting in the U.S. The intelligence community has said Beijing's influence operations are more focused on down-ballot races in the U.S. than the presidential contest.

U.S. officials, lawmakers, tech companies, and researchers have been concerned about the potential for AI-powered manipulation to upend this year's election campaign, such as deepfake videos or audio depicting candidates doing or saying something they didn't or misleading voters about the voting process.

While those threats may yet still materialize as election day draws closer, so far AI has been used more frequently in different ways: by foreign adversaries to improve productivity and boost volume, and by political partisans to generate memes and jokes.

On Monday, the ODNI official said foreign actors have been slow to overcome three main obstacles to AI-generated content becoming a greater risk to American elections: first, overcome guardrails built into many AI tools without being detected; second, develop their own sophisticated models; and third, strategically target and distribute AI content.

As Election Day nears, the intelligence community will be monitoring for foreign efforts to introduce deceptive or AI-generated content in a variety of ways, including ""laundering material through prominent figures,"" using fake social media accounts or websites posing as news outlets, or ""releasing supposed 'leaks' of AI-generated content that appear sensitive or controversial,"" the ODNI report said.

Earlier this month, the Justice Department accused Russian state broadcaster RT, which the U.S. government says operates as an arm of Russian intelligence services, of funneling nearly $10 million to pro-Trump American influencers who posted videos critical of Harris and Ukraine. The influencers say they didn't know the money came from Russia."
Fox News Politics: Swing State Stats,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-politics-swing-state-stats,2024-09-23T22:38:41Z,"Welcome to Fox News' Politics newsletter with the latest political news from Washington D.C. and updates from the 2024 campaign trail.

Former President Donald Trump leads Vice President Kamala Harris in three crucial swing states, according to a Monday poll from the New York Times.

Trump is leading Harris in Arizona by five points in a 50%-45% spread, and he holds a similar 49%-45% lead in Georgia. Harris is closer to the former president in North Carolina, however, where the race sits at 49%-47%, according to the poll.

The Times conducted its poll from Sept. 17-21, surveying 2,077 likely voters across all three states.

Arizona and Georgia would be major victories for Trump in the general election, as both are states that President Biden won in 2020. Arizona in particular represents a major swing toward Trump, where a Times poll in August found Harris leading by five points.

The Times survey comes days after a Fox News national poll found Harris leading Trump by two points in a 50%-48% matchup.

MC Lyte Excudes Grown Woman Rap In '1 Of 1': Her First Album Release In 9 Years,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/imeekpo/2024/09/23/mc-lyte-excudes-grown-woman-rap-in-1-of-1-her-first-album-release-in-9-years/,2024-09-23T22:01:20Z,"MC Lyte, the groundbreaking hip-hop luminary, has officially returned from her musical hiatus.

On Friday, Lyte released her 9th studio album, 1 of 1. Executive produced by Grammy Award-winner Warryn Campbell, the project features an impressive lineup of cultural icons, including Stevie Wonder, Queen Latifah, Cheryl ""Salt"" James, Mary Mary, Big Daddy Kane, Q-Tip, Ghostface Killah, Common, Raheem DeVaughn, and more.

Lyte has joined the league of hip-hop legends making comebacks to their signature stances in 2024. This year has seen an array of new releases from artists like LL Cool J, Rakim, Common, and Pete Rock. Based on observation, MC Lyte appears to be one of the few, if not the only, female MC from her era to release a fully developed project in 2024.

In our exclusive interview last month, while enjoying breakfast at Junior's on 42nd Street, the ""Woman"" MC shared how hip-hop's 50th anniversary last year confirmed the strong demand and space for hip-hop legends, or rather, old-school artists, in today's music scene.

""The people were there,"" said Lyte. ""It was like we really gained an understanding of the many generations that have been influenced by what we've done for years, and it's like, 'Oh, they want to see us!' So, somehow I think we might have lost sight of it -- LL never did, which is why he put all his time, energy, and invested himself into Rock The Bells Radio -- because there's an audience there.

""I think that everyone independently thought it was time, and perhaps last year was a testament to that,"" Lyte continued. ""With it being the 50th year of hip-hop and the advent of LL Cool J's reimagined backspin into Rock The Bells Radio, we all did quite a bit of touring last year. We did the Rock The Bells festival, the Rock The Bells cruise, and several dates on The Force Tour.""

Lyte revealed the upcoming album during an appearance on the Rock the Bells radio show That's The Joint with hip-hop pioneers MC Sha Rock and Grandmaster Caz. 1 of 1 marks her first solo album in 9 years, following the release of Legend in 2015.

It's fitting to say this album is a prime example of what grown woman rap sounds like. There's no braggadocio about the self-proclaimed pleasurable mechanics a girl theorizes as an offering, or material gains like money and designer fashion. In particular, on the track ""Woman,"" R&B singer Raheem DeVaughn delivers the hook, while Cheryl ""Salt"" James (Salt-N-Pepa) and Big Daddy Kane contribute verses in a powerful ode to Black women, celebrating their regal presence and undeniable strength.

""I ain't never wanted nothing but some respect/And see the love from his eyes be reflected/Never looking for a handout or a check/Just a humble spirit looking for a real connection,"" Lyte raps, crystalizing the definition of grown woman rap.

Fans of hip-hop's golden era are in for a treat as Salt from Salt-N-Pepa showcases the evolution of her rap skills -- a performance exuding class and finesse, hallmarks of the legendary artist's signature style.

""Salt, of course, I used to say all of her lyrics when I was rehearsing before I even became MC Lyte,"" said MC Lyte. ""And she's a friend; we attend the same church. She just moved to Cali. It's easy. It's like, hey, we're working in the studio, need you to come by. She comes by, she hears 'Woman' -- at that point, Kane and Raheem were already on it -- and she goes, 'Oh, I want to be on this one.' So we actually shortened my verse, shortened Kane's verse, and put her right there.""

Stevie Wonder makes an exciting appearance on ""Change Your Ways"" alongside Common, offering a soulful hook while Common's signature lyricism shines with lines like ""Keeper for my brothers, reaching for my sisters.""

Moreover, Q-Tip graces the album, enhancing the nostalgia by giving MC Lyte a taste of the signature A Tribe Called Quest sound on the track ""Kick Back Relax.""

""For 'Kick Back Relax,' it sounds like a classic Tribe song, and because of that, I felt like, wow, Q-Tip would sound right at home on this. And, you know, not to mention, I can reach out -- hey, I need this -- and literally, he sent it the next day,"" Lyte recalled.

Mary Mary and Muni Long team up on ""Thank You,"" a track that highlights Lyte's seasoned perspective, delivering a stirring anthem about triumphing over adversity and the power of praise in tough times. The gospel-infused vocals amplify the track's uplifting spirit, showcasing Lyte's growth as both an emcee and a thoughtful storyteller. The music video draws clear inspiration from Lyte's iconic 1991 single ""Poor Georgie,"" with the Brooklyn native positioned in the New York City MTA subway, embodying hip-hop's rap element.

The album also taps into Lyte's Brooklyn roots, particularly on the DJ Scratch-produced track about the struggles of chasing dreams, delivering a gritty, raw energy that perfectly complements Lyte's iconic flow. For the first time, Lyte collaborates with legendary hip-hop producer Easy Mo Bee and enlists veteran producer Nottz Da Ruler alongside bourgeoning talent Koncept. In a full-circle moment, Lyte also reunites with King of Chill, who contributed to the production of her 1988 debut album, Lyte as a Rock.

A standout is ""King King,"" featuring Queen Latifah, a throwback to Lyte's classic storytelling style reminiscent of ""Cappucino,"" where both queens address grown situationships with a mix of self-awareness and empowerment. Lyte's chemistry with Ghostface Killah on the appropriately braggadocious ""Gritty"" is undeniable, with Ghost's explosive verse advocating for hip-hop pioneers to own their masters, reminding listeners that this is more than just music -- it's about securing the legacy of hip-hop's trailblazers. The track also features Lil Mama and steers as Lyte's continuous co-sign of the Harlem rapper's lyrical dexterity.

""These are not people that were just conveniently there for me to get, but that I'm actually fans of,"" said MC Lyte. ""I love Ghostface's flow because it's unorthodox. I love Common's voice, and I love his poetry style of rap. With Toni [Braxton], I've loved everything she's done since the '90s.""

""I think Muni is probably the most modern on there, and that's just because we have a mutual respect for one another,"" Lyte continued. ""I said, 'Hey, you want to get down on something?' She was like, 'Yes, and she followed through. And then, of course, probably the youngest is Lil Mama on the Ghostface Killah song. And I'm a fan of Mama's; I think that she's one of the best rappers out of New York City. It's just we don't hear from her enough, but I love her flow.""

In our interview, MC Lyte revealed that a part two of the album will be released soon, featuring Toni Braxton, Slick Rick, Anthony Hamilton, and more to be announced. This return to the booth allows Lyte to bring her musical visions to life and curate the quality sound that classic hip-hop deserves.

""We all came quickly to the realization, 'Let's put some music out.' And then I remember [Big Daddy] Kane told me, 'I'm doing it because you're doing it.' So it's like everybody kind of hears, 'Oh, so-and-so is... we're from the same era, I'm gonna do something too.' It is something that just lives in us. I record all the time, but this will be the first time in a long time I've put energy into actually releasing the music."""
Opinion | Prosecutors believe this Missouri man is innocent. The state wants to execute him anyway.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/marcellus-williams-missouri-execution-prosecutors-innocent-rcna172234,2024-09-23T21:48:26Z,"On Tuesday, the state of Missouri is scheduled to execute Marcellus Williams even though no one with a stake in the outcome of the case wants him to die.

On Tuesday evening, Marcellus Williams will be strapped to a gurney at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, Missouri. He will be allowed to offer his last words. Barring a last-minute intervention by Missouri's governor or the courts, he'll then be injected with a lethal cocktail of drugs that will end his life. Williams, who was convicted in August 2001 for the brutal stabbing murder of Felicia Gayle Picus, may very well be innocent.

There is no physical or forensic evidence linking Williams to the crime scene. Fingerprints taken at the crime scene were inexplicably destroyed. Neither bloodied footprints nor hair at the crime scene could be linked to to Williams. The evidence against him is the testimony of two eyewitnesses -- a jailhouse informant and Williams' former girlfriend. His attorneys argue that both implicated Williams because they wanted to claim a $10,000 reward.

But perhaps the most unusual element of Williams' situation is that, seemingly, no one with a stake in the outcome of the case wants him to die. Gayle Picus' family, who believe that Williams is guilty, opposes the imposition of the death penalty. Members of the jury have expressed second thoughts about the verdict. And even the office that prosecuted Williams, the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney's Office, has led the charge to free Williams from prison.

Quite often, it is the prosecuting attorneys who work most feverishly to uphold a successful conviction, but last January, St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell filed a court motion to vacate Williams' prosecution. (A 2021 state law allows Missouri prosecutors to ask a court to vacate a conviction they believe was unjust. Three other men already have been freed after decades in prison under that law.)

At the time, Bell's office cited testing that found Williams' DNA was not on the murder weapon. Subsequent tests, however, revealed that the knife had been mishandled by law enforcement, making a potentially exonerating DNA test impossible. Wiliams, who has long maintained his innocence, subsequently reached a painful agreement with prosecutors. In return for pleading no contest to first-degree murder, he would receive a new sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Unless Williams could find another way to prove his innocence, he would likely live out his days under lock and key. But he would avoid execution.

Judge Bruce Hilton and Gayle Picus' family agreed to the deal. However, after lobbying from Andrew Bailey, the state's Republican attorney general, the Missouri Supreme Court scrapped the agreement and ordered Hilton to conduct an evidentiary hearing.

According to Williams' attorney, Tricia Rojo Bushnell, a lawyer at the Midwest Innocence Project who has worked on Williams' case for the past seven years, ""it is very unusual"" for a prosecutor to seek to vacate a murder conviction, ""and more unusual for a court not to agree to the prosecutor's motion.""

But the latter is precisely what happened. On Sept. 12, Hilton ruled that ""there is no basis for a court to find that Williams is innocent, and no Court has made such a finding."" Thus, Hilton concluded, the death sentence verdict must be carried out -- even though he had agreed to the reduced sentence of life without parole just the month before.

""What we have here,"" said Bushnell, ""is a duly elected prosecutor from where this case happened who wants to overturn this conviction and an attorney general who was appointed [to the job], who doesn't live in St. Louis County, trying to put him to death."" (Bailey was appointed as attorney general after his predecessor, Eric Schmitt, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2022.)

Williams' lawyers are continuing to try and save his life. They've filed a cert petition pending in the Supreme Court, a motion at the Eighth Circuit based on new facts that have emerged regarding the striking of Black jurors by the prosecution that might have violated his constitutional rights, and an appeal asking the Missouri Supreme Court to overturn Hilton's ruling. But Williams' likely last best hope is a grant of clemency from Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, who has never granted clemency in any of the previous 11 death penalty cases since he took office.

I asked Bushnell how Williams was holding up, knowing that he could die on Tuesday night -- or could be granted a last-minute reprieve. ""He's trying to hold both thoughts at the same time,"" she says. ""He remains hopeful but understands the balance of preparing for the moment and is focused on his family and his Muslim faith.""

It's hard to imagine the trauma of being so close to death's door, but Williams has been down this road before. He received a reprieve in 2015 and then in August 2017, hours before he was scheduled to die, when then-Gov. Eric Greitens, a Republican, granted a stay of execution. Then there's the impact on the victims, who have had to relive this agony over and over for years, and Williams' family. His son has gone through this for years, says Bushnell, not knowing if his father will die.

The whole experience feels like cruel and unusual punishment for all concerned and reminds us that the American death penalty creates far more agony and trauma than it does relief.

Still, no matter one's view on capital punishment, whether for or against it, all surely agree that no innocent man or woman should be sentenced to death. I don't know if Marcellus Williams is innocent or guilty, but when the prosecuting attorney's office, members of the jury, and even the victim's families express doubt about the death penalty, shouldn't that be enough to stop an execution from going forward? If those with the most at stake in the decision are opposed, what good reason is there to take the life of a man who could very well be innocent?

One can only hope that Gov. Parson makes the right decision and spares Marcellus Williams' life."
Indiana judge rules prison must provide transgender surgery for inmate who killed baby,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/indiana-judge-rules-prison-must-provide-transgender-surgery-inmate-who-killed-baby,2024-09-23T20:48:50Z,"'Fox News @ Night' panelists Peachy Keenan and Elizabeth Barcohana discuss Vice President Kamala Harris' changing position on transgender surgery for inmates.

A federal judge has ruled that it would be unconstitutional for an Indiana prison to deny a transgender inmate sex reassignment surgery following the inmate's lawsuit against the facility.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued the Indiana Department of Corrections last year on behalf of a transgender inmate, Jonathan C. Richardson, also known as Autumn Cordellionè, who was convicted of strangling his 11-month-old stepdaughter to death in 2001.

Indiana law, however, prohibits the Department of Corrections from using taxpayer dollars to fund sex reassignment surgeries for inmates. However, the ACLU argues in the lawsuit, filed on Aug. 28, 2023, that the law is a violation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of ""cruel and unusual punishment.""

ACLU SUES INDIANA OVER DENIAL OF SEX REASSIGNMENT SURGERY FOR INMATE WHO STRANGLED 11-MONTH-OLD TO DEATH

The surgery for Richardson, who is serving out a 55-year prison sentence for reckless homicide, ""is a medical necessity,"" according to the ACLU lawsuit.

Judge Richard Young agreed with the ACLU's claims and ruled in favor of Cordellioné last week.

""Specifically, Ms. Cordellioné has shown that her gender dysphoria is a serious medical need, and that, despite other treatments Defendant has provided her to treat her gender dysphoria, she requires gender-affirming surgery to prevent a risk of serious bodily and psychological harm,"" the ruling states.

The DOC must now take ""all reasonable actions"" to ensure Cordellioné undergoes sex surgery, according to the order.

Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, a Republican, said in a post on X that his office is still reviewing the judge's decision, ""but you can undoubtedly expect our office to appeal this decision.""

""An Indiana inmate convicted of murder wants our taxpayers to fund their gender-altering surgery! Hoosiers do NOT want thism"" Rokita said.

TRANS INMATE WHO KILLED BABY AND IDENTIFIES AS MUSLIM WOMAN SUES CHAPLAIN FOR ALLEGEDLY NOT ALLOWING HIJAB

The original ACLU filing says Cordellioné was diagnosed in 2020 with gender dysphoria and prescribed female hormones and testosterone blockers, both of which he has ""consistently taken since that time."" Other accommodations provided for the inmate include ""panties, make up, and form fitting clothing.""

""Accordingly, at this point gender-affirming surgery is necessary so that her physical identity can be aligned with her gender identity and so her gender dysphoria can be ameliorated,"" the lawsuit states.

""She believes that the only remedy for her persistent gender dysphoria, and the serious harm it causes her, is to receive gender-affirming surgery, specifically an orchiectomy and vaginoplasty,"" it said.

Cordellioné has identified as a woman since 6 years old, the ACLU lawsuit also claims, and the inmate is ""a woman trapped in a man's body.""

According to court documents, Cordellioné strangled his then-wife's 11-month-year old daughter to death while she was at work on Sept. 12, 2001. During RCordellioné's initial interview with one of the detectives, he was calm and ""unemotional"" when recounting what happened, court documents from Indiana's Court of Appeals show.

Described as a gender-flipping reboot of the original Matlock with Andy Griffith, Kathy Bates plays Madeline Matlock, who claims to be a widowed, inexperienced ex-lawyer raising her grandson and in need of money, who takes a job at Olympia's law firm. In this pilot episode, we learn that she is actually Madeline Kingston, a wealthy woman whose husband is still alive. She took the job at the law firm firm because she believes that a senior partner at the firm - either Olympia, her soon-to-be ex-husband Julian, or her father-in-law - hid documents that led to the death of her daughter from an opioid overdose.

Eric Roberts slams Julia's Oscar-nominated 'Steel Magnolias' performance: 'Crying gets a lot of credit',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/eric-roberts-slams-julias-oscar-nominated-steel-magnolias-performance,2024-09-23T20:22:43Z,"George Clooney and Julia Roberts discussed their close friendship during the ""Ticket to Paradise"" premiere night on Monday night in Los Angeles.

Eric Roberts, the elder brother of the beloved Julia Roberts, isn't afraid to publicly critique one of his sister's most profound performances.

""Julia was good in 'Mystic Pizza,' great in 'Pretty Woman,' but not so much in 'Steel Magnolias,' in my opinion, even though it brought Julia her first Academy Award nomination,"" he wrote in his memoir out now, ""Runaway Train: Or, The Story of My Life So Far,"" per Entertainment Weekly.

""I don't want to sound like an actor talking, or a jealous sibling, but I don't think her performance held up in that movie. When I saw her in 'Steel Magnolias,' I thought, 'Okay. Good. She's almost a good actor, and one day she's gonna be one,'"" Eric wrote.

ERIC ROBERTS OFFERS 'PUBLIC APOLOGY' TO SISTER JULIA ROBERTS

""In fact, I think all those brilliant women - Sally Fields [sic], Dolly Parton, Olympia Dukakis, Shirley MacLaine, Daryl Hannah - overacted their asses off in 'Steel Magnolias,'"" he continued. ""Nobody's great in that movie. They all chewed a lot of scenery, and we know that if an actor cries on film, they go to the top of the class. They get the Oscar nod because crying gets a lot of credit. It's the big joke in all acting classes, even in the great Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio. Crying and dying bring home the bacon!""

""Julia was good in 'Mystic Pizza,' great in 'Pretty Woman,' but not so much in 'Steel Magnolias,' in my opinion.""

-- Eric Roberts

Brenda Fricker ended up beating Julia for best supporting actress at the Oscars in 1990, for her performance in ""My Left Foot.""

Eric continued to qualify his sister's nomination, saying her ""Southern charm"" contributed. ""I also think another reason she got an Oscar nod for 'Steel Magnolias' was her authenticity as a sweet, small-town Southern girl,"" he wrote. ""That's what she was, after all, or at least that's how she started off. I don't know if she had a dialect coach try to eradicate her Southern accent, but if so, luckily for her it didn't take.""

""I think that's a big part of her appeal - along with her boffo good looks and killer smile - her Southern accent and mannerisms,"" he added. ""Beauty like that can be off-putting, especially for other women, but Julia's down-home manner made her seem like your best friend. There's a certain colorful and enchanting quality to Southern speech.""

""We know that if an actor cries on film, they go to the top of the class. They get the Oscar nod because crying gets a lot of credit.""

-- Eric Roberts

Eric insisted in his memoir that he was ""not really"" jealous of Julia, particularly because they never auditioned for the same roles. He can admit, however, that he felt his presence in Hollywood shrinking as Julia's enlarged.

""When suddenly this rare and rarefied thing occurred, this worldwide phenomenon of Julia's stardom, it shoved me into the public eye in a different way,"" he wrote.

""First, there were all kinds of suspicions cast upon us - even outlandish and creepy rumors of incest. I don't exactly know where that started,"" he said. ""It could have been a dumb idea of what Southerners were capable of - a mean-spirited swipe at the South. But beyond that, it seemed as if there wasn't room in the public imagination for both Julia and me - that we were in competition with each other.""

The Roberts' family is from a small suburb of Atlanta, Georgia.

Although he wasn't jealous of his sister, he didn't necessarily voice his support.

""When you rule the world, which she kind of did for a while, and a member of your family is slow to acknowledge that, you hold it against them,"" he wrote of not immediately acknowledging her success. ""I never paid enough homage to her. I still saw her as my baby sister, and I knew that she - like me - came from white trash, yet she became one of the biggest stars that ever breathed. And she knew it, bless her heart. What a trajectory!""

Eric's relationship with Julia remains unclear - in 2018, he infamously told Vanity Fair that he had paved the way for both Julia and his daughter, actress Emma Roberts. ""If it wasn't for me, there would be no Julia Roberts and no Emma Roberts as celebrities, as actresses, and I'm very proud of that,"" he said then.

According to an excerpt of his book obtained by People magazine, Eric apologizes for that remark. ""I hope Julia will accept this public apology. It was an asinine thing to have said.""

Representatives for both Eric and Julia Roberts did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment."
"Bay Area's Inaugural Black Art Week Begins October 1, 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chaddscott/2024/09/23/bay-areas-inaugural-black-art-week-begins-october-1-2024/,2024-09-23T20:00:12Z,"Museums, galleries, artist studios, and creative spaces open their doors welcoming guests to explore the Bay Area's rich Black arts community

One person can't make an art scene, but one person can bring it together.

That's Monetta White's goal for the inaugural ""Nexus: SF/Bay Area Black Art Week"" taking place October 1 through 6, 2024.

From her position as the executive director and CEO of San Francisco's Museum of the African Diaspora, the lifelong San Franciscan recognized an opportunity to bring artists, museums, galleries, creative spaces, collectors, and art lovers together this fall across the Bay Area.

""Community,"" White told Forbes.com when asked about her goals for the event. ""Connecting our region and the arts, strengthening ties between the San Francisco Bay Area at large. We're stronger when we come together as a region.""

Connecting the museums and galleries and collectors-candidly, the money-of San Francisco, with the artists and studios of Oakland, where much of the region's creative talent lives and works due to San Francisco's exorbitant real estate prices.

""The (San Francisco-Oakland Bay) bridge is so much easier and faster to get back and forth than going from one side of town in L.A. to the next,"" White said. ""If we can start shifting that mindset-our art scene, culture, it's really not that far, it's right there-and so I'm trying to amplify that collective impact within San Francisco and Oakland, we shouldn't let the bridge disconnect us.""

For all the Bay Area's cultural gems and opportunities, the scene lacks proximity. Art makers, art lovers, art museums, and art galleries are disconnected geographically. The Bay Area doesn't have a defined ""arts district,"" although to visit the city, the entirety of it feels like an arts district for all the architecture and history and museums.

Chinatown-North America's oldest and largest-is as culturally rich a neighborhood as exists in America. Dogpatch-with its Minnesota Street Project-has become a hub for galleries. SoMA-South of Market-hosts the prestigious San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Museum of the African Diaspora, and the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, all next door to each other. Haight Ashbury, the epicenter of 60s counterculture adjacent to Golden Gate Park and the de Young Museum, remains artsy.

But these neighborhoods are here and there, spread out, and the collaborations and energy fostered by casual routine proximity-sharing the same coffee place-don't have the opportunity to develop in San Francisco as they do in New York or Santa Fe, NM or cities where the arts community is densely sited.

""Nexus"" gives artists, arts workers, and art lovers across the Bay Area an excuse to be in the same places at the same times.

""Let's make this a week of going out to support art where it is. Let's amplify it. Let's tell the world what the Bay Area has to offer,"" White said. ""When you're by yourself and you're doing something, you don't get that pump, but if we all collectively come together and say this is everything that we're doing all together, then it has power.""

Bookended by the opening of the Museum of the African Diaspora's fall exhibition, ""Liberatory Living: Protective Interiors & Radical Black Joy,"" and the museum's annual fundraiser gala, the Afropolitan Ball, ""Nexus"" offers a weeklong smorgasbord of talks, openings, exhibitions, open studios, even a Black Cowboys Parade and Festival-the 50 Annual Oakland Black Cowboy Association Parade and Festival on October 5.

Saturday, October 5, also represents ""Nexus'"" big day of open art studios for the public to visit, details of which can be found on the event's website along with a full rundown of events.

Other highlights include free admission for Bay Area residents and extended nighttime hours Thursday, October 3, at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art where an exhibition of Mary Lovelace O'Neal's paintings shouldn't be missed. O'Neal (b. 1942) moved to San Francisco in 1969 after graduating with a Master of Fine Art degree from Columbia.

Among artworks on view are early paintings from the 1960s utilizing lampblack pigment -- powdered soot created from burning oil-which she rubbed and pushed into her canvases. O'Neal used this technique to address three subjects at the fore of art and culture at that moment, which she describes as ""surface flatness, black as a color, and blackness as an existential, racial experience.""

O'Neal was born in Jackson, MS, the black heart of Jim Crow America. She attended college at historically Black Howard University in Washington, D.C. where she was involved with the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee in the 60s. In 1979, O'Neal was hired at the University of California, Berkeley, where she became the first African American professor awarded tenure in the Department of Art Practice in 1985, and chair of the department in 1999.

SFMOMA also hosts a screening and discussion on Sunday, October 6, with contemporary art superstar Titus Kaphar around his new feature film Exhibiting Forgiveness. Admission is free, but registration is required to attend.

Friday, October 4, make plans for Oakland First Fridays, an art and community experience from 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM in the KONO District. The neighborhood comes alive with open galleries, artist collectives, street artists, local food, performers, musicians, dancers, DJ's, and poets gathering.

""We have a vibrant art scene and I wanted to really showcase what the Black artists had to do to contribute to that,"" White said.

""Nexus"" seeks to rally and connect the whole of the Bay Area arts community through the talent and experiences of its Black artists.

""If you're an artist, you're an artist, however, I think that with the San Francisco Bay Area, particularly in San Francisco, with a shortage of (Black resident and artist) population, it's important to amplify that we are here and that there's something for this Black community,"" White explained. ""It's important to have a Black Arts Week because we contribute to the scene differently. Within our Black art and culture-it's the same thing with any other culture-whether music or art or historical backgrounds, it's important to highlight that heritage.""

Black art is produced by Black artists, but it's for everyone, same as Latinx art, or Asian art, or Native American art.

Highlighting Black art and Black artists not only serves to correct art historical biases, it signals a welcome to audiences who may have traditionally felt excluded from the hoity-toity ""fine art"" world.

""I've lived here all my life and as an African American woman who's been interested in arts, I'm always seeking that. I want other people to know that this is here for them too,"" White said. ""(Nexus) comes from me always wanting to highlight the richness of the Bay Area and the art scene, and particularly uplift the Black art and cultural scene as well."""
Usher says social media account was 'hacked' after Diddy arrest,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/usher-says-social-media-account-hacked-after-diddy-arrest,2024-09-23T20:00:08Z,"Usher is explaining what happened to his social media history on X.

On Sunday, the entirety of the ""Confessions"" singer's social media history disappeared from X, prompting many to wonder what had happened.

His posts remained active on other sites like Instagram.

Later in the day, Usher tweeted an explanation.

SEAN 'DIDDY' COMBS' FORMER PROTÉGÉ SHYNE SAYS DISGRACED MUSIC MOGUL 'DESTROYED' HIS LIFE

""Account got hacked and damn y'all ran with it!"" he wrote, adding: ""See you tonight at Intuit Dome,"" referring to the Intuit Dome in Los Angeles, the latest stop on his Past, Present, Future Tour.

Usher has additional coming up dates in Oakland, California, and more around the country.

Representatives for Usher did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

The disappearance of Usher's post raised eyebrows among internet users who questioned the timing of the incident in light of the singer's professional relationship with Sean ""Diddy"" Combs.

""Account got hacked and damn y'all ran with it!""

-- Usher

Combs was arrested last week and charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and transportation to engage in prostitution.

Authorities claimed Diddy ran a criminal enterprise through his businesses, including Bad Boy Entertainment, Combs Enterprises and Combs Global, among others. He used ""violence, use of firearms, threats of violence, coercion, and verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse"" to fulfill his sexual desires, according to the unsealed indictment obtained by Fox News Digital.

Combs had been a mentor to Usher, working with the singer from his teen years and executive producing his 1994 debut album.

In a clip that resurfaced in the wake of the federal raid on Combs' home earlier this year, Usher recalled his early days with the now disgraced mogul in a 2016 interview with Howard Stern.

""I moved to New York City, and I lived with Sean 'Puffy' Combs for a year,"" Usher said in the clip.

Stern asked if ""Puffy's place was like just filled with chicks and orgying like nonstop, right?""

""Nah, not really. It was curious. I got a chance to see some things,"" Usher said, later adding, ""I went there to see the lifestyle, and I saw it. And it was... But I don't know if I could indulge and understand what I was even looking at. It was pretty wild. It was crazy.""

Co-host Robin Quivers asked, ""So nobody tried to, you know, some woman didn't come along...""

Usher laughed before adding, ""I didn't say that. What I did say is that there were very curious things taking place, and I didn't necessarily understand it.""

He noted that the parties were filled with industry heavy-hitters, including, ""Biggie Smalls was there, Lil Kim, Craig Mack... Faith Evans, Jodeci, Mary J. Blige.""

Quivers asked Usher if his parents were OK with what was happening, and the ""Yeah!"" singer replied, ""They didn't know nothing about this s---. I was having a good time.""

"Enigmatic voter group could split ticket for Trump, Dem Senate candidate in Arizona",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/enigmatic-voter-group-could-split-ticket-trump-dem-senate-candidate-arizona,2024-09-23T19:57:48Z,"Arizona Cardinals apologized to the woman, saying a security worker misunderstood the stadium's policy on political displays.

One group of voters could fuel a win for Democrats in the Arizona Senate race while also propelling former President Trump to victory in the key battleground state.

Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris among registered voters in Arizona 49% to 45% in a new poll from the New York Times and Siena College. This was a notable shift from their numbers last month, when Harris came out on top.

At the same time, Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., bested Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake 50% to 41%.

According to the New York Times, ""The respondents who said they were splitting their ticket - supporting Mr. Gallego and Mr. Trump - were much more likely to be Latino, less college-educated and lower-income.""

Gallego voted 100% in line with President Biden and Harris' administration in the 117th Congress, per FiveThirtyEight, and is by no means a fan of Trump, and the former president is an ardent supporter of Lake.

Despite their political disagreements, they've managed to simultaneously attract a key group of voters.

""You always have to consider in American politics whether gender is playing a role,"" Melissa Michelson, the dean of arts and sciences and a political science professor at Menlo College in California, told Fox News Digital.

Trump and Gallego are both facing off against women in their respective races.

""What gender scholars will tell you is that when women are running, they face additional challenges,"" she explained.

With Trump's election in 2016, his strength among those without college degrees became evident. He's also shown an ability to appeal to non-White voters, including Latinos, who are considered integral to the Democrats' coalition.

His enduring appeal to these types of voters is on display in the latest poll as well. ""And yes, those same voters would be more likely to prefer the Latino candidate,"" said Michelson, explaining the preference of some of those voters for Gallego in the Senate race.

She noted that Latinos tend to vote Democrat more often than not and that they also tend to vote for Latino candidates. ""If a candidate before you is both your shared racial group and your shared party, then that's easy,"" Michelson remarked.

When it comes to women perhaps feeling inclined to vote for women candidates, she pointed out that gender isn't ""as strong of an identity or as strong of a motivator of vote choice.""

""People just don't think about their gender the same way they think about their race.""

The potential for a split result in Arizona, with Trump winning the presidency and Gallego taking the open Senate seat, would be notable given the recent decline in split-ticket voting.

HARRIS, TRUMP DEADLOCKED IN PENNSYLVANIA AS FORMER PRESIDENT TRAILS IN OTHER 'BLUE WALL' STATES: POLL

Republican strategist Kevin Madden said the vote is ultimately ""candidate-dependent.""

""Sherrod Brown in Ohio and Ruben Gallego in Arizona are examples of two candidates running very carefully tailored races that are customized to their state's political environment,"" he told Fox News Digital.

It's true that Gallego has made a concerted effort to reach a male, Latino audience. For Cinco de Mayo this year, his campaign held a watch party in Glendale at JL Boxing Academy for a match between champion Mexican boxer Canelo Álvarez and fellow fighter Jaime Munguía, who was undefeated until that point. The venue was reportedly outfitted with large screens displaying the fight, and the event featured food trucks serving birria tacos and Mexican Cokes outside.

The watch party was expected to draw over 100 guests, mainly Latino Arizonans and their families.

""They're doing whatever they can to get out of the national political jet-stream and make their campaign less of a proxy on the presidential contest,"" Madden said.

Michelson claimed that recent endorsements from the Arizona Police Association (APA) for both Gallego and Trump could encourage the increasingly rare practice of split-ticket voting. Despite backing Trump and reportedly endorsing Lake during her 2022 gubernatorial bid, the union chose Democrat Gallego in the Senate race in 2024.

However, Lake did get the backing of a separate police union, the Arizona Fraternal Order of Police, earlier this month."
Shaq Says Supreme Talent Of Reese And Clark Makes Case For Equal Pay,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyfrye/2024/09/23/shaq-says-supreme-talent-of-reese-and-clark-makes-case-for-equal-pay/,2024-09-23T19:38:18Z,"Last week, serial entrepreneur and investor Shaquille O'Neal announced his newest business partnership, the first one in the realm of AI, with fintech firm Klarna.

The Hall of Fame hoops man also said he's impressed with and excited about another growing business venture out there: women's sports, especially the WNBA.

""The emergence of and the number of eyes on women's basketball has been great,"" O'Neal said during our Zoom interview just a week ago.

He added that the WNBA ""has always had those kind of great players,"" naming Phoenix Mercury guard and three-time WNBA champion Diana Taurasi as one of many legendary and transformational players that make the league and the women's side of the game exhilarating.

Shaq points to two key stars in the newest generation of WNBA players who he thinks give the league new staying power and will continue to create excitement for the tens of millions of fans tuning in.

Those two new players are, of course, Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese.

""You've got Caitlin Clark,"" Shaq said, ""who is a Steph Curry kind of a player. There aren't too many players other than Diana Taurasi and maybe Sue Bird who play like Caitlin Clark plays.""

This year, Clark, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft, joined the Indiana Fever, while Reese, the No. 7 pick, went to the Chicago Sky. Clark, a guard, averaged 19.2 points per game this year (7th overall) during the regular season, while Reese, a forward, led the WNBA in rebounds at 13.1 per game while boasting an impressive 13.6 points per game.

But there is also something special about the rookies' natural rivalry that has added new enthusiasm to the already popular league.

""The way Caitlin and Angel (Reese) were going back and forth, first with LSU and Iowa, then in the (WNBA) league. It has brought a lot more eyes on the game.""

After the conclusion of the regular season, Clark and the Indiana Fever eked out a playoff berth with a 20-20 record. Currently, the Fever are down one game in a playoff series against the Connecticut Sun.

Two weeks ago, Reese underwent successful surgery on a fractured left wrist. After a 13-27 season, the Chicago Sky did not make the WNBA playoffs.

O'Neal played 19 seasons in the NBA as a center and is a Hall of Fame player who has also had his jersey and number retired three teams: the Orlando Magic, Los Angeles Lakers, and the Miami Heat. But even with his own playtime over and his heavy engagement in business ventures, Shaq makes time to watch the game and its new talent.

""I watched Caitlin Clark play the other day -- and I've said this -- she's the real deal. She plays the game the right way, plays hard, is a fabulous player.""

Despite the long overdue attention the WNBA is getting, Shaq said that there is much more that the women of the WNBA should get besides fans' appreciation.

He put it this way: ""I'm glad there's new (focus) on the WNBA. But the conversation is not over. We need to start getting them similar pay.""

""I said this before and I took a lot of flak for it, but I mean it. For a guy like Rudy Gobert to make $200 million and not be that good, while Caitlin Clark to make $100,000, there's something wrong with that picture.""

Shaq tips his cap to the WNBA's biggest and most loyal fans and hopes that the corporate sponsors that have made the NBA grow financially will step up their support of the NBA's sister league.

""We need to start having women get similar pay or equal pay. Fans should keep supporting them, continue buying merchandise, continue helping them get TV deals.""

Shaq capped it off by stating, ""I am looking forward to the day when a woman professional athlete makes $50 or $60 million like she deserves for being a good player.""

The last time I spoke to him in 2021, Shaq had proclaimed that pro basketball's ""big man is back.""

That year, he was referring to the arrival of Greek center Giannis Antetokounmpo to the NBA and the Milwaukee Bucks, who had helped the Milwaukee Bucks win their first NBA title, while grabbing the NBA Finals MVP Award, while also being named regular season MVP in 2019 and 2020.

To underscore the ""big man is back"" sentiment, the NBA has also seen transformational players, including 2023 NBA MVP Joel Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers and the Denver Nuggets' Serbian center Nikola Jokić, who was critical in last year's NBA championship.

When I asked Shaq about the newest NBA big man, Victor Wembanyama, the 7-foot-4 second-year power forward and center for the San Antonio Spurs, he said, ""He's had a good year, he's playing well, and he's a different animal.""

The five-time NBA Champion Spurs are known for the work of legendary players such as David Robinson, Tim Duncan, Manu Ginóbili, and Tony Parker, but they are considered to be in a rebuilding phase after several losing seasons.

""He's definitely the new era of the big man -- size, height, and he can do everything. Make big plays, shoot threes,"" Shaq said. ""I like what I saw from (Wembanyama). He plays the right way, and he plays hard.""

During the 2023-2023 NBA season, the Spurs tied for the worst record in the Western Conference, logging a 22-60 record. Shaq had plenty to say about Wembanyama's role in the future of the historic franchise.

""They're got to start winning if he wants to be in the same eyes as David Robinson, and Tim Duncan, who paved the way for the Spurs as a historic NBA franchise.""

Wembanyama has shown that ""he is great,"" Shaq said but declares that ""the honeymoon is over. It's time to start winning games. (Wembanyama) can be someone with empty stats, or he can win championships."""
Angelina Jolie's Maria Callas Movie Gets Netflix Release Date,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/timlammers/2024/09/23/angelina-jolies-maria-callas-movie-gets-netflix-release-date/,2024-09-23T17:51:49Z,"Maria -- a film about legendary opera singer Maria Callas starring Angelina Jolie -- has landed a premiere date on Netflix.

Jolie attended the world premiere of the film at the Venice International Film Festival on August 29 in Venice, Italy. The logline for Maria notes the film ""follows the American-Greek soprano as she retreats to Paris after a glamorous and tumultuous life in the public eye. Maria reimagines the legendary soprano in her final days as the diva reckons with her identity and life.""

Maria is directed by Jackie and Spencer filmmaker Pablo Larraín.

According to Variety, Netflix will first release the film in theaters on November 27 in order to qualify for an awards season run before making its streaming debut on Netflix on December 11.

The trade publication reported that Maria received an 8-minute standing ovation following its Venice premiere, which left Jolie in tears.

Maria got a warm reception by Rotten Tomatoes critics following its premiere at the Venice Film Festival in August.

To date, Maria has a 75% ""fresh"" rating based on 44 reviews. An Audience Score won't be available until Maria screens in previews.

The RT Critics' Consensus for the movie reads, ""Angelina Jolie unveils new highs within her emotional register in Pablo Larraín's Maria, keeping this tragic biopic compelling even when its theatrics go off-key.""

Among the top RT critics giving Maria a ""fresh"" review is Time Out's Kaleem Aftab, who writes, ""This enjoyable biopic offers a loving and affectionate portrait of Callas that never airbrushes her foibles. It's likely to put Jolie front and center in the Oscar race, too.""

In addition, David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter notes, ""The naked emotionality and piercing tragedy of the immortal operatic heroines is a poignant fit for Callas' end-of-life story and a useful counterpoint to her studied poise and aloofness in this interpretation.""

Vanity Fair's Richard Lawson isn't so high on Maria, writing in his ""rotten"" review, ""There is something arbitrary, unspecific about the film. With a few details removed, Maria could be about any grand diva, this blurry picture of a woman swanning through the final week of her life.""

The Wall Street Journal's Kyle Smith appears a bit more mixed in his ""rotten"" review of Maria, writing, ""Ms. Jolie is fantastically regal as La Callas contemplates a comeback in her palatial Paris apartment in the 1970s, but her vamping, and a surfeit of languid lounging, makes it seem like a humorless retread of Sunset Boulevard.""

Maria opens in theaters on November 27 before pivoting to streaming on Netflix on December 11."
"Egg-Freezing Demand Is Up 194%, Highlights Opportunity For Employers",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/evaepker/2024/09/23/egg-freezing-demand-is-up-194-highlights-opportunity-for-employers/,2024-09-23T17:40:11Z,"""When you freeze your eggs, you #freezetime. How often do you get to do that?⏰"" asked one of the first advertisements for egg-freezing. The ad, run on Instagram by a New York City clinic called Extend Fertility, summarized one of the major appeals of egg-freezing: it can allow women to pursue specific personal and professional goals before pursuing parenthood.

""Increased access to fertility care, whether that be education, testing, or preservation services has had a major impact in allowing women to pursue other goals in life before motherhood"", Shelly MacConnell reiterated. Ms. MacConnell is the Chief Strategy Officer at WIN: the nation's leading family-building and family well-being benefit company. The company aims to help families through every stage of life with its range of management services, which include those for fertility, maternity, surrogacy, adoption, and parenting.

And, in the process, it has found that women are taking advantage of this ""increased access"" Once typically reserved for women who had cancer or another medical condition - such as endometriosis or polycystic ovarian syndrome - that could affect their fertility, egg-freezing now can be an option for various women. WIN data showed that, from 2020 to 2023 alone, the demand for egg-freezing services increased 194%. 482 healthy women in the U.S. froze their eggs in 2009, and 22,967 froze their eggs in 2022: a 4665% increase. The number of egg-freezing cycles performed each year, meanwhile, increased from around 7,600 in 2015 to 29,803 in 2022: a 292% increase. The result is that over a million frozen eggs or embryos are stored in the United States today.

Part of this increase can be attributed to changes in women's lifestyles and life goals. For example, women are becoming mothers at a later age than before; the average age of first-time mothers was 21 in the 1970s and was 27 in 2022. The number of women choosing to have children in their 30s and 40s is also on the rise. A WIN survey highlighted that 79% of women who became mothers at 35 or older would make the same choice again because of their relationship status (53%), lifestyle (45%), and career goals (36%). 44% of these surveyed women also cited finances as a reason; they might not want to pay ""motherhood penalty"" - or the disadvantages around advancement, benefits, and pay for women who chose to become mothers - until they have already established themselves professionally, they might want to focus on increasing their savings especially since they still earn only $0.82 on average to men's $1.00, and/or they might want to pay off any loans first since women collectively carry 64% of the country's student loan debt. With options such as egg-freezing, they can pursue those goals without feeling as though they're chained to a biological clock: after all, a woman's fertility - and the chances of a pregnancy without complications and a baby without health challenges - start to decline around her mid-30s.

But that freedom - or ability to ""#freezetime"" as Extend Fertility's Instagram ad proclaimed - can come with a price. For one, the egg-freezing process is physically ""arduous"". It starts with ovary-stimulation hormones, which are self-injected - often two or three times per day - for around 10 to 14 days and which aim to increase the number of eggs that women produce (rather than the single egg that they would normally produce per month). Alongside these injections, patients need appointments for ultrasounds and bloodwork: usually about eight to 10 in a two-week period. When the eggs are the right size, patients take a ""trigger shot"", which prepares the body to release the eggs at the right time for retrieval.

The ideal number of eggs that women should freeze depends on their age, but, on average, they should freeze between 10 and 20 eggs. If the number of eggs retrieved and frozen is below that threshold, they might have to undergo another cycle, which includes more appointments, more emotions, more shots, more time - and more money.

As is, the cost of one egg-freezing cycle is about $10,000 to $15,000: a price tag that generally covers an initial consultation, medications, tests and monitoring, anesthesia fees, and the actual retrieval process. If not included, the ovary-stimulating medication can add another $3,000 to $10,800 to the overall cost. If women need to undergo additional cycles to gather an adequate number of eggs, the cost can increase to $30,000 to $40,000 - not including any storage fees. Once the eggs are retrieved, they are frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored in a lab until they're ready to be used; those storage fees, while usually $300 to $500 per year, could be up to $800 to $1,000 depending on the fertility center used. Once a woman is ready to use her eggs, it costs another $5,000 - $7,000 to thaw those eggs, fertilize them with sperm, grow the embryos in a lab, and transfer them to the women's uterus. Testing the embryos for chromosomal anomalies can cost another $3,000. And this whole process usually isn't covered by insurance since many insurers view it as an elective procedure, not a medically necessary one. As of June 2023, only 21 states required insurance companies to cover fertility treatments, which can include egg-freezing.

Even after all these costs, egg-freezing - like any conception method - is not guaranteed to result in a successful live birth. Even with the ovary-stimulating injections, women might not produce enough eggs, they might not freeze enough eggs, or they might not freeze their eggs at a young enough age. The eggs might not survive the freezing process or the thawing process. And, even if they do survive, they might not fertilize properly or the fertilized embryos might not implant. All in all, the chance of a live birth from frozen eggs - according to multiple studies - is about one-third: 33%.

Due to these various factors, especially the economic costs, egg-freezing has the reputation of being an option only for straight, wealthy white women.

Employers and states, though, are looking to cover some of these costs and, subsequently, broaden the accessibility of this fertility and family-planning service. As Ms. MacConnell summarized, ""What was once seen as a completely taboo topic in the workplace, is now a prevalent conversation, and we're seeing more and more companies realize the importance of offering a robust fertility and fertility preservation benefit"". WIN has seen this rising prevalence firsthand: its client volume has increased 518% since 2020. Meanwhile, 54% of large employers - including but not limited to WIN's clients - offer fertility coverage, which can include an infertility diagnosis, egg-freezing, in vitro fertilization (IVF), intrauterine insemination (IUI), and more. For egg-freezing specifically, 16% of large employers with 500 or more employees cover elective egg freezing - a percent that increases to 37% for large high-tech employers and 63% for Fortune Best Companies - and 43% of large employers covered IVF, up from 27% in 2020. Altogether, nearly two-thirds of organizations that provide fertility benefits don't require members to have an infertility diagnosis to be eligible for coverage - thus allowing same-sex couples and single intending parents to access these benefits as well - and 97% of employers offering fertility and family-building benefits do so with no significant cost increase.

Offering these benefits is not only ""increasingly popular"", as Ms. MacConnell said, but also ""a business imperative to attract and retain top talent"". She cited that 88% of those surveyed say they would consider switching jobs for access to family-building benefits, 61% of employees who received the coverage say they felt more committed to their employer, and only 59% of employees, across ages and across the world, acknowledge their current benefits align with their needs. For Gen-Z women specifically, who now make up 20.5% of the women in the workforce, 62.7% reported that family-building and maternity support are critical considerations when selecting a new position.

The result is a ""critical gap"" that, as Ms. MacConnell noted, employers can close by ""acknowledging and supporting workforces"" through every stage of life. She added, ""Over the years, we've seen fertility benefits shift to family-building benefits and now they're evolving to more family wellness benefits"", which can include maternity and parenting as well as support through menopause (when women stop menstruating) or andropause (when men experience age-related declines in testosterone levels). For context, 99% of women feel menopause symptoms have negatively affected their career and 51% of men reported deterioration in work performance due to andropause.

Going forward, Ms. MacConnell finds it ""critical"" that these employer benefits are ""well designed to protect employees' access to care"". Benefits that cover egg-freezing are just one aspect of this growing, positive trend: that employers are increasingly acknowledging, addressing, prioritizing, and even protecting their employees' mental and physical wellbeing to become a desirable workplace, to fill a critical gap, and to allow employees the freedom to freeze their eggs - and to freeze their time as well."

(Credit: WBMA)

Authorities in Alabama are now offering a combined $100,000 reward Monday for information surrounding a mass shooting in Birmingham over the weekend that left four dead and at least 17 others injured.

Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin said the primary objective now is to ""hunt down, capture, arrest and convict the people who are responsible"" for the violence that erupted Saturday night outside a popular nightspot in the city's Five Points South district. As of Monday, no suspects have been arrested.

""As a community we cannot give safe harbor or shelter to people who want to just simply kill people. We can't give them cover. They should not feel safe in our community. They should not feel safe anywhere,"" Woodfin said during a news conference, urging the public to come forward with information. ""It's your time to step up, and we need you.""

""You see, it's easy to see people in a line who are most likely unarmed, because to enter a club you can't have a weapon on you. And so, on one hand, as heinous as this was, it was also one of the most cowardly things we have also seen. They're cowards,"" Woodfin continued.

""Everyone who wants to play detective on social media, everyone in the streets that's pointing the finger at police and everyone else, this is your time to step up. And there is an ample reward for you doing your part as a community member,"" he also said.

The combined reward is being offered by the FBI and Crime Stoppers of Metro Alabama.

Police Chief Scott Thurmond said at the news conference that police are still sifting through tips and that five of the injured victims remain hospitalized.

The shooting occurred on the sidewalk and street outside Hush Lounge, where blood stains were still visible on the sidewalk Sunday morning, according to The Associated Press.

Thurmond previously said authorities believe the shooting targeted one of the people who was killed, possibly in a murder-for-hire. A vehicle pulled up and ""multiple shooters"" got out and began firing, then fled, he said.

""Some of the individuals that were killed have extensive criminal histories,"" Thurmond also told reporters on Monday. ""And because of that, there's often times motivation from others and there's people who are willing to pay to have them killed. And so that's part of it.""

Police said about 100 shell casings were recovered. Thurmond said law enforcement was working to determine what weapons were used, but that they believe some of the gunfire was ""fully automatic."" Investigators also were trying to determine whether anyone fired back, creating crossfire.

Officers found two men and a woman on a sidewalk with gunshot wounds, and they were pronounced dead at the scene. An additional male gunshot victim was pronounced dead at a hospital, according to police.

A French daredevil has turned his childhood dreams into reality by ""soaring"" from mountain cliffs -- on a flying carpet.

Freddy Montigny, 44, has spent years honing his skills in extreme sports to live out a dream of becoming a real-life Aladdin, according to SWNS, the British news service.

He developed a unique stunt by using expertise gained from paragliding, skydiving and hang-gliding over the years -- all of which gave him the control he needed, he said, to ""fly"" on a carpet.

He can be seen falling rapidly to 1,600 meters while ""riding"" a carpet.

Montigny of Choranche, France said, ""I've always wondered what part of the myths and legends we were told as kids was true,"" as SWNS reported.

He said he started ""paragliding at 25, skydiving at 30, and hang-gliding at 35.""

These activities, he said, ""helped me master the art of carpet flying.""

He called the parachute his ""main safety net.""

The (Few) Women Leaders To Watch At This Year's UN General Assembly,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephaniefillion/2024/09/23/the-few-women-leaders-to-watch-at-this-years-un-general-assembly/,2024-09-23T16:02:10Z,"As global instability mounts, the stakes are high for the 79th United Nations General Assembly high-level debate, which begins Tuesday in New York City.

While tensions in Europe and the Middle East continue to dominate the diplomatic agenda and shake up the global order, all eyes will be on the Big Apple for leaders to set the diplomatic agenda for the coming year. This year, once again, the U.N. General Assembly high-level debate will be dominated by men speaking at the rostrum.

A provisional list of speakers published earlier in September - which is likely to change until the very last moment - revealed that less than 10 of the leaders set to speak at the high-level week are women, showing the hill remains steep for women in politics, especially in the top job. There were only 27 countries where 28 women served as Heads of State and/or Government globally as of June, and gender equality in the highest positions of power will not be reached for another 130 years, according to UN Women.

While, so far, only around ten women prime ministers or presidents are set to travel to New York for the event, there is a bright side: the first woman to speak come earlier than usual. The first woman to appear at the rostrum will be the fifth one to speak on the first day of the debate.

Switzerland's rotating president, Viola Amherd, will not only address the General Assembly for the first time as president but will also be the first woman to do at the event. ""Her presence demonstrates the importance Switzerland grants to the United Nations and the relevance of effective multilateralism in today's fragmented world,"" Switzerland's mission to the U.N. said, confirming Amherd's attendance.

Anita Bhatia, the founder of ImpactCommons and Deputy Executive Director of UN Women between 2019 and 2023, attended many high-level debates at the General Assembly and remembers thinking at the time, ""It would be men after men after men, a sea of men in black,"" she said, ""so it's a mixed feeling of conflicting happiness, frustration at the lack of women and then optimism and hope when you get good results.""

The U.N. General Assembly offers an opportunity to paint a picture of the state of women in politics and leadership in international organizations. While the number of women leaders in international organizations steadily increases, a report by GWLvoices, an advocacy group for multilateralism and gender equality revealed in February that only 13% of all elected leaders in international organizations have been women since 1945. The number of women in national assemblies has also increased globally, but significant strides remain to achieve full gender parity, according to UN Women.

However, not everything is gloomy for women in power. A few countries elected for the first time a woman in the top job since last year's General Assembly, including Mexico, North Macedonia and Dominica.

""In the case of Mexico, we have to wait until October 1 to be the president-elect to take the full powers in her country,"" Maria Fernanda Espinosa, President of the 73rd General Assembly and minister of foreign affairs of Ecuador between 2017-2018, said. ""but we will have a female foreign minister of Mexico take the stage at the U.N. so I think that the region is increasingly improving its gender balance.""

Mexico is currently still led by lame-duck president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and as such should be represented by its influential foreign affairs minister, Alicia Barcena.

The leader of Dominica, Sylvanie Burton is listed as a speaker and as such could make her first appearance as leader of the Caribbean Island. However, Dominica's presidential office could not confirm her attendance.

On top of Burton and Barcena, Latin American women shine on the provisional list as the region sending the most women leaders . Peru's president, Dina Boluarte, who took over from Pedro Castillo in 2022 after waves of protests appears on the list, as well as Honduras' president Xiomara Castro, a leftist.

""We are far from being where we need to be, and it's more the exception,"" Espinosa said. ""It's exceptional to have four or five heads of state and government in Latin America, but out of the 29 heads of state and government, it's not bad in terms of ratio, in terms of number of countries.""

Other women attendees from the region include high-profile Caribbean leader Mia Mottley of Barbados. ""Barbados is a very important country, a strong voice from that country is Prime Minister Mottley."" Espinosa added. Mottley is rumored to be a potential candidate to be the next U.N. Secretary-General, and is an influential figure for international financial institutions reforms and climate change.

Other women presidents of prime ministers listed on the provisional list include Italy's prime minister Georgia Meloni, a political rising star on the right who will also receive a ""Global Citizen"" award from the Atlantic Council on Sept. 23, where she will be introduced by tech tycoon Elon Musk at the event.

Gordana Siljanovska, North Macedonia's first woman president, is scheduled to speak on Thursday. She already made some waves on in first day in office, after she reignited a longstanding spat with North Macedonia's neighbor, Greece, over her country's name, calling it Macedonia. As such, Siljanovska's presence at the world's highest diplomatic event will be an opportunity for her to present herself for the world and potentially set the tone on the name controversy.

President Hilda Heine of the Marshall Islands, who recently got reelected as president after serving a first term in 2016-2020. Heine was not only the first woman president of the island country but also the first woman to earn a doctoral degree. As a representative from an island nation, she has been a voice for climate resilience globally.

Another small island leader, Fiamē Naomi Mataʻafa, prime minister of Samoa, is also in New York for the debate and could also highlight the challenges her country faces on climate and other files.

Uganda's prime minister, Robinah Nabbanja, attended the Summit of the Future on Sunday and is on the schedule to represent her country later on this week. Nabbanja is one of a few women from Africa scheduled to speak from the rostrum this year. ""Like everywhere else, we need to do better,"" Amina Mohamed, a former high-level UN official and a minister in Kenya between 2013-2022, said. ""I think it's something that we are all very engaged with, we're all very conscious of, we're seized with, and we want to make sure that as we speak about women representation globally, we do not forget that in the globe starts at your doorstep."""
Why This Digital Leader Says Community Is The Next Big Social Platform,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/09/23/why-this-digital-leader-says-community-is-the-next-big-social-platform/,2024-09-23T15:32:02Z,"Former OnlyFans CEO Amrapali Gan Has Prioritized Online Safety And Women's Empowerment Throughout Her Career, And Says That Communia, A Secure Social App For Women, Represents The Future

After spending three years at the online creator platform OnlyFans, and just over a year and half of that as its CEO, Amrapali ""Ami"" Gan stepped down to pursue her own venture: strategy and branding firm Hoxton Projects. She also came across Communia, a secure social platform for women to have honest and emotional conversations. This summer, Gan joined Communia as a strategic partner and growth advisor.

I talked to Gan about Communia, the up-and-coming community economy it represents, and her work in online platforms dedicated to women's empowerment and security. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. It was excerpted in the Forbes CEO newsletter.

Tell me about Communia and why you were interested in the business in the first place.

Gan: I met the CEO and founder Olivia [DeRamus] at least a year ago. She reached out to me through LinkedIn, and we were both in L.A. at the same time. We ended up getting coffee, and I really respected her passion for creating this community after what she had been through, in terms of experiencing a sexual assault while in college and not having a platform or anywhere she felt she could go to find other people she could identify with and relate to. That's where it was triggered for her, like, 'Oh, there's a need for this.'

Once I downloaded the app and dug into the community, for being an earlier stage company, it already has a good bit of users. There's great traction. She's put a lot of effort into the user experience, the design, and most notably, the safety component of the platform.

Communia is an app for anyone who's 16-plus and identifies as a woman. [It's] very friendly to the LGBTQ community and also the non-binary community. What's unique about it is that you go through a verification process to be able to engage with the app and the platform. That was something I thought was really unique. Looking at just the state of mainstream platforms and social media, there's a lot of these spam trolls, negative comments. It's really not that empowering, whereas being able to log on somewhere and have a safe place to talk about school, work, dating, relationships, family, moving, just general life things and actually get responses. I think it's really cool. I really like the way she's designed the app, the aesthetic of it. It's very approachable, relatable, doesn't feel intimidating.

She's there to keep the community safe and create things that they are asking for or interested in. There's an opportunity to have public and private journals. You can ask questions, and your questions can be anonymous. You can ask a question that might be related to sex to work or an awkward situation and get real responses. That's something I haven't seen anywhere else, and that's why I've gravitated towards the platform.

Olivia and I got to know each other the past year in very much a natural synergy, in terms of my outlook and ethos of empowerment, online safety, and really thinking about the future of online engagement. To me, Communia is the exemplary example of the community economy. The future is very much about niche communities versus broad mainstream platforms.

What are you doing for Communia as a strategic partner and growth advisor?

I talk to Olivia pretty regularly. We're going into [topics] from prioritization of different features, thinking about how to message [and] market the platform. She launched it in the U.K., so it has a good bit of following there. We're looking to get more traction for the business in the U.S. She also launched it while she was in university, so now she's a full-time founder. This is her focus. She's been in many accelerator programs. I work with her closely to go over strategies, priorities, thinking of allocating funds, all the way through to investor relations and introductions.

When you were at OnlyFans, you were credited with doing a lot in terms of making it a safe platform all the way around. What are some of the biggest challenges of online safety and how do you intend to bring some of that ethos to Communia?

With anything, all you can control is what's happening on your platform, and creating options for users to feel like they can block or report anyone they might see as a bad actor. And being transparent about safety, and the fact that everyone on Communia is a real person, just like everyone on OnlyFans is a real person.

Platforms that are created for real people that have real problems go right back to what the future is, which is the community economy.

How important is the safety component to being able to build an online business?

For a platform like Communia, it's very important because users need to feel like, 'Okay, I can share my personal life here. I can share information here. I can have a journal here.' It can be private, it can be public, but it's very important they know that from the onset of development of this business, safety was a priority.

You've been talking about the community economy as being what you see as the future. Tell me a little bit about what the community economy is and how it works.

Everyone is familiar with the term 'creator economy' and how the creator economy is truly taken off. The pandemic hit fast forward on that, where everyone with a phone is essentially a content creator: able to share content, create a following, monetize it. Now you have this breadth of creators in various categories.

To me, I see the future being the community economy, which is more about deep, meaningful interactions versus a larger individual talent, influencer, celebrity speaking to a broad audience, and it just being that one way. Whereas with the community economy, it's more about coming together over a shared experience, through shared interest interaction. And that's digitally, [but] could be translated to IRL. You're seeing everything from book clubs, run clubs, all of these different experiences on the rise, which are taking a mix of digital and IRL components. That's something Communia also has in the works: smaller IRL events for their community, which they've tested out in the U.K. and [are] starting to do in the Los Angeles area too.

Thinking about value creation for the community economy, that's really through these shared experience interactions, versus creator economy, where it's much more about views, likes follower accounts. It's a different kind of value. Whereas with community, it's much more of that emotional, positive ethos. Anyone can be part of it. It's not necessarily like, 'Oh, I'm just following this person,' and they need to have certain likes on stuff, or engagement, or they're doing brand deals. It's very different, what is actually meaningful.

The community economy, thinking about relationships, is more about long-term authentic relationships. Whereas the creator economy can be a bit transactional in terms of those brand deals, affiliate codes, links -- which in all honesty, many consumers and fans are a bit fatigued by and are very much aware that that happens. There's been this search for anyone who's engaging digitally. Like, 'Oh, where are there other people that like the same music, sports, going through the same shared life experiences.' That's why I always was gravitating towards Communia because it's a place for these shared experiences, for people to come together who are like-minded and have a safe space. That can be the same thing for people who like going to concerts, sports fans, usually across the board.

How is the community economy monetized?

There's a bit less emphasis on monetization. It's more about support and shared value, whereas the creator economy, there's a very clear monetization, whether it's through subscriptions, sponsorships, ads, sponsored posts.

But with the community economy, there is opportunity to monetize. Within Communia, you can pay and have access to a different set of features on the app. Potentially in the future, we could have monetization through events. There's a lot of different ways to monetize, but monetize in a way that's going to bring value to that community and also create experiences, whether they are digital or IRL, that they're going to be excited about. And ultimately, again, it brings that community value, so they're willing to pay a little bit extra for those features.

So the community economy is more about the individual as part of the community. They aren't necessarily driving revenue from the community.

Exactly. It's not dependent on a single individual. It's more about a collective with a shared ethos. And then there could be ways that monetization happens within there, whether that is through some sort of subscription level access or it's through event access. And I think that's where you have these communities that are bought into: I'm already a fan of this, whether it's Communia or a different club, and then they feel they're getting bigger value out of different monetization. It's also less about follower levels. It's really about meaningful interactions and creating a sense of belonging.

Communia is a place that brings women support and empowerment. When you ran OnlyFans, it was as a company that brought a different sort of empowerment to women, but it was made to tailor to their safety and support for them. Why is it important for social platforms in general to foster a place for women's empowerment?

What's important is that women feel there's some level of control over their identity, their data, their IP, whenever they are using a platform or are in the digital ecosystem. I know when I go online shopping and I give my email, I'm going to end up getting a bunch of stuff. But if I don't want that, I can easily opt-out. Having a clear terms of service, knowing what you're getting into when you sign up for a platform. Women are very savvy tech consumers, and that's something that businesses are definitely realizing, and that's what creates an opportunity for a platform like Communia.

Apart from Communia, most of this year you've been working with Hoxton Projects. What are you seeing through that venture?

Hoxton's been an incredible experience to launch. As soon as I transitioned from CEO, I immediately shared that I was creating Hoxton. I formally launched it earlier this year, and we're primarily focused on business strategy and marketing for a range of companies in different sectors, primarily consumer-facing.

The biggest trend -- and this is obviously part of my background -- is community. How can community be created, whether it's through a brand and their loyalty program, through a platform. Everyone wants some level of authentic, real community.

On top of that is the engagement component for retention, preventing churn. Messaging and design are things that we really pride ourselves on at Hoxton.

What are some things that business leaders in general don't know or don't realize about the community economy that's rising now?

They may not be paying attention to it yet at all. There's still an emphasis on that big creator using their product and having it placed with them. But I really believe communities, as well as micro and nano influencers, are much more the future in terms of actually converting engagement. And, again, being authentic.

Where do you see the community economy going in the next five years?

It's going to continue to grow. You're going to see other platforms come out that appeal to different communities. The future is: people want that connection. If you look at the world right now, there's all these articles about the loneliness epidemic. There's different AI tools coming out that combat that. There's this natural need for, 'Where can I find like-minded people who have the same interests?' And then from there, it just organically grows."
Understanding When Not To Waive Alimony In A Prenuptial Agreement,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/christinefletcher/2024/09/23/understanding-when-not-to-waive-alimony-in-a-prenuptial-agreement/,2024-09-23T14:05:46Z,"A lot of couples sign prenuptial agreements to protect an inheritance. Some have been gifted monies that they want to safeguard. Others may be expecting a large sum in the future. Often, the couple's parents have suggested the use of a prenup. After all, the family does not want to see their monies divvied up in the event of a divorce. Families prefer to see their assets stay within their lineage, passing from children to grandchildren instead of being given to an ex-spouse.

When addressing alimony in a prenuptial agreement, many people will want to waive it, meaning neither spouse can get alimony from the other. For instance, if one spouse receives an income stream from their inherited assets, paying alimony will impact that income stream. Therefore, people living off their family assets will often want to waive alimony.

But remember, you cannot leave your spouse penniless in the event of a divorce. That is not the goal of a prenuptial agreement. The agreement has to be fair. Further, you want the agreement to have teeth so that it is enforceable if it needs to be used. Leaving your ex-spouse destitute is not fair, and it leaves the agreement susceptible to a challenge. If you carve out your inherited assets and waive alimony, you will need to make sure your spouse is provided for through their assets or other assets you give them as part of a divorce.

Many couples begin discussing a prenuptial agreement by just wanting to protect their inheritance and end up caught in the intricacies of planning for a divorce. They are surprised to learn that different scenarios must be considered in drafting the agreement, such as each party's earning potential, their likely career paths, and care of unborn children. The couple who want to get married and plan their wedding day now find they are in the middle of planning for their divorce and pondering who is going to pick up Junior from school every day. The stress of the impending marriage and negotiating the prenuptial agreement can bring couples to their breaking point.

However, if you only want to protect your inheritance, consider whether you should put alimony back on the table. Not waiving alimony takes the pressure off because you do not need to consider every scenario in the event of a divorce. If you get divorced, one party can go after the other for alimony, making it is less likely that one party will end up penniless. And you will have protected your inherited assets by carving them out as separate property.

It also may not be in your best interest to waive alimony - even if you are the party asking for the prenuptial agreement. Consider a young woman whose parents want her to sign a preputial agreement to protect the inheritance they will one day leave her. They have not gifted her any money and her income is modest. Suppose she waives alimony in her prenuptial agreement and later stops working to become a stay-at-home parent. In that case, her spouse may divorce her after many years of marriage and not have to pay her alimony. If her parents never left her the promised inheritance because they spent it or there was a catastrophic loss of funds, she could be financially devastated. In that situation, it is possible that the prenuptial agreement could be attacked as unconscionable in light of her current situation. However, she may be better protected by not waiving alimony in the agreement. In this case, she would have been better off with no prenuptial agreement.

Planning for a prenuptial agreement is a highly intricate process that requires thorough consideration. There's no one-size-fits-all solution, and, unfortunately, there's no crystal ball to predict the future. If your primary concern is protecting your inherited assets, it's crucial to explore all options, including the decision to waive or not to waive alimony."
How Bitcoin Can Offer A Path To Safety For Domestic Abuse Survivors,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/09/23/how-bitcoin-can-offer-a-path-to-safety-for-domestic-abuse-survivors/,2024-09-23T13:55:05Z,"Domestic violence is a pervasive issue worldwide, affecting millions of women. According to the World Health Organization, nearly one in three women globally have experienced physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime. In many cases, this violence is not just physical but also financial.

Financial abuse is the use of financial control, manipulation, or exploitation by one person to gain power over another, often in the context of intimate relationships. It can include limiting access to money, preventing a partner from working, misusing their financial resources, or creating debt in their name to enforce dependency and maintain control. This form of abuse undermines a person's economic independence and is a key element of coercive control. Yet, there's hope, and that hope, surprisingly, comes in the form of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is more than just a digital currency. It's a tool for financial independence, a shield of privacy, and a way for women to reclaim control over their lives on their own terms. For women experiencing domestic violence, particularly in spaces where financial abuse is rampant, Bitcoin can provide the autonomy they need to escape and rebuild.

Financial abuse is not just about denying someone access to money. It's about trapping them in a cycle of dependency and fear. In 99% of domestic violence cases, financial abuse plays a critical role in maintaining control over the victim. Abusers cut off their partners from work opportunities, prevent them saving money, and often control all the financial ressources that enter the household. It's hard enough to leave an abuser, but when you don't even have the means to buy a bus ticket or pay for a safe place to stay, it feels impossible.

The traditional financial systems often fail women. Joint accounts are easy to monitor, cash is risky to hide, and banks require permission from both partners for major financial decisions. Women need a tool that is safe, private, and entirely in their control. That's where Bitcoin comes in. Bitcoin can be a valuable tool for women facing domestic violence due to its permissionless nature. It does not require a bank account, external approval, or the knowledge of others, including an abuser. As a decentralized currency, Bitcoin cannot be easily frozen or controlled by third parties, allowing individuals to fully own and decide how to manage their funds independently.

For a woman trapped in an abusive relationship, this level of autonomy is revolutionary. With Bitcoin, she can create a wallet in minutes and begin saving in secret. Her abuser has no way of knowing, and even better, no way of accessing those funds. The bitcoin user holds the private key to their Bitcoin wallet, a key that she can store securely, giving them a path to financial independence that's invisible to their abuser.

Privacy is not a luxury for women in abusive situations: it's a necessity. Many women risk their lives when trying to hide money or make financial plans to escape. Even opening a new bank account can raise red flags with a controlling partner. But Bitcoin operates in a different way. It's pseudonymous, meaning that while transactions are visible on the blockchain, they aren't directly tied to a person's identity. This allows women to send and receive funds privately, without exposing their financial activities to anyone who might be watching.

Bitcoin transactions are also borderless, which is crucial for women who may need to flee not only their homes but also their countries. Traditional banking systems are often slow, expensive, and traceable when it comes to international transfers, but Bitcoin offers a fast and secure way to send and receive money across borders in minutes.

Another form of financial abuse involves preventing women from working or controlling their earnings if they do work. As more jobs shift to online platforms, Bitcoin provides a way for women to earn and safeguard their income privately. Through freelancing, selling digital goods, or offering services online, women can receive payments in Bitcoin, bypassing traditional banking systems and maintaining control over their finances.

Imagine the freedom that comes with knowing you can earn an income that no one can seize or control. For many women, this represents not just financial independence but also the emotional freedom to start planning their escape.

Organizations that support victims of domestic violence have an opportunity to explore new tools for providing assistance. In the past, sending money to women in hiding could be risky, especially if their abuser monitored their bank accounts, potentially raising suspicion. Bitcoin offers a discreet and secure way to send funds, allowing survivors to access essentials like shelter, food, and transportation without increasing their risk.

Organizations can also train women on how to use Bitcoin safely, ensuring that they understand how to protect their private keys and maintain the privacy of their transactions. This kind of support empowers women to not just survive but thrive in their new independent lives.

We talk a lot about economic empowerment, but for many women trapped in domestic violence, the concept of empowerment is meaningless without tools that are safe, private, and in their control. Bitcoin offers exactly that. It offers a means of financial independence, enabling women to save, earn, and leave abusive situations without requiring permission from anyone. For many women, Bitcoin can be more than just a digital currency, it can be a path to freedom and personal safety. As awareness of its potential grows, Bitcoin may become an essential tool for survivors of domestic violence."
Undecideds Need More Information On Harris -- Gender Bias May Be The Reason,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimelsesser/2024/09/23/undecideds-need-more-information-on-harris-gender-bias-may-be-the-reason/,2024-09-23T13:03:20Z,"As political strategists and journalists query undecided voters ahead of the upcoming presidential election, a recurring sentiment stands out: many remain unsure about Kamala Harris, citing a need for more information. Despite her media presence and debate appearances, these voters still haven't heard enough to make an informed decision. According to research on female leadership, their hesitation could be more about her gender than her policies.

Research reveals that when assessing female leaders, people often struggle to see women's potential. Evaluating someone for a role they've never held before, like the presidency, requires using our imagination -- but our imagination is also where stereotypes are most likely to kick in. Since leadership is traditionally associated with male traits, these stereotypes often cloud our judgment of women, causing us to question whether a woman has what it takes to be a leader or a president. This typically happens without our knowledge or awareness. As a result, some voters can't picture Harris as president, aren't sure why, and think they need more information.

After conducting a focus group on undecided voters, the Los Angeles Times concluded, ""Most of the 20 swing voters weren't entirely undecided, but almost all said they needed more information -- especially about Harris -- before they make up their minds."" One of the participants explained, ""With Harris, I just don't feel as if I know enough about her... and what she stands for."" Gender stereotypes make it difficult for these voters to see Harris' potential to be president, and, as a result, they require more concrete information of what she'll be like as president.

One study published in the Academy of Management illustrates how this inability to see a woman's potential plays out in everyday work situations. The researchers examined the reviews of over 29,000 management-track employees at a large retailer. Women at the retailer were less likely to be promoted because although they received higher performance ratings than men, they were seen as having less future potential than men.

The performance ratings reflected the women's work and did not require imagination, so bias did not impact these -- indeed, women received higher performance ratings than men. But when evaluators were asked to imagine the women's future potential, much like the undecided voters, they couldn't see it. Despite performing better than men, women received lower ratings on their potential than men.

To assess whether women truly had less future potential than men, the same researchers looked at the women's performance ratings in future periods. They found that women outperformed forecasts of their potential. Yet, even though they outperformed prior ratings of their potential, managers still rated the women as having lower future potential in subsequent ratings.

In another study, researchers found similar results. Nearly 200 participants reviewed résumés for a director role at a fictional tech company. Half the résumés emphasized the candidate's past achievements, while the other half highlighted their potential. A similar trend emerged: male candidates received high rankings when their potential was showcased. But for female candidates, the story was different -- they were held to far higher standards, and their leadership potential was largely dismissed. Women had to have already demonstrated their ability to lead at a particular level before they were evaluated positively.

Other research consistently shows that women are held to higher standards than men, often needing to prove their abilities time and again -- especially in roles traditionally dominated by men. With no female president in U.S. history, this dynamic is particularly relevant in Kamala Harris's case. This phenomenon, known as the ""prove-it-again bias,"" reflects how much evidence women must provide of their leadership skills.

As a woman of color, Harris faces additional obstacles. In one study, Black women were the most likely to report experiencing prove-it-again bias, with three-quarters of Black women surveyed agreeing they had to prove themselves over and over again at work.

Certainly, part of the demand for more insight into Harris may stem from her relatively recent entry into the presidential race, leaving voters seeking clarity on her policies. However, given the research evidence, it's also likely that the difficulty some voters have in envisioning her in the role of president is fueling the calls for further details about her plans.

Companies can take concrete steps to help combat this type of bias in the workplace -- like defining ""potential"" with clear, objective criteria. But the challenge is more complex when it comes to the presidency. To move past the stereotypes that might cloud voters' judgment, Harris would need to offer enough detail about her vision and plans to help people clearly see her in the Oval Office, leaving no room for imagination -- and thus, bias -- to take hold. That level of transparency would likely be too much for voters to absorb."
The Homebuilders Getting Rich Off America's Housing Shortage,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardjchang/2024/09/23/the-homebuilders-getting-rich-off-americas-housing-shortage/,2024-09-23T12:55:14Z,"Forbes uncovers a dozen new billionaire builders whose fortunes have jumped on the homebuilding industry's high prices and high interest rates.

urveying a row of three-to five-bedroom starter homes going up along the recently asphalted Addison Drive, Tom Bradbury spots an issue. Poking his brown brogue leather shoes into the red Georgia clay, he makes a beeline for a construction crew manning an excavator, telling them exactly where they need to dig.

""Everything has to be done right the first time and on time,"" Bradbury says. ""Like when a car comes off the assembly line, it has to be ready to go.""

Bradbury is an expert at churning out neighborhoods like this one -- ""Duncan Farm,"" in Cartersville, a suburb of Atlanta -- with Ford-like efficiency. Since 2008, his Smith Douglas Homes has built 304 communities in five states. Sales hit $765 million in 2023. Shares of Smith Douglas, which Bradbury took public on the New York Stock Exchange in January, are up 56% since then. The 80-year-old Bradbury, who still owns 88% of the stock, is now a billionaire.

It's a terrible time to be a homebuyer. In 2023, mortgage rates spiked to levels not seen since 2008 and, despite coming down in recent months, remain higher than they've been in more than two decades. Home prices have also skyrocketed, up 30% nationally on average over the past four years while real median household income has stagnated.

Yet, given a nationwide shortage of at least four million housing units, according to the National Association of Realtors, it's a great time to be a homebuilder. There simply aren't enough homes. The S&P index of builders is up 57% over the past 12 months. Shares of the country's largest, D.R. Horton, are up even more over that period, 70%, while luxury builder Toll Brothers' stock has soared by 96%.

This building boom has led to a billionaire boom. In all, Forbes has found at least 12 new billionaires or billionaire families in the homebuilding industry. That includes Bradbury, plus Perry Homes' Kathy Britton, GL Homes' Itzhak Ezratti and three members of Lennar Corp.'s Miller family.

It doesn't look like it will slow down any time soon, especially with both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump calling for a major increase in new home production. Plus, builders have a few advantages in this market: cash-strapped buyers not only don't need to put additional money into remodeling a brand new home, but they can often borrow money at competitive rates from the builders' affiliate lenders or secure other sales incentives to ease the costs.

""You put all that together and you have an environment that is solid and performing better than I think most economists would have expected,"" says Robert Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. Adds Alan Ratner, an analyst at housing research firm Zelman & Associates: ""These companies are in the best shape they've ever been.""

Bradbury, whose father was an architect who designed government office buildings and who once worked as a flight instructor, sold his first house to a police officer and a municipal clerical worker for $35,000 in 1975. ""I was sitting at that closing and that woman cried,"" says Bradbury. ""She looked me in the eye and said, 'I thought I would never be able to own a house.'"" That was the start of Colony Homes, which built entry-level residences in Georgia and North Carolina before Bradbury sold it to KB Home for $67 million in 2003. Five years later, when KB Home pulled out of Atlanta, Bradbury, frustrated they'd abandoned the market, started Smith Douglas Homes.

Since then he's built 15,000, mostly for lower-to-middle class buyers like auto workers, teachers and first responders, mainly in growth markets in the South, such as Nashville, Charlotte and Raleigh. He's been able to keep the homes relatively affordable because he's gotten the process down to a science, thanks in large part to a scheduling software, called the SMART build system, that updates trade partners and material suppliers in real time, starting from when a home buyer has put in the order. After one part of the construction process is completed, the next step can begin the following morning. The faster it gets the framers or painters in and out, the faster -- and cheaper -- it can move onto the next buyer's new house. The SMART system has decreased Smith Douglas Homes' build time to an average of just 59 days from start to finish, about 20% faster than most of the other public builders.

""Our goal is to be as efficient as we possibly can to try to reach as many folks as we can,"" Bradbury says. ""Ever since I've been in business, I've had big, hairy, audacious goals -- and I always come close or beat them.""

Patrick Zalupski got a later start than Bradbury but has already gotten richer. A former auditor for FedEx in Tennessee, he made his way to Florida and built his first 27 homes in Jacksonville in 2009, right after the financial crisis. Since then his Dream Finders Homes, which he took public in 2021, has closed on 31,000 homes through 2023 in eight states, primarily in the Southeast. Like Bradbury, he focuses largely on first timers or move-up buyers looking to upgrade, but his strategy has largely been to cut out some higher-end features like quartz countertops or wood floors in recent years and make them optional upgrades. That has helped power the company to record sales of $3.7 billion in 2023, up 12% from the prior year, and landed him on Forbes' billionaires list, worth an estimated $2.3 billion thanks to his 84% stake.

""We used to customize a lot more,"" says Zalupski, who paid nearly $8 million earlier this year to buy an 18,000-square-foot Jacksonville mansion on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. ""All of that comes with a tremendous amount of inefficiency and cost. Now it's just about trying to deliver a more affordable house at the end of the day.""

Meanwhile Lennar, America's second-largest builder, has started making 660-square-foot houses as wide as a driveway for as little as $137,000. In San Antonio, the company sold nearly every lot in its first-ever tiny homes community this year. ""Demand remains robust if it can be supplied at an attainable price point,"" said Lennar's CEO and executive chairman Stuart Miller (estimated net worth: $1.8 billion) on a July earnings call. Miller, whose father Leonard Miller (d. 2002) became a co-owner of Lennar's predecessor in 1956 and took the company public in 1971, has helped run it for 35 years. The business has never been worth so much, reaching a recent $52 billion market capitalization, enough to Stuart and his two siblings, Jeffrey Miller and Leslie Miller Saiontz, all individual billionaires.

Even Toll Brothers, known as the largest luxury builder in the country, has been moving down market. In 2016, the company began offering smaller townhouses and homes on smaller lots at the $450,000 price point. Around 2019, these cheaper residences made up only around 10% of Toll Brothers' business. Now, ""40% of Toll Brother homes are being sold at this lower price range,"" says Doug Yearley, the firm's chairman and CEO. ""In a high interest environment, we're doing well.""

Especially Bruce Toll, who cofounded the company in 1967 with his brother Bob (d. 2022) and retired as vice chairman of the board in 2016. Toll, 81, who has been diversifying out of his Toll Brothers stock and into commercial real estate but still owns 1% of the company's shares, is now worth an estimated $2 billion.

But for many buyers, it's less about affordability than the prospect of getting a good deal. In Texas, Kathy Britton's approach runs somewhat counter to the national trend. Houston-based Perry Homes, which Britton inherited from her father Bob Perry (d. 2013), has been riding a wave of new residents and businesses relocating to the Dallas and Houston metro areas in search of lower taxes, is targeting high-end homebuyers with an in-house design team to give them more choices on home floor plans, tech and materials. Under Britton, who spent her high school summers helping Perry Homes' sales associates, it has hired extra architects to offer even more plans and greater customization. ""Our product is superior quality,"" Britton, 55, says in an interview from her office in Houston. ""I think we build the best house in the industry, and we're very selective about the communities where we build.""

In many ways, the market slowdown since the pandemic-era frenzy has actually made building more attractive for buyers. Existing home prices in much of the country have not fallen, even as mortgage rates spiked enough to push the average buyer's monthly payment up by more than $1,000 since 2021. And with six out of ten American homeowners locked into rates of less than 4%, they're unwilling -- or unable -- to list their house and take on a higher rate on their next purchase, drying up the market even more.

""We looked at quite a few older houses, and I wasn't interested in trying to overpay for something that you're just going to need to put more work into,"" says James Wallace, a controls engineer in Detroit who bought his first home from a local builder with his wife in April. ""We decided, ""Let's go for something new that's a lot less headache for us to worry about.'""

Many of the larger builders have another advantage, too: They can cut deals that others can't. No bank in America is advertising a mortgage rate of less than 5.5% on an existing house, yet Ashton Woods Homes will lend to their new buyers at 5% in Durham N.C. That's because many homebuilders have affiliate lenders that can offer better rates or subsidize some of a buyer's closing costs using a small portion of the builder's profits. These days many are offering mortgage rate buydowns, where a buyer pays upfront for a lower interest rate at closing, giving the larger firms that have in-house mortgage arms -- an advantage against smaller builders and existing home sellers, according to John Lovallo, an analyst at UBS.

""If a home builder can give you a mortgage rate that's 150 to 200 basis points less, the premium between new and existing homes collapses. The new home price is less than the median existing home price,"" says Brian Bernard, director of industrials equity research at Morningstar. ""People are realizing that, 'Hey, I can get a pretty good deal on home prices. Obviously it's not as affordable as if I would've bought it years ago, but I can manage it.'""

In January, the biggest U.S. homebuilder, D.R. Horton, said it plans to offer more long-term mortgage rate buydowns through its in-house lender, DHI Mortgage, to maintain its advantage over other builders. Dream Finders Homes, the Florida-based builder run by billionaire Patrick Zalupski, recently brought their preferred mortgage lender in-house to buy mortgages in bulk and offer lower rates to buyers, striking a deal to purchase the 40% it didn't own of Jet HomeLoans in July for $9.3 million. ""Today, buying down the rate is the most impactful benefit to the consumer,"" Zalupski says. More than 90% of Dream Finders' new home buyers with mortgages are taking advantage of the incentive.

The homebuilder boom is likely to stay for the foreseeable future, too, even if the economy goes through a rocky period. The National Association of Realtors predicts that there will still be a shortage for at least the next five years, even if building activity outpaces population growth. New housing starts peaked at more than 2 million in 2005 and cratered to just 500,000 by 2009, following the subprime mortgage crisis. By 2012, 54% of new homebuilders folded after overbuying land in the runup to the crash, and an undersupply of both materials and labor have held new construction too well below demand for more than a decade. If rates continue to fall, builders could see a massive influx of buyers, spurred by easier access to mortgages and an easing of the mortgage lock-in effect that has kept many homeowners from giving up their low rate.

""Home builder outlook for the next five years is still good just because we have a sizable housing shortage."" says the National Association of Realtors' chief economist, Lawrence Yun. ""I think builders will ramp up production but there will not be an oversupply."" The U.S. Congressional Budget Office projects the post-pandemic drive for larger living spaces and an influx of immigration will spur 1.6 million housing starts annually over the next ten years. Goldman Sachs predicts new home sales will increase to 723,000 by the end of the year and 771,000 in 2025, up from 666,000 in 2023. Meanwhile, Fannie Mae expects 2024 to be the lowest-selling year for existing homes since 1995. That's music to the ears of America's billionaire builders, and the investors who have bid up their public share prices even in the face of sky-high home values and crushing interest rates.

""The sad part of it is that there are a lot of people that could afford a house but now they can't,"" says Bradbury of Smith Douglas Homes. ""It would sure be a blessing if the rates went back down and people who are renting and would love to own a house can buy one."""

Lynda Carter, the actress famous for playing Wonder Woman in the 1970s, slighted her conservative sister last weekend by endorsing her opponents in an Arizona state representative race.

Pamela Carter, who served as a state director for the Trump campaign in 2020, is currently running for Arizona's Legislative District 4. Carter is running as a Republican, along with her fellow conservative candidate, Matt Gress.

Instead of endorsing her sister or staying quiet, Carter opted to publicly announce her support for the two Democratic opponents, Karen Gresham and Kelli Butler.

""As a native Arizonan, I am proud to endorse @KelliButlerAZ and @KarenGreshamAZ for the two LD4 seats in Arizona's State House,"" Carter wrote on X on Sept. 14. ""Kelli and Karen are both strong, experienced candidates, born and raised in Arizona.""

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: WHICH CANDIDATE HOLDS THE EDGE ON THIS CRUCIAL ISSUE

""They are working mothers fighting for the rights that matter most to Arizonans, especially every child's right to a quality education,"" she added.

The 73-year-old actress has a history of endorsing Democratic candidates, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016 and President Biden in 2020.

Pamela Carter's platform states that she is committed to tackling inflation, supporting law enforcement and securing the Southern border. The Republican's campaign website accused her Democratic opponents of ""champion[ing] Joe Biden's open border policies, but this is a critical issue that should not be corrupted by their partisan politics.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS IN THE HARRIS-TRUMP 2024 SHOWDOWN

""Our open borders are allowing human trafficking, drugs (including fentanyl), gangs, drugs, and violence to pour across our border, in record-setting quantities,"" her website reads. ""This puts us all at risk, just because politicians are too busy fighting each other to fight for us.""

""I believe we should secure the border, enforce Arizona's laws, and stop the flow of drugs, crime, and violence,"" the Republican added. ""Legal immigration has long been a source of strength for America and deserves its own updating, but nothing meaningful will succeed until illegal immigration is largely ended.""

Two days after she endorsed the Democratic candidates, Carter endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming U.S. presidential election.

""I'm voting for @KamalaHarris because she has a proven track record of improving the lives of everyday Americans,"" the actress wrote on Sept. 16. ""A 'concept of an idea' won't protect your grandparents' retirement savings. Her policies already do.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Pamela Carter's campaign for comment, but did not immediately hear back."
Tennessee woman attempted to hire hitman to kill wife of man she met on dating website: 'Needs to seem random',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/tennessee-woman-attempted-hire-hitman-kill-wife-man-she-met-dating-website-needs-seem-random,2024-09-23T10:01:46Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

A Tennessee woman attempted to hire an online hitman for close to $10,000 to kill the wife of a man she met on the dating website Match.com, according to prosecutors.

Melody Sasser, 48, used a dark website known as ""Online Killers Market"" to hire a hitman for a ""job"" last year, according to court documents.

That website allegedly offers hitman-for-hire services, hacking, kidnapping, extortion, disfigurement by acid attack and sexual assault, WVLT reported.

Sasser, using the username ""cattree,"" messaged the website administrator about hiring a hitman. She paid $9,750 in Bitcoin to do the ""job"" and emphasized that it needed to appear like an accident to avoid suspicion of criminal activity.

TENNESSEE MURDER SUSPECT ON THE RUN FOR MONTHS FOUND AFTER FALLING THROUGH CEILING DURING HOME SEARCH

""It needs to seem random or accident, or plant drugs, do not want a long investigation. She recently moved in with her new husband,"" Sasser wrote to the administrator.

The woman she wanted dead, identified only as JW, lives in Prattville, Alabama, with her husband, identified as DW, who met Sasser on Match.com prior to his marriage.

DW said Sasser helped him with a hike along the Appalachian Trail before he moved to Alabama and married his now-wife.

Sasser had left threatening voicemails on JW's phone using technology to disguise her voice, court documents allege.

Court documents say Sasser talked with the ""Online Killers Market"" administrator over the course of two months over frustrations about the ""job"" not being completed.

""I have waited for 2 months and 11 days and the job is not completed,"" she wrote to the administrator. ""2 weeks ago you said it was been worked on and would be done in a week. the job is still not done. does it need to be assigned to someone else? will it be done? what is the delay? when will it be done, [SIC].""

During her communications with the website, Sasser provided photographs and location information of JW, according to court documents.

Sasser was allegedly able to track the couple's whereabouts by using an app called Strava, which connects to Garmin watches to share fitness data.

At one point, she notified the ""Online Killers Market"" administrator when JW had left her home for a two-mile walk.

But the plot ended up unsuccessful, and it led to Sasser's arrest and her home being searched.

Law enforcement found during the search of her home a journal listing several other hitman websites, a handwritten account of communications with the ""Online Killers Market"" and a stack of cash underneath a sticky note with a Bitcoin address.

A federal grand jury indicted Sasser in June of last year for the use of interstate commerce facilities in the commission of murder-for-hire.

Sasser entered a plea deal on Wednesday, and she was sentenced to 100 months in prison and must pay more than $5,300 in restitution to the victim."
"Testosterone therapy could help boost women's sex drive as they age, but risks exist, experts say",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/health/testosterone-therapy-could-help-boost-womens-sex-drive-age-risks-exist-experts-say,2024-09-23T08:34:01Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Celebrities' use of testosterone to boost their sex drive could lead more women to try hormone replacement therapy (HRT), experts say.

Actress Kate Winslet recently revealed in an appearance on the ""How to Fail"" podcast with Elizabeth Day that a dip in libido could mean an imbalance in testosterone levels.

""A lot of people don't know this, but women have testosterone in their body; when it runs out, like eggs, it's gone,"" the ""Titanic"" actress, 48, told a listener.

KATE WINSLET ADMITS TO USING TESTOSTERONE THERAPY TO 'FEEL SEXY AGAIN'

""So, once it's gone, you have to replace it, and that is something that can be done, and you'll feel sexy again,"" Winslet said.

""I know,"" she added, without offering additional details.

Hormone expert Dan Holtz, co-founder of the Beverly Hills Rejuvenation Center, echoed that HRT is used to ""optimize hormone levels in men and women as they go through life.""

""Benefits may include better sleep, improved energy, less anxiety [and] improved metabolic rate,"" he said in a response sent to Fox News Digital.

WOMEN'S HORMONE EXPERT SHARES HER METHOD FOR ELIMINATING MENSTRUAL PAIN

Holtz has worked with numerous celebrities to optimize their hormone levels. He confirmed that many women and men have reported a ""noticeable improvement in libido after optimizing testosterone.""

Some women have also reported an improvement in libido when correcting a deficiency in DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone), a hormone the body produces in the adrenal gland, according to the expert.

HRT is often referred to as menopause hormone therapy (MHT), a medical treatment to relieve menopause symptoms, according to women's health and menopause expert Dr. Mary Claire Haver of Friendswood, Texas.

""As we approach menopause, the natural decline in estrogen, progesterone and testosterone can lead to symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, mood changes, muscle and joint pain, brain fog, vaginal dryness and low libido,"" she told Fox News Digital.

""Every woman's situation is unique, and we need to balance the potential benefits against the risks.""

""For many women, these symptoms can severely affect their quality of life.""

Hormone therapy works by replenishing the estrogen, progesterone and testosterone levels that the body is no longer producing in sufficient amounts, Haver noted.

THE 9 MOST COMMON QUESTIONS WOMEN OVER 40 ASK THEIR DOCTORS, ACCORDING TO A MENOPAUSE EXPERT

""The goal is to alleviate symptoms by restoring health-promoting hormone levels, but MHT also has additional benefits, like maintaining bone density, which reduces the risk of osteoporosis - a concern for postmenopausal women,"" she added.

While women have much lower levels of testosterone compared to men, the hormone is ""crucial"" to maintaining libido and sexual function in females, according to Haver -- in addition to boosting energy and mood.

When testosterone levels decline -- which occurs as women grow older and approach menopause -- a decrease in sexual desire, arousal and satisfaction can result, the expert said.

That's because the hormone acts on a key region of the brain involved in regulating sexual behavior, she added.

Studies have shown that for some women, boosting testosterone levels can lead to ""noticeable improvements"" in sexual health, Haver said.

""Women need to know that low libido is a legitimate medical concern, not just something they have to 'push through.'""

""By increasing testosterone levels, these brain centers become more responsive to sexual stimuli, which can lead to an increase in libido,"" she said.

Haver encouraged women who are experiencing low libido to consider testosterone therapy as part of a ""broader treatment plan.""

""The goal is to restore levels to the normal physiological range for women, improving sexual desire without pushing the body into a 'male' hormone profile,"" she told Fox News Digital.

Mayo Clinic confirmed that testosterone therapy may boost sex drive for some women after menopause, but noted that there is limited research on its safety and long-term effectiveness.

It has also been shown to cause some side effects.

""Most often, other treatments are tried before testosterone,"" the clinic stated on its website.

""These include low doses of the hormone estrogen, and a type of counseling called sex therapy. Some depression medicines also may boost sex drive.""

HRT is ""not a one-size-fits-all solution,"" and there are potential risks if it's done inappropriately, Haver warned.

IS IT MENOPAUSE? 6 HIDDEN SYMPTOMS WOMEN SHOULD KNOW ABOUT NOW

""Studies have shown that estrogen-containing hormone therapy can increase the risk of certain conditions, such as blood clots and stroke,"" the doctor said.

""Testosterone therapy can also increase the risk of unwanted hair growth, deepening of the voice and acne.""

Those risks can vary based on factors like the type of hormones used, the dosage, the delivery method and how long it's administered, according to Haver.

""Every woman's situation is unique, and we need to balance the potential benefits against the risks, with the proper dosage, formulations and delivery system.""

Haver recommends MHT for women who are within 10 years of menopause onset and are under 60 years old -- ""particularly for those suffering from moderate to severe symptoms.""

Some women can feel ""dismissed or not fully supported"" when discussing sexual health concerns with medical providers, Haver noted.

""Sexual function in women can be influenced by hormones, neurotransmitters, mental health, relationship dynamics and even chronic medical conditions,"" she said.

Effective treatment addresses these root causes rather than just offering ""superficial fixes,"" she said.

""Women need to know that low libido is a legitimate medical concern, not just something they have to 'push through.'""

For those interested in HRT, Holtz suggested finding a well-established and reputable company or provider with a track record of success.

Haver added that it's essential for women to have a thorough discussion with their medical provider to assess their specific health needs and determine the best treatment plan."
"Terminally ill Missouri woman, 79, taking trip to Switzerland for assisted suicide",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/health/terminally-ill-missouri-woman-79-taking-trip-switzerland-assisted-suicide,2024-09-23T08:31:14Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

A terminally ill Missouri woman is planning to go to Switzerland to end her own life in a physician-assisted death while she is still physically capable of making the trip.

Gayle Hendrix, a 79-year-old mother of two from Cape Girardeau, was diagnosed with lupus and interstitial lung disease four years ago and says her lung capacity continues to worsen.

""I've had a great life, and I want to have some dignity when I'm going to the next phase,"" she told 12 KFVS.

After her diagnosis, she says her shortness of breath continued to become worse and was breathing heavily even on flat surfaces.

PHYSICALLY HEALTHY DUTCH WOMAN DIES BY ASSISTED SUICIDE AT AGE 29

""My friends will say, 'But you don't look or sound or act like somebody who is near death.' But I am dying, and that's what I want to control,"" she said.

""I don't want to get to the point of, 'This is existing, not living,'"" Hendrix continued.

Hendrix must use an oxygen machine and can only walk short distances.

She had lived an active lifestyle before her diagnosis, which included traveling a lot for work, hiking and riding a bicycle.

""She was always busy, always ... She always either had three jobs or she was going somewhere, like to concerts or festivals,"" her daughter, Charlene Foeste, told the news station.

Hendrix, who is originally from North Carolina, is now a retiree after having had a career in human resources. She also lived in other locations during her career before returning to Missouri.

""I would love to say I was a poet, a painter and a musician ... I have nothing in that arena,"" Hendrix said with a laugh. ""So, I think that's why I took up walking because I can walk. I was an avid walker, anywhere from three to five miles a day ... every day up until about three years ago.""

Following her retirement, Hendrix grew bored and went back to work during the pandemic as a contact tracer. She recently retired again, as she prepares for her next chapter.

""It is going to be hard, but I know that, and I know sort of what to expect and what the end result is going to be for sure,"" Foeste said.

Hendrix and Foeste will board an airplane this week for a flight to Switzerland where Hendrix will end her life on Sept. 26 through assisted suicide.

""When I started seeing more and more decline, like monthly, I can tell this is not as good as it was last month. I knew then if I wanted to do it when I'm still able to walk in and still make the trip, then I need to do it soon,"" Hendrix said.

Physician-assisted death is legal in the U.S. in ten states and Washington, D.C. All but two of these places have residency requirements, with the exceptions being Vermont and Oregon.

But Hendrix is choosing to end her life in another country because, among other rules and regulations, a patient must have six months or less to live to undergo assisted suicide where it is legal in the U.S.

""I don't want to wait that long,"" Hendrix said. ""I don't want to get that sick.""

Even before her diagnosis, Hendrix had spent decades advocating for the right to assisted suicide, including by becoming involved with groups like Compassion and Choices, a nonprofit that works to increase access to so-called death with dignity.

She filled out the paperwork for her assisted death this past spring and was planning to make the trip to Switzerland in August, but she had to push her timeline back due to a lack of open spots for the procedure during that time.

""They put an IV in your arm and the first medicine that goes through puts you to sleep and the second one stops all body functions,"" Hendrix said. ""They have some kind of button on the IV, you have to be able to push that button and that starts the fluid. In five minutes it's done.""

When her life ends, she will be cremated and her remains will be shipped back to Missouri in a couple of weeks.

Hendrix said she is not nervous about the trip, but acknowledges the impact her death will have on her family.

""It's a huge loss, a huge loss for us,"" Foeste said. ""It's not going to be the same. It's just not.""

Hendrix said she has had tough conversations with friends and family who do not support her decision to end her life through assisted suicide, including some who believe what she is doing is morally wrong.

""Some of them are religious, and, you know, have some views, but I think because I've been open about it for so long around people, they weren't shocked,"" Hendrix said.

Her daughter is among the people who do not support her decision to end her life.

""I can't say I agree with her decision, I don't,"" Foeste said. ""But, it's not my choice. I do love her and support her and there's no way on the planet my mom is going to do this alone, no way.""

""I love her and support her 100%, no matter what,"" Foeste added. ""She knows that, my kids know that, and I just wish more people were like that.""

Hendrix said she is aware she could potentially miss out on more quality living, but does not want to run the risk of ending up in a hospital bed.

""I just am peaceful about my decision, and it's the right thing for me and my body,"" Hendrix said."
"Families in swing state afraid to let kids play outside after Venezuelan migrant attacks mom, child: lawmaker",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/families-swing-state-afraid-let-kids-play-outside-after-venezuelan-migrant-attacks-mom-child-lawmaker,2024-09-23T08:16:12Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A member of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang was arrested in a tiny Wisconsin community for allegedly sexually assaulting a mother and abusing her daughter after he had been arrested and released earlier this year in Minneapolis.

Republican Rep. Derrick Van Orden, whose grandchildren live less than a mile away from the Prairie du Chien home where the mother and daughter were held against their will and repeatedly victimized, told Fox News Digital that it was only a matter of time before tragedy would strike the community amid the White House's open-border policies and sanctuary city initiatives.

Alejandro Jose Coronel Zarate, 26, assaulted the woman and child ""under particularly brutal circumstances,"" and attacked his victims ""over the course of a period of time,"" Prairie du Chien Police Chief Kyle Teynor said at a September 9 press conference following Coronel Zarate's arrest.

Coronel Zarate was charged with sexual assault, battery, strangulation, suffocation, false imprisonment, child abuse and disorderly conduct in Crawford County Court on Wednesday, WXOW reported. He remains in Crawford County Jail on $10,000 cash bond.

VENEZUELAN GANG TREN DE ARAGUA TAKE OVER TEXAS HOTEL, COUNTY OFFICIALS WORK TO SHUT DOWN BUSINESS

The mother later told police that Coronel Zarate had also assaulted her on September 4, according to a criminal complaint. During that incident, she told police, Coronel Zarate allegedly told her, ""I get away with it. I'm a criminal.""

Teynor said that Coronel Zarate had tattoos associating him with Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang, which originated in the country's prisons and has since grown a foothold in several areas across the United States.

Members are accused of a series of high-profile crimes across the U.S., including the murder of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley and the shooting of two NYPD officers during an arrest in June.

""I don't care what your political affiliation is. This is not a Democrat issue. It's not an independent or Libertarian issue. This is a human-rights issue,"" Van Orden said at the Sept. 9 press conference. ""American citizens' human rights are being violated. They're being kidnapped, raped and murdered by criminal illegal aliens, and it's just got to stop.""

Van Orden told Fox News Digital that he stands behind his earlier comments despite the pushback he has since received.

""They're calling us racists for putting out the fact that a man with organized crime tattoos was let into the country by the Harris border czar - he happens to be Venezuelan,"" Van Orden said.

Van Orden clarified that he was not opposed to legal immigrants, or immigrants who come to the country on temporary agricultural worker visas, noting that Wisconsin's farming industries rely on migrants.

""If we don't have immigrant labor, our dairies, our farms will go out of business. Our dairies will close if we don't have immigrant labor. I absolutely 100% welcome immigrant labor if they want to come here and work and send remittances back,"" he said. ""But letting someone into the country with tattoos associated with known immigrant gangs is not OK. We do not welcome criminal illegal immigrants to come here.""

Prairie du Chien police confirmed that Zarate had entered the country in September 2023 at or near the El Paso, Texas point of entry.

""I've been to the border three times. They let a guy in the country with gang tattoos, and you get a medical screening before you come over the border. They give them a medical exam, because they don't want people coming over with tuberculosis,"" Van Orden said incredulously.

The former Navy SEAL said the attack had shaken his small community, but said it was only a matter of time until migrant crime would strike there.

""Why should a town of 5,500 people . . . be afraid of letting their kids play in their front yard?"" Van Orden said. ""It wasn't like this three years ago.""

The gang member's Prairie du Chien arrest was not his first run-in with police. In November 2023, he was detained for allegedly receiving stolen property but was subsequently released.

""Zarate got rolled up for property crimes in Minneapolis and Minnesota that are controlled by [Governor] Tim Walz,"" Van Orden said. ""They let him go because of the sanctuary city policies.""

A warrant was issued for his arrest in Wisconsin's Dane County on Dec. 1 for strangulation/suffocation, false imprisonment, battery and disorderly conduct. In addition to federal policies, Van Orden blamed Dane County Sheriff Kalvin Barrett, a Democrat, for the incident earlier this month.

""Dane County Sheriff Kalvin Barrett bears a tremendous amount of responsibility personally, and that's just a fact,"" Van Orden told Fox News Digital. ""What [he] cannot deny is that they issued a warrant for Mr. Zarate for strangulation, false imprisonment, battery and disorderly conduct. That warrant came out of his office - if he spent more time fighting crime as opposed to complaining about a Republican on his Facebook page, he would have been detained, and a mother and daughter wouldn't have spent several days being sexually assaulted.""

Van Orden and Republican Rep. Tom Tiffany penned a letter to Barrett earlier this month demanding answers regarding the warrant for Coronel Zarate.

""Given that Dane County was classified as 'non-cooperative' with federal immigration authorities as recently as June of this year by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Reps. Tiffany and Van Orden wrote to ask for additional information regarding Dane County law enforcement's interaction with Mr. Coronel Zarate,"" read a release from the two Congress members.

Barrett told Fox News Digital that the Republicans' accusations were merely ""an unsubstantiated and distasteful attempt to gather votes in a battleground state for the upcoming presidential election,"" and that the statement about being uncooperative was false.

""As sheriff, I will not stand for another disrespectful attack on our law enforcement profession by actors looking to politically persuade voters. This inquiry is an insult to the brave men and women of our Sheriff's Office who courageously put their lives on the line in service to their community,"" Barrett wrote in an email.

""To the authors of this inquiry, please aim your political theatrics in a different direction as you try to recover from the thorough, factual and strategic dismantling of your presidential candidate by VP Kamala Harris,"" Barrett said. ""To save any follow-up inquiries, we have not taken reports of people eating cats or dogs."""
Cher to hit Victoria's Secret runway after casting controversy,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/cher-hit-victorias-secret-runway-after-casting-controversy,2024-09-23T08:13:26Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Music icon Cher will be headlining the musical lineup for the return of the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.

The ""Believe"" singer's upcoming performance was announced on the brand's Instagram.

""It's a woman's world, so it's understood that you can't have a fashion show without the mother of fashion herself -- @Cher!"" they wrote.

Victoria's Secret added that more performers will be joining their ""first-ever, all-women lineup"" when the show airs Oct. 15.

VICTORIA'S SECRET TO 'RETHINK' ANNUAL FASHION SHOW, SAYS NETWORK TELEVISION ISN'T 'THE RIGHT FIT'

Tyra Banks, one of the most famous faces to walk the Victoria's Secret runway, will also be returning to the show.

In a video shared on social media, she and fellow model Gigi Hadid exchanged invites in a setup reminiscent of Banks' ""Tyra Mail"" gimmick from her reality show, ""America's Next Top Model.""

Earlier this year, the lingerie brand announced the show would be returning in a statement on Instagram.

""We've read the comments and heard you. The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show is BACK and will reflect who we are today, plus everything you know and love -- the glamour, runway, wings, musical entertainment, and more! Stay tuned...it only gets more iconic from here,"" it stated, though it did not specify where it will be airing or streaming.

In a statement reported by People, Victoria's Secret noted some significant changes in its approach to the show this year.

""The 2024 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show will deliver precisely what our customers have been asking for -- the glamour, runway, fashion, fun, wings, entertainment -- all through a powerful, modern lens reflecting who we are today,"" a representative for the brand told the outlet. ""We're thrilled to share a women-led articulation of this iconic property later this year!""

""We've read the comments and heard you. The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show is BACK and will reflect who we are today...""

-- Victoria's Secret

Victoria's Secret canceled the show in 2019 after facing criticism over inclusivity on the runway and suffering its lowest ratings ever.

The brand's chief marketing officer at the time, Ed Razek, also drew fire after he made controversial statements in a 2018 interview with Vogue, saying the show wouldn't include transgender models because it's supposed to be a ""fantasy.""

HALSEY SLAMS VICTORIA'S SECRET FASHION SHOW FOR 'LACK OF INCLUSIVITY'

""It's like, why doesn't your show do this? Shouldn't you have transsexuals in the show? No. No, I don't think we should,"" he told Vogue. ""Well, why not? Because the show is a fantasy. It's a 42-minute entertainment special. That's what it is.""

Shortly after the comments were published, Victoria's Secret posted an apology from Razek.

""My remark regarding the inclusion of transgender models in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show came across as insensitive. I apologize,"" the statement read. ""To be clear, we absolutely would cast a transgender model for the show. We've had transgender models come to castings... And like many others, they didn't make it... But it was never about gender. I admire and respect their journey to embrace who they really are.""

In 2019, the brand decided to no longer move forward with the show and was going to ""rethink"" the event, according to an internal memo obtained by Fox News Digital at the time.

A year later, Victoria's Secret was the subject of a New York Times investigation that detailed an alleged culture of misogyny at the company.

The company split from L Brands in 2021 and has continued to change its approach to its female customer base.

In 2023, Victoria's Secret released a filmed version of a fashion show on Prime Video before its official relaunch this year.

Janie Schaffer, Victoria Secret's chief design and creative officer, and Sarah Sylvester, executive vice president of marketing, spoke in an interview with Women's Wear Daily in July, saying the brand has ""really been transforming hugely"" over the past few years.

""This is really a celebration of everything we've been doing. Believe me, we have got such super fans out there that there is an element where people are saying, 'You bring it back exactly as it was before. Bring back exactly the same models, and don't change anything,'"" Schaffer said."
"Keith Urban admits he has 'animalistic, wild, reckless, irresponsible' side",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/keith-urban-admits-he-has-animalistic-wild-reckless-irresponsible-side,2024-09-23T08:13:21Z,"Keith Urban discussed how his wife Nicole Kidman and their children support his music career.

Keith Urban is highlighting both the joys and struggles of his life in his new country-rock album ""High.""

Last Friday, the 56-year-old singer released his 11th studio album, which marked his first new record in four years. During a recent interview with the Associated Press, Urdan explained how ""High"" reflects dual sides of his personality.

""I've got a dutiful, responsible, reliable side. And I've got this animalistic, wild, reckless, irresponsible, 'What does this button do?,'"" Urban said. ""The spirit of those two things is very much a part of who I am, and this album hopefully captures that.""

The four-time Grammy Award winner first announced his new album in a June Instagram post. He wrote that ""High"" was based on a ""prior record I started in 2022."" Urban previously revealed that he had completed another record titled ""615,"" which he ultimately discarded after being dissatisfied with the result.

KEITH URBAN, NICOLE KIDMAN SHARE HUMBLE ROOTS OF COMING TO AMERICA 'WITH NOTHING'

In his Instagram post, Urban explained that ""High"" was ""completely expressive, true, honest and . . . so much more of what I actually wanted to say when making that scrapped record.""

""I hope these songs bring you joy, levity, some new understanding, energy, and escape!"" he added.

In a press release, Urban revealed that the new album's title was inspired by his interpretation of the multi-faceted meaning of the word ""high.""

""What makes you 'high' can mean whatever you want it to mean,"" he said. ""It might be physical, spiritual, herbal, meditative, chemical or musical, but it's definitely a place of utopia.""

He continues, ""For me it's my family, my friends, and this rollercoaster musical journey I'm on. Playing guitar, writing songs and the place where I always feel high -- playing live. Every night I get a chance to bring an energy and a release to people.""

After overcoming a challenging past, Urban is now a happily married family man. The singer and Nicole Kidman, who tied the knot in 2006, share daughters Sunday Rose, 16, and Faith Margaret, 13.

Urban has also been sober for 18 years after entering rehab for the third time shortly after marrying Kidman.

However, Urban explained in a recent interview with the Daily Telegraph that he wanted his new album to encompass times from the entirety of his life. ""High"" includes songs about Urban's hard-partying days, battle with addiction and growing up with an alcoholic father.

""I've got a dutiful, responsible, reliable side. And I've got this animalistic, wild, reckless, irresponsible, 'What does this button do?'""

-- Keith Urban

Urban told the Daily Telegraph that the music video for his song ""Messed Up As Me"" is set ""across 2.45 am to sunrise.""

""A lot of things happen in those hours, and I've been in every scene,"" he said.

""I've got plenty of things to mine, you know,"" Urban added. ""This record is definitely not only about where I'm at; that would make it a very linear record.

""Definitely, I've lived a life, and been a lot of people, and a lot of those people are represented in these songs.""

While speaking with the Associated Press, Urban explained that it was important to him that the album conclude with the song ""Break the Chain,"" in which he delves into dysfunctional family dynamics.

""It's a lot to do with my dad and being born into a family with an alcoholic father and the challenges that come with that,"" he said. ""My job is to now maybe break that chain and do something different.""

""But I never mentioned alcohol in the song once, because I didn't want the song to be about that,"" Urban continued.

""It's really about behavioral patterns that we all learn very quickly to survive in whatever environment that we're in.""

Urban told the AP that he co-wrote ""Break the Chain"" with singer-songwriter Marc Scibilia on the first day they met and they began the process without having much conversation. The second line that came to Urban was ""Never sure/What made him so mad at the world/Mad at me/I was just a kid/I won't do the same.""

The ""Someboy Like You"" hitmaker recalled that he had a strong emotional reaction after penning the lyric.

""I just burst out crying on this guy's couch, just like in a fetal position, like I'm in therapy,"" Urban remembered.

""He looks over and he just goes, 'Hmm, must be true,'"" he said of Sciblia. ""And then went back to work. And it was the perfect reaction, because it wasn't judgmental. It was of no opinion. And he just let me stay in it and finish out the song. And then that was it.""

However, Urban said that like all of the songs on ""High,"" from the clear-as-day goodtime tracks and the others that might center on more complicated emotions, it's ""a hopeful song.""

""It's offering hope and a way through a situation that a lot of people might find themselves in,"" he explained.

Over the years, Urban has been transparent about his own journey to sobriety after battling drug addiction and alcoholism.

In a 2021 interview with Rolling Stone, Urban recalled that his troubles began after he moved to Nashville from Australia, where he had previously released four hit albums. Urban explained that he felt like an outsider as a foreigner trying to make it in the country music scene.

""Nothing I'd done before meant s---,"" he says. ""I felt like I was meant to be here, I had this absolute burning belief, but I was out of step with everything. I mean, what do you do when you're doing your best, and it's not enough?""

""When I was onstage, I felt good, but if I was not onstage, I was very, very insecure,"" he added. ""I felt like I didn't have much of anything to offer. I was just an alien.""

Urban recalled that a painful breakup with a woman who had told him that the ""novelty of you has worn off"" had fueled his descent into addiction.

""You might say, 'Big deal.' But I was feeling insecure, and the fact that me and my accent would be a novelty to somebody cut me to the core,"" he said. ""Oh, my God. Really bad. It devastated me. It was a turning point. After that, s--- started to really go awry.""

""I stepped up my drinking,"" he continued. ""I started doing more drugs. Yeah, man. The whole back end of the Nineties were just awful.""

After years as a struggling artist, Urban made his career breakthrough in 1999 when he released his self-titled debut album. The record, which notched four singles on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and was certified platinum, launched Urban into country music stardom.

Despite finding career success, Urban continued to struggle with his addictions to alcohol and drugs.

NICOLE KIDMAN'S TENNESSEE HOME ALLOWS HER TO BE 'JUST A CITIZEN': 'MY KIDS LOVE THAT'

""It took me a long time to get sober,"" he told Rolling Stone. ""Took me a long time to recognize my alcoholism. A long time, because I didn't drink like my dad, so I compared everything to him. So it just took a long time for me. But I was able to finally make the right choice in my life, that I wish my dad would have made.""

In 2015, Urban's father Robert died after a long battle with prostate cancer.

After two failed stints in rehab, Urban was finally able to conquer his own addiction problems after he married Kidman in 2006. Four months into their marriage, Kidman staged an intervention, and Urban agreed to enter rehab again.

""That's the point right there where she really should've just walked,"" Urban told Oprah Winfrey in 2010. ""I'm just so glad she didn't, and she made a decision to turn around and initiate ultimately this intervention, and it was done in such a way that the love in that room at that moment was just right. I was like, 'Put the cuffs on, let's go.'""

While speaking with Rolling Stone, Urban said that it was a ""miracle"" that their marriage survived.

""I was spiritually awoken with her,"" the singer said of Kidman. ""I use the expression 'I was born into her,' and that's how I feel. And for the first time in my life, I could shake off the shackles of addiction.""

In June 2024, Urban gave a heartfelt tribute to Kidman when she was honored with the 49th AFI Life Achievement Award. The couple's daughters, Sunday and Faith, joined their parents at the star-studded event, which marked their red carpet debut.

During his speech at the ceremony, Urban recalled how Kidman's love for him persevered despite the rocky start to their marriage.

""We got married in June 2006, and barely four months into our marriage, my addictions that I'd done really nothing about, blew our marriage to smithereens, and I went into the Betty Ford Center for three months,"" he told the crowd.

""Four months into a marriage, I'm into rehab for three months, with no idea what was going to happen to us,"" he continued. ""And if you want to see what love in action really looks like, give that a whirl.""

""Nic pushed through every negative voice, I'm sure, even some of her own,"" Urban added. ""And she chose love. And here we are tonight, 18 years later.""

In a video of the speech, Kidman was seen wiping away tears while sitting in the audience next to Sunday and Faith.

Ahead of performing at the 2023 Academy of Country Music Awards, Urban shared the secret to their successful union.

""It's always family first,"" he said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

""It's balanced, so it means it goes out of balance sometimes, and we just put it back in balance,"" Urban added. ""It's never perfectly in balance, but we get it back on track."""

""Last night, several people were killed and many more wounded in downtown Birmingham, Alabama. And once again, our entire nation is watching in horror as another community is devastated by the national epidemic of gun violence,"" Stef Feldman, Gun Violence Prevention Director said in a statement.

""President Biden and Vice President Harris join Americans across the nation in praying for the families affected by this senseless violence,"" Feldman continued.

At the direction of President Biden, Feldman said the White House is coordinating with federal, state, and local officials as investigations are underway into the shooting.

Janet Jackson reportedly not walking back comments about Kamala Harris not being Black,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/janet-jackson-reportedly-not-walking-back-comments-about-harris-not-being-black,2024-09-22T23:21:18Z,"Some Black men in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania remarked to a local CBS news affiliate how they didn't consider Vice President Kamala Harris to be Black.

Janet Jackson's Sunday apology for recent comments about Vice President Kamala Harris was reportedly not authorized.

In an interview with the Guardian on Saturday, the 58-year-old singer was asked about her thoughts on Harris potentially becoming the first Black female president.

""Well, you know what they supposedly said?"" Jackson said. ""She's not Black. That's what I heard. That she's Indian.""

When the interviewer argued Harris was both Black and Indian, Jackson continued, ""Her father's White. That's what I was told. I mean, I haven't watched the news in a few days. I was told that they discovered her father was White.""

Buzzfeed reported that Jackson's manager, Mo Elmasri, released a statement on Sunday saying her comments were ""based on misinformation"" rather than her actual thoughts on Harris.

""She deeply respects Vice President Kamala Harris and her accomplishments as a Black and Indian woman,"" the statement said. ""Janet apologizes for any confusion caused and acknowledges the importance of accurate representation in public discourse.""

""We appreciate the opportunity to address this and will remain committed to promoting unity,"" the statement concluded.

However, other reports have disputed the statement from Elmarsi, claiming he doesn't manage Harris and that the singer is managed by her brother Randy Jackson. Variety reported, ""after a confusing turn of events on Sunday, reps for Janet Jackson tell Variety that an unusually worded 'apology' for the singer's ill-informed comments about Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris' racial background was made by a person who is not the singer's manager, as he had claimed, and thus was not authorized to speak on her behalf.""

According to IMBD, Elmarsi works as a ""creative consultant"" for Jackson, Beyoncé, Britney Spears and Selena Gomez, and he is listed as a producer for the TV series, ""Janet Jackson: Family First.""

In the Guardian interview, Jackson also gave her opinion on whether she believed the country was ready for a ""woman of color"" president.

""I don't know,"" Jackson said. ""Honestly, I don't want to answer that because I really, truthfully, don't know. I think either way it goes is going to be mayhem.""

""I think there might be mayhem,"" she continued. ""Either way it goes, but we'll have to see.""

Jackson's original comments came a couple of months after former President Trump's contentious appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ). During a Q&A event, Trump said Harris changed her racial background.

""She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage,"" Trump said. ""I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black. And now she wants to be known as Black. So, I don't know, is she Indian or is she Black?""

Olivia Munn and husband John Mulaney revealed their family of three became a little larger this month with the addition of their daughter Méi June Mulaney.

The couple announced the birth of their baby girl on social media Sunday, with Munn praising the ""real-life angel"" surrogate who carried their little one.

Munn, 44, previously disclosed that she opted for a hysterectomy as part of an overall ""aggressive"" approach to being proactive about her health after receiving a breast cancer diagnosis last year.

OLIVIA MUNN DOCUMENTED CANCER JOURNEY FOR SON TO SHOW HIM 'I TRIED MY BEST' IF SHE 'DIDN'T MAKE IT'

Mulaney and Munn shared photos of their new bundle of joy swaddled in a receiving blanket and wearing a beanie in a delivery room at the hospital.

""Méi June Mulaney came into the world September 14, 2024, the year of the dragon,"" she wrote on Instagram.

OLIVIA MUNN SAYS SHE HAD HYSTERECTOMY AS PART OF 'AGGRESSIVE' BREAST CANCER TREATMENT

""I had so many profound emotions about not being able to carry my daughter. When I first met our gestational surrogate we spoke mother to mother. She showed me so much grace and understanding, I knew I had found a real-life angel.""

Munn added, ""Words cannot express my gratitude that she kept our baby safe for 9 months and made our dreams come true. I am so proud of my little plum, my little dragon for making the journey to be with us. My heart has exploded.""

The mother-of-two clarified, ""Méi (pronounced may) means plum in Chinese.""

""Words cannot express my gratitude that she kept our baby safe for 9 months and made our dreams come true.""

Mulaney made sure to note in his own post, ""We stole so much stuff from the hospital. I love my little girl so much.""

The couple welcomed their first child, son Malcolm, in November 2021. Last month, Mulaney confirmed on ""Late Night with Seth Meyers"" that he married Munn over Fourth of July weekend.

Munn froze her eggs in anticipation of treatment following her diagnosis. She announced her breast cancer diagnosis on March 13 in an Instagram post, explaining she got an MRI after her doctor found her Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool to be 37%. The MRI found Luminal B cancer, ""an aggressive, fast moving cancer,"" in both breasts.

She revealed she had undergone genetic testing, saying, ""I tested negative for all, including BRCA (the most well-known breast cancer gene). My sister, Sara, had just tested negative as well. We called each other and high-fived over the phone. That same winter, I also had a normal mammogram.""

""Two months later, I was diagnosed with breast cancer.""

""The ""X-Men"" actress later told Vogue, ""After my diagnosis, we decided to try one more round of egg retrievals and hoped it was a good month. John and I talked about it a lot, and we don't feel like we're done growing our family, but [we] didn't know if I would have to do chemotherapy or radiation.""

While they didn't share a specific timeline for family planning, Munn explained how fortunate she was to have surrogacy as an option.

""With a surrogate, you have to try to go find a version of yourself somewhere out in the world. Somebody that you trust as much as yourself to live their life as a pregnant woman the same way that you would. But a surrogate isn't a scary prospect to me anymore because there's nothing I can do,"" she said.

Chicago Sky forward Angel Reese may not be in control of a lot of things in her future, but she knows exactly what she wants in a man when it comes to the dating world.

Reese, whose season abruptly ended early due to a wrist injury, spoke about her dating life on the latest episode of her podcast ""Unapologetically Angel."" She confirmed she was single after dating Florida State Seminoles guard Cam'Ron Fletcher.

""He gotta be tall... 6'7"", 6'8"","" Reese said when divulging her criteria for her next partner, including that he has to be in the NBA.

Mariah the Scientist, a singer/songwriter who is dating rapper Young Thug, said she would look into helping Reese.

""I don't know too many of them. I'm going to make a call,"" the artist said. ""I'm going to make a call and I'm going to have them make a call. And then I'm going to get you a little selection.""

The New York Post noted that Reese also revealed the things that are important to her when it comes to being in a relationship.

""You don't see a lot of relationships where the woman is just as dominant as the man. The woman can provide for herself without the man. They have to bring something completely different to the table because there's nothing you could buy me that I can't buy myself,"" she said earlier this month, adding that ""quality time"" was her love language."
DAVID MARCUS: Project 2025 lies make it to Hershey before the truth can get its pants on,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-democrat-media-lies-about-project-2025-inundating-country,2024-09-22T15:42:08Z,"HERSHEY, Pa. - I hear it everywhere I go, in every corner and crevice of the country that I have covered during this election, menacing talk about Project 2025. Never mind that Donald Trump has nothing to do with Project 2025, never mind that the canard that he does is a coordinated lie between Democrats and the media, the fact is, it is working.

In this town of 15,000 known for chocolate, I met Mark and his service dog. He is retired military and told me, ""Nobody does research, people just believe what they are told,"" adding, ""I'm Gen X, we had actual libraries, we had to look things up with the the...""

TRUMP, HARRIS LOCKED IN TIGHT RACE IN CRITICAL BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA, POLLS FIND

""Dewey Decimal System?"" I chimed in.

""Exactly, thanks,"" he replied. ""Now people just accept whatever Google spits out at them.""

Mark might have a point, because typically, in fact almost always, voters who bring up Project 2025 to me have no real understanding of what it is or what's in it.

It may be the case that, aside from a handful of wonks at the Heritage Foundation where this Frankenstein monster of a policy project came to life, nobody on earth knows what's in it.

""I've heard it's like a list of rights that Republicans want to take away, like on abortion,"" a woman in Virginia recently told me. When I pressed for specifics, she admitted she was only relying on generalizations from the Democrats and the media.

But, far more important than what is or isn't in the 900-page policy tome, which is mostly a set of Human Resources guidelines, is that it has absolutely, positively nothing to do with Donald Trump and never has.

At every turn since Project 2025 became a major campaign issue, Trump has disavowed it, said it will have no impact on his presidency, and frankly, that he doesn't even know what is in it.

So on what basis do Democrats and their feckless media allies continue to try to tie this albatross around The Donald's neck? Only through the worst kind of half-truths and prevarications our democratic system has to offer.

JD Vance wrote the forward! Trump's critics insist, and he did, in 2022, not only long before anyone thought he would be Trump's vice presidential nominee, but at a time when many people thought Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, not Trump, would be the presidential nominee.

Then we are told that dozens of former Trump officials are involved with the project, and yes, Heritage is a think tank, it doesn't have a college draft or use Indeed dot com to hire, it is staffed with, gasp, former political policy officials.

You can't shake a stick at liberal think tanks like Center for American Progress without pointing at a former Obama or Biden staffers, but nobody says Kamala Harris is planning to hand over the keys of the federal government to them.

No, Trump's alleged connection and fealty to Project 2025 is simply a flat out lie, and probably the best argument why he should not accept a second debate with Kamala Harris, especially on CNN which pushes this particular prevarication daily.

In the first debate, when Harris brought up the nonsense claims about Trump and the project, neither of the moderators broke in to fact-check it, as they did over and over and over with Trump. It is almost as though the ABC anchors were in on it.

This desperate and constant lying about Project 2025 from the Harris campaign and the other Harris campaign known as the liberal press has come about precisely because Harris is incapable of making a positive argument for her candidacy.

Fighting price gouging fell flat. On a host of issues, she refuses to say where she stands, except that it is closer to the center than where she used to stand, and she refuses to do serious interviews to clarify her positions.

So, what does that leave in the campaign arsenal? Basically, vice presidential nominee Tim Walz fixing old cars while lying about Project 2025.

Sadly, from what I can tell in my travels and conversations it is working, something that rankles Gen X Joe who is voting for Trump. ""It's just like the white supremacists, and everything else,"" he told me, ""Trump denounces it over and over and it's never good enough.""

It was Mark Twain who said that a lie travels the world before the truth can get its pants on. If so, the Project 2025 is the heart print boxers shorts of the 2024 election, and time is running out to clothe the issue in the truth."
Sean O'Malley Isn't Handling His Loss To Merab Dvalishvili Well,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2024/09/22/sean-omalley-isnt-handling-his-loss-to-merab-dvalishvili-well/,2024-09-22T15:39:58Z,"Sean O'Malley lost his UFC men's bantamweight championship to Merab Dvalishvili in the main event of Noche UFC on Saturday, September 14, at The Sphere in Las Vegas, and he's not handling the defeat well.

Since losing, O'Malley has gone from gracious to graceless.

Before we delve into the specifics of O'Malley's post-loss behavior, it's essential to look at the definitions of the terms I used to describe O'Malley's behavior since Noche UFC.

A gracious loser, which is what O'Malley was for the first 24 hours after losing to Dvalishvili, is defined this way by Collins Dictionary and Thought.is: Someone who accepts defeat with dignity and shows humility and respect for their opponent. They acknowledge the effort and skill of the winner without bitterness or resentment. A gracious loser maintains composure, congratulates the winner, and looks back on the competition as an opportunity for growth and learning.

Immediately after the loss, O'Malley was the poster boy for this definition. He clapped as he stood with referee Herb Dean and Dvalishvili while Bruce Buffer read the official result of the new champion's unanimous decision victory.

This behavior has become the signature animations of a fighter who knows they were just beaten fair and square, and that the opponent was the better man or woman that night.

O'Malley took to social media less than an hour after losing the fight and told his followers, ""I overpromised and underdelivered.""

On his podcast with his coach Tim Welch, Timbo, and Suga, O'Malley expressed regrets about his performance and kept interrupting his commentary by saying,"" f###,"" as the reality of the loss appeared to set in.

He admitted that immediately after the fight, he didn't get much time to mourn the loss of his title as he and his team had a memorable after-party. O'Malley also announced he wouldn't return to the Octagon for 8-12 months while he recovered, but he didn't give a reason initially.

Shortly after his podcast episode was live and went viral, things began to change with O'Malley's narrative. And this was the genesis of the graceless loser persona. Merriam-Webster and Cambridge Dictionary define a graceless loser as someone who does not handle defeat with dignity or respect.

Instead of accepting the loss gracefully, they may make excuses, blame others, or show disrespect toward the winner. A graceless loser will display negative behaviors such as bitterness, resentment, or a lack of sportsmanship. A graceless loser also lacks humility and composure during and after defeat.

O'Malley was on a phone call during a live stream with popular streamer Adin Ross, and he revealed he needed surgery to repair a torn labrum, which was why he would be out of action for such an extended period.

While O'Malley didn't directly call this an excuse, it sounds like one, and it was interpreted by many people, including UFC CEO Dana White, as a reason for his flat performance against Dvalishvili.

Unfortunately, things went further downhill from there. On September 16, O'Malley posted on X almost playfully suggesting the fight's result had been overturned.

He said: ""Suga State athletic commission BREAKING NEWS: Suga won 2 of the last 3 rounds!! Fight Over turned. Suga won!""

At this point, according to his social media, he had not watched the fight back. On September 19, O'Malley posted he was ""rewatching the fight.""

Post after post, O'Malley was scoring the rounds up through the fifth.

Unsurprisingly, O'Malley determined he had won three of the five rounds and should still be the champion. After scoring, O'Malley took to X's Spaces to record audio and dispute fans who suggested the official result was correct.

The rant continued throughout the day, with O'Malley even posting videos of himself saying goodbye to the championship belt, but seconds later, he reintroduced himself to the title.

O'Malley got a co-signor for his new narrative from The MMA Guru, who posted a video breaking down how O'Malley was ""robbed.""

Casual MMA also joined the list of people who agreed O'Malley ""has a case"" that he won three rounds.

All of this wreaks of elements of being a graceless loser in defeat. O'Malley disrespects Dvalishvili's efforts, blaming the judges and the commentators for creating a false narrative.

O'Malley is still referring to himself as ""undefeated"" completely ignoring his loss to Marlon Vera in August 2020. Vera finished O'Malley from top position after O'Malley suffered a leg injury during the fight.

I watched the fight with Dvalishvili live and have covered combat sports for 17 years. I've watched combat sports for over 40 years and have watched and analyzed it critically for 30 years. Dvalishvili won the fight. It was not a domination, but he won three rounds to two.

The case of O'Malley winning the first round is the weakest point of his argument.

In addition to trusting my eyes, Dvalishvili outlanded O'Malley 16-14 in significant strikes and 25 to 14 in total strikes while securing two takedowns. If O'Malley gets that round with that statistical disparity, everyone in their right mind is screaming that Dvalishvili was the one who was robbed.

Even without the stat review, this approach from O'Malley just feels wrong. Even if he did watch the fight back and feel better about his performance than he did at first, having already conceded defeat publicly, it feels strange and less than authentic to make a 180-degree turn.

This approach comes off like the actions of a fighter who has gotten so used to winning and being praised and celebrated that they have the toughest time accepting that things didn't go their way on a grand stage against a rival they thought themselves superior.

The optics are bad, and it feels like a high-profile, 2024 version of saving face.

O'Malley is a good fighter who has the opportunity to reflect, improve his takedown defense, and become more acquainted with a tough, freestyle fighter with an A+ grappling game. If he can do that, he could win a rematch with Dvalishvili.

As it is, it seems like he's fighting the rematch on social media and not waiting for his opportunity to settle the score in the Octagon, as he did with Vera."
"Opinion | The checkered origins of the law at the center of Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' prosecution",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/sean-diddy-combs-charged-mann-act-freak-offs-rcna172076,2024-09-22T12:51:30Z,"Originally motivated by xenophobia, racism and a way to punish ""immoral"" sex, the Mann Act has since been amended -- and remains a useful federal tool.

Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was arrested on Monday and charged with racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. Each is a serious federal crime, and the powerful hip-hop mogul is facing very serious prison time if convicted. Notably, the third count in Combs' indictment comes from a federal law dating back to 1910. It's known today as the Mann Act. Federal prosecutors don't often use the law's other name, and for good reason. The Mann Act is also known as the ""White Slave Traffic Act.""

Many laws have been passed because of outdated -- or simply racist -- societal attitudes. Sometimes, those laws stick around for a surprisingly long time. It wasn't until 1967 that the Supreme Court struck down anti-miscegenation laws outlawing interracial marriage. (And Alabama kept its law on the state books until 2000, even though it was no longer constitutional.) Similarly, laws mandating segregation were struck down across the country when modern sensibilities recognized them as unjust.

But not the Mann Act. Originally motivated by xenophobia, racism and politicians looking for ways to punish consensual ""immoral"" sex, the law remains a federal tool used to prosecute Combs and many others, including rapper R. Kelly.

While the text of the White Slave Traffic Act doesn't exclusively protect white women, the statute was ""born out of a hysteria"" in the early 1900s ""that 'white slavers' were preying upon young women -- coercing them into prostitution through threats, intimidation, and force."" Writing in the Columbia Human Rights Law Review, sex worker activist Lorelei Lee argues the ""prototypical 'white slave' of early 1900s discourse was a young white girl from a rural area who was lured into prostitution after moving to an urban center and thus being separated from the supervision of her family.""

The sponsors of the Mann Act defined the white slave trade as ""the business of securing white women and girls and of selling them outright, or of exploiting them for immoral purposes."" Although the text of the law doesn't single out white women for protection, the legislative history demonstrates a retrograde motive to protect white women from ""interracial sex.""

The text of the law as originally passed in 1910 criminalized knowingly transporting a woman in interstate commerce ""for the purpose of prostitution,"" but also for the purpose of ""debauchery, or any other immoral purpose."" As one can imagine, a lot more purposes were considered ""immoral"" in 1910, and potentially included -- according to the Supreme Court in 1917 -- an ""interstate trip for the purpose of a sexual affair between two consenting adults.""

Several scandalous prosecutions followed. Arguably the most infamous was the prosecution of the first African American heavyweight boxing champion, Jack Johnson. The federal government prosecuted Johnson under the White Slave Traffic Act for transporting a white woman named Belle Schreiber across state lines. This, despite the fact that Schreiber was an adult and testified that she had consented to the trip.

Johnson was convicted, only to be pardoned posthumously over a century later in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump. (Johnson wasn't the only high-profile man, Black or white, targeted by federal prosecutors, though. Another famous prosecution was that of Frank Lloyd Wright, accused of transporting a mistress from Wisconsin to Minnesota.)

The ""immoral purposes"" clause remained in the Mann Act for 75 years, until 1986, when Congress amended the statute to remove it, and also to make the statute gender neutral. In its modern incarnation, it applies only when the transportation of the person was for illegal sexual activity -- in Combs' case, prostitution.

Johnson likely could not be prosecuted under the Mann Act today. However, as in 1910, the victim's consent is still not a defense. Diddy's defense will likely try to demonstrate that everyone at the alleged ""freak offs"" and sex parties prosecutors have described in sometimes intense detail were there willingly. But even if that assertion is proven true, it might not be enough to save him.

Two things are probably true: First, seasoned federal prosecutors are likely quite aware of the checkered history of the Mann Act, including its alternate name. Second, you'll never hear any of them call it that. And that's a good thing. The revised version of the Mann Act has utility in the modern era. Human trafficking is a legitimate concern in 2024, as opposed to the manufactured ""white girl slavery"" panic of the early 1900s that inspired the original act. Perhaps this is a law that truly can be repurposed, despite its questionable origins."
"In one key swing state, both parties are courting Black men",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/21/nx-s1-4855917/black-men-voters-2024-election-swing-state-north-carolina,2024-09-22T12:04:29Z,"Phillip Barker, in the hydroponic growhouse on Olusanya Farm LLC, which he owns with his wife in Oxford, N.C. Melissa Gray/NPR hide caption

In his 76 years, Phillip Barker has seen many changes in his home state of North Carolina: desegregation, fewer farmers -- and a less predictable climate. But, one thing has not changed for him: his commitment to voting.

As a young man, his mother told him, ""you gonna vote.""

""She didn't tell us who to vote for, but she made sure we understood that we had one vote and exercised that. I don't miss a vote,"" Barker said standing alongside some of the crops on his organic vegetable farm in Oxford, N.C.

Barker and other Black men in North Carolina -- one of seven swing states -- could play a critical role in this year's presidential election. Polls show both candidates in an extremely tight race. And both parties are making specific appeals to voters like Barker. Democrats are touting policies that benefit Black men, and reminding them of former President Trump's comments about race and about the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va. Republicans are sending Black GOP lawmakers to talk with Black men. They have also tried relating Trump's felony convictions to Black men -- something Phillip Barker rejects. ""Who wants felonies? Black people don't want them!""

As a Black farmer, Barker says he is no stranger to discrimination. He faced years ago when applying for government loan programs.

""When you walk into an office and you realize you're discriminated against when you get to the door, you might really enjoy what you're going in there for, but it makes it miserable by the time you come out,"" Barker said.

It took years of lawsuits, but Congress approved more than $2 billion to compensate farmers who were discriminated against by the USDA farm loan program. Compensation is welcome, says Barker, but he keeps thinking about the farmers who died before they could get it.

For this year's election, Barker points to former President Donald Trump's record in office, with big corporations getting huge tax cuts and government subsidies for big farmers, not small independent ones like himself.

""I don't know what farmers should vote for him. He didn't take care of any farmers,"" Barker said.

Barker has voted mostly for Democrats, but he says he votes for the candidate, not the party. He is not voting for Mark Robinson, the Trump-endorsed GOP candidate for governor, who is Black and has a history of provocative comments about the Holocaust, women, even school shooting victims. ""He's not morally sound,"" says Barker.

Barker is supporting Vice President Harris -- a potentially historic vote for the country's first Black woman president. ""She brings the experience. I think she have the morals and the heart,"" Barker said.

In 2020, according to exit polls - Black men made up about 9% of North Carolina's turnout, nearly half a million votes. More than 90% of them voted for Joe Biden. But this year, polls show Democrats slipping -- not with Barker's generation, but with younger Black men. The economy is a big reason.

""You used to be able to get a box of chicken wings for 60 bucks maybe 50,"" Ian Burris, owner of the Raleigh-based restaurant The Dankery, says. ""Now we're sitting at $130.""

Burris, 28, has been building his business for 9 years -- from his parents' garage to two restaurants in the city.

He says it's rising costs that make him uneasy. But, as a Black man, those concerns pale in comparison to his experiences during Trump administration.

""There was a lot of racial tension. That was too uncomfortable for me to care about if I'm paying a little bit more in taxes,"" Burris says. ""I felt like someone could get away with doing something to me.""

For Burris, the choice this year is less about policy and more about personality.

""With Trump, it's hard to take him as a serious politician,"" Burris says. ""I just think that role should be a serious individual, and I think Harris has the career that says 'serious politician.' ""

That lack of seriousness could cost the GOP the election, if enough young Black voters feel like Burris.

""There's just a lot of cities that are Republican ran, or in Republican states that I admire how things are going,"" Burris says. ""Some of them are cleaner. Businesses are doing well. The cost of living is a bit cheaper. I do like that idea that you can live in a nice city that has restaurants and things to do and have a decent space and you're not breaking your arm and leg for that. That would be cool to see as an entire country.""

Still, Harris has not sealed the deal with Burris. He says he's still looking closely at her policy positions and weighing whether he will vote for the vice president."
Madonna Reaches A Special Milestone With One Of Her Oldest Albums,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2024/09/22/madonna-reaches-a-special-milestone-with-one-of-her-oldest-albums/,2024-09-22T12:02:13Z,"2024 has turned out to be the year of ""Like a Prayer,"" which nobody could have predicted just a few months ago. The beloved Madonna tune became hugely popular once again, and now the album it's featured on has followed suit.

The Like a Prayer full-length debuts on a pair of Billboard charts this week, decades after it was first released. The title is a welcome new win for Madonna on both tallies, and it even helps her reach a special milestone on one of them.

Like a Prayer launches at No. 21 on this week's Vinyl Albums chart. The tally ranks the bestselling projects on just that one format across the country, and for the first time ever, Madonna's bestseller performed well enough in that one arena to appear on the list.

Madonna has now sent 10 different studio efforts to Billboard's vinyl list, including her new smash. That might seem like a fairly low number for a woman who has accrued nine No. 1s on the Billboard 200, but it's important to remember that vinyl was not a popular format for much of the superstar's career. Wax records fell out of favor for many years, and thus, her catalog didn't perform especially well in that arena -- if they were even made available to purchase on vinyl in the first place.

Throughout her career, Madonna has scored just a single No. 1 on the Vinyl Albums chart. In 2022, Finally Enough Love, her latest greatest hits compilation, debuted atop the tally. That project is also the musician's only title to spend more than one frame on the roster.

Madonna has racked up half a dozen top 10s on the vinyl-only list. In addition to Finally Enough Love, she's reached the competitive region with all of the following releases: Rebel Heart (No. 2), Madame X (No. 4), the Like A Virgin & Other Big Hits! EP (No. 5), MDNA (No. 7), and The Immaculate Collection (No. 9).

Like a Prayer surged in popularity and debuted on the tally after it was re-released not long ago. Madonna made the album available on silver vinyl, and several thousand fans purchased a copy once it dropped. Luminate reports that the title sold a little more than 2,000 copies last frame.

The Like a Prayer album is popular once again thanks to more than its new vinyl edition. The lead single from the set was featured in the movie Deadpool & Wolverine, which turned out to be a summer blockbuster. The song became a bestseller once more and charted all around the world, and a few weeks later, the full-length did the same."

The first edition of tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons was released 50 years ago this year.

Since then, the game's publisher, Wizards of the Coast, estimates that over 50 million people have played.

And it's changed a lot since 1974. It was a pastime of nerds in the '80s and in part fueled the ""Satanic Panic,"" a time when concerned parents and news outlets linked the game teen killings and witchcraft.

It's become more mainstream after featuring in Netflix's hit series Stranger Things. It also made its way to the big screen multiple times since 2000, most recently with 2023's Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves.

During the pandemic, it became a popular way for friends to stay connected through virtual campaigns held on Zoom or on 'virtual tabletop' websites like Roll20. NBC reported that D&D product sales rose 33% in 2020.

That momentum continued after lockdown into 2023, as Baldur's Gate 3, a video game based on D&D, exploded in popularity, reaching over half a million concurrent players at its peak in September of 2023. It went on to win Game of the Year.

Throughout the decades, it's remained as a way for its most loyal players to socialize with friends and escape to faraway lands. A few weeks ago, we asked readers and listeners to tell us what role the game has played in their lives.

Nearly 1,000 of you shared your passion for the game. Here are five of your stories.

Memorializing loved ones

James Rubis and his wife Rena played D&D together throughout their relationship. When their daughter Gwen was born in 2003, they switched to online play to save time. As Gwen grew up, she became interested in playing with her parents. One day, Rena was playing an online game and encountered a Beholder - a floating, spherical monster with tentacles that have eyes on their ends. ""My daughter saw that, and she went back to her room, and drew a picture of it and gave it to my wife - we still have it hanging on the wall in our spare room,"" Rubis said.

The three of them started playing together as a family, in one-off games from Adventure in a Box, a monthly subscription service. ""That was our monthly family time,"" Rubis said. ""We'd play 6 to 8 hours over the weekend once a month.""

In June of 2019, Gwen was killed in an accident while visiting family in California. Two weeks later, the monthly Dungeon in a Box arrived at Rubis' house. ""When I got that, it was like 'Man, we're not gonna get to do this again"", he said. He sent an email to the Dungeon in a Box customer service team thanking them for the memories their service allowed them. The co-founder responded, asking if they could honor Gwen's memory in an upcoming campaign.

Gwen's character was included in the final chapter of a long sequence of adventures, which was sent to Rubis' home. ""I started going through the book, I found it, it's been like 6 - 8 months since she had passed away, and I lost it, I just started crying. Because everything they put in there was her story, and how she acted,"" he said. ""She would've loved it.""

Bridging generations

Michael McKenna was introduced to D&D as a kid, when his older brother let him play with his friends. He rediscovered the game in 2017 through Critical Role, a web series where professional voice-actors play D&D in real time. His child Julius wanted to play the game, so Michael put his experience as a high school English teacher to use and wrote a one-on-one campaign for the two of them - and catered to the needs of Julius, who is transgender and has been diagnosed with autism.

""Back then, he had a lot of problems expressing himself,"" McKenna said, ""but they really loved [D&D]"". The seemingly infinite set of directions to take the campaign started out overwhelming. Michael would ask Julius how his character Greta felt, or how she would react to a situation. ""At first, Julius was like I don't know, so we'd give options. Eventually, it became 'this is what she's doing', and then it became 'this is what I, Julius, am doing',"" McKenna recounted

""We caught him at 1:30 in the morning, with a flashlight in their bed, and their Chromebook, writing fiction about their D&D character,"" McKenna recalled and laughed.""And it's like you should go to bed responsibly, but it was so great that they were doing that."" At first, Julius kept the contents of the writing to himself, but he began to open up, eventually sharing the game with friends. ""They've been more comfortable in situations and activities because of exploring things in D&D. They're more assertive.""

Connecting cultures across borders

Khaver Siddiqi grew up in Karachi, Pakistan. The country has a Sunni Muslim majority, and making friends in other denominations was rare. Siddiqi began playing D&D in 1997, when a friend returned from a trip to England with a copy of the 2nd Edition box set. ""We poured over the three books religiously every weekend,"" Siddiqi told us ""It was truly immersive for us as Pakistani teenagers, being transported to a place completely different from ours.""

Through his immersion in the world of D&D, he became curious about the real-world events and cultures that inspired the campaigns he played. ""You go and you read and you realize, 'Wow, other cultures have this fascinating history and mythology,'"" he said. That curiosity then extended back to his view of his own culture, which he could study with a broader perspective. ""It gave me a sense of purpose, an anchor in life to be like 'This is my identity'.""

Siddiqi found community through the game, adding players from the Shia Muslim minority to his D&D party. Playing kept him and the rest of his friends grounded and connected through the country's political strikes, government changes, and corruption. ""There was chaos all around us at some point or another, whether it was political or otherwise. But every Friday night we would get together and play. It would drag into the early hours of Saturday morning or night,"" he said.

Siddiqi hopes that the worlds in D&D's mythology will look more like where he grew up and include facets of his culture. He recalls how important representation has been for his family, ""Like Miss Marvel - I have a daughter who looks up to her because she's like 'oh yeah, she's Pakistani-American,' that's what was missing for me in D&D when I was growing up. It was all these Euro-centric settings.""

Helping people discover themselves

Abby Morrione Matz, a transgender woman, first chose to play a female character during her first big D&D campaign in 2000. ""At this point in my life, I was still trying to get a sense of who I was gender and sexuality-wise. I decided to use it as a platform to try out being a girl in front of my friends,"" she said. ""I really got to explore myself, as an elf, a wizard, but as a woman for the first time.""

Creating the character, she was inspired by the Lord of the Rings - a text that inspired the world of D&D. ""I fell in love with Éowyn,"" she described, ""I was like 'oh my god, she's so cool, I want to play someone like her,' but I also really liked Gandalf, so I did a wizard, I combined the two.""

Matz' identity has been generally accepted throughout her D&D community. She found a community looking to start a group for women only. ""I contacted [the leader] like 'how do you feel about trans women?' and she's like 'I'll see you on Wednesday.' We've built a humongous community since then, I've met some of my absolute best friends through this game.""

Platform for mental health and healing

In 2021, Stacia Seaman found her partner Reese in cardiac arrest in her home. ""She wasn't breathing,"" Seaman said. ""Her heart wasn't beating. I had to do CPR on her while I waited for the EMTs to arrive."" She had suffered a reaction to an antibiotic and was left with mental and physical impairment due to lack of oxygen in her brain.

As Reese slowly recovered, Seaman began slowly introducing new activities. ""We started with games,"" she said. ""We played Go Fish, we played Rummy, we played dominoes, and then she was able to come home."" Then, they reintroduced the game both had played throughout their lives: D&D.

They began by building a D&D Lego set that came with a playable adventure. ""[Reese] took one look at that and said 'When are we going to start playing again?'"" Seaman said, ""I was thinking we're not."" But she decided to slowly help Reese begin playing.

They created a character to play together, and Seaman reached out to the leader of a game for them to join, and described Reese's situation. They welcomed the couple. ""That's one of the things I love about our gaming community: We get young kids, people with autism, and you just work with it,"" Seaman said.

Seaman sees the game as benefitting Reese's recovery.

""It's therapeutic,"" she said. ""It helps her with fine motor control because she's rolling dice, it's helping her cognitively because she's in groups again. She's just a happier person again. She'll never be who she was, but she's a lot more herself."""
"Mike Huckabee has role in new 'God's Not Dead' film, reveals why people of faith can support Trump",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/mike-huckabee-role-new-gods-not-dead-film-reveals-people-faith-can-support-trump,2024-09-22T11:07:21Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee calls the newest installment of the ""God's Not Dead"" film series, ""In God We Trust,"" a story made for this moment in history.

He says the new film is a little like ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" -- the Jimmy Stewart classic -- updated to this modern age when faith in God is not as publicly proclaimed and religious freedom totters in the wake of woke political agendas.

The film invokes Ronald Reagan in his speech more than 40 years ago before the Ecumenical Prayer Breakfast in Dallas, Texas.

FAITH LEADER SAYS PARENTS 'SHOULD NOT TRUST THE WORLD TO TEACH THEIR KIDS ABOUT GOD'

At that event, he said, ""Without God, there is no virtue, because there's no prompting of the conscience.""

And ""without God, democracy will not and cannot long endure.""

The film stars David A. R. White, Ray Wise, Dean Cain, Charlene Tilton, Scott Baio and others. Huckabee plays himself in the film. The lead character is a guest on his talk show.

On a recent episode of the ""Lighthouse Faith"" podcast, he joked about getting his Oscar speech ready.

Said Huckabee, ""I'm, you know, the best supporting actor for a role that nobody will remember!""

But in all seriousness, he said it is a powerful film that ""couldn't be more timely.""

Huckabee said Christians are being maligned and chastised for not keeping their faith a private affair.

It's about a congressional campaign between a career politician and a Christian minister who's suddenly thrust into a political battle when he's called upon to be the opposing candidate in a special election just four weeks away.

It takes head-on the issues of faith in the public square, religious freedom and accusations of Christian nationalism. They are today the fuel of vitriolic debates and cultural clashes.

Huckabee said Christians are being maligned and chastised for not keeping their faith a private affair, and they're accused of wanting to impose their values on the rest of the country.

But, said Huckabee, ""When a person says these people want to impose their values, I want to say: Doesn't the left want to impose their values? Yes.""

He added, ""Politics is ultimately about winning an election so that your policies, those things that you hold dear, will become a part of the culture and a part of government. But I don't think it's a faith component. It is a moral component that a lot of Christians would like -- so that a child who's eight years old is not [put near] pornography at his school.""

Bestselling Christian author Lisa Bevere knows of what Huckabee speaks. A few years ago, she fought against her 14-year-old son's school after the English teacher assigned required reading that she said was not appropriate.

The film is meant to do more than embolden Christians to get involved in their communities.

Bevere shared on an episode of ""Lighthouse Faith"" podcast that in the book, ""They were talking about pornography and masturbation. And I was like, what in the -- ? What does this have to do with English literature?""

MISSOURI JESUIT SAYS JESUS REVEALS THE 'BIG PICTURE' WHEN IT COMES TO FOLLOWING GOD'S LAW

Bevere posted some passages from the book on her social media page and stirred up hundreds of parents, who demanded the book be dropped from the school's curriculum -- which it did.

The film, though, is meant to do more than embolden Christians to get involved in their communities.

It's also a clarion call to inspire the millions who sat out the last election, to make their voices heard not just at the box office but at the ballot box on Nov. 5.

Said Huckabee, ""It is a reminder that 40 million Christians in America did not vote in the last presidential election. Forty million ... But a lot of those people think it doesn't really matter. 'My vote's unimportant.' Well, that's not true.""

And now, after the second assassination attempt on Trump's life, Huckabee is taking aim at the left's rhetoric.

NEW 'GOD'S NOT DEAD' FILM INSPIRES CHRISTIANS TO MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD AT BALLOT BOX

He told Fox News, ""One would think that Democrats would stop calling him a 'threat to democracy,' which only incites violent and threatening behavior. But instead, there is no shame in the continued talk from media hosts all the way to the White House in continuing to essentially blame Trump for his own near-assassinations.""

""He doesn't want to have the government telling us what we can think, what we can preach, what we can say, what we can pray.""

He added, ""This is beyond outrageous.""

An ordained minister, Huckabee knows that he and other evangelicals have taken a lot of heat for backing Trump. Eighty percent of White evangelicals voted for Trump in 2016.

It was Huckabee who gathered about 1,200 pastors together before the presidential election for a meet-and-greet with Trump to convince them to support him.

What he said then is still true today, he asserted.

Said Huckabee, ""I don't pretend that Trump is one of us as an evangelical. I don't ... And my introduction [to the pastors] was this: 'Look, Donald Trump isn't one of us. He's probably not going to be sitting in the front row of your church this Sunday ... So let's not kid ourselves.'""

But Huckabee said the Trump positives outweigh the negatives.

""He has respect for us [evangelicals], and he doesn't want to have the government telling us what we can think, what we can preach, what we can say, what we can pray. That's all I want out of government.""

Huckabee also said Trump is the most pro-life presidential candidate.

However, in this campaign cycle, Trump is being criticized by some pro-life leaders for shifting on the issue and even accusing him of abandoning the pro-life cause.

At this year's Republican National Convention, the platform committee voted to remove a right-to-life plank, prompting Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, to issue a minority report pushing back against the RNC platform.

Other leaders, such as retired U.S. Navy officer Quinn Skinner, who now works for a pregnancy help organization, lamented in an op-ed that ""there is no national political party that champions the sanctity of life.""

Still, said Huckabee, Trump's presence on the global stage is what America needs now.

Huckabee's support of Israel is part biblical and part political.

""His position on Israel has been the most remarkable of any American president. Period. So for issues that are non-negotiable for me, it's easy to be supportive.""

JEWISH SOLDIER, WOUNDED IN WAR, MEMORIALIZES YOUNG HOLOCAUST HERO BY PLAYING HIS VIOLIN

Huckabee had plans to travel to Israel this month. Since 1973, he's visited the Jewish state about 100 times, sometimes on his own, at other times taking groups with him. He was there not long after Oct. 7 last year, after the Hamas attack, he said.

""I was having lunch in a restaurant in Tel Aviv, and the sirens went off. So, we had to go to the bomb shelter. And as we got there, you could hear the Iron Dome intercept a rocket right above our heads.""

Huckabee's support of Israel is part biblical and part political.

ISRAELI SOLDIER GRAVELY INJURED IN OCT. 7 TERROR ATTACK FINDS NEW FAITH, OFFERS HOPE TO OTHERS

As a geopolitical example, he imagined a scenario closer to home, saying, ""If somebody came across the border in Buffalo, New York, or El Paso, Texas, and slaughtered 1,200 people, including putting babies in ovens, slicing the womb of a pregnant woman in front of her children, violently raping women in front of their families -- do you think Americans would say, 'I just hope we can get a ceasefire?'""

Instead, said Huckabee, ""We'd be wanting to absolutely annihilate whatever the force was behind that. So Israel has been far more restrained than I think America would have been in a similar circumstance.""

There is the biblical reason for backing Israel, however.

Huckabee said, ""I look at Genesis 12: 'Those who bless Israel will be blessed. Those who curse Israel will be cursed.' Look, I'm a simple guy. When I read it that way, I say I'd rather be blessed than cursed. I'm going to stand with Israel.""

Huckabee, who has mounted two presidential campaigns, is adamant that he's through with running for higher office. ""I did it twice. I loved it, had a great time.""

Now content to be the father of a politician -- Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Rogers -- Huckabee said, ""You know, there comes a moment. You say, I gave it my best shot. Other people now will take up the mantle, and I will help them.""

"NC rallygoers 'praying' that Trump wins, slam Dem rhetoric calling him a 'threat' after assassination attempts",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nc-rallygoers-trump-dem-rhetoric-calling-threat-after-assassination-attempts,2024-09-22T10:09:53Z,"WILMINGTON, N.C. -- Fired-up attendees at former President Trump's North Carolina rally are ""praying that he wins"" in November, explaining that they are infuriated over Democratic rhetoric regarding the GOP nominee.

Trump held an outdoor campaign rally in North Carolina on Saturday - a battleground state that the Republican nominee narrowly won in the 2020 presidential race.

Rallygoers spoke with Fox News Digital about why they showed up to Saturday's event, and what their thoughts on the current state of the 2024 election.

""We need Trump to save this country,"" Sharron from New Bern, North Carolina, told Fox News Digital.

One individual, Richard, told Fox that he was at the rally to ""get this world straightened back out"" and elect Trump in 2024.

Several attendees expressed uncertainty about the fairness of the 2024 election. Asked whether they think it will be fair, one individual said ""definitely not.""

""Yes, I hope so,"" one woman, Tammy, told Fox News Digital.

""I absolutely do not,"" another attendee told Fox. ""It infuriates me to the fact that I'm almost in tears. I'm so passionate about it.""

""If he doesn't get in, we are gonna to lose everything,"" she added. ""What they put this man through is despicable, and I just pray for him every day.""

Since July, two individuals have attempted to assassinate Trump - one during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and the other allegedly on a golf course in Florida.

Several rallygoers said they believe Democratic rhetoric labeling Trump a ""threat"" contributed to the attempts on his life.

""I absolutely think its appalling that they continue to do that,"" one attendee said. ""The day after, they were still making false claims about him, saying he's a threat to democracy, the campaigns were full of lies and I just can't fathom how anyone can support this other administration.""

Man dies in freak accident involving frozen hamburgers: 'Difficult to hear',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/man-dies-freak-accident-involving-frozen-hamburgers-difficult-hear,2024-09-22T10:06:08Z,"British officials recently determined the shocking and tragic way that a Welsh man died last year.

The Western Telegraph reported that Barry Griffiths, 57, died after accidentally knifing himself while separating frozen burgers in June 2023. Officials announced the results of the investigation at a coroner's court hearing on Monday.

Griffiths, a resident of Llandrindod Wells, had been trying to separate the frozen burgers with a knife when he stabbed himself in the stomach. During Monday's hearing, coroner Patricia Morgan said Griffiths had reduced mobility in one of his arms after a stroke, which likely led to the freak accident.

Tragically, Griffiths' body remained in his apartment for several days after his death. Morgan noted that Griffiths ""[had a] relatively private life with limited contact with others,"" which was why it took over a week for police to conduct a wellness check.

WOMAN LEFT WITH KIDNEY DAMAGE AFTER VISITING HAIR SALON

Griffiths' body was found in his bed on July 4, 2023. According to the Western Telegraph, his phone was last active on June 23, and his laptop was used on June 24.

Griffiths also suffered from atherosclerosis, which meant that his arteries were clogged with plaque. That condition, which restricted blood flow to his heart, also contributed to his death, according to Morgan.

Officials initially thought that his death might be a suicide or murder. According to Deputy Chief Inspector Jonathan Rees, officials eventually came to the conclusion that the cause of death was ""an accident solely involving Mr. Griffiths.""

""The bottom drawer of the freezer had been left open and pulled forward in a position to access food items,"" Rees explained, per the Western Telegraph. ""On the work surface in the kitchen adjacent to the fridge freezer were two uncooked burgers, a knife and a tea towel.""

""The wound to the abdomen would have been approximately the height of the work surface,"" he added. ""My hypothesis at that stage was that Mr Griffiths was attempting to separate frozen burgers using a knife.""

During the hearing, Morgan told Griffiths' family members that she understood that the ""evidence is difficult to hear and traumatic.""

""Thank you for your patience while the investigation was ongoing,"" Morgan was quoted as saying. ""I express my condolences at this difficult time.""

Princess Diana's surprise Billy Joel performance was early sign of doomed marriage: author,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/princess-dianas-surprise-billy-joel-performance-early-sign-doomed-marriage-author,2024-09-22T08:20:41Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

King Charles was less than impressed by Princess Diana's surprise for him.

In December 1985, the Princess of Wales shocked her husband - and the world - when she danced to Billy Joel's ""Uptown Girl"" at the Royal Opera House in London. She was joined by her friend, acclaimed dancer Wayne Sleep.

But the three-minute routine, which involved the princess sashaying in a slinky gown with no stockings, didn't seem to move Prince Charles.

PRINCESS DIANA 'RIPPED THE CORSET OUT' OF HER MET GALA DRESS, REFUSED TO WEAR PINK, DESIGNER CLAIMS

""She wanted Charles to approve of it,"" Diana's ballet teacher, Anne Allan, told Fox News Digital. ""When we met him afterward, he did smile and say, 'Well done, darling.' But [he] immediately went on to doing something else. And when you've come offstage and your adrenaline is pumping ... you just want somebody to tell you that you're doing all right.""

Allan has written a new book, ""Dancing with Diana: A Memoir,"" which details how she ended up working with and befriending the late British royal. The dance routine and its aftermath were immortalized in Season 4 of ""The Crown"" on Netflix.

""Perhaps he's a man that doesn't like surprises,"" Allan explained about Charles. ""Firstly, not everybody does. Secondly, I'm not too sure what he thought about his wife wearing a slinky dress, dancing on stage showing her whole body, and showing her being. I'm not quite sure whether he thought it was the appropriate thing for Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales.""

""I'm not too sure what he thought about his wife wearing a slinky dress, dancing on stage showing her whole body, and showing her being.""

-- Anne Allan

Looking back, Allan believed that Diana was hoping to light a spark in her marriage.

""She loved Charles so much,"" said Allan. ""She just wanted to bring romance into her life, because that's what she thought it should be. And I know that they had many, many happy times together. . . . She would arrange a nice night . . . and Charles occasionally would do that, too. But he was probably a bit more pragmatic as a person.""

""She did love romance,"" Allan shared. ""I think she was much more able to see the possibility of how romance should be. I'm not sure if that was how Charles was. She loved holding hands, she loved having a cuddle. She was a very affectionate person. It meant a lot to her to have that in her life.""

Diana turned to her love of dance as she navigated royal life - and a marriage that quickly crumbled in the public eye. According to the book, Allan gave the princess hundreds of secret one-hour ballet lessons from 1981 to 1989.

They were practicing in the studio one day when Diana told her she wanted to see herself dancing on stage. She also wanted the performance filmed.

""It was wonderfully innocent,"" said Allan. ""Wayne came to set the number, because he is a wonderful choreographer. And immediately, the bond between them was just electric. They both had an absolute wicked sense of humor. Trying to get them to get down to work was quite something.""

""They both knew Diana is beautifully tall, Wayne is short,"" said Allan. ""He said, 'Oh, let's use the difference in height.' He came up with this wonderful choreography, which is partly the story of the lyrics.""

Diana wanted to keep the routine a surprise for her husband. The trio worked together to keep the performance under wraps. In the end, Sleep announced that he would be doing a special performance in time for the holidays. No one suspected that Diana would be his dancing partner.

Allan said she had been ""nervous"" about a wardrobe malfunction.

""The biggest worry for me was that she'd chosen to wear heeled shoes,"" said Allan. ""I was so terrified we'd have a malfunction with either the wardrobe or the shoes. In between rehearsals, I ran home, came up with these elastics, and said, 'Listen, I think we should wear them just in case that shoe falls off.' She thought it was a great idea.

""I put pancake [makeup] on them so they would match the tone of the tights. In the end, she didn't wear tights. . . . I felt it would be all right because I didn't think for one minute there would be photographers there. And lo and behold . . . we got the photographs the next day. All I could see was these elastics on her shoes.""

""[But] it was her idea, her design, her inventiveness of wanting to show herself dancing,"" Allan added.

In the book, Allan wrote that she ""sensed disapproval"" from Charles after the performance.

""She just thought it would be great fun not telling Charles,"" said Allan. ""She would just appear, and it would be hugely entertaining, and everybody would maybe have a nice time.""

As the women grew closer, Allan learned how much Diana wanted to make her husband happy.

""More than anything, she wanted to support her husband,"" said Allan. ""That's what mattered to her. She loved him dearly, and she just wanted him to shine. . . . When articles became more and more about her, she just said, 'I do wish they would spend more time photographing Charles than I. I don't want to make things difficult.'""

""It was important to her that she was doing her job well,"" Allan shared. ""That mattered to her.""

As a friend, Diana asked Allan for advice. But what came out of the royal's mouth stunned the teacher.

""I know he is seeing Camilla again,"" said Diana about her husband's mistress, as quoted in the book. ""Why does he not love me? I really don't understand.

""I have tried everything, tried to conform to his wishes even though I don't always agree. There's no affection between us, and I am always on my own. I just want to be loved. I can't keep going on like this. They are really expecting me to just say nothing and keep going. How do I do that?""

Diana would also tell Allan: ""We manage to put on a good official front, but it's getting more and more difficult, as I find it very hard not to show how I feel if I am upset. Charles seems to want us to lead separate lives.

KING CHARLES FELT 'UNBEARABLE EMPTINESS' AFTER PRINCESS DIANA'S DEATH

""Anne, he runs off to Camilla whenever he can. It's not at all what I want. I'd like the marriage to work, but it just isn't for now. Do I just put up with it, hoping he will change?""

Diana would later publicly describe Camilla Parker Bowles, who carried out a long-term affair with Charles, as the third person in their marriage.

When Diana learned from a friend that journalist Andrew Morton was writing a book about her, she decided it was time to tell her story. The pair used mutual pal Dr. James Colthurst as a go-between as Morton wrote his 1992 book, ""Diana: Her True Story.""

Allan claimed that Morton had reached out to her at the time for an interview. She passed. Still, she understood why Diana had chosen to get deeply personal.

""I thought that she must have been at the brink of things when she spoke to Andrew Morton,"" Allan explained. ""I think perhaps she needed at that point to tell her side of the story. By then, things had become quite difficult.

""But I will also say that when I left her in 1989, I was leaving a very strong woman. She had found her voice and was going to go forward being the Princess of Wales. . . . She wanted to express what she felt. [But] I think it was a long process for her to do that.""

""She was just 20 when she joined the royal family,"" said Allan. ""In the end, she was almost 30 with two children. She came into herself as a woman, and she realized that there were things that mattered to her. . . . Therefore, as she grew in confidence, she realized she could have a voice. She could have something to say.""

Charles and Diana announced their separation in December 1992. Camilla and her husband, Andrew Parker Bowles, divorced in 1995. It was shortly after Charles gave an explosive television interview admitting he had an affair with her. Charles and Diana's divorce was finalized the following year.

Diana died in 1997 from injuries she sustained in a car crash. She was 36.

""I want everyone to remember the beautiful person that she was,"" Allan reflected. ""The genuineness, the authenticity, the compassion and warmth. Anyone who met her saw it instantly.

""She had an open heart. I think she would want people to have an open heart, too. She was an incredible woman who faced many challenges in her life, but she always stepped out with a smile on her face. In the end, she just wanted to do good."""
