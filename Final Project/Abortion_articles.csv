I went to a classic Wisconsin supper club to talk politics. This is what I learned,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5138314/wisconsin-supper-club-harris-trump,2024-10-08T15:11:27Z,"The Packing House in Milwaukee caters to diners of all political persuasions. Keren Carri√≥n/NPR hide caption

When we started planning an election reporting trip to swing state Wisconsin, locals told us we had to include a visit to a supper club to experience a unique part of the state's culture. So when I finally met Chris Wiken, whose family opened The Packing House in Milwaukee 50 years ago, my first question was, ""What on earth is a supper club?""

""This is the elusive question,"" he says. ""The whole idea of a supper club is somewhere that you're going to come and spend the evening at.""

Typically, a supper club will include a few things: a Wisconsin brandy old-fashioned cocktail at the bar, seafood or prime rib in the dining room and then live music and a boozy ice cream drink to close out the night.

Even though The Packing House was remodeled about a decade ago, it still has a classic old-time aesthetic with dark wood and dim lighting. Walking through the doors feels like going back in time.

Milwaukee's main airport terminal was just across the street when The Packing House opened in 1974. Now, that terminal serves private jets where former President Donald Trump, Vice President Harris or their running mates park every time they come to town.

""The police and Secret Service come over and go, 'Hey, Chris, they have to close down the street again.' And then I go and shake my fist at them,"" he says, joking that he'll vote for whoever shuts down the street in front of his restaurant fewer times.

You won't see a Harris or Trump sign in front of The Packing House. Wiken doesn't want to alienate his customers, who have a wide range of views, as the All Things Considered crew and I discovered when we started chatting people up at the bar.

Janine Collette, having dinner with an old friend, remembers growing up in Wisconsin before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in the state.

""In high school, we used to raise money in the girls' bathrooms to help girls go to the state of New York to get an abortion,"" she says. ""We're not going back."" Collette is excited to cast her vote for the candidate she expects to become the first female U.S. president.

At the other end of the bar, Ron Raasch says that he has voted for Democrats his whole life and that this election may be the first time he doesn't. He's disillusioned with the two-party system and is considering a vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein.

""It's very hard to see the difference when both of the major parties are going to continue shipping arms all over the world and especially to Gaza,"" he says. Raasch isn't concerned that in 2016 and 2020 the margin of victory in Wisconsin for Trump and Biden, respectively, was less than 1% of the vote. ""People are throwing that as a fear tactic,"" he says. ""And I'm trying to [more so] make a statement that the two-party system is showing its age and its frailties.""

Wearing a Packers hat at the bar, Lee Cielonko is nursing a beer while he waits for his food to arrive. ""I want the economy to be put back together. I want energy. I want to drill, baby, drill, man,"" he says.

He's supporting Trump and is concerned about immigration, saying: ""People come here and they don't have the same culture as us. They don't understand and know a lot of the way our culture works.""

So much about the future, as well as this election, is uncertain; there can be something comforting in the familiar: fish fry Friday, a Wisconsin brandy old-fashioned at the bar and live music in a place that has been doing pretty much the same thing since before most Americans were born."
It's a close race for Michigan. These factors could decide it for Harris or Trump,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/nx-s1-5130163/michigan-2024-election-harris-trump,2024-10-07T09:06:21Z,"A Trump and Harris sign side-by-side in a neighborhood on Oct. 3, 2024 in Hillsdale, Mich. Sylvia Jarrus for NPR hide caption

Michigan is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House.

The state is part of the ""blue wall,"" along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, that she and Democrats need to hold to avoid a second Donald Trump presidency.

It's home to some of the key demographics that both parties are courting this election, from white voters without college degrees to the largest Black-majority city, Detroit, and one of the nation's largest Arab American populations.

But the path to victory is not easy this year. Harris and Trump remain in a close battle, as his populist message continues to resonate with white voters and union and blue-collar workers, particularly on the economy.

Dave Dulio, a professor of political science and director of the Center for Civic Engagement at Oakland University, says ""in places like Macomb County, with many blue-collar voters and union workers, Trump made inroads by pledging to get the U.S. out of bad trade deals and renegotiate NAFTA, which he did.""

""I think they still give him credit for that,"" he added.

Dulio underscores the state's significance by noting that small shifts could lead to substantial changes for candidates: ""If you take a small shift among the Arab American community and a small shift among union workers, those multiple small shifts could drive a very different result.""

Both candidates have heaped attention recently on the Wolverine State. On Oct 4, Harris visited a Redford Charter Township firehouse near Detroit, meeting union representatives. She met with Arab American and Muslim leaders then appeared with United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain in Flint and vowed support for Michigan's auto industry. Trump held campaign events twice in September and took his presidential campaign to Saginaw Valley State University in Kochville Township on Oct. 3.

Michigan also plays to the strengths of the vice presidential nominees, who hail from the Midwest. Both Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have stumped in the state in the last month.

To better understand the key issues shaping voters' decisions -- from the economy and immigration to abortion and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East -- we are in Michigan this week hearing directly from voters and political observers as part of our ""We, The Voters"" series.

A September poll by The New York Times and Siena College found that Michigan voters cared most about the economy, followed by abortion and immigration.

Economy

Michigan's unemployment rate is historically low, according to state data, but it has slowly ticked up in recent months. Meanwhile, inflation has eased, but high costs of living remain a concern.

The state continues to suffer from the decades-long decline of automobile manufacturing, and high interest rates have constricted sales of cars, according to a September study from the University of Michigan.

Both parties are trying to put focus on the economy. GOP attack ads argue that Biden and Harris are responsible for inflation, while the vice president's messaging focuses on plans to uplift the middle class and paint Trump-era tax cuts as benefiting the wealthy.

Meghan Wilson, an expert in public policy and urban development, said Harris could expand the Democratic position on economics by appealing to Black business owners and holders of student debt.

""African Americans in Detroit have a lot of small businesses, and so we're looking for capital for those kinds of small businesses. I think Kamala Harris is doing a great job of bringing the small businesses into the conversation,"" Wilson explained.

Organized labor plays a key role in Michigan's economy. Both parties are making a play for Michigan's union members, who accounted for 13% of workers in the state last year. Exit polls in 2020 showed Michigan's union voters favoring President Biden over Trump, and Biden pledged to be ""the most pro-union president"" in U.S. history, which he backed up with a visit to UAW workers striking in Wayne, Mich.

Michigan pollster Bernie Porn said Biden's visit to striking workers helped him bump up his union support, but his policies to advance electric vehicles with tax credits were unpopular with Independent and Republican voters.

""You have Harris leading among union members with 63% which is almost where Biden was in 2020 with 65%, so she's improving her lot among union members, but still, the EVs are a problem,"" he said.

Still, one encouraging sign for the Harris campaign could be Michigan's local Teamsters union backing her candidacy, breaking with the national union that declined to endorse any candidate for U.S. president, after they had supported every Democratic candidate for president since Bill Clinton.

Abortion

Two years ago, Michigan voters approved a landmark amendment to the state constitution, securing the right to abortion and other reproductive health services.

Democrats won control of all three branches of Michigan's governments since making abortion a central voting issue.

But that success may have made it a less influential issue in the 2024 election. A KFF poll in June found that women in Michigan saw abortion as ""decided"" and they were more concerned about inflation and the rising cost of living.

""The Democrats are putting an awful lot of their eggs in the basket of abortion,"" the pollster Porn said.

Dulio pointed out that Trump's main weakness stems from what has driven Democratic success in every election -- and not necessarily abortion since it's already decided in the state: ""His character remains a key weakness. He's deeply unpopular because of the Jan. 6 spectacle and doubling down on his claims that the 2020 election was stolen. That just turns off persuadable voters,"" he said.

Michigan is home to one of the largest Black populations in the nation, ahead of Louisiana, Alabama and South Carolina, and the largest Black-majority city, Detroit.

Harris would herself be the nation's first Black woman president, but some Black voters may not be as motivated to vote as they were in 2020.

""The main challenge is the enthusiasm gap,"" said Ronald Brown, a political scientist at Wayne State University. He said among Black voters in Michigan, those who were in the ""black leadership class"" -- meaning serving in government, churches, Black fraternities and sororities -- were highly likely to vote for Harris. However, those without deep connections to the party, especially working-class and poor Detroit residents, were susceptible to sitting out elections. In particular, he pointed to Detroit's recent voter turnout -- higher in 2020 than it was in 2016 -- as a key factor explaining the state's pick for Biden after it went for Trump four years earlier.

""What could occur is that among working class and poor Black voters, lack of interest could lead to fatigue and this may drive those voters not to vote. And in Michigan, you don't need many. You need enough,"" he said.

Democratic state Sen. Sarah Anthony has a different perspective. She had seen an encouraging gain among young people to help shore up Harris' base.

""The Biden coalition included many working-class white men, a group Vice President Harris has struggled to win over. While there may have been losses there, the data I've seen shows significant gains due to increased enthusiasm among young people and people of color,"" she said.

U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East

The Detroit Metropolitan area has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the U.S. Dearborn, often called the Capital of Arab America, is home to a majority of Lebanese residents who maintain strong ties to southern Lebanon.

Arab and Muslim voters here were largely supportive of Biden in 2020. However, many have since been alienated by his handling of Israel's deadly war in Gaza and the administration's ongoing military aid to Israel. Many now are similarly concerned about Israel's continuing bombardment of Beirut and ground invasion along the countries' shared border.

Abbas Alawieh, a Dearborn Democratic strategist and one of the co-founders of the ""uncommitted movement,"" backed Biden in 2020. But earlier this year, he and other organizers successfully secured more than 100,000 ""uncommitted"" votes in the Michigan primary to protest Biden's handling of the war in Gaza.

Alawieh, who had advocated for a Gaza ceasefire, told Morning Edition host Leila Fadel that he feels more despair now as the conflict spreads to his family's homeland, Lebanon.

""This is a grieving community. So, for us to give guidance to vote for Kamala Harris, when she is part of the administration that's actively killing their family members, it's like giving a campaign speech at a funeral.""

Professor Dubio said the uncommitted movement has the potential to ""have a huge impact,"" and while he believes many of them will ultimately vote for Harris, he added, ""it can't and shouldn't be ignored.""

Abbas mentioned sending letters to Vice President Harris's team, including her national security advisor, requesting meetings with those directly affected by the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. ""So far, the answer is still no.""

He added that Donald Trump visited the community, took photos with leaders, and invited them to his campaign rally.

Saeed Khan, an associate professor of Near Eastern and Asian Studies at Wayne State University, said Muslim and Arab voters were drifting toward Trump in 2016, and some continue to do so today, not only because of a push away from Democrats, but also a pull toward the Republican party's values. Many Arabs and Muslims, immigrant Muslims, voted for the Republican ticket at least until September 11 and then started to move toward the Democratic Party.

""The Republican message of self-reliance, smaller government or less government intrusion, lower taxes, social conservatism really appealed to many, especially immigrant Muslims and Arabs, because it epitomized the American Dream that they had internalized,"" Khan said."
"Medical debt snares millions of people. States, red and blue are passing laws to help",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5135641/medical-debt-solutions-hospitals-republicans-democrats-state-laws,2024-10-07T09:02:28Z,"While hot-button health care issues such as abortion and the Affordable Care Act roil the presidential race, Democrats and Republicans in statehouses around the country have been quietly working together to tackle the nation's medical debt crisis.

New laws to curb aggressive hospital billing, to expand charity care for lower-income patients, and to rein in debt collectors have been enacted in more than 20 states since 2021.

Democrats championed most measures. But the legislative efforts often passed with Republican support. In a few states, GOP lawmakers led the push to expand patient protections.

""Regardless of their party, regardless of their background ... any significant medical procedure can place people into bankruptcy,"" Florida House Speaker Paul Renner, a conservative Republican, said in an interview. ""This is a real issue.""

Renner, who has shepherded controversial measures to curb abortion rights and expand the death penalty in Florida, this year also led an effort to limit when hospitals could send patients to collections. It garnered unanimous support in the Florida Legislature.

Bipartisan measures in other states have gone further, barring unpaid medical bills from consumer credit reports and restricting medical providers from placing liens on patients' homes.

About 100 million people in the U.S. are burdened by some form of health care debt, forcing millions to drain savings, take out second mortgages, or cut back on food and other essentials, KFF Health News has found. A quarter of those with debt owed more than $5,000 in 2022.

""Republicans in the legislature seem more open to protecting people from medical debt than from other kinds of debt,"" said Marceline White, executive director of Economic Action Maryland, which helped lead efforts in that state to stop medical providers from garnishing the wages of low-income patients. That bill drew unanimous support from Democrats and Republicans

""There seems to be broad agreement that you shouldn't lose your home or your life savings because you got ill,"" White said. ""That's just a basic level of fairness.""

Medical debt remains a more polarizing issue in Washington, where the Biden administration has pushed several efforts to tackle the issue, including a proposed rule by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, to bar all medical debt from consumer credit reports.

Vice President Harris, who is spearheading the administration's medical debt campaign, has touted the work on the presidential campaign trail while calling for new efforts to retire health care debt for millions of Americans.

Former President Donald Trump doesn't typically talk about medical debt while stumping. But congressional Republicans have blasted the CFPB proposal, which House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) called ""regulatory overreach.""

Nevertheless, pollster Michael Perry, who has surveyed Americans extensively about health care, said that conservative voters typically wary of government seem to view medical debt through another lens. ""I think they feel it's so stacked against them that they, as patients, don't really have a voice,"" he said. ""The partisan divides we normally see just aren't there.""

When Arizona consumer advocates put a measure on the ballot in 2022 to cap interest rates on medical debt, 72% of voters backed the initiative.

Similarly, nationwide polls have found more than 80% of Republicans and Democrats back limits on medical debt collections and stronger requirements that hospitals provide financial aid to patients.

Perry surfaced something else that may be driving bipartisan interest in medical debt: growing mistrust as health systems get bigger and act more like major corporations. ""Hospitals aren't what they used to be,"" he said. ""That is making it clear that profit and greed are driving lots of the decision-making.""

Not every state effort to address medical debt has garnered broad bipartisan support.

When Colorado last year became the first state to bar medical debt from residents' credit reports, just one Republican lawmaker backed the measure. A Minnesota bill that did the same thing this year passed without a single GOP vote.

But elsewhere, similarly tough measures have sailed through.

A 2024 Illinois bill to bar credit reporting for medical debt passed unanimously in the state Senate and cleared the House of Representatives 109-2. In Rhode Island, not a single GOP lawmaker opposed a credit reporting ban.

And when the California Legislature took up a 2021 bill to require hospitals in the state to provide more financial assistance to patients, it passed 72-0 in the state Assembly and 39-0 in the Senate.

Even some conservative states, such as Oklahoma, have taken steps, albeit more modest. A new law there bars medical providers from pursuing patients for debts if the provider has not publicly posted its prices. The measure, signed by the state's Republican governor, passed unanimously.

New Mexico state Sen. Steve Neville, a Republican who backed legislation to restrict aggressive collections against low-income patients in that state, said he was simply being pragmatic.

""There was not much advantage to spending a lot of time trying to do collections on indigent patients,"" Neville said. ""If they don't have the money, they don't have the money."" Three of 12 GOP senators supported the measure.

North Carolina state Treasurer Dale Folwell, a Republican who as a state legislator spearheaded a 2012 effort to ban same-sex marriage, said all elected officials, no matter their party, should care about what medical debt is doing to patients.

""It doesn't matter if, as a conservative, I'm saying these things, or if Bernie Sanders is saying these things,"" Folwell said, referencing Vermont's liberal U.S. senator. ""At the end of the day, it should be all our jobs to advocate for the invisible."""
The Activists Working to Abolish IVF : Up First from NPR,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/1210938249/abortion-abolitionists-aim-to-criminalize-ivf,2024-10-06T07:05:24Z,"Abortion abolitionists protest outside of an IVF clinic in Texas.

In the last few years, more than a dozen states have enacted laws that ban almost all abortions. Some include exceptions for rape, incest, and to protect the life of the mother. But a small, vocal group of anti-abortion activists say even these exceptions are morally wrong. They want to see a ban not only on all abortions but also on some fertility treatments, including IVF. They believe an embryo deserves the same rights as any human.

On this episode of The Sunday Story from Up First, NPR's Sarah McCammon takes us to a protest outside an IVF clinic and talks to activists who call themselves ""abortion abolitionists."" These activists say their goal is to turn their beliefs into policy and are heartened by the progress they've made."
"Three states show how abortion, schools and taxes are at stake in legislature races",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/05/nx-s1-5124638/state-legislature-supermajority-kansas-arizona-minnesota-elections,2024-10-05T09:04:20Z,"Elections for state legislatures don't get the attention that races for president or Congress do but they often have a big impact on our lives. Congress is divided and gridlocked. In contrast, nearly all state legislatures have both chambers run by one party or another. That makes it easy to pass laws.

And they've been passing a lot. More than 20 states have imposed new limits on abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated the federal right to abortion in 2022. In education, state lawmakers create voucher programs and determine public school funding. Gun laws, taxes, criminal sentences, access to Medicaid and food stamps are just a few other issues decided by state legislatures.

Redistricting and polarization have increased the political tilt of many legislatures -- even where the state might be more balanced overall.

This year, several legislatures could see power shift if just a few seats flip in the election -- maybe just a matter of hundreds of votes in some districts. Here are three states, Kansas, Minnesota and Arizona, that illustrate the stakes around the country.

TOPEKA, Kansas -- Kansas is one of several states where the Legislature sometimes tilts more conservative than the state's voters overall. While it votes Republican for president, it has elected a Democrat for governor twice in a row and voted with 59% to protect abortion rights.

But Republicans hold 29 of the 40 seats in the Senate and 85 of the 125 seats in the House. That gives them the two-thirds ""supermajority"" to pass bills and override vetoes by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.

They've overridden Kelly's vetoes 15 times in the last two years. They used the override to pass a bill requiring doctors to question patients seeking abortions about their reasons. They overrode vetoes to pass laws banning transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports and to limit access to food stamps.

Democrats say they can break the supermajority in this year's elections -- they'd only need to flip two or three seats in either chamber. It would give Kelly a stronger veto in her last two years in office -- and Democrats more leverage over what the majority passes.

""My hope is that with the governor being able to veto and being able to sustain those vetoes, it puts us more at the table for compromise,"" says Democrat Dinah Sykes, the Senate minority leader.

National Democratic party organizations say that goal is within reach. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee is highlighting 10 legislative races in Kansas and helping with campaign logistics.

Kansas Republicans, meanwhile, have scorned that contribution as outside interference. And they defend the supermajority.

Republican House Majority Leader Chris Croft says it's a necessary counterbalance to the governor's veto pen.

""[The] supermajority in this case, while it sounds like it's this huge number, in fact, what it does is just gives us a seat at the table,"" Croft told NPR.

Even with their heavy majority, Republican's priorities aren't always veto-proof. Last session, Kelly successfully vetoed three major tax-cut proposals, including one that fell a single vote shy of an override. The fight forced the Legislature into a special session.

""You can't get everything you want in this business. This business has a little bit of give and take and that's the beauty of the process,"" Croft says. ""It's also the frustrating part.""

Supermajorities, like the one held by Kansas Republicans, have become common. Across the country as of their recent legislative sessions, one party or another held a veto-proof majority in 29 states. Republicans had 20 of those, Democrats nine.

Patrick Miller, a political scientist at Kent State University, says supermajorities have spread in part because of polarization and legislators gerrymandering their own districts.

""One of those consequences of supermajority, is a lot more ideological politics and policy,"" he says.

While the U.S. Congress is often locked in stalemate, Miller says state legislatures that are dominated by one party are able to step into the vacuum to pass laws shaping day-to-day life.

""If you care about education, if you care about health care regulation in your state, if you care about abortion, transgender rights, LGBT rights, if you care about whether your roads have potholes ... you need to be looking at your state legislature,"" he says.

TONKA BAY, Minn. -- On a sunny Tuesday morning, Republican state Senate candidate Kathleen Fowke walks door-to-door near Lake Minnetonka just west of Minneapolis. The tree-lined roads by the water are quiet but when she knocks on a door she's reminded that this is hotly contested territory.

""You're in my YouTube all the time,"" says the man inside -- a reminder of the ads targeting voters here.

The contest to win this legislative district could be the state's most expensive ever -- and key to winning the Senate.

For two years, Democrats have controlled the Legislature and the governor's office under Gov. Tim Walz -- now the Democratic nominee for vice president. They've passed more spending for affordable housing and public schools, and guaranteed protections for patients who seek or provide abortion or gender-affirming care.

Now Republicans see a chance to curb the progressive trend. They're just a few seats behind in the state House. The Senate is tied 33-33 and this vacant seat by the lake could be the tiebreaker that ends the Democrats' so-called ""trifecta"" of House, Senate and governorship.

The GOP wants to slow state spending and focus on the economy overall. Fowke, a real estate agent, says that, while voters don't always know about the work the Legislature does, what she does hear about from them is money.

""It's basically affordability, and they can't afford, you know, just to go to the grocery store anymore,"" Fowke says. ""Taxes are high. Inflation is high. They need to find a way to help lower the costs of everything all around them.""

Republicans promise to cut taxes, tighten up on spending and curb fraud and abuse in state programs. ""With one-party, Democrat control, it was easy just to push through partisan policy and partisan priorities,"" House Minority Leader Lisa Demuth says.

Democrats say they address people's cost of living with laws requiring companies to offer paid time off for illness, family leave and safe time and new money for free school lunches.

""They trust the Democrats are going to do more for their economic well being, whereas what they hear from Republicans is, 'Oh, we have to give more tax cuts to corporations,'"" says Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman. The national Democratic Party is helping fund the state party's effort.

Their candidate facing Fowke is civil engineer Ann Johnson Stewart. She's knocking on doors, too, telling people she stands for maintaining legal protections for abortion in the state. ""One of the reasons I'm running is to make sure we can continue on that track,"" she says.

She hopes Democrats will work now on carbon-free energy sources, local infrastructure, expanding mental health care and reducing gun violence.

Andrew Karch, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota, says candidates face an uphill battle getting voters to pay attention to state issues.

""There's a real tendency for these races to sort of fly beneath the radar,"" Karch says. And many voters don't focus on state issues.

""I think politics in Minnesota specifically may have been more distinctive a generation ago than they are today,"" he says. ""State and local politicians are increasingly being asked to comment on issues that we might think of as national.""

Fowke and Johnson Stewart say they hope to keep the conversations focused on what's going on in their district. But they know that's a big ask in a presidential election year.

PHOENIX -- In Arizona, the party that wins the Legislature could determine where tens of thousands of children go to school or how well their schools are funded. At issue is the state's sweeping vouchers program that gives families tax dollars for use in private schools or for homeschooling.

For Chelsea Ellison, a homeschool parent, the program has helped turn things around for a daughter who struggled in public elementary school.

""It took us a little bit of last year to get her where she should have been, in general, and now she's thriving,"" Ellison says. ""She loves school.""

But parents and teachers sticking with public schools say they've paid the price.

""I notice that the amount of resources available to the teachers, directly, it just is not there, any kind of funding for improvements at the school is not there,"" says Miriam Hoban, whose child attends a public school in Scottsdale. She says teachers or parents are forced to pay out of pocket for basic necessities like pencils and markers.

Arizona's program, called Empowerment Scholarship Accounts, is a national model for what advocates call school choice. In 2022, the Republican Legislature and then-Gov. Doug Ducey took a small program offering vouchers for kids with disabilities or in underperforming schools and made it available for any child.

Enrollment in the program leaped from 12,000 students to 78,000 students and growing. Students got a median of $7,409 per year. That added up to a total of about $718 million from the state budget, which was $93 million more than projected, according to the Arizona Department of Education.

Republicans control the Legislature with just a two-seat advantage in both the House and Senate. The narrow margin was in the national spotlight this year as lawmakers just barely repealed an 1864 law that banned abortion.

If Democrats win control, they pledge to scale back the voucher program and they can rely on backing from Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, elected after the program was expanded. ""The previous Legislature passed a massive expansion of school vouchers that lacks accountability and will likely bankrupt this state,"" she said after taking office last year.

Critics point to stories about voucher money going for private lessons in luxury cars and ski resort passes, supposedly part of a child's education. And they say much of the money goes to families that were able to pay for private schools on their own with kids already out of the public schools.

But as the program has grown and gained support among some swing voters, it could be tougher for Democrats in competitive districts to campaign against it. They'll have to temper their ambitions, says Arizona pollster Paul Bentz.

""I don't expect that they could mount a full-fledged repeal,"" Bentz says. ""I think that would be challenging for some of the swing areas for Democrats. But I certainly think at a minimum, there would be regulation on it, and probably some definite changes to the program.""

Ellison, the voucher mom, says her family did try to make it work in public schools before opting to teach at home with voucher support.

""There was larger class sizes, more budget cuts,"" Ellison says of their old public school. ""We had no STEM teacher, we had no music teacher, we had no art teacher.""

Public school supporters say the vouchers drain the money for just those kinds of needs."

This was the harshest charge they faced, and a guilty verdict could have resulted in life in prison. The officers were all convicted of obstruction of justice and witness tampering. Haley was also found guilty of depriving Nichols of his civil rights and deliberate indifference resulting in serious bodily injury.

"In excerpt from new memoir, Melania Trump says women have the 'right to choose' abortion",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/g-s1-26134/melania-trump-memoir-donald-trump-abortion-position,2024-10-03T13:23:45Z,"""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?"" Melania Trump asks in her new memoir, according to an early excerpt published by The Guardian.

Former first lady Melania Trump says in a self-titled memoir set to be released next week that she supports women's autonomy and the right to control their own bodies -- including abortion, if they choose, according to a report Thursday.

Her stance adds another jolt to a presidential campaign season rife with dramatic events, with Melania Trump weighing in on a topic that is a central issue in her husband's bid for reelection.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy"" when deciding when and whether to have children, Melania Trump writes in the book, according to an excerpt cited by The Guardian. The newspaper says it obtained an early copy of the book.

Those decisions, she said, should be based on women's personal convictions, not on ""intervention or pressure from the government,"" according to the excerpt.

According to the The Guardian Melania Trump also writes:

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.

Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

NPR has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment about Melania Trump's writings, and is seeking independent verification of the excerpt from the book's publisher.

Abortion has long been a key issue in U.S. political campaigns, but the 2024 race comes two years after the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v Jackson that found there is no constitutional right to abortion.

Democrats have used that controversial ruling as a rallying call, emphasizing that pivotal votes on the high court's decision came from justices nominated by then-President Donald Trump.

The former president's position on abortion has been closely analyzed as he seeks to regain the White House.

""After 50 years of failure, with nobody coming even close, I was able to kill Roe v. Wade, much to the 'shock' of everyone,"" Trump said last year on his Truth Social platform.

But this year, Trump has seemingly sought to portray a more nuanced position on abortion, including saying that abortion laws should be left for states to decide.

As NPR's Sarah McCammon reported after the 2022 midterm election:

""Advocates for bans on most abortions - including a wave of state laws passed in recent years that prohibit the procedure within the first several weeks - are at odds with public opinion, according to many years of polling. While most Americans support some restrictions on abortion, most support access earlier in pregnancy.""

Melania Trump's memoir, titled Melania, has a release date of Oct. 8, by Skyhorse Publishing, with distribution by Simon & Schuster.

In its summary of the book, the publisher said of the former first lady: ""She shares behind-the-scenes stories from her time in the White House, shedding light on her advocacy work and the causes close to her heart.""

The former first lady was born in Slovenia in 1970, three years before the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. She moved to the U.S. in 1996 and became a U.S. citizen in 2006."
Too much presidential politics? State legislatures are also on the ballot,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5129659/abortion-election-michigan-arizona-minnesota,2024-10-03T09:05:03Z,"Some of the most consequential and controversial issues -- abortion and voting access, education, health care and criminal justice -- are largely decided by state lawmakers who are, more likely than not, on your ballot this year.

State legislators wield significant power, which has been amplified with Congress gridlocked and policymaking punted to the fifty so-called ""laboratories of democracy"" to pass laws dealing with abortion, guns, schools, voting, LGBTQ rights and more.

But, increasingly, voters' attention is devoted to narratives spun in national politics, even as legislatures play an outside role in modern policymaking.

Political parties and interest groups are spending millions of dollars trying to sway legislative elections this year. In at least six states, the margins are so close that partisan control of the legislature could flip.

Republicans have more legislative power than Democrats heading into this year's elections, controlling 55% of the nation's 7,386 legislative seats, according to an NPR analysis. Overall, the GOP is on top in 57 of the country's 99 legislative chambers.

Republicans have veto-proof majorities in 20 states, allowing them to override governors' bill vetoes. Democrats have veto-proof majorities in nine states.

The ability to override a governor's veto is especially potent in Kansas, Kentucky and North Carolina -- states where Republicans have supermajority control of the Legislature and a Democratic governor. Democrats in Kansas and North Carolina are hoping to win enough seats to break Republican supermajorities this year.

Here's a look at some of the legislatures where partisan control hangs in the balance this year.

Democrats believe they have a chance to win total control of Arizona's Legislature and governor's office this year with Republicans defending narrow two-seat majorities in both the state House and Senate.

Abortion access has been front-and-center in Arizona after the state Supreme Court ordered a Civil War-era abortion ban into effect and legislators scrambled to repeal it. Democrats are taking aim at GOP lawmakers who voted against repealing the ban.

And voters will decide whether to add abortion protections to their state constitution during a referendum on Election Day -- one of 10 states with a reproductive rights ballot measure this year.

The state's Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs was elected in 2022. She set a record for the most vetoes in Arizona history -- striking down conservative bills involving elections, immigration and transgender people.

But Hobbs has been cuffed by the Republican-led Legislature and hasn't been able to champion many policies on her own. If Democrats were to flip control of the legislature, they say they would scale back a massive $700 million school voucher program passed by Republicans.

Democrats haven't had full control of the governor's office and Legislature since 1966.

Democrats are attempting to preserve the trifecta they gained in 2022 after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer won reelection and the party gained narrow majorities in both legislative chambers.

Whitmer credited the abortion constitutional amendment on the ballot that year for the Democratic victories after she and other candidates made the issue central to their campaigns. Their wins meant Democrats were in full control of the state for the first time in four decades.

Since then, Michigan Democrats have passed progressive policies like abortion protections, gun safety and an expansion of prevailing wage rules while repealing conservative provisions like ""right-to-work"" legislation.

There are no state Senate elections this year and only the House is in play. Republicans argue Democrats have pushed the state too far to the left and they can provide a check on Whitmer's administration.

Republicans are also trying to undermine a trifecta in Minnesota where the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, Democrats' official name in the North Star State, controls both legislative chambers and the governor's office.

Democrats are defending a slim majority in the House and there is a political tie in the Senate after a legislator dropped out to run for Congress. A special election for the district, located in the Minneapolis suburbs, will determine control of the Senate.

Andrew Karch, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota, says it's hard to make voters aware of these elections when there's a splashy presidential race going on.

""I think that there's a real tendency for these races to sort of fly beneath the radar,"" he says. I think in a lot of ways, there aren't that many messages that actually are bubbling up. I think again, these races often tend to get overshadowed by national politics and by other statewide campaigns.""

Under Democratic control the Legislature passed -- and Gov. Tim Walz signed -- bills that provide free meals for kids at school, restore voting rights to some people with felony convictions and reinforce abortion access and transgender rights.

Control of the Granite State's largest-in-the-nation Legislature has bounced back and forth over the years, but Republicans currently have a trifecta. The GOP currently holds a slim majority with 197 of the state House's 400 seats (there are seven vacancies) and 14 out of 24 Senate seats. After five two-year terms, Republican Gov. Chris Sununu is not running again, leaving a rare open election for governor in this state without term limits. The race to succeed him is likely the most competitive in the country this year between Republican Kelly Ayotte and Democrat Joyce Craig.

New Hampshire is one of the few states in New England without abortion protections enshrined in its state constitution and Democrats hope the issue, along with the open election for governor, will boost turnout.

The Keystone State is one of two legislatures with split control -- Republicans control the Senate and Democrats control the House.

Democrats hope recent statewide victories -- the elections of Gov. Josh Shapiro and U.S. Sen. John Fetterman -- will trickle down to local races in a year when the battleground state has been flooded with national attention. That year, Democrats won control of the state House by gaining 12 seats.

If Republicans win a majority in the House and take full control of the Legislature, it likely spells conflict between lawmakers and Shapiro.

Democrats hope new political maps -- redrawn by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers after the state Supreme Court struck down Republican-drawn maps in 2023 -- will lead to a shakeup of the GOP-led Legislature.

Republicans have controlled the Legislature for more than a decade under maps that favored the GOP. According to Wisconsin Public Radio, at least 61 members of the state Assembly and Senate won't run in their old districts -- nearly half of the Legislature. Democrats are running candidates in 97 of the Assembly's 99 races and in each of the 16 open Senate races.

Democrats argue the legislative maps have been out of step with voters after a series of statewide victories, including Evers' reelection in 2022."
"It's harder to pay and travel for abortion care, but support funds are struggling",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5131573/abortion-fund-travel-state-bans-ballot-measures-national-federation-budget-cuts-repro-rights,2024-10-03T09:02:12Z,"Bree Wallace works for the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund. The group uses donations to help people pay for abortion care in Florida, and to travel to other states, but has struggled financially to keep up with the demand.

Getting an abortion can cost hundreds, if not thousands of dollars, especially if a patient must leave a state with a strict abortion ban.

But the organizations that provide financial support, sometimes known as abortion funds, are struggling financially and slashing their budgets, unable to meet the needs of the growing number of people asking for help.

Planned Parenthood of New England is warning of a projected $8.6 million deficit. Funds in Ohio, Chicago, Arizona and Florida don't have enough money to meet demand.

Even the National Abortion Federation, which runs a national hotline that helps cover procedure costs, was forced to cut its monthly budget in half, due to fewer donations.

Previously, the Federation had covered up to 50 percent of an eligible patient's costs in most locations. In July, it dropped that coverage to 30 percent.

""We're in the midst of an abortion funding crisis,"" says Oriaku Njoku, the executive director of the National Network of Abortion Funds, which provides an online search tool for patients to find a local or regional assistance fund.

Njoku and others at these funds point to intersecting pressures: increased demand for financial assistance for abortions, additional expenses due to some patients having to travel across state lines, and a decline in donor interest.

The initial wave of ""rage donations"" that flowed into the national and regional funds, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, has subsided.

""It's weird to see the divestment like, don't you see the crisis anymore?"" says Jenice Fountain, executive director of the Yellowhammer Fund in Alabama.

""We're absolutely, very much still in crisis, potentially even worse crisis than when the ban first happened.""

The Yellowhammer Fund supports pregnancy and prenatal care, and is involved in a lawsuit against Alabama's Attorney General, after he threatened to prosecute groups like Yellowhammer for helping patients travel out of state for abortion care.

""People ask 'Why should we donate if Alabama doesn't have an abortion clinic?'"" Fountain says.

""And it's like, well, that's a reason to double down on support in Alabama. We're fighting the thing. We have to exist the whole time that we fight the thing.""

But abortion hasn't faded from the news, or become less politically potent. In fact, reproductive rights have become a prominent issue in this year's presidential election.

Ten states will put ballot measures on abortion rights before voters in November, and many Democratic candidates have made it a central issue to their campaign.

The cumulative effect has been to divert donations away from the funds that support patients directly -- and towards specific candidates and ballot initiatives.

In August, more than 30 local abortion funds across the U.S. signed an op-ed criticizing national reproductive rights organizations for focusing too much on advocacy rather than patient care.

""I think there's this false hope and illusion with putting the right president in place, or winning this ballot initiative,"" says Eloisa Lopez, executive director of the Abortion Fund of Arizona.

""None of that is actually funding abortion care,"" Lopez says. ""You can have all those things in place and people are still not going to be able to get their care.""

Even after the election ends, Lopez fears that donors will continue to assume that grassroots abortion funds like hers don't need as much support -- especially if voters approve state-level ballot initiatives that affirm reproductive rights.

""I think when people see progress is being made, it's translating into people's minds, like 'We're not going to have struggles trying to get abortion anymore.'""

But advocates say that the struggles to pay out-of-pocket for abortion care, or travel elsewhere for care, will continue in all states.

Bree Wallace, an employee at the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund, typically spends her days glued to her laptop, messaging back-and-forth with pregnant clients who need help paying abortion care -- and fast, if they want to comply with Florida's six-week ban.

One afternoon in July, a woman texted the fund from the waiting room of a clinic. She needed an abortion, but couldn't pay.

The National Abortion Hotline had pledged to cover 30 percent, leaving her with a fee of $490.

""It can be pretty hefty for people,"" says Wallace, 27, the fund's director of case management.

Within minutes, Wallace committed to help. All the woman had to do was share her first name and last initial. The clinic would directly charge the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund for the balance, and the woman could move forward with her appointment.

In Florida, an abortion can cost between $600 to $800, during the first trimester. Florida law requires a mandatory in-person consultation and an ultrasound, followed by a 24-hour waiting period.

Since 1977, the Hyde Amendment has severely restricted the use of federal funds for abortion care. In practice, that means Medicaid doesn't cover it -- unless individual states cover the entire cost with state funds.

Florida Medicaid does not cover abortion care, and state law also bans coverage by insurance plans sold on the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

Many patients must therefore pay for the entire cost, and have little time to gather the funds under the state's six-week ban.

Bree explained that many women don't even know they're pregnant by six weeks. But if they do, they often have just days to act.

""Especially with six weeks right now you're kind of working against time, you don't even have time to even get that money,"" Wallace says.

Before Florida's six-week ban went into effect last spring, some patients could have saved up their own money. But now they need the fund's help, says Wallace.

At the Abortion Fund of Arizona, declining donations have forced spending cuts. In September, the Fund spent about $18,000 assisting patients -- half of what the Fund spent in July.

Often, that monthly allotment is gone in just two weeks, and staffers must turn down requests for aid, or tell patients to try again next month.

""It's a really terrible position where we're having to give people ideas about how to raise money on their own,"" says executive director Eloisa Lopez.

""'Can you ask your family or friends? Do you have a credit card? Could you take out a line of credit? Do you have items in your home you can sell?'""

Since most states near Florida also ban abortion, patients past the state's six-week mark are traveling to places like Washington, D.C. or Illinois for care.

Between last-minute airfare and hotel stays, that can push the price up another $1,000.

""There's also taking off work. That can be hard for a lot of people, finding childcare,"" Wallace says. ""Sometimes this is the first time people have ever been on a plane, ever left Florida...it can be really confusing and stressful.""

Earlier this year, the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund decided it could spend fifty thousand dollars a month helping pay for procedures and travel. But since May, it's regularly blown past that limit.

The fund doesn't want to turn down someone who really needs help, Wallace says. She read out loud a grateful text she recently received from a client.

""'Thank you,' with a million exclamation points,"" Wallace reads from the screen. ""'Thank you so much,' with even more exclamation points. 'I appreciate you for what you do, you just helped me more than you know.'""

The Tampa fund hopes to do more fund-raising this fall. But if future donations don't keep up with spending, it will completely run out of money in 3-6 months, according to Wallace.

Because of the federal Hyde Amendment, abortion funds must turn to private donations from individuals, community groups or foundations.

But in many states, federal and state funds are used to support crisis pregnancy centers that oppose abortion and often try to dissuade people from getting an abortion. In the last 5 years, about $400 million dollars in federal money flowed to crisis pregnancy centers across the country."
"Justice Department No. 3 official pledges to fight hate crimes, fueled by personal story",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/g-s1-25489/justice-department-hate-crimes-ben-mizer,2024-10-01T09:17:21Z,"Benjamin Mizer, with Attorney General Merrick Garland (left), speaks during a press conference announcing an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in March 2024. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images hide caption

When the Justice Department's third-in-command announced nearly $30 million in new federal funds to fight the rise in hate crimes last week, he paused to share a personal reflection.

Ben Mizer told the audience he was ""almost exactly the same age"" as Matthew Shepard would have been, another young gay man living in a small college town in the late 1990s. Attackers beat Shepard, tied him to a fence and left him to die in 1998, striking fear and horror across the nation. The law named after him -- and passed more than a decade later -- gave the federal government new tools to prosecute people who are fueled by hate.

""What I would say to members of the LGBTQ community is that the Justice Department is working day and day out on their behalf to ensure that their rights and dignity are protected,"" Mizer said in a recent interview. ""And I'm proud to be a member of that community and at a senior level of the department.""

The FBI reported more than 11,000 hate crimes in 2023, including a steep increase in anti-Jewish and anti-Black incidents. Mizer and other Justice Department leaders have been targeting those and other crime problems with a two-pronged approach: prosecuting offenders and making financial investments in public safety. The Justice Department administers billions in federal grants. Its Office of Justice Programs has already invested more than $70 million into fighting hate crimes over the past several years.

Mizer, 47, oversees an enormous portfolio at the DOJ, from antitrust and the environment to civil rights. In recent weeks, he's helped launch a lawsuit against the operators of a ship that brought down Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge; announce a settlement over the Norfolk Southern train carrying toxic chemicals that derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, not far from where he spent his childhood; and bring blockbuster antitrust cases against Apple, Ticketmaster and Visa.

""I think economic justice means ensuring that everyone has a fair shake, that the playing field is level and that corporations are not using their power in unfair ways to harm competition or to harm consumers,"" Mizer said.

The son of two union workers, Mizer said he went to law school at the University of Michigan to ""help the little guy."" Since then, Mizer has served as solicitor general in his home state of Ohio, and had two separate stints at the Justice Department in Washington.

In the Obama years, Mizer helped implement a U.S. Supreme Court decision that invalidated the Defense of Marriage Act, a law that defined marriage as between one man and one woman. He sat in on the oral argument at the high court for another case, Obergefell v. Hodges, that ultimately legalized same-sex marriage.

""My husband and I enjoy the benefits of the tremendous advances that were made with respect to gay rights during the Obama era,"" Mizer said. ""But that is not to say that those battles are completely won.""

Mizer said he's proud of the work the DOJ has done to challenge state laws that could deprive transgender people of gender-affirming care -- and to protect women's rights to travel to secure health care including abortion services.

It's not clear whether Mizer will stick around at Justice, in the event Vice President Harris wins the White House. But he said working at DOJ has been ""the honor of a lifetime."""
JD Vance's time on the trail has often been overshadowed by self-made controversy,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5060281/vp-debate-jd-vance-haitian-migrants-abortion-childless-cat-ladies,2024-10-01T09:10:12Z,"Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance speaks to a crowd during a rally at the Berks County Fairgrounds on Sept. 21, in Leesport, Penn. Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images hide caption

Republican vice presidential nominee Ohio Sen. JD Vance has been an aggressive messenger for Donald Trump's campaign vision for the future and is a constant fixture on the trail, doing interviews and taking questions from the press.

But in the 11 weeks since Vance joined the GOP presidential ticket, that message has been overshadowed by controversy -- often of Vance's own making.

His acceptance speech in Milwaukee at the Republican National Convention was heavy on biography and nodded towards a more polished take on Trump's often dire rhetoric.

""My friends, tonight is a night of hope,"" he said. ""A celebration of what America once was, and with God's grace, what it will soon be again. And it is a reminder of the sacred duty we have to preserve the American experiment, to choose a new path for our children and grandchildren.""

Vance's selection came at a moment when Trump was leading in key battleground polls after President Biden's poor debate performance and the GOP was rallying around Trump after an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. The freshman Ohio senator was viewed as the MAGA heir apparent to the party's future.

But in the run-up to Tuesday's vice presidential debate between Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, there have been two conflicting forces at work on the trail: the message that Vance wants to get out, and what actually sticks.

Take his first solo campaign rally in his hometown, just days after the RNC, where he delivered a populist speech vowing to help lift up ""forgotten communities all across our country.""

""We're going to fight for every single worker in this country,"" he said. ""If you work hard and play by the rules, you ought to be able to put a good dinner on the table and send your kids to whatever vacation and whatever school you want to.""

But another line that broke through to the public -- and not for good reason -- was a comment about Diet Mountain Dew.

""Democrats say that it is racist to believe -- well, they say it's racist to do anything,"" he said. ""I had a Diet Mountain Dew yesterday and one today. I'm sure they're going to call that racist, too.""

In the days that followed, Trump struggled to quickly pivot his campaign message to address Vice President Harris after President Biden dropped out of the race, but Vance was quick to fill in the gaps to question her record and make her the focus of attacks on immigration, inflation and other top Republican issues.

When Harris named Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate and the pair embarked on a swing state blitz, Vance was there, too, countering the Democratic message with the case for a Republican presidency.

""It is normal people who suffer when Kamala Harris refuses to do her job, and it is normal people who stand to benefit the most when we re-elect Donald J. Trump president of the United States,"" he said in Philadelphia.

But Vance's rapid ascension in politics means he has relatively less experience as a campaigner, delivering stump speeches or handling the intense scrutiny on past and present statements.

So the prebuttal tour came as Vance was also dealing with uproar over old comments he made deriding Democrats in charge as quote ""childless cat ladies.""

""It's not a criticism of people who don't have children,"" Vance said in an interview with Megyn Kelly. ""I explicitly said in my remarks despite the fact the media has lied about this that this is not about criticizing people who for various reasons didn't have kids. This is about criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-child.""

But the damage was done, as Vance's old comments provided Democrats an opening to attack the GOP ticket as sexist and out of touch.

Then, there's more recent remarks, like a weeks-long inflammatory crusade against Haitian migrants living in Springfield, Ohio that Vance has sought to use as a cudgel to attack Democrats over immigration.

""The American media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and I started talking about cat memes,"" Vance said in a Sept. 15 CNN interview. ""If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do.""

State and local Republican leaders in Ohio have rejected claims made by Trump and Vance about Haitian migrants in Springfield. The city's mayor told news outlets that Vance's staff knew the conspiracies about eating pets were false before Trump uttered the lies on the debate stage last month.

Several times, Vance has also staked out policy positions for the ticket that Trump has later disagreed with or shot down, like when Vance said that Trump would veto a national abortion ban.

""I didn't discuss it with JD, in all fairness,"" Trump said on the debate stage. ""And I don't mind if he has a certain view, but I don't think he was speaking for me.""

Where Trump offered a ""concept of a plan"" for health care, Vance answered a question after a Raleigh, North Carolina campaign speech with more details of how Republicans would overhaul health insurance risk pools under the Affordable Care Act, a broadly unpopular proposal.

Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Vance has also been prolific when it comes to messaging campaign goals, frequently doing media interviews, delivering speeches and taking questions after most every stop -- prioritizing local journalists.

But those Q and A sessions can turn contentious, with the crowd often booing questions from journalists as Vance takes the opportunity to paint himself as a pugilist for Trump, whether it be queries about interest rate cuts or questions about the campaign's support of North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who allegedly called himself a ""Black Nazi"" among other things on a porn forum more than a decade ago. (Robinson has denied the allegation.)

Vance, who was a combat correspondent in the Marine Corps, regularly lectures reporters about what he perceives to be unfair coverage of him and frequently directs them to ask Harris questions instead.

Even in more casual campaign settings, Vance has struggled at times to connect. At one stop at a doughnut shop in Valdosta, Georgia, an employee was awkwardly put on the spot by the candidate -- she then asked not to be filmed on camera. On another visit to a Pennsylvania sandwich shop last weekend, Vance was left standing outside in a parking lot after some initial confusion because staff at the shop were never given advance notice of his visit.

All of these things have contributed to Vance having the lowest favorability rating on this year's presidential ballot -- and one of the lowest of any VP pick in recent history."
"Poll workers can be hard to find. In Nebraska, election officials can draft them",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/nx-s1-4990797/nebraska-elections-poll-worker-draft,2024-10-01T09:06:20Z,"OMAHA, Neb. -- Joe Ricceri is busy preparing for the general election with the Douglas County Election Commission. Right now, he works at the customer service desk. But on Election Day, he'll be a district supervisor.

Ricceri is currently a volunteer. But he didn't start out as one. He was drafted.

He was actually drafted when his children were little, but deferred until they were old enough to drive themselves home from school.

""Then immediately, when the youngest was 16, [the county] contacted me. So, they were all over it. They did a good job there,"" he said with a wry laugh.

Finding poll workers is a regular challenge for election officials. But Nebraska has a unique solution: It allows counties to draft workers to fill needs, like it's jury duty.

The secretary of state's office says it's only aware of two Nebraska counties using a poll worker draft this election cycle: Omaha's Douglas County and just south of it, Sarpy County.

In Douglas County, any registered voter is eligible and may receive a letter in the mail requiring them to serve. Even though it's been used for years, Douglas County Election Commissioner Brian Kruse said many voters aren't familiar with the draft and are skeptical when they receive the letter.

""I would say most voters in Douglas County, probably their reaction is, 'Is this for real?'"" Kruse said. ""I mean, one of my best friends is the COO of a company here in Omaha, and one of his employees got [the letter], and he called me up, and he was like, 'Is this for real?' And I said, 'Yes.' And he said, 'Can I get him out of it?' And I said, 'No.'""

Kruse laughed at the memory, but he's not kidding. Voters here can't get out of the draft unless they're over 70 years old, don't speak English, or they take themselves off the voter rolls. Kruse said that is rare.

And if a draftee doesn't show up or doesn't answer that letter, they could face a misdemeanor charge.

In recent years, about half of the county's 3,000 general election workers were drafted.

""We try to get as many volunteers as we can,"" said Election Board Coordinator Brandon Olson. ""Still, we don't want to just go, 'OK, we're just gonna draft everybody.' That's not what we're doing, but ... it gives us a confidence that we aren't going to be worried about finding people.""

That's unlike a lot of the rest of the country, even if the situation has somewhat recovered from a nationwide election shortage during the peak of the COVID pandemic, according to Marta Hanson, national program manager for the group Power the Polls.

""I would say, generally speaking, about 40% of jurisdictions we're in touch with have been like, 'Actually, we're set, we're good, we're fully staffed, we have no issues. Please don't send us more people, because they'll just be disappointed,'"" she said. ""Another 40% are in desperate need of more people.""

Douglas County's draft also fills staffing needs with a more diverse group of people -- especially when many election workers are over 70.

Commissioner Kruse added that those drafted must be balanced in political party, so it's not all registered Republicans or all Democrats. The county works to ensure all five of Nebraska's political parties and nonpartisans are represented.

Carolina Lopez, executive director of the Partnership for Large Election Jurisdictions, was excited to hear about the program.

""I'm going to say it: I was geeking out. I was like, 'Tell me more. I've heard about this in practice. I want to see it,'"" she said.

Lopez said she's rooting for Douglas County and can't wait to see how the draft works this year.

""While this has been in practice in Douglas County for some time, this idea has the potential to be equally impactful for other elections communities across the country,"" she added.

Kruse said some other jurisdictions have shown interest in the method, but he hasn't seen other states employ anything like it -- yet.

Douglas is the only Nebraska county that regularly uses the draft, and Kruse thinks it may be because other jurisdictions are smaller, with fewer polling places, so they don't have as much trouble finding enough workers.

Some voters may view the poll worker draft as a pain, but Kruse said many of the draftees turn into longtime volunteers -- like Ricceri.

And he said the draft also helps more people understand fair elections.

""We have all kinds of processes and procedures in place, but it definitely gives us a broader base and we reach out to a lot more individuals, and so those individuals can see how the process works,"" Kruse said. ""They can go back to their neighborhoods, their PTAs, their schools, daycares, churches, synagogues, country clubs, grocery store, wherever they may socialize, and tell folks about the experience. We do hear over and over: 'I had no idea what all went into the process.'""

Kerri Harris received her draft letter in the mail before the primary election in May. The concept was new to Harris, who had lived in the county for 18 years. She remembered she had mixed feelings about it.

""Because I was like, well, I should serve and be a good citizen. And then it was like, that's a long day, and what if I wasn't available? You know, how do they do all that? Like, what happens to me if I don't do it? You know, it seemed kind of serious, really, like you're supposed to do this,"" she said.

Harris said she never would have volunteered to be an election worker; she does not have a big interest in politics, and she prefers to be outside rather than sitting inside a polling location.

All those who are voluntold must serve not just one election, but four. Once someone serves in four, they won't be drafted again. Harris will serve in the November general plus two more before she completes her draft duty.

Harris' service comes as some voters are questioning elections.

""I've learned a lot that I don't question the integrity of the election at all, because I see everything that everybody has to go through to make sure that the right people vote,"" she said. ""So, I think it says a lot for the integrity of Douglas County.""

Draftee-turned-volunteer Ricceri said he sees value in playing a role in the democratic process.

""You're doing the justice for the people to vote and allowing them to vote and have a voice in the government. So that's important.""

And it's an important election year in Nebraska. Voters can look forward to a packed ballot filled with six initiatives -- including on abortion and marijuana -- as well as two U.S. senators and the president. It's also the first general election in which voters are required to present an ID.

As of now, the drafted election workers and volunteers have completed their online training. But they may still get one more letter telling them they're not needed for this election, and to keep their mailboxes open for the next one."
DeSantis administration warns local TV stations to remove ads about abortion ballot measure,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/desantis-abortion-rights-florida-amendment-4-caroline-ad-rcna174387,2024-10-08T10:47:32Z,"The Republican administration is pressuring Florida stations to take down an ad that promotes a ""yes"" vote on Amendment 4, which would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration had already tried to put its thumb on the scale against Amendment 4, a statewide measure that could enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. And now the admin has added to that disturbing trend.

Florida's six-week abortion ban is one of the strictest in the country. The DeSantis administration recently had its election police unit investigate people who had signed a petition to get Amendment 4 on the ballot. Then the administration used taxpayer money to launch an anti-abortion website. The administration also used state money to air Orwellian television ads proclaiming that ""Florida cares about women and families.""

Now the DeSantis administration appears to be trying to intimidate people who have run an ad that promotes a ""yes"" vote on Amendment 4.

""The doctors knew if I did not end my pregnancy, I would lose my baby, I would lose my life, and my daughter would lose her mom,"" a woman says in the ad, titled ""Caroline.""

""Florida has now banned abortion even in cases like mine,"" she says.

Investigative journalist Jason Garcia published a letter from the Florida Department of Health's general counsel to the general manager of WFLA-TV, the NBC affiliate in the Tampa Bay area. The letter, dated Oct. 3, argues that the ad contains a ""categorically false"" claim about abortion in Florida -- and warns that the ad is in violation of state law.

""The advertisement is not only false; it is dangerous,"" the letter reads. ""Women faced with pregnancy complications posing a serious risk of death or substantial or irreversible physical impairment may and should seek medical treatment in Florida.""

In practice, Florida's law hasn't been so clear. Even though the law includes exceptions for rape and incest in certain cases, the law has confused doctors and caused a chilling effect among providers. The problem has been so glaring that the DeSantis administration has threatened doctors who don't provide emergency care in these confusing scenarios, which are only occurring because of the law Republicans put in place.

In another letter Garcia posted online, lawyers for the group sponsoring Amendment 4 defended the ad as true and urged a Florida TV station to continue carrying it.

The Florida Department of Health's letter ""is a flagrant abuse of power and must be rejected,"" the lawyers wrote.

The DeSantis administration sure seems like it's attempting to hide the dangerous impacts of Florida's abortion laws from public view."
Harris attacked MAGA misogyny head-on in 'Call Her Daddy' interview,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-call-her-daddy-interview-alex-cooper-rcna174337,2024-10-07T21:05:54Z,"The Democratic presidential hopeful's appearance on the popular ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast was a clear rebuttal to Donald Trump and the MAGA movement. And Harris pulled no punches.

Kamala Harris sat for an interview on the popular podcast ""Call Her Daddy,"" for an episode that was released over the weekend. The podcast, helmed by host Alex Cooper, is known for being particularly popular with young women.

The interview was part of the Democratic presidential campaign's ongoing strategy of using sit-downs with nontraditional media sources to spread its messaging to targeted groups. Harris recently did an interview on ""All the Smoke,"" a sports-focused podcast known for its popularity among men of color. On Tuesday, she will be interviewed by Howard Stern, a longtime shock jock with a large male audience.

Trump also has gone on a tour of nontraditional media, though his podcast-heavy schedule has seemed structured almost entirely to shore up his support with men (albeit in some pretty juvenile ways). Harris' ""Call Her Daddy"" interview was the antithesis of that.

Where Trump and his movement have embraced the chauvinism of the 19th and 20th century and obsessed over ""tradwives"" -- women defined by their roles as homemakers and caretakers -- the Democratic candidate spoke to the podcast's massive audience of women and encouraged them to define themselves.

Harris said her mom had taught her and her sister ""the importance of us being able to express how we were feeling,"" that they ""had agency"" in how their lives played out, and that they ought to ""figure out how you can take charge of a moment.""

When Cooper asked Harris about Trump's thinly veiled sexist attacks, in which he has called her ""crazy, weak, fake and dumb,"" the VP replied: ""I think it's really important not to let other people define you.""

At one point, the conversation shifted to the crisis of domestic and sexual violence against women. Cooper said many of her listeners have described the shame and the terror they feel about coming forward, but Harris -- a former prosecutor -- told listeners not to ""quietly suffer"" and advised them to ""tell someone that you trust.""

And when Cooper asked about how we can make the country safer for women, Harris did an effective job of explaining how women's economic independence factors into the equation. She said:

This narrative about empowering women economically runs counter to the GOP's attack on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that can assist women in the workplace.

Harris also spoke about the impact of abortion bans, describing the harrowing reality of women who are forced to travel out of state to receive reproductive care -- assuming they even have the money and means to do so.

And she attacked conservatives' arcane view of women when asked to address Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' claim that Harris ""doesn't have anything keeping her humble"" because she does not have biological children. (The vice president, of course, has two stepchildren.)

""I don't think she understands that there are a whole lot of women out here who, one, are not aspiring to be humble,"" Harris said of Sanders. ""Two, a whole lot of women out here who have a lot of love in their life, family in their life and children in their life, and I think it's really important for women to lift each other up.""

The interview was essentially a message to young women that they don't have to accept the MAGA movement's restrictive roles for them -- and that the Harris campaign supports them leading more self-determined lives."
"Katie Phang: As questions swirl over Trump's mental fitness, is Vance ready to be president?",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/vance-25-amendment-trump-presidency-rcna174325,2024-10-07T20:08:02Z,"In some ways, vice presidents are like understudies; you may never need them to step into the breach but they're there just in case something goes wrong.

And as we inch closer to November's election, I want you to consider this: If elected, Donald Trump -- who is currently 78 years old, regularly frequents McDonald's, and loves his Diet Cokes -- would end his second term as the oldest person ever to serve as president of the United States. On the final day of his presidency in January 2029, Trump would be 82 years, seven months and six days old.

The former president's rambling, meandering speeches on the campaign trail have led some mental health experts to go on the record, raising concerns about his potential cognitive decline. Despite these concerns, Trump refuses to release even the most basic information about his health.

So what happens if Trump wins in November and then, days, weeks, months or years into his presidency, dies or becomes incapacitated and can no longer serve? Well, according to Section 1 of the 25th Amendment, in that event, the vice president would become the president automatically.

To state it plainly: Sen. JD Vance is a heartbeat away from the presidency of the United States. The same Vance who, right now, has poll numbers labeling him the least popular vice-presidential candidate of the 21st century -- unsurprising given his many extremist views on everything from child care to the truth of who won the 2020 election. I mean, not admitting your running mate lost the last election is a huge red flag that you have an issue with the truth.

During last week's vice-presidential debate, Vance got caught in another lie. The senator claimed he never supported a national abortion ban. However, in 2022 while he was running for the Senate, Vance said on a podcast he ""certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally.""

Then there's his extremist stances. Also during that 2022 run for the Senate, Vance delivered a 30-minute speech titled ""The Universities are the Enemy"" at the National Conservatism Conference.

""I think if any of us want to do the things that we want to do for our country and for the people who live in it, we have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country,"" the then-candidate told the crowd. ""Ladies and gentlemen, the universities do not pursue knowledge and truth, they pursue deceit and lies, and it's time to be honest about that fact.""

Now, in my opinion, the best way to pursue a good and fulfilling life is through education, but it seems Yale-educated Vance wants to overhaul the education system in his image. Under Project 2025, a Trump-Vance administration could eliminate the Department of Education, privatize K-12, and dismantle the current collegiate system.

He's a threat to everything Americans hold dear: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And if something were to happen to Trump, the big job would go to Vance: the guy who refuses to acknowledge that Trump lost the 2020 election, promotes anti-immigrant hate rhetoric, and supports a national abortion ban.

And let's be clear, 40-year-old Vance is fully aware that Trump is 78 years old. You're kidding yourself if you think he didn't consider Trump's physical and mental health issues when contemplating his career advancement and upward mobility prospects as the Republican VP nominee.

So, before you cast your ballot in this year's election, you should remember this: Any vote for Donald Trump is a vote for a potential automatic JD Vance presidency. Vote accordingly."
Opinion | Texas and Florida are too big an opportunity for Dems to pass up,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/senate-texas-florida-democrats-cruz-scott-rcna174071,2024-10-07T10:26:25Z,"With the path to maintaining their Senate majority narrowing, Democrats are going on the offense against Sens. Ted Cruz and Rick Scott.

Democrats can look at Florida and Texas in a couple of ways. From one angle, the states are both places where victory has been just out of reach -- a tantalizing ""what if?"" From another, they offer an unlearned lesson in heartbreak, a constant loop of Lucy yanking the football away from Charlie Brown at the last second.

For now, the former point of view is winning out as Senate Democrats look to hold on to their slim majority. A new wave of money and interest has begun to pour into Florida and Texas as polls show tightening races and Election Day fast approaches. And with incumbents like Republican Sens. Rick Scott of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas as their targets, it's not hard to see why Democrats see going on the offense as a risk worth taking.

The electoral map was never a good one for Senate Democrats this cycle, forced to defend far more seats than their Republican counterparts. With the GOP set to claim a seat from retiring Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.Va., the upper house is already starting from a 50-50 split. The odds for Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., pulling off an upset in his now deep-red state have continued to narrow, forcing Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to look elsewhere for a path to a majority. And that road requires knocking off at least one of the two least likable members of the GOP caucus.

Things are looking tight in Texas again this time around, with Democratic Rep. Colin Allred closing in on Cruz. Most polls still have Cruz ahead by around 3 points, but an outlier run by Morning Consult had the congressman up by 1 point. That's still within the margin of error, but the numbers have galvanized Democrats' hope that the state might be a jump ball. Accordingly, the Cook Political Report shifted the rating in that race from ""likely Republican"" to ""lean Republican"" on Tuesday, reflecting Allred's momentum.

Cruz at least is extremely aware of his own vulnerability. He roared into the Senate in 2012 and quickly made a name for himself as a darling of the far-right tea party movement. But his bid for president in 2016 faltered and his first re-election bid in 2018 ended up a squeaker that he won by less than 3 points. In the last two years, as he's prepared to face voters again, Cruz has sought to refashion himself as a bipartisan moderate, a hard task when you've built your whole brand on being a provocateur and ideological bomb-thrower.

Scott, on the other hand, hasn't bothered following Cruz's lead in playing for the middle (despite winning his seat that same year by just 0.1 points). Instead, the first-term senator is angling to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., at the top of the GOP caucus and take the title of majority leader, if all goes according to plan. But his time at the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee during the most recent midterms wasn't exactly a wild success, nor was his bid to pounce against McConnell last year.

Former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell isn't faring quite as well against Scott as Allred is against Cruz, but she is gaining traction. Five Thirty Eight's polling average has Scott up by 4 points, which is half of the lead he held over the summer. Mucarsel-Powell has also been set on making the race into a referendum on reproductive rights. In doing so, she's hoping to draw enough support from the abortion amendment on the ballot to negate any benefit Scott could get from riding former President Donald Trump's coattails.

The optimistic view is that each contest could be won with either more dedicated discipline from local Democrats or greater resources and attention from the national party. But recent history has shown that neither is a guarantee of success. Cruz's challenger in 2018, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, was popular both locally and nationally, seen as a real contender at finally winning a statewide race in Texas after a more than 20-year drought for Democrats. Likewise, former Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., transformed her race in 2022 against Sen. Marco Rubio into a national referendum on the GOP, but neither managed to unseat their opponent.

Those two races raised -- and spent -- a jaw-dropping amount of money in the process. O'Rourke's campaign drew in a staggering $80 million, the most a single U.S. Senate candidate has ever raised. Demings managed to raise almost as much for her race, considerably outspending Rubio in the process. This year, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee announced in late September that both Mucasal-Powell and Allred will get support in the form of a multimillion-dollar ad buy in their states, but the DSCC has yet to disclose exactly how much is going to each candidate.

The two biggest unknowns in these races are factors outside of the individual candidates' control: infrastructure and demographics.

Florida was once the biggest swing state in the country but has shifted to the right in the last decade, producing blowout wins for the GOP in the 2022 midterms. It doesn't help that the Democratic Party there has been a bit of a mess, if we're being honest, which has left a vacuum for Trump to fill in his new home state. And Scott, who has already spent $8 million of his own money in this race, is sure to keep shoveling in cash to offset the DSCC's investment.

Conversely, Texas is deep Republican territory that Democrats have spent the last decade trying to transform into a purple state. An influx of people into the Austin and Houston metro areas has come with a boost in liberal voters. A major question mark hovers over how the state's Latinos wind up voting this year, as the GOP has been making major inroads with border communities. Meanwhile, Texas' Republican attorney general has been cracking down on voting rights, potentially alienating Latinos in the process.

With less than four weeks to go, this is not an ideal scenario for Democrats. There's plenty of reason for cynicism in the face of these odds and so many prior disappointments. But with this much on the line, there's little choice but to square up and take a running start at that football again. Better to land flat on your back than be left wishing you'd taken the chance at dispatching the likes of Scott and Cruz."
Opinion | An awful lie about Haitian migrants led to this threat against citizens far away,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/ohio-sheriff-kamala-harris-yard-signs-rcna172572,2024-10-05T11:59:10Z,"There appears to be a campaign among some conservatives to bully everybody else into political inactivity or silence.

The hateful lie pushed by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating their neighbors' pets not only endangered those migrants, it also led to an Ohio sheriff three hours away threatening citizens who show support for the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.

In a Sept. 13 Facebook post that he later claimed ""may have been a little misinterpreted,"" Portage County Sheriff Bruce Zuchowski suggested tracking ""all the addresses of the people who had [Harris] signs in their yards"" so that ""when the Illegal human 'Locust' (which she supports!) Need places to live...We'll already have the addresses of their New families...who supported their arrival!""

There's no misinterpreting the racism in that post, described to me by the county's NAACP president as ""vile and egregious."" There's no excusing the lie from the sheriff that Springfield's Haitians -- who are there as part of a federal humanitarian program for migrants -- are here illegally. On top of that, referring to human beings as pests (ravenous pests, at that) has preceded too many global atrocities for Zuchowski's hateful statements to be excused.

And that's before we get to heart of the matter, which is that Zuchowski veered into unconstitutional territory with the suggestion that residents lawfully expressing a political opinion warrant law enforcement's attention. Zuchowski's defense -- that he has a ""First Amendment right"" to post what he did -- is doubly offensive. His status as a public servant ought to come before his desire to express his opinion, and his post made his constituents afraid their government would be monitoring their constitutionally protected expression of speech.

Zuchowski, who has declined to speak to NBC News and multiple media outlets, took down his post after the Portage County NAACP and the League of Women Voters complained to the Ohio secretary of state, and as the Ohio ACLU was gearing up to sue him. But if Zuchowski succeeded in making people afraid that he and his deputies are watching their political activity, it seems unlikely that his deleting the post is enough to make them breathe easy.

On its face, the story out of Portage County, where I happen to have multiple loved ones who vote, is evidence that a malignant lie about an innocent immigrant population metastasized into a threat against innocent citizens hours away. But it's also part of what appears to be a larger campaign from conservatives to bully everybody else into political inactivity or silence.

In Florida, voters who signed a petition that put that state's abortion referendum on the ballot cried foul at being questioned by Gov. Ron DeSantis' election police unit. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton executed search warrants against members of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), one of America's oldest Latino civil rights groups, about two weeks after LULAC endorsed Harris' presidential campaign. He says he was investigating ""allegations of election fraud and vote harvesting"" in 2022. The Republican National Committee's so-called ""Protect the Vote"" project aims to recruit people from the suburbs to monitor the polls in urban Democratic strongholds, which it has falsely declared are hotbeds of voting fraud.

""I've never felt less protected and more scared than I do right now,"" a resident of Ravenna, Ohio, wrote Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, according to the Akron Beacon Journal. At least 59 residents complained to Yost's office, the paper reported. Zuchowski ""has made me feel unsafe in my home of 24 years,"" a Kent resident said.

Portage County NAACP President Renee Romine said at the emergency meeting her organization held about Zuchowski's post that there were ""people almost in tears"" and ""not wanting to go to the voting polls"" because Zuchowki's office provides security for in-person absentee voting. ""People did not even want to go and vote if they were going to be there.""

The county's board of elections voted to remove the sheriff's office from that security role, which Romine described as a ""big win for the people."" But to Freda Levenson, the legal director of the ACLU of Ohio, the win was Zuchowski removing the offending post.

""We were going to ask a federal judge to make him take down his post. So as soon as he took down his post, we no longer had anything to ask for,"" she said. ""He backed down, which is what we wanted. Not just what we wanted, it's what the Constitution required him to do.""

But what the ACLU counts as a win may be cold comfort to Portage County voters. He made a post about monitoring who's supporting Harris. There's no reason they should believe that his being forced to take the post down has been accompanied by any change of heart."
Why the race for control of the U.S. Senate is intensifying,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/race-control-us-senate-intensifying-rcna174013,2024-10-04T17:04:32Z,"Which party will control the U.S. Senate next year? With 11 closely watched contests, the chamber appears to be up for grabs.

As most fair-minded observers would probably agree, the race for the White House remains anybody's guess. No matter who wins the presidential contest, however, he or she is going to look to the U.S. Senate to help govern, and as it turns out, figuring out which party will be in the chamber's majority next year isn't easy, either.

As regular readers know, the Senate Democratic conference currently has a one-seat majority, but with Sen. Joe Manchin retiring in West Virginia, Republicans have, for all intents and purposes, already flipped one seat.

With this in mind, Republicans will need a net gain of just one additional seat to secure a majority, which is hardly unrealistic given the number of tough races in states where there's currently a Democratic incumbent -- including races in states where Donald Trump is all but certain to win easily.

So where do things stand with 32 days remaining? Let's take stock.

There are, by most measures, 11 Senate races that could credibly be described as ""competitive."" Taking them one at a time, in alphabetical order:

Arizona: Incumbent independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema is retiring

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego has led failed Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake in nearly every poll for months, and with an abortion-rights ballot measure likely to boost turnout, Gallego is the clear favorite.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Despite Lake's baggage from her 2022 race, the election denier isn't being blown out, and the fact that the race is competitive is keeping Democratic money flowing into the state, instead of other contests.

Florida: Incumbent Republican Sen. Rick Scott is seeking a second term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: The far-right incumbent is not well liked; he has no accomplishments or record of successes; an abortion-rights ballot measure likely to boost turnout; and polls suggest former Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is keeping this contest far more competitive than most thought possible.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: At the end of the day, Florida is a red state, filled with voters who probably won't care about the senator's awful record; Scott is able to invest heavily thanks to his considerable personal fortune; and Mucarsel-Powell is struggling to keep up financially in a massive state with several expensive media market.

Maryland: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin is retiring

Why Democrats feel good about the race: In one of the nation's reliably blue states, Angela Alsobrooks' polling lead appears to be growing, and it won't hurt that there's an abortion-rights ballot measure on the statewide ballot.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Larry Hogan remains popular in the state, and the former governor is benefiting from massive investments from Republican megadonors.

Michigan: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow is retiring

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Most recent polling shows Elissa Slotkin well positioned to prevail in a state that has elected a Republican senator only once in the past 50 years.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Despite former Rep. Mike Rogers' baggage -- he moved to Florida after retiring from Congress -- he's keeping the race close.

Montana: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is seeking a fourth term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Tester is a respected and accomplished incumbent, running on a record of success, and it won't hurt that there's an abortion-rights ballot measure on the statewide ballot.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Polls suggest Tester is nevertheless losing to a struggling Republican businessman who's facing controversies surrounding his racist rhetoric, his record of dishonesty about a gunshot wound, and alleged plagiarism in his book.

Nebraska: Incumbent Republican Sen. Deb Fischer is seeking a third term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Independent Dan Osborn has stunned much of the political world by running a strong race -- Republicans have scrambled in recent weeks to start airing ads in a state they expected to ignore -- and polls suggest he's within striking distance of an upset victory. The fact that the ballot will include measures on abortion policy might also help tip the scales.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: At the end of the day Nebraska is a reliably ruby-red state.

Nevada: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen is seeking a second term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Nevada is one of the nation's most closely divided battleground states, but polls suggest Rosen is well positioned to prevail. Nevada is also one of the states with an abortion-rights measure on the statewide ballot.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Republican Sam Brown isn't far behind the incumbent, and there's still a lot of GOP money backing his candidacy.

Ohio: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is seeking a fourth term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Like Tester in Montana, Brown is a respected and accomplished incumbent, running on a record of success. Unlike Tester, recent polling shows Brown hanging on to a small lead.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Bernie Moreno isn't exactly an impressive candidate, and he isn't exactly running a good campaign, but he's still within 3 points of a popular senator, thanks in large part to the fact that Ohio is becoming a reliably red state.

Pennsylvania: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey is seeking a fourth term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Like Tester in Montana and Brown in Ohio, Casey is a respected and accomplished incumbent, running on a record of success. The latest polls also show the senator with modest but steady leads.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Despite his carpetbagger problem, Dave McCormick is still within striking distance of defeating a longtime incumbent.

Texas: Incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz is seeking a third term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Democratic Rep. Colin Allred is exactly the kind of candidate who can appeal to a broad audience in Texas -- ""Republicans for Allred"" has some established and well-known figures on board -- and many GOP insiders have started to express real anxiety in response to surprisingly close polls.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: For all of Cruz's many troubles, he still has an ""R"" after his name in Texas. With Trump expected to win the state with relative ease, are there really a significant number of voters who will vote for Trump and Allred on the same ballot? GOP insiders believe the answer is no.

Wisconsin: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin is seeking a third term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Like Tester in Montana, Brown in Ohio, and Casey in Pennsylvania, Baldwin is a respected and accomplished incumbent, running on a record of success. The latest polls also show the senator with modest-but-steady leads.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: In a dynamic similar to the Ohio contest, Eric Hovde isn't exactly an impressive candidate, and he isn't exactly running a good campaign, but he's still within 5 points of a popular senator."
Trump reshares a video portraying himself as God's gift to earth,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/god-made-trump-video-christian-nationalism-masculinity-rcna173945,2024-10-04T10:38:48Z,"""I need somebody with arms strong enough to wrestle the deep state and yet gentle enough to deliver his own grandchild.""

That creepy line comes from a video called ""God Made Trump,"" which Donald Trump has shared in the past and did so again Wednesday. It's essentially an ad that portrays the Republican presidential nominee as God's gift to Earth.

As Phoebe Jones wrote for California's Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey earlier this year, the video -- which plays on Paul Harvey's ""So God Made a Farmer"" speech -- shows how Trump and the Christian nationalist movement he leads are steeped in toxic notions of masculinity:

At one point, the ad literally says God needed a man who cares for the flock, as if to reiterate God's purported preference. Trump has leaned into this kind of messianic masculinity with some of his recent rhetoric.

And evidence suggests that all of this is likely to appeal to Trump's base, given the conservative movement's evangelical beliefs and arcane ideas of manhood and masculinity. A Public Religion Research Institute poll from September, examining the connection between authoritarianism and Christian nationalism in the U.S., found that nearly 7 in 10 Republicans think society has become too soft or feminine.

The poll also found Christian nationalist ""adherents"" or ""sympathizers"" were more likely than others to agree with these statements:

Today's fiercely Christian conservative movement in the U.S. has become a hypermasculine cult of personality with Trump at the helm. He has permitted Christian men to cloak their desires for domination and power in religiosity -- and is even selling Trump-branded Bibles.

And men in this movement have made hay with their shamelessness, openly promoting misogynistic policies like bans on abortion and trying to end no-fault divorces (along with discouraging abused women from divorcing their partners).

This hypermasculinization of the American church has coincided with a perhaps predictable trend. As The New York Times reported last week:

My suspicion is that this is a byproduct of MAGA masculinity pervading American Christianity -- and crowding out young women who, given the choice, don't want to suffer underneath it."

If you already know which candidate you're supporting in the presidential race between Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris -- not to mention everything from governor down to local school board -- it can be frustrating to wait for these seemingly indecisive, procrastinating Americans to get to it.

But late deciders are important, and this year, I think they are the reason that Harris may have a chance to win Georgia, North Carolina and Florida.

No, that's not a typo. I said what I said. President Joe Biden won Georgia in 2020, and North Carolina has been close for a while. But Florida? The one state where the promise of a ""red wave"" in the 2022 midterms actually materialized? The state that has voted for Trump both times he's been on the ballot? It's still close enough that a late-breaking group of Harris voters could make a difference.

Now, it's important to understand who these voters are. I think of them as intentional voters, because they'll usually tell you what they think of the candidates and the race or that they don't intend to vote at all. Months out from the election, if you were to ask whom they'd vote for, they'll give a reflexive response. They'll cite something they heard in an ad or skimmed in a news article that may or may not closely approximates which candidate they're leaning toward. In fact, that candidate may not be whom they end up supporting.

But, as we get closer to Election Day, these voters become more engaged. Their intentions begin to shift and may even harden into support as they read up on the two candidates, listen closer to their arguments, and shift their attitudes. When they do, they can change the political landscape dramatically in short order.

That's especially likely in the 2024 election, which has seen a lot of tumult so far.

Consider when Biden dropped out of the race and Harris became his successor. The country saw 40,000 new voter registrations in just 48 hours, according to Vote.org CEO Andrea Hailey. That's a 700% increase in the site's daily registrations, and young voters accounted for 80% of them. According to ActBlue, the campaign and its joint fundraising committee raised more than $86 million from online donors, many of whom were donating for the first time. This averaged out to around $65 per person from more than a million people. That's a lot of voters who were activated quite suddenly.

Or look at Taylor Swift's influence. Her Instagram post endorsing Harris and urging her fans to vote regardless of their candidate led to at least 337,000 visits to Vote.org. That's a large group of potential voters who were quickly activated and are not likely to be casting their ballot for Trump.

There are also signs that Trump's own popularity has been slipping. Those signs aren't coming from polls, but from his actual performance in the primaries as his own voters shift in their intentions since the Republican convention, as career political adviser Mike Madrid recently noted.

Finally, there's the potential for local issues to have a dramatic effect on turnout.

North Carolinians may turn out to rebuke Trump-endorsed Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson in the state's gubernatorial race. Robinson recently made headlines for allegedly referring to himself as a ""Black Nazi"" on a porn site forum, among a litany of other disgusting comments, all of which he denies making. That's in addition to his extremist views on abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.

Trump has distanced himself from Robinson but not pulled his endorsement, and it's not clear if that would even help at this point.

Then there's Georgia. In past elections there, we've seen controversial voting policies be met with determination and expanded turnout due to the resilience of Peach State voters, pushing Democrats to statewide victory in a presidential election and three Senate races. It's possible some of the last-minute, ham-fisted changes to election rules by the state Board of Elections will also provoke a backlash.

And in Florida, voters will also be considering ballot measures to legalize recreational cannabis and codify abortion rights -- popular policies that align with the Harris-Walz agenda.

To be clear, I'm not saying that Harris will outright win Georgia, North Carolina or Florida -- or even that she'll win at all. What I am saying is that the polls can't yet capture what these late deciders intend to do. It happened in 2016 when Trump won unexpectedly, in 2020 when Biden won even as down-ballot Republicans did well, and in 2022 when a much-prophesied red wave failed to materialize. Yeah, those late voters can be pretty intentional

So, as you're going over the polls and casting about for some kind of clue as to what may happen, remember that there's still a lot of uncertainty. The only thing you can do is cast your own ballot, encourage your friends and family to do the same and volunteer to help out a campaign and persuade as many intentional voters as you can along the way. After that, all you can do is wait as they make their intentions known."
Melania Trump reveals pro-abortion stance that's completely at odds with the GOP,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/melania-trump-abortion-rights-book-rcna173791,2024-10-03T16:37:17Z,"The former first lady's revelation is hard to square, given her husband's singular role in rolling back a right she calls essential to women ""from birth.""

In her forthcoming self-titled memoir, Melania Trump espouses an unflinching belief in abortion rights -- a view on one of the biggest issues of the election that is entirely antithetical to that of her husband and her political party.

In reviewing an early copy of her book, The Guardian reports that Melania Trump says it is ""imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy"" in deciding whether to have children, ""free from any intervention or pressure from the government.""

""Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body,"" she adds.

On Thursday morning, she also posted a video to social media that references her position on abortion rights. ""Without a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth: individual freedom,"" Melania Trump says in the video. ""What does 'my body, my choice' really mean?""

According to the Guardian, Melania Trump's book acknowledges the extreme circumstances in which some people make such decisions, including rape, incest or severe medical conditions in the fetus. But she also defends abortion access later in a pregnancy, which her husband has repeatedly demonized and misrepresented as a ""radical"" Democratic view.

She writes:

The former first lady's revelation is astonishing, given how out of step she is with her party, and in light of her husband's singular role in rolling back the right that she professes is essential to women ""from birth.""

And the timing of her declaration is no less circumspect: Melania Trump chose not reveal that she is pro-abortion when Roe v. Wade was overturned, or after Republican legislatures imposed draconian state abortion bans, which have caused preventable deaths and forced women to travel out of their states for the procedure. Rather, her apparently unwavering belief in abortion rights comes just ahead of a closely contested election in which Republicans are trying desperately to rebrand their extreme abortion views -- and in a memoir she is selling for upwards of $40."
Opinion | JD Vance tried to mansplain his way into the good graces of women. It didn't work.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-vice-presidential-debate-fail-rcna173598,2024-10-02T23:54:23Z,"Vance admits Republicans have a problem when it comes to women's trust. That doesn't mean he has a plan.

Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance arguably had one job going into Tuesday night's debate: convince the American public that he, and his party, don't hate women.

Even with that painfully low bar, I'd say he failed to do the job. The once anti-Trump senator did wear a pink tie, but did not face up to his past comments about menopausal women, ""childless cat ladies"" and a historically low favorability rate. Instead, he used most of his allotted speaking time to mansplain his views to the two women who were moderating, women who vote, and even his own wife.

During a question on immigration, Vance tried to talk over CBS moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, after he regurgitated dangerous lies about Haitian immigrants living in Springfield, Ohio. To Vance's dismay, Brennan reminded the audience that the immigrants in Springfield are there legally.

""The rules that you were not going to fact-check,"" Vance quipped, referring to CBS' statement that it would leave it to Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to fact check each other during the debate. ""And since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.""

Vance talked over and interrupted both O'Donnell and Brennan as they tried to move forward with the debate.

""Thank you, senator, for describing the legal process,"" Brennan said, before the network then muted Vance's mic.

""The audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Brennan said. ""We have so much we want to get into. Thank you for explaining the legal process,"" she added, in a tone every woman sitting in a cubicle, boardroom or classroom knows deep in her bones.

Unlike his windmill-, shark- and Hannibal Lecter-obsessed running mate, Vance deftly wields a very specific type of misogyny that, while far less obvious, is just as insidious -- one that can come off as empathic, but is undeniably condescending as it normalizes the most draconian right-wing policies.

One example of this was Vance consistently referring to Brennan -- a woman he does not personally know -- by her first name rather than addressing her appropriately. The slight-of-hand misogynistic move may have been Vance's attempt to appear likable and down-to-earth, but many viewers saw it differently: condescending, patronizing and rude.

Vance himself admitted that the Republican Party has a problem when it comes to women's trust. He reminded women watching Tuesday that they do not trust Republicans when it comes to abortion and the human right to bodily autonomy -- yet failed to explain how he, his running mate and his fellow party members plan to address the problem.

""We've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue where they, frankly, just don't trust us,"" Vance said, before claiming that is ""one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do.""

To demonstrate his party's commitment to earning that end, Vance lied about not supporting a nationwide abortion ban, the realities of abortion care later in pregnancy, and Minnesota's PRO Act, signed by his opponent, Gov. Tim Walz. Because nothing says ""trust me, I know what's best for you"" like holding an impromptu masterclass on gaslighting.

While Vance was able to appear far more level-headed than Trump in his fateful debate performance against Vice President Kamala Harris last month, it was Vance's faux praise of his wife while discussing the necessity of child care that truly embodied his very specific type of mansplaining and misogyny.

""I speak from this very personally because I'm married to a beautiful woman who is an incredible mother to our three beautiful kids, but is also a very, very brilliant corporate litigator, and I'm so proud of her,"" Vance began. ""But being a working mom, even for somebody with all of the advantages of my wife, is extraordinarily difficult.""

It's telling, when a man publicly laments the challenges his working wife faces, yet doesn't seem to face those same challenges as a working father. While appearing to appreciate all his wife does, Vance still chose to mansplain how hard it is to work outside the home while managing the majority of child care and household responsibilities without structural support -- the exact structural support Republicans have historically opposed.

For his bropropriating coup de gr√¢ce, Vance then pontificated on the importance of giving a ""family care model that makes choice possible.""

""The cultural pressure on young families, and especially young women, I think, makes it really hard for people to choose the family model they want,"" Vance said, ignoring how anti-abortion laws make it difficult, dangerous and in some cases impossible for women to choose when and how to start creating a ""family model"" in the first place.

Overall, it's true that during Tuesday's debate Vance succeeded in portraying himself as a level-headed, somewhat ordinary politician (if the definition of ""ordinary"" is calmly discussing the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history). But that is perhaps what makes Vance far more Machiavellian than Trump even. And it's what should put us all on high alert as we prepare to head to the polls in November."
Ali Velshi: Project 2025's plan to globalize the GOP's culture war,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/project-2025-usaid-abortion-climate-authoritarian-rcna173345,2024-10-02T21:11:47Z,"Republicans want to use one of the world's biggest humanitarian organizations to spread their far-right agenda.

No area of government seems to be safe from the clutches of Project 2025; that includes the U.S. Agency for International Development, also known as USAID. Chapter 9 of the far-right blueprint is dedicated to USAID, which distributes aid to more than 100 countries in the form of humanitarian assistance, health infrastructure and economic development.

Project 2025 sees USAID's status as one of the world's biggest humanitarian organizations as an opportunity to export its right-wing culture war obsessions to the world. That includes abortion.

On page 260, Project 2025 calls for reinstating the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy, widely known as the ""Mexico City Policy."" It's an old policy that blocks U.S. federal funding for organizations that perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning in foreign countries, first introduced by President Ronald Reagan.

But if the Mexico City policy's goal was to stop abortion ... it didn't work. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa affected by the policy, for example, saw increased abortion rates, according to a 2019 study featured in the Lancet Global Health Journal.

On page 265, Project 2025 asserts, ""The continued high rate of maternal and infant mortality is a persistent global tragedy. Contrary to current publicity, this problem is not solved by abortion."" That's actually contrary to reality. Decreased access to abortion means increased maternal mortality rates. According to the World Health Organization, nearly half of all abortions conducted worldwide are considered ""unsafe,"" and according to the Guttmacher Institute, nearly 11% of all maternal mortality comes from these unsafe abortions.

As I've said time and time again: Abortion is health care. In America and around the world, restricting abortion means restricting women's health care.

Project 2025 also wants the president to be able to dictate abortion policy worldwide. A section on page 261 reads:

The goal here is to hold the rights of women hostage, with the carrot of U.S. aid in exchange.

This chapter's war on women continues. On page 259, the plan suggests:

This head-in-the-sand approach to those big scary woke words may be in line with right-wing domestic politics, but fighting this culture war on the global stage would be an incredible disservice to women everywhere.

The USAID Office of Population and Reproductive Health actually helps fight child marriage. It also supports programs aiming to end female genital mutilation and gender-based violence. But Project 2025 is so immersed in the right-wing culture wars that it abandons all other reasoning.

Case in point: On climate change, page 257 reads: ""The aid industry claims that climate change causes poverty, which is false. Enduring conflict, government corruption, and bad economic policies are the main drivers of global poverty.""

Again, reality would disagree. The impacts of climate change, like increased frequency of extreme weather, more droughts and harsher heat, could push more than 100 million people into poverty by 2030, according to a report from the World Bank. Yes, you read that correctly: not keep 100 million people in poverty, but push 100 million more into it.

Page 257 is chock full of ideas: It suggests that:

This would be a death blow to the fight against global climate change. USAID's climate strategy is full of goals to reduce emissions, conserve at-risk ecosystems, and develop renewable energy systems around the world. Cutting this funding would hurt the folks already disproportionately feeling the effects of climate change: The 74 lowest-income nations contribute to only one-10th of emissions but stand to be affected the most by climate change.

So there you have it: Women as breeding stock and the world as a dumping ground -- that's international development courtesy of Project 2025."
"MAGA abortion bans are an attack on men's freedom, too",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/maga-abortion-bans-attack-mens-freedom-rcna173625,2024-10-02T19:49:35Z,"Men 4 Choice co-founder Oren Jacobson spoke with The ReidOut Blog about how his group is defying hypermasculine norms and tagging men into the fight for reproductive rights.

This post is the third in ""MAGA and Masculinity in 2024,"" an ongoing series examining the societal fallout from right-wing hypermasculinity -- and the people fighting its toxic messaging by positively redefining what it means to be a man. You can read the first post here and the second post here.

Oren Jacobson, co-founder of reproductive rights advocacy group Men 4 Choice, said he had an ""aha-slash-oh-s--- moment"" in 2015 that led him, a progressive organizer at the time, to shift his focus toward reproductive rights and bodily autonomy.

That was the year he became convinced of the real potential for Roe v. Wade to be overturned and for abortion to be criminalized, Jacobson told me on Tuesday. He cited Pew Research Center data that shows majorities of both men and women support abortion being legal in all or most cases. However, he argued, voices critical of abortion seem to dominate coverage of the issues.

""I was struck by the fact that the men who were speaking were the ones who were trying to criminalize abortion, while the six in 10 of us who thought that was bulls--- were saying nothing and doing nothing,"" Jacobson said. ""And that struck me as this really interesting puzzle.""

Men 4 Choice garnered national attention last year and earlier this year when second gentleman Dough Emhoff invited the group to participate in roundtables on ways to get male allies to help advocate for abortion rights. And the group's ads have drawn support from other prominent activists.

In my interview with Jacobson on Tuesday, we discussed hypermasculinity, men's role in the reproductive rights movement, and the powerful moments at the Democratic National Convention this year, when Josh Zurawski and Derek Cook took the stage as symbols of the righteous impact men can have on the fight reproductive rights.

This interview has been slightly edited for length and clarity.

Jah'han Jones: What are the lessons your work has taught you about men's views on abortion rights?

Oren Jacobson: Number one is that most men don't understand the harm abortion bans cause. It's a little easier now, after Dobbs, because you have Josh Zurawski speaking out or Derek and Anya Cook's story or the couple stories out of Georgia we've seen where women have actually died. So that harm is a little bit more front and center. But especially pre-Dobbs, and in ways that people don't even see still, it wasn't as obvious to many men how people are harmed by the denial of access to care, whether it's like care in an emergency situation or just like, ""Hey, when you start banning and criminalizing abortion, OB-GYNs leave your state and less people have access to all reproductive health care."" So the number one lesson is the need for men to understand harm. How does this actually hurt my family, my community, and my people?

OJ: Number two is that most men don't see this as their issue. It's a woman's issue in their mind. They think, ""It doesn't directly impact me. I'm not affected.""

The third is that most men don't see a natural entry point into this organizing work. Most of the organizations and organizing and messaging and communications and outreach is focused on women and pregnant people, which makes endless amounts of sense. But pick any population in the country and say, ""If you're not engaging them, what are the odds that they actually engage with you civically, right?""

And then the fourth is that men don't have a playbook. They just don't know what to do and don't know what to say. And so even if you get them through the first three pieces, you give them an entry point. You help them see the harm. You help them create ownership. You still need to tell them what to do and how to do it, because they know they're not experts, and they're worried that they're going to screw up.

JJ: What kind of messaging have you seen work in terms of getting men to better understand that abortion is their issue, too?

OJ: We tell men this isn't just about abortion. It's about freedom and power and control. Because no person can be free if they don't have the power to control their own body and reproductive decisions, right? Not if the government has the power to control you, or the power to control the most important decision you could ever make -- which is if, when and how to build a family. So we start in this place of grounding the question in these universal value frames that all of us understand. The word freedom is just such a part of our political and cultural discourse.

JJ: Absolutely.

OJ: The second piece of this is what I would call stakeholder messaging, which is different than allyship messaging and different than beneficiary messaging. Allyship means I stand up for you because you're hurt. Our message is actually different. It's about what men have to lose. It frames them as someone whose body may not be under attack, but someone whose rights are -- whose family is and whose freedom is.

We'll use a story like Josh's as a way to point that out: If the government has the power to control your wife's body, the government has the power to control your family. So your body may not be under attack, but your rights are, your family is, and your freedom. Josh and Derek almost lost everything because their partners were denied access to basic, essential reproductive health care.

JJ: I hear you.

OJ: I should say, men who are LGBTQ+ are quicker on the draw on this. They see the connection between the legal structure of their rights around privacy, around government, and the government attacking and controlling people. If you're a queer man in America and you live in a state that's banning abortion, you probably happen to also live in a state that's attacking your rights.

JJ: Sure, and in that case you might be better equipped with the language to fight back against things like attacks on bodily autonomy and what that means for pregnant people, too.

OJ: Yes, and that's why we focus on terms like freedom, power, control. It's finding a way to center men -- putting men into the center of the [abortion] story without making the story about men, if that makes sense.

JJ: It does. And I appreciate those efforts at a time when the MAGA movement is using those words to promote a toxic masculinity rooted in brutishness and bravado. I see your organization deploying them toward better ends.

OJ: A lot of young men in particular are susceptible to what that movement is doing because the world around them is changing. We're all socialized into ideas. Some of them are good. Some of them are bad. We think that -- not just until Election Day, but beyond this -- we need to build a plan and a movement to win on this question. To win and fight for young men."
Opinion | Why JD Vance's abortion debate answer sounded eerily familiar,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/vance-abortion-debate-trump-ban-rcna173646,2024-10-02T18:55:09Z,"By Susan Rinkunas, freelance reporter covering abortion, reproductive health, and politics

Ohio Sen. JD Vance acknowledged during Tuesday night's vice presidential debate that Republicans have a believability problem on abortion. It's a notable admission, given that he and his running mate are asking voters to trust that they won't enact a national abortion ban after the demise of Roe v. Wade -- the Supreme Court precedent that the GOP swore was safe, until it wasn't.

Vance said during his debate against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz that the GOP has ""got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue where they, frankly, just don't trust us."" He then claimed that Trump believes the proper way to handle the issue is to ""let the individual states make their abortion policy.""

Trump himself fired off a social media post during the debate that stressed this talking point in capital letters. ""EVERYONE KNOWS I WOULD NOT SUPPORT A FEDERAL ABORTION BAN, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, AND WOULD, IN FACT, VETO IT,"" he wrote, ""BECAUSE IT IS UP TO THE STATES TO DECIDE BASED ON THE WILL OF THEIR VOTERS (THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE!).""

It's not the first time Trump and Vance have downplayed the chances of a national ban. But people have zero reason to trust them: A federal abortion ban is absolutely on the table. From the top of the presidential ticket on down, Republicans are using condescending language eerily similar to what conservatives said in past elections: that Democrats and women, especially, are fear-mongering about a federal ban and are being hysterical.

At a Sept. 23 rally in Pennsylvania, Trump said that ""all [Democrats] can talk about is abortion and it really no longer pertains"" because, he claims, abortion is a state issue and ""a vote of the people."" In a bit of wishcasting, Trump added that if he wins, women ""will no longer be thinking about abortion."" That line was a rehash of another deranged, all-caps Truth Social post from three days earlier -- his repetition of this message shows how desperate he is for voters to believe the lie that abortion access won't get worse if they elect him.

During the presidential debate in September, Trump told moderator Linsey Davis that he ""won't have to"" veto a federal ban, because it would never pass Congress. That pat dismissal came after another answer in which Trump said Vance didn't know his stance on a nationwide law, and twice declined to say he'd veto a ban if it came to his desk.

Since that debate, Vance has parroted the line that congressional action was highly unlikely and really dialed up the dismissiveness -- stopping just short of calling women crazy. He told NBC News' Kristen Welker that a federal abortion ban was ""kind of a ridiculous hypothetical,"" adding that it would get about 10 votes in the Senate. When pressed by Welker, Vance said that Trump ""thinks it's ridiculous to talk about vetoing a piece of legislation that isn't going to come before the president in the first place.""

Ohio GOP Senate candidate Bernie Moreno made explicit what Vance kept implicit: At a Sept. 20 town hall, Moreno said suburban women are ""crazy"" for being single issue voters on abortion. Other Republicans have stuck to minimizing voters' concerns. Trump ally and battleground member of Congress, Florida GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna claimed: ""The Supreme Court said, as a federal legislator, that my opinion on the matter doesn't really matter."" Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., made a similar argument. Nowhere did the court say that Congress can't pass abortion laws. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, suggested that such a bill wouldn't pass: ""Thinking about the politics, it doesn't seem like that's really on the table.""

All this dodging is reminiscent of conservatives' dismissive reassurances in years past when they said Roe would never be overturned. Then-Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., notoriously said in 2018 that women protesting the Brett Kavanaugh nomination were engaging in ""hysteria."" It was ""absurd,"" he argued, to suggest that the Supreme Court would overturn Roe and women would die as a result. Supreme Court architect Leonard Leo told Fox News even before Kavanaugh was chosen that Democrats only talked about the fall of Roe as a ""scare tactic"" to mobilize base voters.

Trump himself famously claimed in a September 2020 debate that neither Joe Biden nor anyone watching could possibly know how his nominee Amy Coney Barrett would rule on Roe. ""There's nothing happening there,"" Trump said. ""You don't know her view."" (This is the same man who, in 2016, said he would only appoint anti-abortion justices and that Roe would be overturned ""automatically."") Just months after that debate, the court took up an abortion case out of Mississippi and, about a year later, Roe was gone -- with Barrett voting to overturn it.

Another telling debate moment, about the very meaning of the word ""ban,"" epitomized the Republicans' shell game. When the moderators asked Vance about his past support for a 15-week abortion ban, he claimed the proposal wasn't a ban but rather a ""minimum national standard."" Maybe Trump and Vance believe ""ban"" means a total abortion ban but make no mistake: A federal ban at any gestation would override state laws, in direct contradiction to their ""states' rights"" argument. Even more chilling, a second Trump administration could also enact a national ban by enforcing the 19th-century Comstock Act, which could ban abortion pills nationwide, if not all procedures.

Two years ago, a nearly 50-year precedent Republicans had argued was safe was overturned. Now, women are bleeding in hospital parking lots, losing fallopian tubes and, yes, dying. Obscenely yet predictably, they're trying to tell women reporters and women voters across the country that everything is fine but we know it's not. Vance is right that people don't trust Republicans on abortion and they shouldn't."
Amber Thurman's family slams GOP on abortion again after Vance equivocates at debate,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/amber-thurman-abortion-republicans-vance-debate-rcna173630,2024-10-02T18:52:20Z,"""Amber Thurman should still be alive,"" Vance said, as he defended the very circumstances that led to her preventable death in 2022.

On the debate stage Tuesday night, Sen. JD Vance found himself agreeing with his opponent, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, that a woman who died from abortion complications in 2022 due to Georgia's draconian abortion ban should still be alive.

""Governor, I agree with you,"" the Republican vice presidential nominee said. ""Amber Thurman should still be alive -- and there are a lot of people who should still be alive -- and I certainly wish that she was.""

Vance's acknowledgement that Thurman's death was preventable and his expressed desire for the GOP to ""earn people's trust back"" on abortion doesn't square with Republican lawmakers actively restricting people's ability to make such choices for themselves. After the debate, Thurman's family issued a statement condemning the GOP for ""seek[ing] to further restrict women's access to necessary healthcare under the false guise of protection.""

""Amber's tragic death was a direct result of Georgia's archaic and dangerously restrictive abortion laws, which denied her the life-saving care she so desperately needed,"" Thurman's family said. ""We are grieving an unimaginable loss that no family should have to endure.""

In the debate, Vance said that the American people ""just don't trust"" Republicans when it comes to abortion, and that he wanted the GOP to become ""pro-family in the fullest sense of the word."" He also claimed that he has never supported a federal abortion ban (Vance did, however, say as recently as 2022 that he ""would like abortion to be illegal nationally"") and defended the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

After lamenting Thurman's death, Vance immediately went on to talk about ""partial birth abortion,"" a highly misleading political term that refers to an abortion that happens later in pregnancy. He also asserted that allowing states to impose their own abortion laws is the right thing to do, despite that being exactly the circumstance that led to Thurman's death."
Why JD Vance's 'fact-checking flashpoint' in the debate mattered,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vances-fact-checking-flashpoint-debate-mattered-rcna173588,2024-10-02T13:23:12Z,"The Ohio senator spent much of the vice presidential debate brazenly lying. No wonder he grew agitated in response to a brief fact-check from a moderator.

About a third of the way into the vice presidential debate, the discussion turned to Springfield, Ohio -- a community torn apart by a racist and false conspiracy theory promoted by the both members of the Republican Party's presidential ticket. It was against this backdrop that Sen. JD Vance, who ostensibly represents the city, referred to ""millions of illegal immigrants"" and parts of the country that have been ""destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border.""

The Republican senator was peddling a multi-layered lie: The border isn't ""open""; the vice president isn't responsible for the nation's immigration laws; and Springfield's Haitian immigrants entered the country legally. Indeed, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic nominee, took the opportunity to note that his rival had ""vilified a large number of people who were here legally.""

At that point, one of the debate's moderators, CBS News' Margaret Brennan, told viewers, ""To clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio, does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status.""

The GOP nominee was not having it. The New York Times referred to it as the debate's ""fact-checking flashpoint,"" and NBC News' report summarized it this way:

""The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" the senator complained.

In reality, even that wasn't quite true: As the Times' report noted, CBS News executives had indicated ahead of the event ""that the moderators may choose to clarify a fuzzy point if they determined it had been left unclear.""

Or put another way, Vance lied about fact-checking after having lied about immigration policy.

But the on-air clash had a larger significance. The Ohio Republican wasn't upset because the debate moderators were wrong; he was upset because the debate moderators were telling the public the truth.

And as Vance made clear over the course of the evening, telling the truth simply wasn't part of his debate strategy.

Much of the post-event analysis has focused on the fact that the young senator appeared polished, smooth, and well-prepared for much of the debate, while Walz, who missed some opportunities, seemed nervous and at times unsteady. Those assessments are largely fair. But more important than the GOP candidate's presentation and style was the fact that he spent much of the evening peddling an alternate reality with little resemblance to the real world.

I recently wrote a book about Republican efforts to rewrite recent history, and even I was amazed at Vance's brazenness when it came to waging war against the recent past.

The GOP nominee lied about Trump and the Affordable Care Act. He lied about the ""peaceful"" transfer of power after Trump's 2020 defeat. He lied about his earlier support for a national abortion ban. He lied about his party's regressive 2017 tax breaks. This is a small sampling from a much longer list of obvious falsehoods.

A separate New York Times analysis said Vance showed ""a knack for revising history,"" which was a polite way of saying the senator spent the evening lying to the electorate about matters large and small. A Washington Post report added that Vance ""dominated on the falsehood meter.""

No wonder he seemed quite agitated about moderators telling the truth: The Republican was busy trying to pull a con on the American electorate, and the CBS News anchors were interfering with his scam.

A couple of weeks ago, Vance conceded that he's willing to ""create stories"" to advance his goals. It was hard not to think of this line during this year's only vice presidential debate."
Opinion | Who won the first (and only) VP debate? It came down to one of the last questions.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/who-won-vp-debate-tonight-vance-lied-walz-polls-rcna173558,2024-10-02T05:15:46Z,"JD Vance is clearly a smooth talker, but eventually his lies caught up with him.

Despite a somewhat slow start and an occasionally halting style, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz produced strong answers on health care, gun violence and reproductive rights. But his standout win -- and indeed one of the most compelling moments of the whole night -- came at the end of the debate, when the issue of election integrity took center stage. Vice presidents are tasked with a final ceremonial role in the process of certifying state electors. Former President Donald Trump tried to exploit this role in 2020 and pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to try to stop the certification. Pence refused. Just as concerning, though, is Trump's reluctance to even admit that he lost the 2020 election.

Tuesday night, Walz asked Sen. JD Vance point-blank whether Trump lost to Joe Biden. It was an easy question, which Vance nonetheless whiffed. Instead of answering with a yes or a no, Vance equivocated, deflected and eventually tried to turn the issue into a confusing and nebulous referendum on ""censorship."" Only then did it become clear that Vance, for all his smooth talking points, is still in many ways just a vessel for Trumpism.

During an extended exchange about the consequences of illegal immigration, CBS News co-moderator Margaret Brennan offered a mild fact-check of Vance, who claimed that in ""Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you've got housing that is totally unaffordable, because we've brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.""

Brennan noted that many of the Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, are in fact there legally. This caused Vance to lose his cool. ""Margaret, the rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" he complained. Then, as Brennan's colleague Norah O'Donnell attempted to move on, Vance pushed back again, trying to tie Haitian migrants in Ohio to illegal immigration. Finally, CBS cut his mic.

Putting aside Vance's snarky treatment of the moderators, his seemingly righteous anger here is misplaced. Vance and Trump have repeatedly claimed that Springfield is overrun with Haitian migrants who are causing all sorts of problems, including, incredibly, stealing and eating pets. But according to the city's Republican mayor, Vance's own office called officials in Springfield to check this pet rumor and was told they were baseless.

It was a strikingly emotional reaction from Vance, who attempted to maintain a mostly collegial demeanor throughout the ""Midwestern nice"" debate. And it came off as both overly defensive and disproportionally condescending.

Vance says he ""never supported a national ban"" on abortion. This is, right off the top, not fully accurate. In 2022, Vance said he ""would like abortion to be illegal nationally.""

But in the same breath, Vance admitted he has supported a ""national minimum standard"" for abortion procedures. A ""national minimum standard"" of six or eight or even 15 weeks, however, would restrict abortion access to such an extent that it would become a form of abortion ban. This is a slick rhetorical trick, but it shouldn't fool people who are listening closely."
Vance's Republican Party sounds pretty nice. Too bad it's fantasy.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jd-vance-republican-party-fantasy-vp-debate-rcna173573,2024-10-02T03:53:04Z,"Like most of the most promising words that come out of his and Trump's mouths, it's absolutely too good to be true.

I can't say I recognize the Republican Party that Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, advocated for on stage during Tuesday night's vice presidential debate. In answer after answer, Vance talked about policies that sounded nothing like anything that any Republican has advocated during this election cycle. It certainly doesn't sound like an administration that his running mate, former President Donald Trump, is likely to put into place should he win in November.

Let's start with abortion, an issue that has been a drag on the GOP since the conservative Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Vance waved off the idea that a national abortion ban is something that many Republicans support. Instead, he tried to humanize the issue, talking about a friend of his who felt she had to terminate a pregnancy and pushing for a string of ""pro-family"" policies that could help American families afford to raise kids. Later on, he added that the federal government should be investing in helping families pay for child care, using funding to help entice more child care workers into the field.

Vance further explained that, of course, the GOP wants to save the Affordable Care Act's ban on insurance companies using pre-existing conditions against people. He said there needs to be more housing made available for people to bring down the amount people are spending to have a roof over their heads. And he implied that Trump facilitated the peaceful transfer of power, downplaying the former president's plot to try to overturn the 2020 election.

On the one hand, this could be what the campaign would have looked like if Trump wasn't the nominee. He's kept the most far-right plank of MAGA extremism, falsely blaming the majority of America's problems on immigration. But he's tried to sand off many of the edges, doing what Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis failed to achieve in his primary campaign, presenting a version of Trumpism that could extend beyond Trump.

But recall Vance's nomination acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in July. None of the sort of ""compassionate conservatism"" redux that he pitched on Tuesday night was present in that speech. And when you hold up his statements to what the GOP has done and proposed in the real world, there's no way to make the two versions align. There is no support among Republicans in Congress for a new federal child care program, nor was there any desire to save the ACA among them. Vance was saying whatever he thought Americans wanted to hear -- same as he will do if ever in a position to challenge Trump as his vice president.

Likewise, Vance worked to assure the audience that there was actually a lot that he and his Democratic opponent, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, agreed on and implied that Trump would look for bipartisan solutions if returned to the White House. It honestly sounded nice, a throwback to a semi-mythological era where things got done in Washington as both sides compromised for the good of the country.

But like most of the most promising words that come out of his and Trump's mouths, it's absolutely too good to be true. I'd love it if the Republican Party that Vance promoted was real. But there is no world in which a second Trump administration leads to a new era of common sense solutions. Vance's claim otherwise may be the biggest, most disturbing lie that he told on stage."
Opinion | This is the rare vice presidential debate that actually matters,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-tim-walz-vp-debate-vice-presidential-rcna172750,2024-10-01T23:15:15Z,"""Ain't nobody coming to see you, Otis"" is an iconic line from ""The Temptations,"" a 1998 NBC miniseries. Delivered by the actor playing David Ruffin, it's a boast that the audience was not paying to see anyone else in the group, just Ruffin. Conventional wisdom says one could apply this logic to Tuesday's vice presidential debate between Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. JD Vance of Ohio.

In a ""normal election,"" a debate between the No. 2s on the ticket would be interesting but not statistically significant. The rule for a vice presidential debate is generally the same election to election: Stick to the top of the ticket's message, draw a contrast with the challenger anchored in that message and, crucially, do no harm. Conventional wisdom says people do not cast ballots because of whom the Democratic or Republican nominee chose as an eventual governing partner. It's the name on the top of the ticket that matters.

However, this is not a normal election, and I disagree with the conventional wisdom. Running mates matter, and tonight's debate is quite significant!

If the nominees' choice for potential governing partner did not matter, then there would no reason to put them on the stage together before the election. Choosing a running mate is the first presidential-level decision a major party nominee makes. It is a statement about who they are and what their agenda and legacy will be if elected president. In selecting the millennial Vance, former President Donald Trump tripled down on Trumpism, cementing it as a key pillar of the Republican Party apparatus and the bedrock of the GOP's next generation.

In selecting Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris signaled that the Democratic tent is big and that she is serious about making her bold plans on child care, reproductive freedom and the economy a reality. Just look at what her running mate has done in Minnesota when it comes to those issues.

Tonight's debate could be the last time voters hear from the campaigns in a forum at which they are mandated to stand next to each other and defend their plans. A literal split screen where the comments of both participants will take center stage. That alone raises the stakes.

Vance will have to answer for his treasure trove of soundbites on everything from likening Trump to Hitler and the racist conspiratorial lies about Haitian people in his home state, to name just two. Walz will be asked to defend his record in Minnesota (because apparently feeding children is too progressive) and his military service record. Regardless of what the moderators ask, a candidate who is well prepared will answer the question then quickly pivot out of the conversation about themselves and back to the issues and their No. 1. This is not always easy to do, but it is critical.

When we first sat down for debate prep in 2020 with then-Sen. Harris, we initially focused on ensuring she knew what then-candidate Joe Biden had said publicly about each issue. It was important she was well versed in his thoughts, so she knew the contours of where and how far to go in discussing any particular topic.

The last thing a campaign wants is the running mate making unauthorized news.

When Vance sat down with my colleague Kristen Welker on ""Meet the Press,"" he emphatically stated Trump would not sign a national abortion ban into law. And yet, during Trump's second debate this cycle, he walked back Vance's answer on national television. Vance will want to avoid making the same mistake tonight, but a large part of being vice president is speaking for the president. If Vance cannot do that in a debate, why would he be able to do it at the White House?

For Walz, he will have to walk the tightrope of part attack dog and part explainer. This is an area where many voters still say they want to know more about Harris' plans, so Walz will have to use his time wisely, find moments to speak directly to the people at home and explain how a prospective Harris-Walz administration would make a difference for families across the country. Much has been said about Walz not being a seasoned debater, but remember he was a high school teacher and a football coach! One could say he honed his oratory skills in the lion's den.

In 2020, during Harris' debate prep, we had many internal discussions about how to handle the question of age if it came up. Tonight, Walz won't have that problem. Harris will turn 60 this month; however, Vance will have to speak to why Americans should trust 78-year-old Donald Trump to sit behind the resolute desk again and if he himself -- a freshman senator with no legislative accomplishments and no other political or government experience -- would actually be ready to lead the country if duty called.

Tonight, while no one will be looking for Otis, all political eyes will be on Tim Walz and JD Vance."
Opinion | What 5 political experts will be watching for at Tuesday's VP debate,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-tim-walz-vp-debate-2024-what-to-watch-rcna173348,2024-10-01T18:29:20Z,"JD Vance and Tim Walz will meet in the last time the two campaigns square off face-to-face.

The vice presidential debate Tuesday between Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will likely be your last chance to see the two campaigns square off before the election.

With the two running mates not as well-known as the tops of the tickets, many people will be watching just to get to know them. Others will be looking for how they represent the tickets.

So what should you watch for?

We asked some MSNBC analysts to weigh in on what they will be watching for during the debate. Here's what they said.

Follow live updates covering the 2024 vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz.

There's an underappreciated point of distinction between Walz and Vance: At their debate, one will find it vastly easier to defend his running mate.

When the vice presidential nominees share the stage, I'll be watching to see just how much the Republican senator struggles, not only to defend Donald Trump's latest scandals, lies and missteps, but also to distance himself from his own condemnations of the former president -- some of which he reportedly voiced as recently as 2020.

It's a challenge the Minnesota governor won't have to worry about: He and Kamala Harris were, are and almost certainly will remain on the same page.

Walz has lived a charmed existence since being tapped for VP, but we're about to learn whether he can take a punch. It will be very interesting to see how he handles real scrutiny and tough questions, which he's so far been able to avoid.

Walz's superpower is his relatability. Vance's biggest liability is his inability to connect with human beings. I'll be looking out for Walz to exploit that difference, especially by highlighting some of Vance's more extreme positions on abortion, marriage, reproductive rights and more. We'll see if Vance is suddenly going to run away from all of those Christofascist views that he was so quick to espouse on the right-wing podcast circuit before he became the Republican vice presidential nominee. My guess is that he'll certainly try.

Vance has a hard choice to make: try to show balance and get his historically low favorability numbers up or please Trump. This means he will have to attack but not cough up a hairball. Gov., aka ""Coach,"" Walz must show that he is more than just a nice guy. He must show command of the issues and not fumble the ball.

Quite simply: Will CBS fact-check the candidates, or will it outsource that to the candidates themselves? This seems like an especially important question given JD Vance's serial lies about Haitian immigrants, but it also goes to the question of whether the media has been browbeaten into eschewing its most important function: the dissemination of truth."
"Judge strikes down Georgia's abortion ban, but not quickly enough for some",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/judge-strikes-georgias-abortion-ban-not-quickly-enough-rcna173419,2024-10-01T14:31:15Z,"A court ruling striking down a Republican-imposed abortion ban in Georgia comes too late for Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller.

It's not every day when a judge references ""The Handmaid's Tale"" in a high-profile court ruling, but that's precisely what happened when a judge struck down Georgia's six-week abortion ban. NBC News reported:

As my colleague Lisa Rubin explained in a social media thread that's worth your time, it was quite a ruling from Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who concluded that the meaning of ""liberty"" in Georgia includes ""the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.""

McBurney added that the Republican-imposed ban was ""extreme"" in its ""narrowing of the window of time within which women have the legal ability to end a pregnancy from roughly twenty weeks (i.e., viability) down to a mere six weeks, a point at which many -- if not most -- women are completely unaware or at best unsure if they are pregnant.""

He went on to write that ""for many women, their pregnancy was unintended, unexpected, and often unknown until well after the embryonic heartbeat began. Yet that's too late under the LIFE Act's strictures: these women are now forbidden from undoing that life-altering change of circumstances -- before they even knew the change had occurred.""

""For these women, the liberty of privacy means that they alone should choose whether they serve as human incubators for the five months leading up to viability. It is not for a legislator, a judge, or a Commander from The Handmaid's Tale to tell these women what to do with their bodies during this period when the fetus cannot survive outside the womb any more so than society could -- or should -- force them to serve as a human tissue bank or to give up a kidney for the benefit of another,"" McBurney concluded.

With this in mind, women in Georgia can, for now, terminate unwanted and/or dangerous pregnancies up to 22 weeks.

But in the meantime, it's also worth emphasizing that McBurney's ruling, while heartening and progressive, comes too late for some -- because there's ample evidence to suggest that Georgia's poorly named LIFE Act was responsible for the deaths of at least two local women.

As my MSNBC colleague Sarah Posner recently explained, Amber Nicole Thurman died in 2022 after she failed to receive the medical care she needed -- because her physicians ""were terrified of committing a felony under the state's abortion ban.""

Soon after the public learned of the Thurman tragedy, we were confronted by a related story: Candi Miller also died in Georgia, and as ProPublica reported, maternal health experts have blamed Georgia Republicans' abortion ban.

GOP officials in the state have already vowed to appeal the latest ruling. Watch this space."
Opinion | Trump's brand of masculinity puts his own followers' health at risk,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-masculinity-gun-violence-suicide-prevention-rcna173360,2024-10-01T10:34:37Z,"Trump leads a movement of men who are indifferent to suffering, averse to health guidance and overly agitated. And it's putting America's men in danger.

This post is the second in ""MAGA and Masculinity in 2024,"" an ongoing series examining the societal fallout from right-wing hypermasculinity -- and the people fighting its toxic messaging by positively redefining what it means to be a man. You can read the first post here.

Former President Donald Trump's MAGA movement is a hypermasculine cult of personality, in which men are encouraged to remain stoic, inflict harm on others and ignore experts in favor of the advice of tough-talking podcasters. We've seen the ways this kind of machismo has hurt the movement's perceived nemeses.

Women have suffered -- even died -- while being denied abortion care. And a recent study from the Trevor Project links state-level anti-trans laws to a spike in attempted suicides by trans teenagers. In the name of upholding arcane gender roles, the male-dominated MAGA movement has relentlessly infringed on other people's health and well-being.

But MAGA masculinity poses health risks to its hosts, too, particularly with regard to mental health and susceptibility to gun violence. The MAGA movement's toxic mix of ignorance, vitriol and bravado poses a threat to the men most likely to be drawn to it.

The Covid-19 pandemic was a clear example. Trump and his supporters portrayed defiance of public health measures, like wearing masks and practicing social distancing, as matters of manhood and toughness. Studies have shown that this kind of toxic masculinity was a major driver of vaccine hesitancy in men, which in turn was a contributing factor to the disproportionately high excess death rate for Republicans after the Covid vaccines became available.

Trump has only leaned in to his hypermasculine anti-science agenda by promoting his ""Make America Healthy Again"" slogan with anti-vax conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an archetype for toxic masculinity in his own right, who has reportedly been promised a role in Trump's administration if Trump wins the election and has promoted the idea of banning U.S. agencies from studying infectious diseases.

In 2022, NBC News reported on a study that linked conservative policies to higher mortality rates among working-age people.

According to the NBC News report:

The overwhelming majority of gun violence in the U.S. is committed by men, and activists and researchers have long pointed to hypermasculinity as key to gun culture and a driver of gun violence -- both self-harm and violence committed against others.

And the MAGA movement has done a great deal to discourage men from receiving the mental health care and attention they need to thrive. We see this in the right-wing attack on suicide prevention programs and ""social and emotional learning"" programs in school, which experts have used to help boys better process their emotions. Evidence shows that fear and stigmatization make men less likely to receive the mental health care they need. And yet it even found a way to stigmatize mental health and demonize immigrants at the same time by falsely claiming the Biden administration is welcoming them from ""insane asylums"" and ""mental institutions.""

MAGA men get the message, and it's just one of many ways they've endangered their own health -- and others' -- thanks to their allegiance to Trump."

Democrats hope the latest court rulings restricting abortion energize voters as election nears,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-rulings-election-trump-harris-texas-georgia-b17211cd0fe92a6454878169b1730207,2024-10-08T21:13:59Z,"CHICAGO (AP) -- Two court rulings this week have delivered major blows to reproductive rights in Texas and Georgia but, during a crucial time in the election cycle, Democrats are seizing on them in an attempt to energize voters who support abortion access.

Advocates hope the rulings will serve as reminders about what's at stake in a post-Roe America just weeks before a presidential election that has been partly defined by competing visions of abortion rights and the sometimes harrowing consequences for women living in states with abortion bans.

""Every time our opponents say the policies we have in place are fine and not as extreme as you think, this continual drumbeat of headlines illustrates the reality and galvanizes voters,"" said Kelly Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project, which is providing money and other support for several ballot measure campaigns hoping to preserve or strengthen abortion rights.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday left in place a lower court decision that bans emergency abortions that violate Texas law. The same day, the Georgia Supreme Court halted a ruling that had struck down the state's near-total abortion ban.

Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, took the opportunity to remind voters of the threats her campaign says a second Trump presidency poses to reproductive rights and his role in overturning Roe v. Wade, which once granted a federal right to abortion. Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing the three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the constitutional right to abortion that had stood for 50 years.

""Because of extreme Trump Abortion Bans in states across the country, including Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia, women are facing horrific consequences to their health and lives -- even death,"" Harris posted on X. ""Let me be clear: Donald Trump is the architect of this health care crisis.""

Monday's rulings are just the latest court decisions around reproductive rights to ripple through this year's races for president and Congress. In February, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that embryos can be considered children, a decision that temporarily halted in vitro fertilization treatments and threw the lives of couples seeking fertility treatments into chaos.

In April, the Arizona Supreme Court upheld a near total abortion ban from 1864 -- when the state was only a U.S. territory. The Legislature repealed it months later, but not until after the issue had galvanized abortion rights supporters in a state that will help determine the presidency and control of the Senate.

Kristi Hamrick, spokesperson for the national anti-abortion group Students for Life Action, accused Democrats of ""latching onto anything and blaming losses on anyone but themselves in a desperate attempt to get votes."" She celebrated the two rulings Monday and expressed hopes the anti-abortion wins will instead energize voters against abortion.

""We're grateful for these wins and hopeful they may add some wind in our sails,"" she said.

In Texas, the state's abortion ban - one of the strictest in the country - is playing a role in the Senate race between the Republican incumbent, Sen. Ted Cuz, and Democratic U.S. Rep. Colin Allred. The weekend before Monday's ruling, Allred vowed to restore Roe v. Wade at a campaign event in Fort Worth.

Other Democrats in the statehouse, including Texas Rep. Donna Howard, also expressed outrage at the rulings. She accused the courts of ""willfully ignoring the dangerous reality many pregnant Texans are forced to endure if they experience severe pregnancy complications.""

In Georgia, one of the seven presidential battleground states, the state supreme court's ruling comes on the heels of outrage over the deaths of Georgia women Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, who died after being denied immediate care that was attributed to the state's restrictive laws.

Georgia voters are watching these stories about the impact of the state's abortion restrictions and ""they will bring that to the polls"" during the presidential election, said Jessica Arons, a director of policy and government affairs at the ACLU. But these headlines might also energize voters in contests up and down the ballot, including citizen-led ballot measures in nine states aiming to protect abortion rights, she said.

Support for legal abortion has risen since the Supreme Court eliminated protections two years ago, according to a July poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Around 6 in 10 Americans think their state should generally allow a person to obtain a legal abortion for any reason if they don't want to be pregnant. That represents an increase from June 2021, a year before the Supreme Court decision, when about half of Americans thought legal abortion should be possible under these circumstances.

Many experts and advocates have credited this shift to Americans' reactions to the abortion restrictions affecting a wide swath of the country since Roe was overturned. Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy while another four ban it after six weeks -- before many women know they're pregnant.

""It's hard to say how much voters are following each development, but it's clear abortion is still an incredibly salient issue, and these are reminders of why as we head closer to November,"" Arons said. ""As courts and politicians continue to play ping-pong with women's lives, ballot measures will be especially important.""

Only about half the states allow citizen-led ballot initiatives. Georgia and Texas, states where Republicans control the Legislature and governor's office, are not among them.

Lauren Brenzel, campaign director for a coalition aiming to enshrine abortion rights into the Florida Constitution, said the Georgia Supreme Court ruling only adds to a ""public health crisis in the Southeast.""

Florida is the only state in the Southeast that allows citizen-led ballot initiatives, Brenzel said. If Floridians vote in favor of abortion rights, the state may become a major access point for Georgians seeking abortions. The Florida amendment needs at least 60% support to pass.

""It raises the stakes for us here in Florida,"" Brenzel said.

After the Arizona Supreme Court revived the Civil War-era ban on nearly all abortions, a coalition organizing around a statewide ballot measure to protect abortion rights reported a surge in donations, volunteers and interest. Laura Dent, the coalition's political director, said it's evidence that voters are paying attention and taking action.

""Arizonans are seeing these headlines,"" she said. ""This and all the whiplash we've seen since the Dobbs decision really brought into focus for Arizona voters how we need to protect this right, and I think that will be reflected in November.""

Not all elections look the same. Here are some of the different ways states run their voting,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/ranked-choice-voting-nebraska-california-615e9fbdf7b086dce4227dff01c0df68,2024-10-08T19:44:46Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. general election on Nov. 5 will decide the country's direction, but it is far from a nationally administered contest. The 50 states and the District of Columbia run their own elections, and each does things a little differently.

Here's a look at some notable variations in the 2024 election:

To win the presidency outright, a candidate must receive at least 270 of the 538 votes in the Electoral College. In 48 states, the statewide winner gets all of that state's electoral votes, and that's also the case in the nation's capital.

In Maine and Nebraska, the candidate who receives the most votes in each congressional district wins one electoral vote from that district. The candidate who wins the statewide vote receives another two.

In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden received three of Maine's four electoral votes because he won the popular vote in the state and its 1st Congressional District. Republican Donald Trump received one electoral vote from the 2nd Congressional District. Trump won four of Nebraska's five votes for winning the popular vote in the state as well as its 1st and 3rd Congressional Districts; Biden received one electoral vote for winning the 2nd Congressional District.

In ranked choice voting, voters rank candidates for an office in order of preference on the ballot. If no candidate is the first choice for more than 50% of voters, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. Voters who chose that candidate as their top pick have their votes redistributed to their next choice. This continues, with the candidate with the fewest votes getting eliminated, until someone emerges with a majority of votes.

Maine uses ranked choice voting in state-level primaries and for federal offices in the general election. That means Maine voters can rank presidential, Senate and House candidates on ballots that include the Democrat and the Republican who advanced out of their respective party primaries, plus third-party and independent candidates who qualify.

The presidential ballot will include Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris, plus three other candidates. In the six years since implementing ranked choice voting, the state has used it twice in races for Congress in its 2nd Congressional District. The 2020 presidential race did not advance to ranked choice voting, with the winners of the state and in each congressional district exceeding 52% of the vote.

Alaska holds open primaries for statewide offices and sends the top four vote-getters, regardless of party, to the general election, where the winner is decided using ranked choice voting. In all legislative and statewide executive offices, Alaskans can rank up to four names that can include multiple candidates from the same party.

The exception is the presidency, which is eligible for ranked choice voting in Alaska for the first time. This year, there will be eight presidential tickets on the ballot, and Alaskans can rank all candidates if they choose to. The last time the winner of the presidential contest in Alaska failed to surpass 50% of the vote was in 1992, when third-party candidate Ross Perot won almost 20% of the national popular vote.

But in 2022, both Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski won their elections after both went to ranked choice voting.

Another wrinkle this year? In Alaska, where ranked choice voting was implemented by ballot measure in 2020, there's a voter initiative on the ballot this fall to repeal it.

California and Washington hold open primaries in which all candidates run on the same ballot and the two top vote-getters advance to the general election, regardless of party. This year, there are two House races in Washington that include candidates of the same party, one with two Republicans and one with two Democrats. There are four in California: three with only Democrats and one with only Republicans.

The winning party in those six districts will be reflected in The Associated Press' online graphic showing the balance of power in the House at poll close, rather than once a winner is declared because the party of the winner is a foregone conclusion.

Louisiana holds what it refers to as its ""open primaries"" on the same day the rest of the country holds its general election. In Louisiana, all candidates run on the same open primary ballot. Any candidate who earns more than 50% of the vote in the primary wins the seat outright.

If no candidate exceeds 50% of the vote, the top two vote-getters advance to a head-to-head runoff, which can end up pitting two Republicans or two Democrats against each other. Louisiana refers to these contests as its ""general election.""

That will change for elections for the U.S. House starting in 2026 when congressional races will have earlier primaries that are open only to registered members of a party. Certain state races will continue to hold open primaries in November, but the change will prevent future members of Congress from waiting until December -- a month later than the rest of the country -- to know whether they are headed to Washington.

In Nebraska, any measure that receives approximately 123,000 valid signatures qualifies for the ballot. This year, two measures relating to abortion met this threshold.

One would enshrine in the Nebraska Constitution the right to have an abortion until fetal viability or later, to protect the health of the pregnant woman. The other would write into the constitution the current 12-week ban, with exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the pregnant woman.

This marks the first time since the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade that a state has measures that seek to roll back abortion rights and protect abortion rights on the ballot at the same time.

It's possible voters could end up approving both measures. But because they're competing and therefore cannot both be enshrined in the constitution, the measure with the most ""for"" votes will be the one adopted, according to the Nebraska secretary of state.

In primary elections, a handful of states, mostly in the South, go to runoffs if no candidate receives at least 50% of the vote. In races with more than two candidates, runoffs in those states are common. Several states held primary runoffs this year.

Georgia uses the same rules in general elections. The last three Senate races there went to runoffs because a third-party candidate won enough of the vote to prevent the Republican or Democratic nominee from exceeding 50% of the vote.

But this year, runoff possibilities may be confined to downballot races such as state legislature. There's no Senate race there this year, and the U.S. House races have only two candidates on the ballot.

This is common in states that span multiple time zones. In most states, polls close at the same time in each time zone.

The AP will not call the winner of a race before all the polls in a jurisdiction are scheduled to close, even if votes already reported before that time make clear who will win the race. So if there is a statewide race in a state where polls close at 8 p.m. local time, but some of the state is in the Eastern time zone and some of the state is in Central time zone, the earliest the AP can call the winner is 8 p.m. CST/9 p.m. EST.

The AP will still show the results as they arrive from counties with closed polls.

Some of the biggest states with split poll close times are Florida, Michigan, Texas and Oregon. Tennessee is an exception, as even though the state is in both the Eastern and the Central time zones, all counties coordinate their voting to conclude at the same time.

"AP Elections Top 25: The people, places, races, dates and things to know about Election Day",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/associated-press-elections-top-25-people-places-races-dates-f323fe3dd459c54860a3ad39657e1fca,2024-10-08T19:26:14Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans will cast roughly 160 million ballots by the time Election Day comes to a close -- in several different ways, including many submitted a few weeks before polls even open.

They will choose a president, members of Congress and thousands of state lawmakers, city council members, attorneys general, secretaries of state -- and in Texas, a railroad commissioner who has nothing to do with the trains.

This year's election also comes at a moment in the nation's history when the very basics of how America votes are being challenged as never before by disinformation and distrust.

It can be tough to make sense of it all. To help better understand the way America picks its president and its leaders -- all the way down the ballot -- The Associated Press offers the following thoughts on the Top 25 people, places, races, dates and things to know about Election Day. A guidebook, of sorts, to American democracy as it nears its 250th birthday.

It's said that every presidential election makes history. Perhaps. But while some are destined to be included in the history books, others become the subject of books all of their own. Put 2024 down to get a whole shelf at the library. Will Americans choose to return Donald Trump to the White House, electing a former president to a new term for only the second time -- and picking for the first time a convicted felon to sit behind the Resolute Desk? Or will voters decide Kamala Harris ought to be the nation's first woman to take up office in the Oval Office, a candidate who didn't win a single primary yet landed at the top of her party's ticket by acclamation. No list of the Top 25 things to know about this year's general election can begin without an acknowledgment that no matter who America chooses, Trump and Harris will make history this Election Day. (Or a few days later.)

There might not be anyone as all-in on returning Trump to the White House as Elon Musk, the world's richest person. ""President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution. He must win to preserve democracy in America,"" the founder of SpaceX and Tesla told a rally crowd in early October when Trump returned to the site of his first attempted assassination in Pennsylvania. Along with his unfathomable personal wealth, Musk's ownership of X, formally known as Twitter, gives him an unprecedented ability to try and convince voters of his belief that electing Trump is a ""must-win situation."" Musk is spending heavily on get-out-the-vote efforts and using his perch as X's CEO to amplify misinformation and push into millions of timelines his argument that the country will not survive should Kamala Harris win the White House. It's a foreboding message that seems to get bleaker by the day - and Musk knows it. ""As you can see, I am not just MAGA,"" he told Trump's backers from the rally stage. ""I am Dark MAGA.""

The founder of Win With Black Women, Jotaka Eaddy has for the past four years hosted Sunday evening video conferences on Zoom to chat politics. On July 21, she couldn't get into her own meeting. Earlier that day, Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Kamala Harris as his replacement to be the Democratic nominee, and once Zoom changed some settings, 44,000 people were online and ready to talk about it. It was a pep talk and a telethon. People prayed and sang. About an hour after the Zoom started, Star Jones shared a donation link and by early the next morning they had raised more than $1 million. The meeting spawned a domino effect as Eaddy turned a tool made essential by the coronavirus pandemic into an essential place for Harris' supporters to gather. Soon, Black men and white women and white dudes and Taylor Swift fans were logging on. ""It has allowed us to organize in a way to bring people together that otherwise would not connect,"" Eaddy said.

Now that how a ballot is cast is as much of a red/blue choice as the candidate getting the vote, figuring out who will win a close election often depends on knowing the kind of ballots left to be counted. Garrett Archer, a former analyst at the Arizona Secretary of State's office who is now a data journalist, was one of the first of Twitter's election seers to understand how nit-picky those details can be. Were the advance votes still to be counted cast in person, mailed or left at a drop box? How soon before Election Day did those mail ballots arrive? Or might those mail votes actually be ""late earlies"" dropped off at a polling place? Archer goes deep into those details in his job with ABC's Phoenix affiliate, but most of us will get his analysis of Arizona's election results online, as we wait every afternoon after Election Day for his trademark Tweet that begins: ""Maricopa incoming...""

About a week after Election Day, Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows is likely to star in a livestream via laptop webcam to announce results of ranked choice voting. The instant-runoff system, used when no candidate initially wins an outright majority, might be a downballot novelty if not for the state's 2nd Congressional District. Behind by about 2,000 votes in 2018, Democrat Jared Golden emerged the winner and ousted the GOP incumbent once the ranked choice process awarded him the votes of two trailing independents. Maine also awards two of its Electoral College votes by congressional district, and while it may be unlikely, the road to 270 electoral votes could theoretically end with ranked choice results in Maine's 2nd District. In that case, should Golden's come-from-behind win of 2018 repeat itself, it would fall to Bellows to announce that ranked choice voting had put a second place finisher into the White House.

On an Aleutian island closer to the Russian border than mainland Alaska and more than 4,000 miles from the White House, the question isn't who wins on Election Day. It's who will be the very last American to vote. ""People have a little bit of fun on that day, because, I mean, realistically everybody knows the election's decided way before we're closed,"" said Layton Lockett, the city manager in Adak, Alaska. The country's last polling place to close is the only one still open from midnight ET to 1 a.m., when things wrap up on the island and former World War II military base. The honor of being the last voter was Mary Nelson's in 2012, when the community of a few hundred people did away with early voting in favor of casting ballots in person. She was a poll worker that Election Day, too, meaning her historic moment was short lived. ""When I opened the curtain to come back out, the city manager took my picture ... and they were waiting for us in Nome to call with our vote count,"" she said.

Out of more than 500 counties in the seven battleground states in this year's election, only 10 voted for Trump in 2016 before flipping to Biden in 2020. The first to complete its count this Election Day ought to be North Carolina's Nash County, which by 10 p.m. ET could provide an early indication of which candidate is performing best among the swing voters likely to decide a closely contested White House. That's especially true should there be a decisive winner in the community northeast of Raleigh, unaffected by Hurricane Helene. Two decades have passed since any presidential candidate won Nash by more than a point. Confirmation won't come for hours (or days), but more intelligence will arrive about a half hour later when North Carolina's other Trump-Biden county -- New Hanover on the state's Atlantic Coast -- should wrap up its count. The other eight counties to watch: Erie and Northhampton in Pennsylvania; Maricopa in Arizona; Kent, Saginaw and Leelanau in Michigan and Sauk and Door in Wisconsin.

There's more to Arizona than Maricopa County. Seriously! Yes, it's true that Biden eked out a win in 2020 among the more than 60% of Arizona voters who live in the sprawling home of Phoenix and its suburbs. But Biden may not have won Arizona and its 11 electoral votes without his win in Apache County, where he beat Trump by 11,851 votes out of roughly 35,000 cast. His statewide margin? Just 10,457. Apache County is far from the typical Democratic urban stronghold. Much of the rural county is part of the Navajo Nation, and it also includes lands belonging to the Apache people who gave the county its name. In all, more than 70% of people living there are Native American. America's indigenous population is often overlooked in presidential elections: the states with the largest percentages of Native people - Alaska, New Mexico, Oklahoma and South Dakota - are not often competitive. Arizona's emergence as a battleground makes the voters in Apache County -- and the roughly 5% of Arizonans who are Native American -- a potential factor in this year's election.

Trump won Wisconsin by about 20,000 votes in 2016 - and he and the country had to wait on Milwaukee County to know which way that margin would fall. The state's largest county and Democratic stronghold is one of a handful in Wisconsin that releases results of mail ballots all at once, rather than combining them with other ballots counted at precinct polling places. In 2016, confirmation there weren't enough mail votes left to count in the City of Milwaukee to flip the race from Trump to Hillary Clinton allowed AP to declare the Republican the winner of the state - and the White House. In the 2022 midterms, it was only when AP confirmed there were no ballots remaining to be counted in Milwaukee and Dane County, Wisconsin's other largest source of Democratic votes, that it was able to say incumbent Republican Ron Johnson would return to the Senate. Milwaukee might not be among the final counties in Wisconsin to report its results this year, but don't count out its chances to be the decisive county once it does in this crucial battleground state.

Election officials nationwide found no cases of fraud, vandalism or theft related to the use of drop boxes that that could have affected the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. And yet no place in this year's election may face more scrutiny than the drop box - a tool designed to make voting easier that's become the source of conspiracy theories that they played a role ( they didn't ) in stealing the election from Trump ( it wasn't ). Several states have enacted laws restricting their use since 2020, while in others they remain the subject of fascination. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed itself in July and dumped a ruling that limited drop boxes to only election clerks' offices. Prosecutors are currently investigating allegations that the mayor of Wausau removed the city's drop box last month without consulting with the city clerk. Election officials typically have detailed processes to ensure the security of ballots left in drop boxes, which are often monitored remotely by camera. Still, drop boxes remain a place where opponents wrongly believe their vote is neither safe nor secure.

There are 538 electoral votes to win from the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but the Trump and Harris campaigns are seriously contesting only seven states this year as battlegrounds: Arizona and Nevada out West, North Carolina and Georgia in the South, Michigan and Wisconsin amid the Great Lakes and Pennsylvania as the final boss. Eight years ago, Pennsylvania was the last state called for Trump before he won election by winning in Wisconsin in the early morning hours after Election Day. Four years ago, Biden's win there four days after polls close -- by roughly 80,000 votes out of more than 6.8 million cast -- was the difference. Both presidential hopefuls can get to the 270 electoral votes need to win White House without the Keystone State, but their path to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue gets a whole lot easier if they grab Pennsylvania's 19 electoral votes along the way.

Supporters of abortion rights are 7-for-7 in statewide votes since the U.S. Supreme Court "" returned to the people and their elected representatives "" the ability to decide on the legality of abortion. Come Election Day, voters in nine more states will get the chance via ballot measure to do the same. The states range from the reliably blue (Colorado, Maryland) to the resolutely red (South Dakota, Missouri, Nebraska), with a few presidential battlegrounds and/or states with key races for U.S. Senate - Arizona, Nevada and Montana - in between. And then there's Florida, a state Hillary Clinton hoped would provide her with a powerful push into the White House. Instead, the Sunshine State was in 2016 (and again in 2020) a cornerstone of Trump's Electoral College count. A Trump loss in Florida would undoubtedly sink his bid to return to the White House, but it's hardly clear that the chance to vote on social issues - even one as potent as abortion - can sway enough voters to truly affect an outcome at the top of the ticket.

Republicans can likely hold the U.S. House of Representatives even if they lose a couple of seats in New York, where a messy redistricting process two years ago helped the GOP win six districts carried by Biden. But if those losses include freshman Rep. Marc Molinaro in the state's 19th District, it will make for an uncomfortable election night for House Speaker Mike Johnson. Molinaro has styled himself as a pragmatist as he seeks reelection for the first time, avoiding the circus of former GOP Rep. George Santos in New York's 3rd District - a seat his party has already lost - and the inconveniently timed headlines of rising party star and 17th District Rep. Mike Lawler. Democrat Josh Riley, who nearly won the district in 2022, has raised more money than Molinaro ahead of their November rematch, as Democrats run candidates nationwide who came up just short in the 2022 midterms. If that's a winning strategy in New York's 19th District and elsewhere, the celebrations might be the most raucous in Brooklyn at the election night party of New York 8th District Rep. Hakeem Jefferies: the Democratic leader and House Speaker-in-waiting.

Pay enough attention to politics and you'll have heard the bit about Democrats being one election away from winning in Texas. Then Election Day arrives and Republicans have the cattle while Democrats are once again holding their hat. Is this the year that changes? Democrats say they're investing serious cash into the state with the hope that an unpopular incumbent (Sen. Ted Cruz) is at risk to a rising star (former NFL player and current Rep. Colin Allred). Sound familiar? Six years ago, Cruz was an unpopular incumbent running against a rising Democratic star from the U.S. House named Beto O'Rourke. Some say O'Rourke ran the perfect campaign...and Cruz won by a comfortable 2.6 points. It's been 30 years since a Democrat won statewide in Texas, so maybe the odds are better for Democrats in Florida? They're spending money there, too, to try and take down incumbent Sen. Rick Scott. Ask the GOP what to make of these moves and they'll tell you Democrats need that kind of dramatic upset to keep control of the Senate.

John Duarte might be in one of the closest races of the cycle - and possibly faces the longest waiting time to find out if he's returning to Congress. The California Republican won his 2022 race by 564 votes in a race that was so close that the AP needed until the first week of December to declare Duarte the winner. Now he has to do it all again: He faces a rematch in the state's 13th Congressional District against former state Assemblyman Adam Gray. California's count takes so long in large part because the state conducts its elections entirely by mail. In the 13th, there are also no major cities - no L.A., no Bakersfield, not even Fresno - that would provide enough votes at the beginning of the night to make clear who has won. If the House majority comes down to Duarte's race, the nation's attention will focus on a long count in five counties of California's agricultural Central Valley.

The first Tuesday after the first Monday in November is Election Day, established in 1875 under 2 U.S. Code ¬ß 7 for the election ""in each of the States and Territories of the United States, of Representatives and Delegates to the Congress."" In modern U.S. elections, Election Day is perhaps best thought of as the LAST day of the general election: it's the final chance for voters to cast ballots in person, for mail ballots to arrive and be counted, or, in some states, the day by which mail ballots must be postmarked.

Three weeks later comes the last day a mail ballot can arrive in Washington state and still be counted -- Nov. 25 is the latest deadline of any state that accepts votes cast by mail to arrive with an Election Day postmark. In all, 17 states and the District of Columbia allow mail ballots to arrive after Election Day, while 32 others require they be in the ballot box on Election Day. Only Louisiana requires mail ballots to arrive early in order to be counted -- the deadline there for mail ballots is the day before Election Day.

After supporters of Trump stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in an insurrection that aimed to overturn his loss to then-President-elect Joe Biden, Congress updated the Electoral Count Act to, among other things, establish the date by which every state's governor must certify the results of the presidential election and submit their slate of electors. Any legal challenges should then be completed by Dec. 16, because those members of the Electoral College will vote the next day.

Wait, there's another election day? Indeed! The Constitution says it's not the people who pick a president, but rather a group of ""electors"" as selected by each state for the job. But the founders also wrote that states get to decide how to pick their members of the Electoral College, and almost all require they vote for the winner of their state's popular vote (Maine and Nebraska do it just a little differently). This ritual takes place about a week before Christmas, the deadline for the electors' cast ballots to arrive in Washington.

More ceremony in early January as the members of the 119th Congress, having taken office a few days earlier, count those Electoral College ballots under the rules of the updated Electoral Count Act. Objections are still possible, but much harder to raise, and the revised law makes plain the vice president is there only to announce the results as president of the Senate. Once the electoral votes are officially cast and counted, the final step of the election comes at the new president's inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025.

Almost all of the roughly 160 million ballots that will be cast in this year's election will be made of paper. And almost all will be counted by machine. Election officials say without such machines, counting those ballots by hand would take much longer, cost taxpayers far more and result in errors that would then take even more time and money to fix. ""Human beings are really bad at tedious things, and counting ballots is among the most tedious things we could do,"" said Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Charles Stewart. ""Computers are very good at tedious things. They can count very quickly and very accurately."" Still, the desire to have humans involved in the process lingers. Officials in Georgia remain at odds over a recent directive from the state's election board requiring poll workers to count the total number of ballots by hand.

At The Associated Press, a race is ""too early to call"" if election officials are still tabulating votes and there is no clear winner. Regardless of how tight the margin may be between the leading candidates, AP won't say a race is ""too close to call"" unless election officials have tallied all outstanding ballots -- save for provisional ballots and late-arriving mail and absentee votes -- and the winner still remains unclear. In those cases, it's likely AP won't be able to say who has won until election officials certify the results -- a process that may take up to several weeks after Election Day. By the way, elections headed to a recount aren't automatically ""too close to call."" In fact, depending on how many votes separate the trailing candidates from the leader, AP may declare a winner even if a recount is possible.

Here's the thing about recounts: They might be required by law, they might be requested by a candidate, they might be ordered by a court. But they're not very likely to do anything but drag out the inevitable. ""Recounts are shifting a very small number of votes,"" said Deb Otis of the nonpartisan organization Fair Vote. ""We're going to see recounts in 2024 that are not going to change the outcome."" They almost never do. In the 36 recounts of a statewide general election since America's most famous recount in 2000, none moved the margin by more than a few hundred votes. The average change? Just 0.03 percentage points. The biggest? A move of 0.11 points in the 2006 race for Vermont state auditor - a rare race that did flip as a 137-vote lead in the initial count for Republican Randy Brock became a 102-vote recount win by Democrat Thomas Salmon. ""The count is pretty accurate because the machines work,"" said former Arizona election official Tammy Patrick. ""We have recounts ... to make sure we got it right."" As hopeful trailing candidates will soon learn, the first count almost always is.

Looking for ""precincts reporting"" when watching as results are reported in this year's election? Chances are, you'll find an estimate of ""expected vote"" instead. The Associated Press and other news organizations have moved away from precincts reporting as a measure of election turnout for several reasons - the fact that well more than half of voters no longer cast their ballot in person at a neighborhood ""precinct"" on Election Day chief among them. Instead, AP will estimate how much of the vote election officials have counted - and how many ballots they have left to count - based on a number of data points, including details on advance ballots cast, registration statistics and turnout in recent elections. Those estimates will change as votes are counted and more information about the exact number of ballots cast becomes available. AP's estimates of ballots cast won't reach 100% until election results are certified as final and complete.

More often than not, in a nation as evenly divided as the United States, not on Election Day -- or, at the least, not on Election Day on the East Coast. Since it took 36 days for George W. Bush's win in the 2000 presidential race to play out in Florida and before the Supreme Court, only in Barack Obama's two victories has AP declared a White House winner before midnight Eastern Time. Trump didn't win until 2:29 a.m. ET in 2016 and he didn't lose in 2020 until the Saturday morning after Election Day -- that's how long it took for Biden to claim 270 electoral votes by emerging as the clear winner in Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the sheer number of U.S. Representatives from California -- a state where officials will be counting mail ballots for weeks -- could make for a long wait to know which party will control the House. The election for Speaker? That's a whole other matter.

The AP Elections Top 25 was reported by Leah Askarinam, Christina A. Cassidy, Christine Fernando, Meg Kinnard, Chris Megerian, Geoff Mulvihill, Stephen Ohlemacher, Emily Swanson, Mark Thiessen and Robert Yoon.

"How AP VoteCast works, and how it's different from an exit poll",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/how-ap-votecast-works-exit-poll-48c02b728cecb06c26a896b049fe1096,2024-10-08T19:18:40Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- When it comes to understanding elections, it's not just about who won and lost. To explain what really happened, it's important to understand who voted and how, what they cared about and how they felt about important issues facing the country.

At The Associated Press, AP VoteCast is a key part of answering those questions, explaining the voting coalitions that elected the president, determined congressional control and decided state-level ballot measures.

Launched in 2018, AP VoteCast is an extensive survey of both voters and nonvoters that aims to tell the story behind election results. Conducted for the AP and Fox News by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, it's a detailed snapshot of the American electorate that helps explain who voted, who didn't vote, what issues they care about, how they feel about the candidates and why they voted the way they did -- or didn't vote at all.

Although it serves a similar purpose, AP VoteCast is not an exit poll.

Traditional exit polls, including the one conducted by a consortium of news networks in the United States, rely largely on in-person interviews with voters conducted outside of select polling places after they've voted, supplemented with a phone survey to reach mail-in voters. Before AP VoteCast the AP worked with other major news organizations to conduct Election Day exit polls.

AP VoteCast was created in part to reflect significant changes over the years in how people vote, from a world where most people vote by showing up at the polls on Election Day to one where a growing number vote before Election Day.

In 1972, for example, about 95% of voters nationwide cast a ballot in-person on the day of the election. Since then, the number of those voting before Election Day has grown steadily, especially in the past few elections. In 2018, roughly 4 in 10 voters cast their ballots before the November general election. In 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, the number shot up to about 7 in 10. In the 2022 midterms, about half of voters cast pre-Election Day ballots.

AP VoteCast captures the views of voters -- whether they vote in person on Election Day or weeks ahead of time -- by beginning to interview registered voters several days before Election Day. Those interviews conclude as polls close in each state. Interviews are offered in English and Spanish, as needed.

This approach allowed AP VoteCast to reliably survey more than 130,000 registered voters in all 50 states during the 2020 presidential election, and comprehensively explain how Democrat Joe Biden won the presidential election.

AP VoteCast uses a combination of methods -- mail, phone and online interviews -- to reach registered voters and capture their opinions about the candidates and the election, regardless of whether they vote in-person on or before Election Day or by mail-in ballot.

The first step in the process is to find people to participate in the survey. A random sample of registered voters drawn from state voter files is contacted through the mail and invited to take the survey online or by phone. Some voters are also contacted by phone if they do not respond to the initial invitation to take part in the survey.

Besides the randomly selected group of eligible registered voters, AP VoteCast collects data by conducting interviews with additional voters recruited through ""opt-in"" online panels where the participants are not selected randomly but instead recruited through internet advertising. This helps give AP VoteCast a broader reach and additional depth.

To make sure these additional interviews don't overrepresent or underrepresent important demographic and ideological groups, the panel's composition is carefully calibrated to match the random sample survey on key attitudes, along with matching the demographic characteristics of all registered voters.

Voters are asked a standard set of demographic questions, such as their age, sex, race and ethnicity, education level and the type of neighborhood they live in. They're asked to share their views on what they look for in a candidate, what they think about the candidates on the ballot and what they believe are the key issues facing the country, such as abortion, crime, the economy, health care and immigration.

While voters are asked for whom they're voting, the AP doesn't use this information to report an overall horse race result or to replace vote totals. But the survey results do provide valuable insight into how specific groups voted. For example, in the 2020 presidential election, AP VoteCast results showed that white men favored Republican Donald Trump, while women with college degrees favored Biden. That year, voters who thought the economy was the top issue preferred Trump, while those who thought health care was the top issue supported Biden.

In the 2024 Republican primary, AP VoteCast surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina showed that while Trump won commanding victories in the early states, he struggled to broaden his support beyond those groups that have generally supported him in the past. Harris didn't become the Democratic nominee through the primary process, so her support among the party's primary voters wasn't captured in AP VoteCast surveys.

Courts keep weighing in on abortion. Next month's elections could mean even bigger changes,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-ruling-texas-georgia-5c5d73c45274f90d40f7a4a07f00a27a,2024-10-08T16:18:22Z,"Two court rulings Monday bolstered abortion opponents, with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that Texas could ban emergency abortions if they violate state law and Georgia's top court allowing enforcement of the abortion ban in that state.

The rulings are the latest in a legal saga that's been playing out a few rulings at a time across the U.S. for the past two years -- since the nation's top court overturned Roe v. Wade, ended the nationwide right to abortion, and opened the door to bans and restrictions, as well as the new legal fights that followed.

Meanwhile, abortion is also a top concern for voters ahead of next month's elections, including in nine states where it's on the ballot directly in the form of state constitutional amendments.

Here are five key things to know about the latest abortion developments across the country.

In the fallout of the 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, President Joe Biden's administration told hospitals that federal law required them to provide abortion services when the life of the pregnant person was at risk.

Texas sued over the policy, saying the federal government could not mandate the right to abortions that would violate the state's ban at all stages of pregnancy, with exceptions to protect the health and life of the woman.

On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court let that ruling stand. The justices did not detail their reasoning.

A weeks after a Georgia judge blocked the state's ban on abortion after the first six weeks or so of pregnancy, the state Supreme Court on Monday put it back into place -- at least for now.

The state's top court said the ban on abortion once cardiac activity can be detected, generally about six weeks into pregnancy and often before women realize they're pregnant, can be enforced while it considers the state's appeal of the September ruling.

It's not clear how many abortions were provided in the state that could not have been under the ban during the week the rules were relaxed. Some clinics said they were willing to provide abortions after six weeks, though.

The ruling meant that four states again bar abortion in most cases after about six weeks of pregnancy.

In another late-September development, a North Dakota ruling from earlier in the month striking down that state's abortion ban became official.

That means that 13 states are now enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, instead of 14.

But the impact of the ruling in North Dakota is limited to hospitals in the nation's second-least populous state.

The only clinic that provided abortions in the state moved from Fargo to nearby Moorhead, Minnesota, after the Dobbs ruling was made and North Dakota's ban took effect.

Court rulings are not the only place where abortion policy decisions are being made.

Voters in nine states are determining whether to add the right to abortion to their state constitutions.

In Missouri and South Dakota, the measures would undo current bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy. In Florida, it would lift a ban that kicks in after six weeks.

Nebraska has competing measures on the ballot. One would create the right to abortion until fetal viability, generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks into pregnancy. The other would enshrine the current ban that kicks in after 12 weeks.

In Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana, it would enshrine, and in some cases expand, abortion rights. Nevada's vote would, too, but to take effect, the measure would have to pass a second time, in 2026.

Additionally, New York voters will decide on an amendment that would bar discrimination on the basis of pregnancy status, though it does not mention abortion by name.

Abortion is a major issue in elections for office, too -- including the presidential race.

Vice President Kamala Harris has been focusing on abortion rights in her presidential campaign. She says she wants to ""reinstate the protections of Roe"". She talked about it on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast this week and in a speech last month in Georgia.

Former President Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has taken credit for nominating Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe. He says that the issue should be up to the states and, recently, that he would veto a nationwide abortion ban if Congress passed one. He has also said he would vote against the Florida ballot measure, though he has also criticized it as too restrictive."
"Encuesta: Votantes negros apoyan m√°s a Harris, pero no est√°n seguros de que cambiar√° las cosas",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/politics/encuesta-votantes-negros-apoyan-mas-a-harris-pero-no-estan-seguros-de-que-cambiara-las-cosas-b8e6e2f00c41d9e00df2a6b5503abc4b,2024-10-08T16:01:14Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Los votantes registrados negros tienen un punto de vista abrumadoramente positivo de la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris, pero no est√°n seguros de que ella cambiar√° al pa√≠s para bien, seg√∫n una encuesta de AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

La encuesta, realizada a mediados de septiembre, hall√≥ que alrededor de un 70% de los votantes negros tienen una opini√≥n muy o algo favorable de Harris, con escasa diferencia entre hombres y mujeres. Los votantes m√°s j√≥venes y los de edad m√°s avanzada tambi√©n ten√≠an opiniones similares de la vicepresidenta.

Las opiniones entre los votantes negros hacia el expresidente y candidato presidencial republicano Donald Trump, en cambio, son abrumadoramente negativas, lo que subraya la dificultad que enfrenta en sus intentos por quitarle a Harris apoyo entre las personas de raza negra. Los votantes negros son un importante baluarte para los dem√≥cratas y pocos est√°n alineados con el Partido Republicano. Seg√∫n la encuesta, dos tercios de los votantes negros se identifican como dem√≥cratas, un 20% se identifica como independiente y solo un 10% se identifica como republicano.

Pero el sondeo tambi√©n hall√≥ que, a pesar de la profunda discrepancia en los puntos de vista hacia los candidatos, los votantes negros tienen menos certeza en cuanto a que Harris pueda colocar al pa√≠s en una mejor trayectoria o cambiar sus vidas de manera significativa. Preguntados si la frase ""Cambiar√≠a al pa√≠s para bien"" describe bien a Harris, solo la mitad dijo que la describir√≠a muy o extremadamente bien, un 30% dijo que la describir√≠a ""m√°s o menos bien"" y un 20% dijo que la describe ""no muy bien"" o ""para nada bien"". Y solo alrededor de la mitad opinan que el resultado de estas elecciones tendr√° ""mucho"" o ""algo"" de impacto en sus vidas, una proporci√≥n similar a la hallada en la poblaci√≥n general.

""El Partido Dem√≥crata no es lo suficiente fuerte para m√≠"", expres√≥ Raina Johnson, una habitante de Chicago de 53 a√±os de edad. Vaticin√≥ que Harris ""tratar√° de hacer algo a favor de la gente"" pero se ver√° limitada ""como ocurri√≥ con (Barack) Obama, porque el Partido Republicano le tranc√≥ el camino"".

Si bien Johnson opina que las elecciones ser√°n muy importantes, no cree que le afectar√° mucho en su vida ""porque yo seguir√© viviendo mi vida, seguir√© adapt√°ndome a los problemas que surjan"".

Preguntados sobre cu√°l candidato har√≠a un mejor trabajo en encarar los temas que enfrentan al pa√≠s -- como la econom√≠a, la atenci√≥n m√©dica y la delincuencia - la mayor√≠a de los votantes negros coincidieron: Harris.

Al igual que en la poblaci√≥n general, un 80% de los votantes negros dijeron que la econom√≠a es uno de los temas principales en esta campa√±a. Pero un 75% de los votantes negros dijeron que la atenci√≥n m√©dica es uno de los temas m√°s importantes, comparado con poco m√°s de la mitad de la poblaci√≥n general. Adem√°s, los votantes negros son m√°s propensos a opinar que las normas sobre tenencia de armas y la delincuencia son problemas importantes, que en la poblaci√≥n general.

En todos esos temas, as√≠ como en otros como el aborto y el cambio clim√°tico, Harris supera c√≥modamente a Trump entre los votantes negros. Pero el tama√±o de esa ventaja es mayor en algunos temas que en otros. Un 60% de los votantes negros opinan que Harris est√° mejor posicionada para manejar la econom√≠a, mientras que un 20% dice lo mismo de Trump, lo que le da a Harris una ventaja de alrededor de 40 puntos. En cuanto al aborto, ella tiene una ventaja de alrededor de 60 puntos.

La campa√±a de Trump ha estado aumentando sus intentos por ganarse el apoyo de las comunidades negras, creyendo que su mensaje en cuanto a la econom√≠a, la inmigraci√≥n y los valores tradicionales puede quitarle votos a los dem√≥cratas, particularmente entre los hombres negros m√°s j√≥venes.

Rod Wettlin, un jubilado y veterano de la Fuerza A√©rea en Surprise, Arizona que desea m√°s acci√≥n en cuanto a la atenci√≥n m√©dica y la inmigraci√≥n, dice que se opone fuertemente a Trump y que teme que la democracia estadounidense est√° en peligro.

""Lo que est√° pasando ahora es la culminaci√≥n de algo a lo que nos hemos enfrentado desde hace a√±os"", dijo Wettlin. ""Ojal√° despu√©s de las elecciones volveremos a un discurso m√°s civil, pero esta gente desde ya est√° clamando por un caos. Y eso es su derecho, yo luch√© para que ellos tengan ese derecho. Pero que no vengan a pisarme mis derechos"".

Hay indicios de que algunos votantes negros consideran a Harris una figura m√°s fuerte. Las mujeres negras y los votantes negros de mayor edad especialmente son m√°s propensos a describir a Harris como alguien que ""luchar√° a favor de gente como t√∫"", comparado con los hombres negros y los votantes negros m√°s j√≥venes.

Son relativamente pocos los votantes negros que tienen una opini√≥n positiva de Trump, o que lo consideran un candidato poseedor de las cualidades necesarias para ser presidente. La encuesta hall√≥ que alrededor del 80% de los votantes negros tienen una opini√≥n algo o muy desfavorable de Trump, mientras que apenas un 15% tienen una opini√≥n algo o muy favorable. Apenas alrededor de un 10% dicen que frases como ""Cambiar√≠a al pa√≠s para bien"" o ""Luchar√≠a por gente como t√∫"" describen bien a Trump, y una proporci√≥n igualmente baja de votantes negros dijeron que Trump ser√≠a un buen presidente.

""Creo que iremos por la direcci√≥n correcta si Kamala Harris gana"", opin√≥ Roslyn Coble, una residente de Oakboro, Carolina del Norte, de 63 a√±os de edad. ""Pero si Donald Trump gana, las cosas ir√°n mal. √âl ya dej√≥ claro lo que va a hacer, va a ser un dictador"".

Alrededor del 70% de los votantes negros dicen que la frase ""Dir√° cualquier cosa para ganar las elecciones"" describe a Trump por lo menos muy bien.

En un indicio de c√≥mo la decisi√≥n del presidente Joe Biden de retirarse como candidato dem√≥crata en julio podr√≠a haber afectado la contienda, solo un 55% de los hombres negros tienen una opini√≥n favorable de Biden, comparado con 70% entre las mujeres negras.

Biden ""hizo lo mejor que pudo"", declar√≥ Wettlin. A√±adi√≥ que Biden debi√≥ haberse retirado mucho antes, y se mostr√≥ esc√©ptico ante los logros del mandatario.

Grupos de activismo negro dicen que han detectado un aumento en energ√≠a y entusiasmo desde que Harris se convirti√≥ en la candidata dem√≥crata, y tanto la campa√±a de Harris como la de Trump siguen centrando esfuerzos en ese sector demogr√°fico.

La campa√±a de Trump ha estado organizando eventos en vecindarios negros de ciudades como Filadelfia, Detroit y Milwaukee y organiz√≥ una gira en autob√∫s con el lema ""Voces Negras A Favor De Trump"" en septiembre. Por su parte, la campa√±a de Harris ha realizado varios eventos orientados hacia los votantes negros, especialmente los hombres, y ha despachado a varios partidarios prominentes - como legisladores, celebridades y l√≠deres de derechos civiles - en comunidades negras en semanas recientes.

La encuesta abarc√≥ 1.771 votantes registrados y se realiz√≥ entre el 12 y 16 de septiembre usando una muestra AmeriSpeak, dise√±ada para ser representativa de toda la poblaci√≥n estadounidense. Tiene un margen de error de +/- 3,4 puntos porcentuales."
What polling shows about Black voters' views of Harris and Trump,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-election-black-voters-biden-78e344ddea4886dd23582f4a51eb0da6,2024-10-08T04:06:13Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Black registered voters have an‚ÄØoverwhelmingly positive‚ÄØview of Vice President Kamala Harris, but they're less sure that she would change the country for the better, according to a recent poll from the‚ÄØ AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

The poll, which was conducted in mid-September, found‚ÄØabout 7 in 10‚ÄØBlack voters have a‚ÄØsomewhat or very favorable‚ÄØview of Harris, with‚ÄØfew differences‚ÄØbetween Black men and women voters on how they view the Democratic candidate. Younger and older Black voters also had‚ÄØsimilar views‚ÄØof the vice president.

Black voters' opinions of former President Donald Trump, by contrast, were‚ÄØoverwhelmingly negative, underscoring the challenges that the Republican candidate faces as he seeks to erode Harris' support among Black men. Black voters are an important Democratic constituency, and few are aligned with the Republican Party. According to the survey, two-thirds‚ÄØof Black voters identify as Democrats,‚ÄØabout 2 in 10‚ÄØidentify as independents and‚ÄØabout 1 in 10‚ÄØidentify as Republicans.

But the poll also found that despite this dramatic gap in views of the candidates, Black voters are less certain of whether Harris would set the country on a better trajectory, or make a substantial difference in their own lives. Only‚ÄØabout half‚ÄØof Black voters say ""would change the country for the better"" describes Harris‚ÄØvery or extremely well, while about 3 in 10 say it describes her ""somewhat well"" and about 2 in 10 say it describes her ""not very well"" or ""not well at all."" And only‚ÄØabout half‚ÄØbelieve the outcome of this presidential election will have ""a great deal"" or ""quite a bit"" of impact on them personally, an assessment that's‚ÄØin line with Americans overall.

""The Democratic Party is not strong enough for me,"" said Raina Johnson, 53, a safety case manager in Chicago. Johnson predicted that Harris would ""try to do something for the people"" but she felt that Harris would be limited as it was ""with (Barack) Obama, because the Republican Party shut him down.""

While Johnson felt that the stakes of the election were extremely high, she did not think it would have a large personal impact on her.

""Because I'll still live my life. I'll just have to roll with the punches,"" she said.

When asked which candidate would do a better job handling their top issues, including the‚ÄØeconomy,‚ÄØhealth care and‚ÄØcrime, Black voters had the same answer:‚ÄØHarris.

Like voters overall,‚ÄØabout 8 in 10‚ÄØBlack voters said the economy is‚ÄØone of the most important issues‚ÄØto their vote. But‚ÄØabout three-quarters‚ÄØof Black voters said health care was one of their most important issues, compared to‚ÄØslightly more than half‚ÄØof registered voters, and they were also‚ÄØmore likely‚ÄØthan the electorate as a whole to say‚ÄØgun policy‚ÄØand‚ÄØcrime‚ÄØwere top issues.

In all of those areas, as well as on other topics like abortion and climate change, Harris held a commanding advantage over Trump among Black voters. But the size of that edge was bigger on some issues than others. About 6 in 10‚ÄØBlack voters said Harris was better positioned to handle the economy, while‚ÄØabout 2 in 10‚ÄØsaid this about Trump, giving Harris‚ÄØabout a 40-point advantage. On‚ÄØabortion‚ÄØpolicy, she had‚ÄØaround a 60-point advantage‚ÄØover Trump.

The Trump campaign has stepped up with some outreach to Black communities this year. The former president's campaign believes that‚ÄØhis‚ÄØmessage on the economy, immigration and traditional values can make notable inroads into the Democrats' traditional base of support among Black voters, especially younger Black men.

Rod Wettlin, a retired Air Force veteran in Surprise, Arizona, who wants greater action on issues like‚ÄØhealth care‚ÄØand immigration, said he was deeply opposed to Trump and was concerned about the implications of the election for American democracy.

""What's going on now is the culmination of a lot of stuff that's been in our face for years,"" said Wettlin. ""Hopefully after the election it is civil, but these cats out here are already calling for bedlam. And that's their right, I fought for them to have that right. But don't infringe on mine.""

There are signs that some groups of Black voters see Harris as a stronger figure, though. Black women voters and older Black voters were‚ÄØespecially likely‚ÄØto describe Harris as someone who would ""fight for people like you,"" compared to Black men and younger Black voters.

Relatively few‚ÄØBlack voters have a positive view of Trump, or see him as a candidate who has important qualities for the presidency. The poll found that‚ÄØabout‚ÄØ8 in 10 Black voters‚ÄØhave a‚ÄØsomewhat or very‚ÄØunfavorable view of Trump, while‚ÄØjust 15% ‚ÄØhave a‚ÄØsomewhat or very‚ÄØfavorable view.‚ÄØAbout 1 in 10‚ÄØsaid ""would change the country for the better"" or ""would fight for people like you"" describes Trump‚ÄØat least very well, and a similarly low share‚ÄØof Black voters said that Trump would make a good president.

""I think we're headed in the right direction if Kamala Harris gets it,"" said‚ÄØRoslyn Coble, 63, and‚ÄØa resident of‚ÄØOakboro, North Carolina. ""But if Donald Trump gets it,‚ÄØit's going to be bad. He already told us what he's going to do. He's going to be a dictator.""

About 7 in 10‚ÄØBlack voters say the phrase ""will say anything to win the election"" describes Trump at least very well.

In a sign of how former President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw as the Democratic candidate in July may have altered the race, only‚ÄØ55%‚ÄØof Black men‚ÄØvoters‚ÄØhave a favorable view of Biden, compared to‚ÄØ7 in 10‚ÄØBlack women‚ÄØvoters.

""He did his best,"" said Wettlin. He said that Biden should have bowed out of the presidential race far sooner and was skeptical of some of his achievements.

Black voter engagement organizations‚ÄØsay they‚ÄØhave also seen a burst of energy from voters and advocates since Harris' entrance into the race, and both the Harris and Trump campaigns are continuing to focus on this group.

The Trump campaign has been conducting listening sessions and community events in Black neighborhoods in cities like Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee. The campaign has also coordinated a ""Black Voices for Trump"" bus tour across cities in September. Meanwhile, the Harris campaign has held a number of events geared toward Black voters, especially Black men, and has deployed a number of high-profile surrogates, including lawmakers, celebrities and civil rights leaders, to Black communities in recent weeks.

The poll of 1,771 registered voters was conducted Sept. 12-16, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for registered voters is plus or minus 3.4 percentage points."

Georgia Supreme Court halts ruling striking down state's near-ban on abortions as the state appeals,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/georgia-abortion-ban-967ed4f8efe64d07e22213c47749df9a,2024-10-07T17:15:01Z,"SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) -- The Georgia Supreme Court on Monday halted a ruling striking down the state's near-ban on abortions while it considers the state's appeal.

The high court's order came a week after a judge found that Georgia unconstitutionally prohibits abortions beyond about six weeks of pregnancy, often before women realize they're pregnant. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled Sept. 30 that privacy rights under Georgia's state constitution include the right to make personal healthcare decisions.

It was one of a wave of restrictive abortion laws passed in Republican-controlled states after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a national right to abortion. It prohibited most abortions once a ""detectable human heartbeat"" was present. At around six weeks into a pregnancy, cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in an embryo's cells that will eventually become the heart.

Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed it in 2019, but it didn't take effect until Roe v. Wade fell.

McBurney wrote in his ruling that ""liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.""

""When a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then -- and only then -- may society intervene,"" McBurney wrote.

The judge's decision rolled back abortion limits in Georgia to a prior law allowing abortions until viability, roughly 22 to 24 weeks into a pregnancy.

""Once again, the will of Georgians and their representatives has been overruled by the personal beliefs of one judge,"" Kemp said in a statement in response to McBurney's decision. ""Protecting the lives of the most vulnerable among us is one of our most sacred responsibilities, and Georgia will continue to be a place where we fight for the lives of the unborn.""

Abortion providers and advocates in Georgia had applauded McBurney's ruling, but expressed concern that it would soon be overturned."
"Corte Suprema deja vigente prohibici√≥n a abortos en Texas, incluso los de emergencia",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/us-news/general-news-27f7423fbdba39336b74954c504584bc,2024-10-07T16:17:52Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- La Corte Suprema dej√≥ vigente el lunes una decisi√≥n que proh√≠be los abortos de emergencia que violen la ley en Texas, que tiene una de las prohibiciones al aborto m√°s estrictas del pa√≠s.

Sin dar explicaciones, el m√°ximo tribunal dej√≥ vigente el fallo de un tribunal inferior seg√∫n el cual los hospitales no pueden ser obligados a practicar terminaciones de emergencia de embarazos que violen la ley de Texas. No hubo ning√∫n disenso p√∫blico.

El gobierno del presidente Joe Biden le hab√≠a pedido a la Corte Suprema que desestimara el fallo del tribunal menor, argumentando que los hospitales est√°n obligados a practicar abortos en situaciones de emergencia bajo las leyes federales. El gobierno se√±al√≥ una decisi√≥n previa de la Corte Suprema en un caso similar registrado de Idaho, en que los magistrados por estrecha mayor√≠a permitieron los abortos de emergencia mientras contin√∫a una demanda.

El gobierno federal tambi√©n mencion√≥ un fallo de la Corte Suprema de Texas seg√∫n el cual los m√©dicos no tienen que esperar a que la vida de una mujer est√© en peligro inmediato para poder practicar legalmente un aborto. De acuerdo con el gobierno estadounidense, ello ajusta a Texas a las leyes federales e implica que el fallo de la corte menor no es necesario.

Texas le pidi√≥ a la Corte Suprema federal mantener vigente la orden, argumentando que el fallo del tribunal estatal significa que la ley de Texas, a diferencia de la de Idaho, s√≠ tiene una excepci√≥n para proteger la salud de la mujer y que no hay conflicto entre las leyes federal y estatal.

Los m√©dicos han dicho que la ley sigue siendo peligrosamente vaga luego que una junta m√©dica se neg√≥ a especificar exactamente qu√© condiciones califican como excepci√≥n.

Han aumentado recientemente las denuncias de que mujeres embarazadas con problemas m√©dicos han sido rechazadas en salas de emergencia en Texas y otros estados, mientras los hospitales debaten si el cuidado est√°ndar podr√≠a violar las estrictas leyes contra el aborto.

La terminaci√≥n de un embarazo siempre ha sido parte del tratamiento m√©dico para personas con complicaciones serias como manera de evitar la sepsis, la atrofia de √≥rganos u otros problemas. Pero en Texas y otros estados, m√©dicos y hospitales han dicho que no queda claro si esas terminaciones violan las prohibiciones al aborto que acarrean penas de prisi√≥n.

El caso de Texas empez√≥ luego que la Corte Suprema derog√≥ el fallo Roe vs. Wade en 2022, lo que llev√≥ a prohibiciones al aborto en varios estados gobernados por republicanos. El gobierno de Biden emiti√≥ una directriz diciendo que los hospitales todav√≠a deb√≠an practicar abortos en casos de emergencia, bajo una ley de salud que requiere a la mayor√≠a de los hospitales atender a cualquier paciente enfermo.

Texas demand√≥ en contra de esa directriz, argumentando que no se puede obligar a los hospitales a violar la prohibici√≥n al aborto vigente en el estado. La Corte Federal de Apelaciones del Quinto Distrito le dio la raz√≥n a Texas, diciendo en enero que el gobierno estadounidense hab√≠a excedido su autoridad."
Supreme Court lets stand a decision barring emergency abortions that violate Texas ban,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-emergency-abortion-texas-bf79fafceba4ab9df9df2489e5d43e72,2024-10-07T13:47:42Z,"Without detailing their reasoning, the justices kept in place a lower court order that said hospitals cannot be required to provide pregnancy terminations that would violate Texas law.

The Biden administration had asked the justices to throw out the lower court order, arguing that hospitals have to perform abortions in emergency situations under federal law. The administration pointed to the Supreme Court's action in a similar case from Idaho earlier this year in which the justices narrowly allowed emergency abortions to resume while a lawsuit continues.

The administration also cited a Texas Supreme Court ruling that said doctors do not have to wait until a woman's life is in immediate danger to provide an abortion legally. The administration said it brings Texas in line with federal law and means the lower court ruling is not necessary.

Texas asked the justices to leave the order in place, saying the state Supreme Court ruling meant Texas law, unlike Idaho's, does have an exception for the health of a pregnant patient and there's no conflict between federal and state law."
Andy Kim and Curtis Bashaw clash over abortion and immigration in New Jersey Senate debate,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/new-jersey-senate-debate-kim-bashaw-57659eff4ca62c7e581978f0d91561cb,2024-10-07T02:57:18Z,"NUTLEY, N.J. (AP) -- Democratic Rep. Andy Kim and Republican Curtis Bashaw clashed over abortion and immigration Sunday in their first debate for New Jersey's Senate seat, open this year after Bob Menendez's conviction on bribery charges and resignation.

Kim, a three-term representative from the 3rd District, hammered Bashaw for his support of former President Donald Trump and expressed skepticism about Bashaw's position as an abortion rights supporter. Bashaw, a hotel developer from southern New Jersey and first-time candidate, sought to cast himself as a moderate and Kim as a Washington insider.

The debate was briefly derailed at the start when Bashaw stopped speaking mid-sentence and stared ahead, nonresponsive. He was helped from the stage and left the room for roughly 10 minutes.

""I got so worked up about this affordability issue that I realized I hadn't eaten so much food today,"" Bashaw said when he returned. ""So I appreciate your indulgence.""

Among the most pointed exchanges was over abortion. Both candidates support abortion rights, but Bashaw has said he supported the U.S. Supreme Court's decision that ended Roe v. Wade. New Jersey has enshrined abortion protections in state law.

""I just fundamentally have a problem with using the term 'pro-choice' to describe yourself when you have talked about the important of the Dobbs decision being correctly decided,"" Kim said.

He also hammered Bashaw for his support of Trump, who has twice lost New Jersey's electoral votes.

""The one endorsement that he has made is for Donald Trump to be president of the United States,"" Kim said. ""And I guess we get a sense of his judgment from that.""

Bashaw, who defeated a Trump-endorsed rival in the primary, didn't defend the former president explicitly.

""Elections are binary choices, and we all have to make a decision,"" he said.

He touted his own candidacy based on his credentials as a businessperson and resisted being typecast as a traditional Republican, pointing out that he backs abortion rights and is a married gay man.

""I am pro-choice, congressman. I am for freedom in the home,"" Bashaw said. ""I don't think government should tell me who I can marry. I don't think it should tell a woman what she can do with her reproductive health choices.""

Bashaw hammered on immigration repeatedly throughout, saying it's ""a crisis in New Jersey"" and is costing the state.

In a reflection of how Democratic-leaning New Jersey has been in Senate races, which Republicans haven't won in more than five decades, Bashaw addressed his closing statements to women and moms of New Jersey.

""I am a moderate, common-sense person that will work to be a voice for New Jersey,"" he said.

Kim declared his candidacy a day after Menendez's indictment last year, saying it was time for the state to turn the page on the longtime legislator. It looked as if the Democratic primary in a must-win state for the party would be contentious when first lady Tammy Murphy entered the race, winning support from influential party leaders.

But Kim challenged the state's unique ballot-drawing system widely viewed as favoring the candidates backed by party leaders. A federal judge sided with Kim in his legal challenge, putting the system on hold for this election. Murphy dropped out of the race, saying she wanted to avoid a divisive primary, leaving a clear path to Kim's nomination.

Kim first won office to the House in 2018, defeating Republican Rep. Tom MacArthur. He got national attention after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection when he was photographed picking up trash in the building.

Bashaw won a contested primary in June, defeating a Trump-backed opponent. The hotel developer from Cape May is running for office for the first time.

Menendez was convicted this summer on federal charges of accepting bribes of gold and cash from three New Jersey businesspeople and acting as an agent for the Egyptian government. He has vowed to appeal the conviction.

He resigned in August, capping a career in politics that spanned roughly five decades. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy appointed George Helmy as interim senator. Helmy said he'll resign after the election is certified so Murphy can appoint whoever wins the election to the seat for the remainder of Menendez's term, which expires in January."
Walz says he'll 'own up' when he misspeaks as the Democratic ticket steps up media interviews,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/walz-harris-media-interview-presidential-campaign-83325184cd7f93ca505df590f7a27ede,2024-10-06T16:08:51Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly a week after verbal stumbles in the only vice presidential debate, Democrat Tim Walz used his debut campaign appearance on a Sunday news show to try to fend off criticism of his stand on abortion rights and ""own up"" to past misstatements.

The interview on ""Fox News Sunday"" reflected a broader media blitz by presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her running mate as the Democrats seek to garner public attention in the final 30 days of the campaign against Republicans Donald Trump and JD Vance.

Harris has taped an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that will air Monday night. She is booked Tuesday on Howard Stern's satellite radio show, ABC's ""The View"" and ""The Late Show"" with Stephen Colbert on CBS. Her interview on the podcast ""Call Her Daddy"" is scheduled to be released later Sunday. Walz will be on Jimmy Kimmel's ABC show on Monday.

Walz's Fox appearance also touched on the turmoil in the Middle East, with anchor Shannon Bream pressing the Minnesota governor on whether Israel has a right to preemptively attack Iran's nuclear and oil facilities in response to Tehran's firing of missiles against Israel. It was a question that Walz did not fully answer during his debate this past week with Vance, an Ohio senator.

Walz said Sunday that ""specific operations will be dealt with at the time."" He said Israel has a right to defend itself and that Harris worked with Israel this past week to repel the Iranian attack. President Joe Biden said last week he would not support an Israeli strike on sites related to Tehran's nuclear program.

Walz defended a law that he signed as governor to ensure abortion protections, saying it ""puts this puts the decision with the woman and her health care providers."" He questioned the statement by Trump that he would not sign a national abortion ban into law.

On the economy, Walz said Harris' proposals would make life more affordable for the middle class by helping with the construction of 3 million new homes and expanding tax credits for parents. He said tariffs floated by Trump could increase costs by an estimated $4,000 a year on a typical family.

Walz also faced questions in the interview about misstatements pertaining to his military service, drunken driving arrest, infertility treatment for his family and claims to have been in Hong Kong before the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in China.

""I will own up when I misspeak,"" Walz said.

He said he believes voters are more concerned by the fact that Vance could not acknowledge during their debate that Trump lost the 2020 election to Biden and that there could restrictions on the infertility treatment of intrauterine insemination that his wife, Gwen, received.

""I think they're probably far more concerned with that than my wife and I used IUI to have our child and that Donald Trump would restrict that,"" Walz said. ""So I think folks know who I am.""

Bream noted that Trump has come out in support of fertility treatments, even as he has said that abortion questions should be decided by states."
Mormon church leaders encourage civility as Trump and Harris rally religious voters,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mormon-voters-trump-harris-abortion-4b7d1b3fca00d341ba988d3390cfc3d5,2024-10-05T22:51:31Z,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- As both presidential campaigns have stepped up efforts to win over voters in western swing states who belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a top church official urged members on Saturday to ""avoid what is harsh and hateful"" in the heat of election season.

Dallin H. Oaks, the top adviser and likely successor to 100-year-old church president Russell M. Nelson, encouraged congregants at the faith's twice-annual general conference to steer clear of contention and be peacemakers in their communities one month out from the Nov. 5 election.

The devil is the father of contention, which can stir up anger and stall important policy changes, he told a room of 18,000 church members in Salt Lake City and thousands more watching on a livestream.

""As we pursue our preferred policies in public actions, let us qualify for his blessings by using the language and methods of peacemakers,"" said Oaks, the second-highest-ranking leader of the faith known widely as the Mormon church.

The faith's leaders strive to remain politically neutral. But they sometimes give general advice about how members should approach key elections. About 7 million of the faith's 17 million worldwide members live in the United States, many in the battleground states of Arizona and Nevada, and in solidly red Utah and Idaho.

Latter-day Saints have been a reliably Republican voting bloc for decades, but many have half-heartedly embraced Donald Trump since his first run for the White House.

Some church members say the former president's demeaning rhetoric toward women, immigrants and refugees conflicts with their core values of humility, honesty and compassion. Others have raised concern about his felony convictions and his attempts to undermine the 2020 presidential election.

Vice President Kamala Harris is hoping to capitalize on her opponent's inability to lock down the Latter-day Saints vote. Her campaign formalized outreach efforts last month and enlisted prominent members of the faith to convince those in battleground Arizona, a state with nearly 450,000 church members, that Trump is not in alignment with the church's teachings.

Trump has also rallied influential church members at his Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida to help him convince swing voters that he will better protect their religious liberties.

Harris is unlikely to come close to winning a majority of Latter-day Saints. But by preventing Trump from running up big margins with a key demographic, she could tip the scales in Arizona and Nevada, which is home to upward of 180,000 Latter-day Saints.

One of Harris' greatest challenges is making her abortion policy palatable to members of a faith that has long opposed the procedure, with some exceptions.

It is a sticking point for Marilou Idos, a conference attendee from Herriman, Utah, who said she is not a fan of Trump's brash style but plans to vote for him because he opposes expanding abortion access. She also values Trump's support for Israel.

""He's the lesser of two evils,"" said Idos, 70. ""The basic things we believe in, Trump endorses. Abortion, that's kind of the main one, and the freedom to worship.""

The religion is also known for its belief in eternal families, tight-knit congregations and bans on alcohol, coffee, gambling and same-sex relationships.

Sammy Price, 38, of Las Vegas, said he is leaning toward voting for Harris because he thinks the nation needs her unifying rhetoric.

""Trump, he insults people, he makes people feel bad about who they are, and that's not something I think I can stand by,"" he said.

Undecided voters Jenna Winkel, 22, and her husband, Ben Winkel, 24, said just before the conference that they hoped church leaders would avoid addressing politics.

The couple from Draper, Utah, said there is room for a variety of political views under the Latter-day Saints umbrella. While Jenna said her religion doesn't really inform her politics, Ben said his does, but he wants to do more of his own research.

""The important thing about any general conference message is that it's general and then we're asked to take them and study them and apply them to our own lives, and maybe our politics,"" Jenna said. ""People will take what they need to hear from them and apply them in their lives."""
The Supreme Court opens its new term with election disputes in the air but not yet on the docket,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-election-transgender-free-speech-guns-50d7d3d0a85932efe407a80aeaea75fa,2024-10-05T12:43:12Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Transgender rights, the regulation of ""ghost guns"" and the death penalty highlight the Supreme Court's election-season term that begins Monday, with the prospect of the court's intervention in voting disputes lurking in the background.

The justices are returning to the bench at a time of waning public confidence in the court and calls to limit their terms to 18 years that have wide support, including the backing of Democratic President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the party's White House nominee.

Whether by design or happenstance, the justices are hearing fewer high-profile cases than they did in recent terms that included far-reaching decisions by the 6-3 conservative majority on presidential immunity, abortion, guns, and affirmative action.

The lighter schedule would allow them to easily add election cases, if those make their way to the high court in the run-up to the Nov. 5 election between Republican Donald Trump and Harris, or its immediate aftermath.

""I think there are legal issues that arise out of the political process. And so, the Supreme Court has to be prepared to respond if that should be necessary,"" Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson told CBS News last month in an interview to her promote new memoir, ""Lovely One.""

The court's involvement in election disputes might depend on the closeness of the outcome and whether the justices' intervention would tip the outcome, David Cole, the outgoing legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said at a recent Washington event.

""I don't think the court wants to get involved, but it may have to,"" Cole said.

The court turned away multiple challenges from Trump and his allies to the results of the 2020 election that he lost to Biden. It's been nearly a quarter-century since the Supreme Court effectively decided the 2000 presidential election, in which Republican George W. Bush edged Democrat Al Gore.

When the justices gather Monday morning on a date set by federal law, they will shake hands with each other as they always do. Just after 10 o'clock, they will emerge from behind freshly cleaned heavy red drapery and take their seats on the curved mahogany bench, Chief Justice John Roberts in the center chair and his eight colleagues seated in order of seniority.

There are likely to be smiles and shared private jokes. But the friendliness of that moment will not sweep away tensions that have barely been concealed.

During the summer, two justices, Elena Kagan and Jackson, voiced support for toughening the new ethics code that so far lacks a means of enforcement.

The leak to The New York Times of the contents of a memo Roberts wrote last winter that outlined his approach to the court's presidential immunity decision ""was nothing short of shocking,"" Supreme Court lawyer Lisa Blatt said last week at a Washington preview of the coming term.

Two years ago, Politico obtained the draft decision overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion case.

""Something does feel broken,"" Blatt said. Describing her experience arguing before the court, she said, some justices ""just seem visibly frustrated.""

Important cases dot the court's calendar, beginning Tuesday. The court will take up a challenge to a Biden administration attempt to regulate hard-to-trace ""ghost guns"" that had been turning up at crime scenes in increasing numbers. The Supreme Court jumped into the case after the conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated the regulation.

Last term, conservatives voted 6-3 to strike down a gun regulation that had banned bump stocks, an accessory that allows some weapons to fire at a rate comparable to machine guns. Bump stocks were used in the nation's deadliest modern mass shooting in Las Vegas.

A day after the guns case, the justices will take up the latest twist in Oklahoma death row inmate Richard Glossip's long quest for freedom. His case is the rare instance in which prosecutors are conceding mistakes in the trial that led to Glossip's conviction and death sentence.

The highest-profile case on the agenda so far is a fight over transgender rights that is focused on state bans on gender-affirming care. It probably will be argued in December.

Republican-led states have enacted a variety of restrictions on health care for transgender people, school sports participation, bathroom usage and drag shows. The administration and Democratic-led states have extended protections for transgender people. The Supreme Court has separately prohibited the administration from enforcing a new federal regulation that seeks to protect transgender students.

The case before the high court involves a law in Tennessee that restrict puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender minors. About half the states have enacted similar restrictions.

Also on tap for the late fall is an appeal from the adult entertainment industry to overturn a Texas law that requires pornographic websites to verify the age of their users.

Only about half the court's calendar for the term has been filled, and several big cases could be added. Among those is a push by Republican-led states and conservative legal outlets to further restrict federal agencies.

The immediate target is the method the Federal Communications Commission has used to fund telephone service for rural and low-income people and broadband services for schools and libraries.

The case, which the administration has appealed to the Supreme Court, could give the justices the opportunity to revive a legal doctrine known as nondelegation that has not been used to strike down legislation in nearly 90 years. Several conservative justices have expressed support for the idea of limiting the authority Congress can delegate to federal agencies."
"Supreme Court candidates dodge, and leverage, political rhetoric",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/us-news/montana-courts-u-s-republican-party-general-news-bd83d87893ce66f70a20b9f23453572b,2024-10-04T21:25:08Z,"Judicial forums are not typically known for their entertainment. But during an hour of questions and answers at a late September forum in Great Falls, hosted by the Montana Farmers Union, the four nonpartisan candidates for the open seats on the Montana Supreme Court successfully conveyed that their races are far from boring.

Two sitting state district court judges, Katherine Bidegaray of Sidney and Dan Wilson of Kalispell, are vying for the associate justice position currently held by Justice Dirk Sandefur. In the other race, Broadwater County Attorney Cory Swanson and former federal magistrate Jeremiah ""Jerry"" Lynch, a Missoula resident raised in Butte, are facing off to replace retiring Chief Justice Mike McGrath.

None of the candidates are allowed to run as Republicans or Democrats. But that hasn't stopped political parties and special interest groups from saturating the campaign with mailers and online advertisements, as has become a tradition in Montana judicial races.

Speaking before the audience gathered in a conference room at the Great Falls International Airport, all the candidates acknowledged the charged political environment surrounding their races but stressed their commitment to judicial independence.

""We can't control who supports us, really, or what they do,"" Bidegaray said. ""We only have the ability to control ourselves.""

But while Bidegaray and her opponent, Wilson, have often tried to dispel the heated political rhetoric surrounding the judicial races, Swanson and Lynch have used it to power attacks against one another and defend their own reputations.

""This race became partisan because the Democratic Party made it partisan,"" said Swanson, referencing a national Democratic political action group that pledged to spend millions in states with competitive Supreme Court races. ""Well, they're not spending the money for me.""

During the Great Falls event and other judicial forums, Bidegaray and Wilson have tried to appeal to voters by highlighting their respective legal experience and commitments to fair and impartial rulings.

Both candidates for associate justice have spent decades as lawyers practicing in diverse settings and, most recently, as district court judges adjudicating cases ranging from child welfare to criminal violations to constitutional conflicts.

Bidgaray has been elected to her district court seat, which adjudicates issues from Dawson, Prairie, McCone, Richland and Wibaux counties, four times. Previously, she spent a decade in private practice. Wilson has been a district court judge in Flathead County since 2017 and spent the six years prior as a justice of the peace. Wilson worked as a lawyer beginning in the 1990s, first as a prosecutor and later in private practice, where his cases included criminal defense.

Each candidate has occasionally made statewide headlines for high-profile cases. Wilson gained name recognition during the first year of the COVID pandemic after he ruled against the administration of former Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock when it tried to bring a restraining order against certain businesses over masking requirements.

More recently, Bidegaray ruled that the state Department of Environmental Quality erred in issuing a permit for a company's construction of the Black Butte Mine, a copper operation that could impact a tributary that feeds into the Smith River. The Montana Supreme Court later overturned that ruling.

Recent waves of political advertisements and mailers have tried to distill each judge into a liberal or conservative frame, in part drawing on those notable rulings. The American Civil Liberties Union and Wild Montana Voter Fund have lined up behind Bidegaray, portraying her as a candidate who will uphold Montana's longstanding protections for abortion access and public lands. Alternatively, the Montana Republican State Central Committee and many elected Republicans are backing Wilson, praising him as a restrained judicial conservative with a tough-on-crime record.

In Great Falls, Bidegaray said the groups endorsing her might be reacting to her repeated pledges to defend the individual rights outlined in the Montana Constitution. Those rights, as Bidegaray has mentioned, include the right to privacy, the well-known legal foundation for Montana's access to abortion.

""I have consistently and repeatedly said that I am willing to do my part to uphold the Montana Constitution,"" Bidegaray said. ""I have taken hard cases during my tenure as a district court judge ... and have held firm to protecting people's rights.""

Wilson, meanwhile, told the audience that he does not see the state Constitution as a liberal or conservative document but rather as a clear set of instructions for judges to follow that he has no desire to manipulate.

Both candidates insisted that the political narratives about their campaigns should not undermine their credibility as nonpartisan judicial figures. In response to a question about the support he's received from the Montana Republican State Central Committee, Wilson said, ""The voters can make of it what they will.""

""The message that I have been delivering from the time I started my campaign until the present time hasn't wavered. I am for the rule of law, for judges to follow it humbly and obediently, and don't legislate from the bench,"" Wilson said. ""To the extent I am supported by any group or party, I'm grateful for the support, but it's not going to change how I approach the campaign or is not going to cause me, one bit, to change my judicial philosophy or approach.""

The contest for chief justice between Lynch and Swanson has some parallels to the race for associate justice. Progressive interest groups are backing Lynch. The Republican Party is supporting Swanson.

Other key players include Montanans for Fair Judiciary, a group affiliated with prominent conservative strategist Jake Eaton, which is backing Swanson and Wilson. Another political committee, Montanans For Fair and Impartial Courts, linked to the Montana Trial Lawyers Association, is supporting Bidegaray and Lynch.

But compared to the mostly stoic rhetoric in the race for the associate justice position, the dynamic between Lynch and Swanson is boiling.

Part of the dynamic comes from the candidates' differing professional experiences. Lynch touts his roughly 40 years as a federal court clerk, trial attorney and federal magistrate as evidence of his passion for the law and interest in defending the judiciary. Swanson, alternatively, has a shorter and more diverse background. He started in private practice in 2006 and spent three years as a registered lobbyist for a variety of private interest groups. He spent two years as a deputy attorney general under former Republican Attorney General Tim Fox and was elected Broadwater County attorney in 2014.

Perhaps because of his long track record in federal courts, Lynch doesn't shy away from the third-party depictions of him as a staunch defender of constitutional liberties. As chief justice, he has passionately said he would protect individuals from groups -- including the government -- that seek to infringe upon their rights. Among the many spelled out in the Montana Constitution, Lynch often points to rights that are linked to ongoing policy disputes: the right to public education, the right to vote, the right to a clean and healthful environment and the right to privacy.

Lynch has also promised to fight to preserve the judiciary's autonomy, criticizing the Republican-led Legislature's efforts to change laws about the judiciary and launch pronounced investigations into the Montana Supreme Court.

""They are a fair court. They decide issues according to the law. And the attack on that court right now is a political attack. It's that simple,"" Lynch said during the Great Falls forum. ""As your chief justice ... I will stand toe-to-toe to make sure the independence of the judiciary stands.""

As he pushes his vision of a doggedly independent and defensive judiciary, Lynch has attacked Swanson with allegations that the current county attorney is too closely tied to conservative interest groups and the Republican Party. Lynch points to a 2008 case in which Swanson represented Eaton, then the director of the state GOP, after the party challenged roughly 6,000 voter registrations in several Democratic-leaning counties weeks before the November election. Lynch also publicly highlights that Swanson's judicial campaign is managed by lobbyist and former GOP official Chuck Denowh.

""I think it's fair to say he's a political partisan and a hyper-partisan,"" Lynch said about Swanson during an August podcast with Whitefish business owner Ed Docter.

At other points in the interview, Lynch justified his strong critique of his opponent by pointing to the attacks Swanson's supporters have made against him. ""I entered this race thinking I would be at a high level -- and I do want to be that because I respect the judiciary so much,"" Lynch said. ""However, I'm also from Butte. When someone punches me in the mouth, I'm going to punch back.""

Butte heritage aside, Swanson has appeared to abide by the same rule of thumb. As the two candidates appear together at forums around Montana, Swanson has accused Lynch of complimenting Democrats and aligning with progressive causes.

""My opponent recently went on a podcast and endorsed Jon Tester and Tim Walz. And I don't think we should be doing that,"" Swanson said at the Great Falls forum, referring to Lynch's podcast appearance with Docter. ""So my goal is to keep this nonpartisan. And if I get elected, I will operate as a nonpartisan justice. Period.""

Lynch wagged his finger and shook his head in disagreement. In the podcast, Lynch did not explicitly endorse either Montana's Democratic U.S. senator or the Democratic Minnesota governor currently running to be vice president alongside Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. However, the former magistrate called Tester ""a magnificent human being"" and said that he appreciated Walz's down-to-earth demeanor, opining that those types of individuals ""are the people that should be in the United States Senate."" Tester is running for reelection against Republican challenger Tim Sheehy.

The state code of judicial conduct prohibits Montana judges and judicial candidates from publicly endorsing or opposing any partisan or independent candidate for public office. Swanson has not specifically mentioned that prohibition in recent public appearances, instead opting to generally criticize Lynch's disposition and tout his own ability to navigate political tensions -- including the ongoing feud between the judiciary and Republican leadership in the Legislature.

""There is a political controversy in this state that has to be navigated with wisdom, with dexterity and with humility and with some diplomacy, and then occasionally with some firmness. That's called judicial temperament,"" Swanson said. ""A certain level of that leadership and temperament must be on display at all times.""

At a Bozeman forum hosted by the Gallatin County Bar Association in late September, the day after the Great Falls event, Lynch again sought to leverage Swanson's involvement with the GOP voter registration challenge from 2008. He accused Swanson of participating in voter suppression, an effort that Lynch suggested should be disqualifying for someone running for the Supreme Court.

Swanson reflected on the case but quickly pivoted, questioning the ethical implications of walking away from a client who did something wrong.

""I represented an entity that did something stupid. And the rules of ethics, as an attorney, tell you that when your client does something stupid, you don't just run away from them and abandon them. You say, 'Okay, I'm going to represent you despite the fact that you did something stupid and help you work your way through that.' And that's what I did,"" Swanson said.

Later, Swanson returned to the topic, criticizing Lynch for using the incident to malign his reputation. Speaking to a roomful of lawyers and pre-law students, he asked whether that type of judgment is what attorneys want from a justice when they're representing a challenging client. ""Think about that,"" Swanson said.

The county attorney has used other public comments to cast Lynch as unprofessional. Swanson has taken issue with Lynch's repeated pledges to defend the Montana Supreme Court's 25-year-old precedent in Armstrong v. State, the unanimous decision that found that the state Constitution protected abortion access through the right to privacy. Lynch has said that respecting precedent is not the same as pre-judging cases that may come before the court, but rather a display of respect for the weight of past rulings.

Swanson doesn't buy it.

""Those are dog whistles. They are intentionally crafted statements to tell liberal groups how you're going to vote,"" he told Montana Free Press shortly before the Bozeman forum. ""You can't do that.""

In Great Falls, Swanson and the other candidates were explicitly asked about abortion rights and the initiative to explicitly include those protections in the Montana Constitution, CI-128. Swanson again spoke against judges and candidates forecasting their stances on future issues. He likened his approach to the tradition among some top-ranking military officials not to vote in presidential races.

""I don't go to quite that extreme, but I intend to abstain from voting on all of these policy issues because I don't want to, even internally in my own soul, have a policy preference that then I might have to deal with as a judge,"" Swanson said. If the initiative passes and is the basis of future litigation, Swanson continued, the justices should ""take our own personal view and ideology out of it and decide that case with a methodology that is fair and impartial.""

At this point, third-party groups -- including the Montana Republican State Central Committee and the American Civil Liberties Union -- have collectively invested millions in the races for the two Supreme Court seats, mostly on direct mailers and online advertisements.

The Montana Values Action Fund, helmed by liberal powerbroker Mary Stranahan, has donated hundreds of thousands to Montanans for Fair and Impartial Courts, Montanans for Liberty and Justice and Montana Senior Vote Action Fund -- all groups advocating for Lynch and Bidegaray.

In August, the national group Fair Courts America made a $200,000 donation to Montana Judicial Accountability Initiative, another political action committee tied to Eaton, its largest received donation this cycle. Fair Courts America, a federal PAC, is primarily funded by Richard Uihlein, the shipping magnate and billionaire supporter of conservative political causes. Since that donation, Montana Judicial Accountability Initiative has transferred $35,000 to Eaton's other group, Montanans for Fair Judiciary, one of the entities backing Swanson and Wilson.

Other interest group spending is more difficult to track. The national money Swanson referenced, from the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and Planned Parenthood Votes, has not made a clear mark on Montana's elections, but could very well be circulating after transfers between other political committees.

The candidates themselves continue to eschew direct affiliation with those political undercurrents and speak to voters about their individual judicial philosophies in forums around the state.

One of the next events with all four contenders is scheduled for 6 p.m., Oct. 9 in Billings, hosted by the Montana Farm Bureau at the Billings Hotel and Convention Center.

Absentee ballots are scheduled to go out on Oct. 11. The election is Tuesday, Nov. 5.

Departures in House create crucial Republican targets in the fight for majority control,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/house-elections-michigan-virginia-california-41af911c357f2c719adbd2008bfa5cdf,2024-10-04T04:16:19Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a tumultuous and unproductive session of Congress, nearly 50 House members decided either to not seek reelection or to run for a higher office this year, leaving Democratic vacancies in several tight races that could tilt control of the House to either party.

Both Republicans and Democrats have had their fair share of turnover -- with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, the most prominent -- but Democrats are also losing prodigious fundraisers who have successfully held off GOP challengers in recent years. With fierce competition raging over just a couple dozen seats, that's left Democrats relying on fresh faces to hold their ground, while Republicans sense openings in four races in Virginia, Michigan and California.

The GOP is sending resources and trying to neutralize the issue of abortion access in those districts, hoping to go on offense to hold onto a slim majority. The party is running with candidates who have previously come up short in bids to unseat Democrats, but are now optimistic they can build on campaign experience and fare better when they don't face an incumbent.

Democrats, riding on a windfall of campaign donations and voters motivated by reproductive rights, are tapping candidates with track records in office. Most of them are state lawmakers who already have legislative accomplishments, relationships with voters and experience campaigning.

Regardless, it will be a tough task to make up the fundraising hauls and political skills of the prominent Democrats in the three states.

Democratic Reps. Katie Porter of California, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, and Elissa Slotkin and Dan Kildee, both of Michigan, raked in a combined fundraising total of over $50 million in the last election cycle. Slotkin, Spanberger and Porter all entered Congress in 2018 as part of a wave of female lawmakers who flipped seats and delivered House control to Democrats.

They all have set their sights on higher offices: Slotkin is running for Michigan's Senate seat, Spanberger is running for Virginia governor next year, while Porter fell short in a bid for Senate earlier this year.

Meanwhile, Kildee decided not to run for a sixth term after a bout with cancer last year.

Here's how the races to replace them are playing out:

Central Michigan has been represented by either Kildee or his uncle, former Rep. Dale Kildee, for almost five decades. And Kildee said it's important to him that he hands his seat off to a Democrat.

""It's a lot easier to leave knowing we have a chance to hold the seat,"" he said.

But Paul Junge, a Republican who lost to Kildee in 2022, said Kildee's retirement also made his decision to run again much easier.

""Incumbency is powerful for a reason. People know the name. They feel like they know that representative,"" said Junge, who is a former prosecutor and TV anchor. ""This time I don't face that. And in fact, for me, as a second-time candidate in this district, I was reaching out to people who already knew me.""

Junge also chalks up 2022 as a difficult year for Republicans in Michigan because voters were coming out to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution as well as reelect a popular Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer. He has self-financed his campaign, pushing him towards a cash advantage this year.

So Junge has crisscrossed the district in his Ford F-150, working to win over the union members and blue-collar workers who once made Michigan a blue wall of support for Democrats, but who have slipped towards Republicans in recent years.

Still, Democrats are pointing out that Junge has spent most of his life outside the Michigan district, calling him a ""carpetbagger."" Democrat Kristen McDonald Rivet, a state senator, is talking up her working-class roots and experience raising six children in the community.

Rivet described herself as a ""moderate"" and pointed to her time in the legislature championing tax credits for families with children.

""I believe that when we're looking at policy, we have to prioritize middle-class families, working-class families,"" she said.

Rivet is also pushing Junge on abortion, pointing in TV ads to his opposition to abortion rights. Junge has responded that he would not support a federal abortion ban.

In another central Michigan race, Democrats are also tapping a state lawmaker to try to hold what is now Slotkin's seat.

""In terms of abortion, I think it will always be an incredibly important issue because it's a matter of personal freedom. That's not going to change,"" said Curtis Hertel Jr., who served four terms as a state senator before working in Whitmer's administration.

He's facing a former statehouse colleague. Tom Barrett, who previously served in the state senate, is running for the seat again after losing to Slotkin by 5 points in 2022. Barrett was heavily outspent that year, but so far has been able to keep a closer pace to Hertel's fundraising this year.

Barrett argued that a host of problems -- illegal immigration, a cost of living crisis, crime in Lansing, the district's largest city, as well as global threats -- have only grown in the last two years.

""I feel like there's unfinished business there,"" he said.

Barrett hasn't backed away from his record of supporting abortion restrictions in the statehouse, saying he is ""pro-life,"" but he also described abortion access as a settled issue in Michigan.

The closely watched House races to replace Spanberger is playing out in northern Virginia between two Army veterans and lawyers: Democrat Eugene Vindman and Republican Derrick Anderson.

Vindman, promising to work to restore abortion rights that were in place under Roe v. Wade, has proven to be a prodigious fundraiser and is on track to surpass Spanberger's 2022 totals, giving him the advantage of early advertising. He and his twin brother, Alexander Vindman, played major roles in former President Donald Trump's first impeachment.

Anderson, whose campaign did not grant an interview, is emphasizing his background in the Army special forces and trying to present a gentler profile on abortion rights and economic issues. However, Anderson, who is engaged to be married, raised eyebrows for posing with a friend's wife and three daughters in a campaign photo shoot that could be mistaken for a family photo.

On the West Coast, Republicans are trying to go on the offensive against Dave Min, the Democratic state senator whom Porter recruited to fill her seat. The GOP's super PAC, the Congressional Leadership Fund, launched an ad this week criticizing his support for criminal justice changes in California's State Assembly.

Republican Scott Baugh, a former chair of the Orange County GOP, ticked off a list of local violent crimes, saying Democrats were to blame for an ""overall concern that we are less safe than we were four years ago.""

He was heavily outspent by Porter in 2022, but said this year the ""spending won't be quite as lopsided.""

Min pointed out that he has the endorsement of the Los Angeles police union and has a history in the State Assembly of advocating for immigrants, who make up a large portion of the district.

He also has a fundraising advantage, but said he is still campaigning with the mentality that the election ""could be decided by a few hundred votes and potentially could decide control of Congress."""
Abortion-rights groups are outraising opponents 8-to-1 on November ballot measures,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ballot-measures-fundraising-florida-arizona-39f0cac3078fffcf94196710c50865ec,2024-10-04T04:12:03Z,"Abortion-rights ballot measure supporters across the country have raised nearly eight times as much as groups campaigning against the amendments on the November ballots. But that advantage may not translate into a huge benefit down the stretch in Florida, the most expensive of the nine statewide campaigns to enshrine abortion rights into state constitutions.

So far, campaign finance data compiled by the watchdog group Open Secrets and analyzed by The Associated Press tells a similar story in most of those states: Amendment backers have raised multiple times as much money and have far more donors, bringing in nearly $108 million compared to $14 million for their opponents as of reports aggregated by Tuesday. Still, it's not a sure thing that will mean more spending to promote the measures in every state in the final weeks before the Nov. 5 elections.

""The apparent differential on campaign finance reports does nothing to reassure me that we will not see large, late spending on these campaigns,"" said Kelly Hall, executive director of The Fairness Project, which is providing money and other support for abortion rights groups in several of the campaigns.

The measures would roll back restrictions in some states and enshrine protections into the constitutions in others after the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling overturning Roe v. Wade. Most GOP-controlled states implemented bans or restrictions after the ruling. Most Democratic-controlled ones offered some protections for abortion access.

The ballot measures could also drive voter turnout in the elections.

Campaigns that raise more money have an edge reaching voters with ads on TV, radio and websites, along with mailers and yard signs and more organizing power for door-knocking and other efforts.

That's evident so far in Missouri and Montana, where big funding advantages have translated into far more ad buys, according to data collected by the media tracking firm AdImpact.

In Missouri, the Open Secrets data shows abortion rights groups have raised more than $5 million, and state filings reflect millions more in contributions, including $1 million from former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The giving has fueled over $11 million in ad spending supporting a measure that would overturn the state's ban compared with less than $50,000 opposing it.

In Montana, pro-amendment groups lead in ad spending, with more than $11 million compared to under $50,000 for opponents.

There hasn't been as much ad activity so far in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Nevada or South Dakota. In Nebraska, abortion opponents have raised slightly less money but have spent slightly more on ad buys. Contribution totals don't have to be reported in Nevada or South Dakota until later this month.

Supporters of the ballot measures also have some costs that opponents don't.

Getting most of the abortion questions on the ballots required signature drives, which are a major cost for their sponsors. And with most of the questions, there were legal battles over whether ballot requirements were met. Paying lawyers in those battles often falls to the groups behind the campaigns, reducing how much of the money they raise is available for reaching voters.

The costs of legal challenges often do not eat into their opponents' fundraising the same way.

The Thomas More Society, for instance, challenged initiatives in Missouri and Nebraska. The group is not required to file campaign finance reports.

And in Florida, the state attorney general challenged that state's measure, shifting legal expenses to taxpayers.

Florida's race has some other unique wrinkles.

For one, adopting the measure requires approval from 60% of voters, compared to lesser thresholds needed in other states.

If approved, Florida's amendment would make abortions legal until the fetus is viable, or when necessary to protect the patient's health, as determined by a health care provider. Florida currently bans most abortions after six weeks, with some exceptions.

Abortion rights groups have reported raising more than $60 million and opponents $9 million. But that does not reflect all of the spending.

The state Republican Party has aired commercials urging voters to defeat the amendment. AdImpact data shows the GOP has spent $9.6 million running TV and online ads. That's about half the $20.7 million bought by groups backing the amendment. But using an industry calculation for how many people see TV ads, it puts the ballot measure's opponents ahead.

Even that spending doesn't include another boost for the argument that the amendment goes too far. A state government website states, ""Amendment 4 threatens women's safety."" Advocates sued last month to stop the taxpayer-funded messaging. A judge ruled Monday that the website could remain up.

Peter Northcutt, director for state strategies at National Right to Life, portrays the anti-abortion movement as an underdog up against funding from those with a financial interest in abortion.

""The abortion industry and their allies bring massive funds to the table,"" he said. ""Those who are trying to fight off these extreme amendments have an uphill climb.""

Planned Parenthood Federation of America and some of its regional affiliates are among those who have kicked in more than $1 million to support the amendments. But the biggest donor so far is Marsha Zlatin Laufer, a frequent contributor to liberal causes. She's given more than $9 million in Florida.

Other abortion-rights groups that have given more than $1 million in multiple states include the Sixteen Thirty Fund, The Fairness Project and Advocacy Action Fund, which aren't required to disclose their donors, as well as the George Soros-connected Open Society Action Fund.

Nationally, the abortion rights side also has far more donors: More than 94,000 to fewer than 2,600.

On the opposing side, the big individual contributors are U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, a Nebraska Republican, and his mother, Marlene Ricketts. Each of them has given at least $1 million in Nebraska. Nebraska is the one state where campaign finance filings show the two sides have raised similar amounts of money, with both between $3 million and $4 million.

There's a reason for that: Nebraska has competing ballot measures. One would expand access to abortion and the other would enshrine the current ban on most abortions after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.

The fundraising gap is partly explained by the fact that two big national organizations that together spent about $40 million trying to defeat a similar campaign last year in Ohio have not gotten heavily involved in campaign funding this year.

One is The Concord Fund, which spent more than $25 million in Ohio last year - more than 40% of the total in opposition to the amendment. Like abortion-related ballot measures in six other states since 2022, the abortion-rights side prevailed.

The group, formerly known as the Judicial Crisis Network, is part of a network of political groups centered around Leonard Leo, a prominent conservative legal activist and driving force in securing nominations of conservative Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade.

The other is Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which contributed nearly $15 million in Ohio last year. The group said it planned to raise $92 million for political campaigns this year, but the focus was not on abortion-related measures. Instead, it said it would prioritize helping Republicans win the presidency and Congress.

"Melania Trump says she supports abortion rights, putting her at odds with the GOP",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/melania-trump-harris-abortion-election-2024-vance-walz-a9a44cf9d3113eb55e8c4346c7e1fe59,2024-10-03T18:10:42Z,"CHICAGO (AP) -- Melania Trump revealed her support for abortion rights Thursday ahead of the release of her upcoming memoir, exposing a stark contrast with her husband, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, on the crucial election issue.

In a video posted to her X account Thursday morning, the former first lady defended women's ""individual freedoms"" to do what they want with their body -- a position at odds with much of the Republican Party and her own husband, who has struggled to find a consistent message on abortion while wedged between anti-abortion supporters within his base and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights.

""Individual freedom is a fundamental principle that I safeguard,"" she said in the video. ""Without a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth: individual freedom. What does 'my body, my choice' really mean?""

The video appears to confirm excerpts of her self-titled memoir reported by The Guardian on Wednesday.

Melania Trump has rarely publicly expressed her personal political views and has been largely absent from the campaign trail. But in her memoir, set to be released publicly next Tuesday, she argues that the decision to end a pregnancy should be left to a woman and her doctor, ""free from any intervention of pressure from the government,"" according to the published excerpts.

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?"" she wrote, according to The Guardian. ""A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.""

Melania Trump writes that she has ""carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

These views contrast sharply with the GOP's anti-abortion platform and with Donald Trump, who has repeatedly taken credit for appointing the three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade and boasted about returning the abortion question to the states. Democrats have blamed the former president for the severe deterioration of reproductive rights as abortion bans were implemented in large swaths of the country following the overturning of the landmark case, which had granted a constitutional right to abortion.

Vice President Kamala Harris ' campaign noted Trump's role in ending Roe v. Wade in a statement reacting to Melania Trump's defense of abortion rights.

""Sadly for the women across America, Mrs. Trump's husband firmly disagrees with her and is the reason that more than one in three American women live under a Trump Abortion Ban that threatens their health, their freedom, and their lives,"" Harris campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement. ""Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear: If he wins in November, he will ban abortion nationwide, punish women, and restrict women's access to reproductive health care.""

Donald Trump on Tuesday said he would veto a federal abortion ban, the first time he has explicitly said so after previously refusing to answer questions on the subject. Abortion rights advocates are skeptical, however, saying Trump cannot be trusted not to restrict reproductive rights.

Trump's campaign did not respond to a request for comment Thursday about Melania Trump's book or video.

Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said the memoir is another example of ""the Trumps playing voters like a fiddle.""

""As president, (Trump) made it his mission to get Roe v. Wade overturned,"" she said in a statement. ""Melania stood by him, never once publicly disavowing his actions until weeks before an election where our bodies are again on the ballot and they are losing voters to this issue. Read between the lines.""

Democratic strategist Brittany Crampsie called the memoir's release a ""clear attempt to appeal to more moderate voters and to moderate JD Vance's very clearly extreme views on the issue."" But she is skeptical that the move would work in favor of Trump, saying his shifting views ""have already confused voters and sowed distrust.""

Melania Trump also defends abortions later in pregnancy, asserting that ""most abortions conducted during the later stages of pregnancy were the result of severe fetal abnormalities that probably would have led to the death or stillbirth of the child. Perhaps even the death of the mother.""

""These cases were extremely rare and typically occurred after several consultations between the woman and her doctor,"" she writes.

These views appear diametrically opposed to her husband, who has often parroted misinformation about abortions later in pregnancy, falsely claiming that Democrats support abortion ""after birth,"" though infanticide is outlawed in every state.

Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law who focuses on reproductive rights law and history, said it is unclear if the memoir's release so close to the election was an attempt to help Donald Trump. But she did note that Melania Trump's split from Trump on the issue is not uncommon historically.

There is ""a pretty deep history of first ladies being more supportive of abortion rights than their husbands,"" including Betty Ford, a vocal abortion rights supporter and the wife of former President Gerald Ford, Ziegler said.

Donald Trump promoted his wife's book at a September rally in New York, calling on supporters to ""go out and get her book."" It is unclear if the former president has read the book.

""Go out and buy it,"" he told the crowd. ""It's great. And if she says bad things about me, I'll call you all up, and I'll say, 'Don't buy it.'""

Influential prophesizing pastors believe reelecting Trump is a win in the war of angels and demons,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/conservative-christians-spiritual-warfare-donald-trump-kamala-harris-9c861aa7c58907ff67bde3c3499a9365,2024-10-03T12:13:32Z,"COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) -- Thousands sang, cheered and prayed as multiple preachers declared Donald Trump to be God's favored candidate to defeat what one called the ""forces of darkness.""

Headliners denounced Democrat Kamala Harris -- Trump's campaign rival -- as influenced by demons and the spirit of the wicked biblical queen Jezebel.

Attendees stood and recited in unison a ""Watchman Decree,"" invoking a government that honors God and has ""righteous"" laws and ""biblical"" judicial rulings. They pledged to ""take back and permanently control"" positions of leadership in sectors such as government, business and culture.

""We break every curse against Donald Trump -- we break every satanic incantation against his presidency,"" declared the host preacher, Hank Kunneman, at the annual Opening the Heavens conference, held in mid-September at the Mid-America Center arena in Council Bluffs.

The conference is one of several of its type around the country this election year, featuring exuberant worship and speeches by influential preachers. It represents a highly politicized wing of charismatic Christianity, a larger movement that emphasizes spiritual gifts such as healings, prophecy and speaking in tongues.

As a sign of this movement's influence, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance appeared recently at a similar conference, called the Courage Tour, in Pennsylvania.

Goals for the conference included getting out the vote for Trump and his allies, and mobilizing believers to pray and take part in what's proclaimed to be a literal spiritual war surrounding the election.

""Get your butt out there and vote. Get your voice and raise it!"" declared Kunneman, who pastors Lord of Hosts Church in nearby Omaha, Nebraska, with his wife, Brenda. ""Let every devil fall. ... We push back any attempt to steal the executive office.""

The conference emerges from a movement that emphasizes authoritative direction from leaders considered to be modern-day apostles and prophets. It also incorporated Christian nationalism, a fusion of American and Christian identity.

Critics view the movement with alarm, seeing it as anti-democratic and supporting a candidate with authoritarian ambitions and incendiary rhetoric. Many of its leaders rallied behind Trump's claims that the 2020 election was stolen despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

""The attitude coming into 2024 is, 'The demons are probably going to try to steal this election again, and so we need to do spiritual warfare in advance to prevent that,'"" said Matthew Taylor, author of the new book on the movement, ""The Violent Take It By Force: The Christian Movement That Is Threatening Our Democracy.""

""It's very hard to have a pluralistic democracy,"" Taylor said, when many distrust the electoral system.

Several leaders in this movement were present at rallies in Washington protesting Biden's presidential victory before and on Jan. 6, 2021, said Taylor.

Leaders weren't among the Capitol rioters, but some issued decrees and prayers that the certification of Biden's win be blocked and Trump returned for a second term.

Such ideology ""is one of those golden threads"" in the social media feeds of many participants of the Jan. 6 rallies, said Taylor, Protestant scholar at the Baltimore-based Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies.

Headliners at the Council Bluffs conference repeatedly spoke of being in a true spiritual war, merging decrees of political victory and Christian revival.

The ""favor of the Lord"" is on Trump, said one preacher, Dutch Sheets. ""America is going to be saved, and I believe this election is a part of it.""

His brother and fellow preacher, Tim Sheets, recounted seeing a vision of a warrior angel firing an arrow that landed in front of the White House, claiming the territory for God.

""We must move into battle for the Lord,"" he said. ""The drums of spiritual war are beating.""

Preachers repeatedly denounced abortion -- one described it as an outpouring of blood craved by demons -- and the ""mutilation"" of children, as they depicted gender-affirming treatment for transgender youths.

The arena appeared a little more than half full, with thousands of attendees from multiple states. Many wore T-shirts with slogans like, ""Defender of Territory"" and ""We the People Trust Jesus,"" while several bundled up with American flag-themed fleece blankets amid chilly air conditioning.

Participants at the Council Bluffs conference, mostly but not exclusively white, aligned with the larger evangelical Christian support of Trump.

About 8 in 10 white evangelicals supported Trump in 2020, according to AP VoteCast. Pew Research Center's validated voter survey found similar support levels in 2016.

This year, about 7 in 10 white evangelical Protestants view the Republican nominee favorably, an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey found.

Behind that supermajority is a diverse evangelicalism. The charismatic exuberance and focus on the supernatural contrast in tone with the relatively restrained approach of groups such as Southern Baptists, though they have allied in their political conservatism and opposition to abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.

And the charismatic movement has its own diversity. This heavily politicized branch teaches that in the present day, God has re-established the ancient biblical roles of apostle -- an authoritative leader -- and prophet, someone issuing divine proclamations.

The movement isn't a denomination. Churches and ministries largely operate independently, even as its leaders speak at each others' conferences, endorse each others' books and appear on each others' broadcasts.

As one example of the overlap: The Opening the Heavens conference in Council Bluffs featured one segment called FlashPoint Live -- an in-person version of a television show that mixes charismatic Christianity and conservative politics. It's one of several such FlashPoint Live conferences this year, hosted by pastor Gene Bailey -- whose recent interview with Trump demonstrated the close ties between the movement and the former president.

The ReAwaken America tour, started by Trump's former national security advisor Michael Flynn, has similarly blended the political with revival-like rallies and featured members of Trump's family.

While a range of evangelicals served as Trump's faith-based advisors during his administration, charismatic leaders were especially prominent.

The apostles-and-prophets movement overlaps with two related, popular ideas: dominionism, which says Christians are to be in charge of society, and the ""Seven Mountain Mandate,"" which specifies seven areas where Christians are to lead -- politics, religion, media, business, family, education and the arts and entertainment.

Bailey led in the reciting of the Watchman Decree at Council Bluffs, which included a pledge to ""permanently control positions of influence and leadership in each of the seven mountains.""

Bailey and Kunneman declined interview requests through a media representative.

Taylor said that according to this strand of charismatic theology, Holy Spirit-filled Christians have the power not just to ask God for results but to speak them into being.

""It's not just spouting off or praying prayers,"" he said. ""They believe that they are changing reality with these Watchman Decrees.""

He added: ""It looks wild when you encounter it, but it is very popular, and it's very dangerous.""

Separate from the Council Bluffs conference organizers, but with an overlapping cast of speakers, is the Courage Tour. It's led by Lance Wallnau, who popularized the Seven Mountain concept and was an early booster of Trump's 2016 candidacy.

The tour has been held in crucial battleground states, mixing worship, prayers for miraculous healings and overt politics -- including a call for Christians to become election workers or poll watchers to ""fight the fraud"" in swing states.

Taylor said this appears to lay groundwork for a campaign to delegitimize the 2024 election results if Harris wins.

While movement leaders speak of spiritual warfare -- that is, angel vs. demon rather than human vs. human -- Taylor said such rhetoric can stoke some people into taking matters into their own hands.

He said it's no surprise that some rioters at the Capitol in 2021 were loudly praying and displaying Christian symbols.

""I really do worry that we could see a lot more political violence,"" he said.

Anti-abortion leaders undeterred as Trump for the first time says he'd veto a federal abortion ban,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-vance-walz-debate-2024-election-abortion-64c739e99ffa1ad51b973e420e1fe92d,2024-10-02T20:55:36Z,"CHICAGO (AP) -- Anti-abortion leaders said Wednesday that they're undeterred after Donald Trump said he would veto a federal abortion ban, the first time he has explicitly said so after previously refusing to answer questions on the subject.

During Tuesday night's vice presidential debate, the Republican presidential nominee posted on his social media platform Truth Social that ""everyone knows I would not support a federal abortion ban, under any circumstances, and would, in fact, veto it.""

He then said that abortion rights should be left up to the states -- his most common response to questions about the issue since Roe v. Wade was overturned by a conservative majority that included three of Trump's own appointees to the Supreme Court. In the two years since the ruling, abortion rights have emerged as a major vulnerability for the GOP, which has struggled to find a consistent message on the path forward, while driving turnout for Democrats.

With the election less than five weeks away, Trump has been trying to thread a divide between his own base of anti-abortion supporters and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights. The former president is trying to make up ground with women -- a group that views Democratic nominee Kamala Harris more favorably nationally -- in the handful of battleground states that will likely determine the winner.

""Trump's statement last night is just one more example of Republicans trying desperately to rebrand themselves on the issue of abortion,"" said Ryan Stitzlein, vice president of political and government relations at the national abortion rights organization Reproductive Freedom for All. ""But at the end of the day, the only thing that has actually changed is their rhetoric on the issue. It's their reaction to seeing the political consequences for this deeply unpopular policy position.""

Major anti-abortion groups, while voicing disagreement with Trump, said they weren't discouraged by his latest comments on a national abortion ban.

Kristan Hawkins, president of the national anti-abortion Students for Life of America, said, ""There are differing approaches in the pro-life movement on how best to achieve our goal.""

""Donald Trump has his own strategy to get the federal government out of the business of abortion,"" she said. ""We might disagree with him about the long-term goals of our movement, but in the short term, we can work with that direction.""

Hawkins added that there are other avenues Trump could use to restrict abortion nationally, including through defunding Planned Parenthood and appointing anti-abortion officials to lead major federal departments.

Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, said she wasn't surprised by Trump's remarks.

""But quite frankly, unless something really unusual happens in this election, neither side is going to have the votes in Congress to pass a national law,"" she said. ""So that wasn't really at the top of our list anyway.""

Angela Vasquez-Giroux, vice president of communications for Planned Parenthood Votes, meanwhile, said she doesn't believe Trump's vow to veto a national abortion ban, calling him ""a legendary flip-flopper who says whatever he thinks helps him most in that moment."" She said that even without a national abortion ban, Trump would be able to restrict abortion across the country by appointing anti-abortion judges and federal officials or reviving the Comstock Act, a 19th-century ""anti-vice"" law that abortion rights advocates say could imperil access to medication abortion.

Trump had not previously said whether he would veto a national ban. In fact, he repeatedly declined to say if he would veto such a ban during September's presidential debate with Harris, although it is extremely unlikely that either political party would be able to win enough votes in Congress to pass national abortion legislation.

In August, Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, said the former president would veto a national ban. But Trump demurred on the subject during the September debate, saying, ""I didn't discuss it with JD.""

The question has since lingered amid Trump's shifting stances on the crucial issue.

Trump senior adviser Jason Miller on Tuesday rejected the idea that Trump had changed his position on the matter.

""President Trump made clear, which he's said all along, it should be back in the states,"" he told reporters after the debate. ""Nothing changed. He's always said it should be back in the states.""

Vance falsely claimed during Tuesday's debate that he never supported a national ban himself, though he said in 2022 that he ""certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally"" and supported Sen. Lindsey Graham's proposal to impose a national ban on abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy. In 2023, he voiced support for a ""minimum national standard"" for abortion, including at 15 weeks of pregnancy.

Republicans have been accused of attempting to recast federal abortion restrictions as ""minimum national standards"" in order to distort their own stances on the issue amid the political unpopularity of the GOP's position on abortion.

""It doesn't matter what they call it,"" Vasquez-Giroux said. ""What matters is how it's going to impact everyone that we know and love and care about. If you call it a limit or a ban, it's the same thing, and everyday people will suffer.""

Around 6 in 10 Americans think their state should generally allow a person to obtain a legal abortion if they don't want to be pregnant for any reason, according to a July poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Voters in seven states, including conservative-leaning Kentucky, Montana and Ohio, have either protected abortion rights or defeated attempts to restrict them in statewide votes over the past two years.

Harris' campaign, meanwhile, has maintained that Trump would sign a national abortion ban if reelected and blamed him for the abortion restrictions in swaths of the country since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, which once granted a constitutional right to abortion.

Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing the three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade and boasted about returning the abortion question to the states. But voters don't have a direct say through citizen initiatives in about half of states, and in states that will have abortion on the ballot this year, anti-abortion groups and their Republican allies are using a wide array of strategies to counter proposed ballot initiatives.

"Figures, Dobson clash in congressional debate",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/alabama-congress-figures-dobson-election-debate-d7450f75e79ae2c3667e08d67c3dac8c,2024-10-02T20:53:24Z,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Congressional hopefuls Shomari Figures and Caroleene Dobson clashed in a debate Wednesday punctuated by policy differences and verbal swipes at each other's resume.

Figures, a Democrat, and Dobson, a Republican are running to represent Alabama's 2nd Congressional District, which was redrawn after a lengthy redistricting battle. The two faced off in Montgomery in a candidate forum hosted by the Montgomery Chamber of Commerce and broadcast online by WSFA.

Dobson attacked Figures, who worked in the Obama White House and as a former top aide to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, over his background in the nation's capital. Figures said his opponent was opting for a ""photo-op"" over meaningful solutions.

Dobson repeatedly called Figures a ""Washington D.C. insider"" and said he was ""part of an administration that for the past four years crushed American opportunity.""

""He wants to continue the policies of the last four years, but you and I should ask ourselves: Are we better off than we were four years ago?"" Dobson said.

Figures, speaking after the forum, said he does not ""run from the fact"" that most of his professional career was spent in Washington. Nonetheless, he said, Alabama is his home. ""The root of it is: This is home for me. This where I was born, where I was raised,"" Figures said.

He added that he is the son of two Alabama legislators and grew up in Mobile.

Dobson has made border security, a cornerstone of her campaign. Figures referred to a campaign trip that Dobson took to the Mexico border to highlight immigration issues as a ""photo-op"" while saying he has been at the border ""as a staffer"" to work on legislation to provide more resources to border agents.

""My opponent mentions the border, but what she fails to mention about the border is that in her early legal career, she spent time in Texas actually selling millions of acres of our border state land in Texas to shadow companies owned by Mexican investors,"" Figures said.

Dobson responded that the transaction involved a Mexican company that was buying office space in Texas as it fled the drug cartel crisis in Mexico. She said Figures was part of the transition team for the Biden administration that ""flung open our borders and has resulted in less safe communities.""

Alabama's 2nd Congressional District was redrawn after the U.S. Supreme Court agreed Alabama had likely illegally diluted the influence of Black voters when drawing congressional lines. A three-judge panel selected new lines to give Black residents¬∏ who now make up nearly 49% of the district's voting-age population, an ""opportunity"" to elect a candidate of their choice.

The open seat has sparked a heated race for the district that could help decide control of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Some of the sharpest policy contrasts were over abortion and healthcare.

""I do not believe it is the government's role to tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her body. I think it's pretty simple. If you don't believe in abortion, if you don't want an abortion, don't have one,"" Figures said.

Dobson described herself as ""pro-life"" but said the issue should be left to the states.

""This is an issue that's best left to state legislatures to decide with compassion and common sense,"" Dobson said.

Dobson said she supports exemptions to abortion bans for rape, incest and for a pregnant woman's health. Alabama's abortion ban does not have exemptions for rape and incest.

Both candidates spoke of the need to address infrastructure and healthcare challenges in the district.

Figures said four rural hospitals have closed in the district since the campaign began, and life expectancy in Alabama lags most of the nation. Figures urged Alabama to expand its Medicaid program to cover more low-income people who he said are often working jobs but don't have access to health insurance. He said he would support legislation that would renew financial incentives to holdout states to expand their programs. Alabama is one of 10 states that did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

""In the state of Alabama, you are just barely expected to live past your 60s, your 60s. That is unacceptable, and for too many people. That is because of lack of health care earlier in life,"" Figures said.

Dobson said she would encourage state officials to ""examine"" the issue of Medicaid expansion but said that inflation is helping to drive healthcare costs.

""We also have to recognize that the best insurance is the one that you get through your job. So, we need to create more jobs to allow people to have private insurance that is going to pay those reimbursements to keep our rural hospitals open,"" Dobson said.

The two candidates will meet again on Oct. 10 in an online debate hosted by al.com."
Georgia attorney general appeals a judge's rollback of abortion ban,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/georgia-abortion-ban-overturned-appeal-38c9c945ad76647223b7252806e14319,2024-10-02T14:25:07Z,"ATLANTA (AP) -- Georgia's Republican attorney general has appealed a judge's ruling that struck down the state's abortion ban.

Attorney General Chris Carr's office is asking the Georgia Supreme Court to reinstate the law banning most abortions after the first six weeks or so of pregnancy while the court considers the state's appeal.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled Monday that the ban in place since 2022 violated women's rights to liberty and privacy under Georgia's state constitution. His decision rolled back abortion limits in the state to a prior law that allowed abortions until viability, roughly 22 to 24 weeks into a pregnancy.

Some Georgia clinic officials said they would begin accepting patients whose pregnancies are past six weeks' gestation, though they're aware the ban could be reimposed quickly.

Carr's office noted in its notice of appeal filed Tuesday that the case goes straight to Georgia's highest court because it involves a challenge to the constitutionality of a state law.

The judge's ruling left 13 U.S. states with bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy and three that bar them after the first six weeks or so of pregnancy."

It was one of the evening's more contentious moments and reminded viewers again of the difficulty that the news outlets organizing debates this political season are facing in trying to point out in real time statements that are misleading or untrue.

After Vance had talked about illegal immigrants overwhelming some American cities like Springfield, Ohio, Brennan interjected that the Haitians that had moved to that city were there legally.

""Since you're fact-checking me, it's important to say what is actually going on,"" Vance said.

After briefly letting Vance speak, Brennan interrupted him and said it was time to move on to other issues. They spoke over each other, until CBS News muted the microphones of both Vance and Walz, who were appearing at a studio in New York City.

""Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Brennan said.

Prior to the debate, CBS News had said it would be up to the two candidates -- not moderators Brennan and Norah O'Donnell -- to fact-check each other and the journalists would encourage them to do so. Vance said that it appeared CBS News was breaking the rules it had set down.

Fact-checking was an issue during last month's debate between presidential contenders Donald Trump and Kamala Harris after moderators corrected Trump at least four times, angering the former president and his supporters. When Trump debated President Joe Biden last spring, CNN moderators did not attempt any on-air corrections.

In an echo of what followed the ABC debate, Trump posted on his Truth Social site during Tuesday's debate that ""both young ladies have been extremely biased Anchors!""

At one other point Tuesday, wrapping up a discussion about climate change, O'Donnell said it was the overwhelming consensus of scientists that the planet was warming. Earlier, she had asked Vance whether or not he agreed with his running mate's comment that climate change was a hoax.

There were points at which the moderators sought to encourage the candidates to police each other. During a discussion about whether illegal migration was driving up housing costs, Brennan said to Walz, ""I do want to let you respond to the allegation that the vice president is letting in migrants.""

Yet it was a discussion about abortion that most illustrated the difficulties of that approach, and how there is no easy way during a live debate to make sure viewers are getting accurate information. Vance cited a provision in a Minnesota law, where Walz is governor.

""As I read Minnesota law, it says that a doctor that presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide life-saving care,"" Vance said.

Vance called that ""fundamentally barbaric,"" while Walz said his opponent's interpretation of the law was untrue.

What did the law actually say? That was unclear, and viewers were left to decide which candidate they wanted to believe. The CBS moderators cut to a commercial, unable or unwilling to clarify the question.

Throughout the debate, CBS News ran on its screen a message that viewers could log onto its ""CBS News Confirmed"" website to read about claims in the debate that were untrue or misleading. At some points, the network even showed a code that enabled viewers to instantly call up the information on their mobile phones. Yet those entreaties were not shown on the screens of other networks that simulcast the debate, which was produced by CBS.

The debate may have represented the last chance for viewers to see representatives of the two presidential campaigns duke it out onscreen. Harris has called for a second debate between her and Trump, but the Republican candidate has not accepted the challenge.

FACT FOCUS: A look at false and misleading claims during the vice presidential debate,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/debate-walz-vance-misinformation-fact-check-a3f67b1fdef425038dfac9267861247c,2024-10-02T04:13:45Z,"The vice presidential candidates, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, on Tuesday engaged in a fast-moving, largely civil debate on a wide range of issues. Here's a look at some false and misleading claims from the debate.

___

VANCE: ""Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration. What do they use that money for? They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching against our allies.""

THE FACTS: The Biden administration agreed last year to unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian assets as part of a deal to free five U.S. citizens being held by Iran. But administration officials say not a dollar of that has yet been given to Iran. It was part of a deal negotiated by the Obama administration, before Biden and Harris took office, that could have allowed Iran to access frozen assets in exchange for accepting limits on its nuclear program.

In 2016, Iran said it had received access to more than $100 billion worth of frozen overseas assets following the implementation of a landmark nuclear deal with world powers. The money had been held in banks in China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey since international sanctions were tightened in 2012 over Tehran's nuclear program. Then-Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew told Congress that only about $50 billion of the frozen assets would actually be accessible by Iran.

WALZ: ""They were charging $800 before this law went into effect.""

THE FACTS: Walz overstated how much Americans were paying for insulin before a new law capped prices at $35 per month for millions of older Americans on Medicare. A December 2022 study found that people who were on Medicare or enrolled in private insurance paid $452 yearly on average before the new law took effect.

VANCE: ""You've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.""

THE FACTS: Most economists blame a long-term decline in the housing supply for the steady increase in home prices. The number of new homes under construction plunged from an annual pace of 1.4 million in April 2006 to barely above 400,000 in August 2011, and didn't recover to 2006 levels until 2021.

Vance said at least one prominent economic analysis from the Federal Reserve supports his claims that immigrants are pushing up housing costs, but he didn't provide details. He was likely citing a May 2024 blog post by Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Kashkari says immigration's long-run effect on inflation is ""unclear,"" but immigrants need a place to live and their arrival has overlapped with higher prices.

There might be upward pressure on home prices in some markets because of immigrants arriving, but most economists say the issue is a lack of supply of homes on the market. Homebuilders say they need the immigrants to build the homes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a September news conference that high mortgage rates mean people aren't listing their homes for sale and there has not been enough supply.

WALZ: ""Their Project 2025 is going to have a registry of pregnancies.""

THE FACTS: That's not true. The conservative initiative calls for the collection of ""accurate and reliable statistical data about abortion, abortion survivors, and abortion-related maternal deaths,"" but not a record of every pregnancy that occurs.

More specifically, Project 2025 proposes that the Department of Health and Human Services require all states to report detailed information about abortions that are performed within their borders, including the total number of abortions, the age and state of residence of the mother, the gestational age of the fetus, the reason for the abortion and the method used to perform the abortion. It suggests that this data be separated into categories such as spontaneous miscarriages, intentional abortions, stillbirths and other medical treatments that result in the death of the fetus, like chemotherapy.

VANCE: ""We've got 20, 25 million illegal aliens who are here in the country.""

THE FACTS: That figure is highly inflated. U.S. Customs and Border Protection reports more than 10 million arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico from January 2021 through September 2024.

That's arrests, not people. Under pandemic-era asylum restrictions, many people crossed more than once until they succeeded because there were no legal consequences for getting turned back to Mexico. So the number of people is lower than the number of arrests.

According to the Department of Homeland Security's latest available estimate, there were approximately 11 million people living illegally in the U.S. as of January 2022, 79% of whom entered prior to January 2010.

VANCE: ""It says that a doctor who presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide lifesaving care to a baby who survives a botched late-term abortion.""

THE FACTS: This claim misrepresents a bill Walz signed into law in 2023, updating language about the care of newborns.

The new language uses the phrase ""an infant who is born alive"" instead of ""a born alive infant as a result of an abortion."" It states that medical personnel are required to ""care for the infant who is born alive"" rather than ""preserve the life and health of the born alive infant.""

Both the current version of the law and the 2015 version that was amended state that ""an infant who is born alive shall be fully recognized as a human person, and accorded immediate protection under the law.""

Infanticide is criminalized in every state, including Minnesota, and the bill does not change that.

VANCE: ""Remember he said that on January the 6th, the protesters ought to protest peacefully.""

THE FACTS: It's true that Trump told the crowd gathered near the White House, ""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.""

But Vance ignored the incendiary language Trump used throughout his speech, during which he urged the crowd to march to the Capitol, where Congress was meeting to certify President Joe Biden's victory. Trump told the crowd: ""If you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore."" That's after his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, declared: ""Let's have trial by combat.""

Some of the most notable quotes from the JD Vance-Tim Walz vice presidential debate,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/vance-walz-debate-cbs-quotes-94e552d1a7100225a0003db618351601,2024-10-02T04:09:09Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first and only vice presidential debate between Ohio Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz featured an often orderly, policy-focused and even civil dialogue between the two men seeking to serve as the next president's second in command.

One of the sharpest comments came from a debate moderator. Here are some of the most notable quotes from the debate:

-- CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan, who intervened after a tense back and forth between the candidates over immigration. Vance protested a clarification by a moderator about the legal status of Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. ""Since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" Vance said before both he and Walz's exchanges were muted.

-- Walz, agreeing with Vance that some regulations limit the construction of new housing units. Both candidates throughout the debate expressed agreement on some points before driving home their own messages.

-- Vance, after Walz noted his son had witnessed gun violence. ""I appreciate that,"" Walz replied.

-- Walz, when discussing discrepancies in his travel history to Hong Kong in 1989 that have been reported by multiple news organizations.

-- Vance, arguing Harris could have acted as vice president to make housing more affordable. ""If Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address middle class problems, she ought to do them now,"" Vance also said during the debate.

-- Walz, when discussing Vance's unfounded claims about immigrant communities in Springfield, Ohio. Walz said Vance ""will create stories to bring attention to this that vilified a large number of people who were here legally in the community of Springfield. The Republican governor said, it's not true. Don't do it.""

-- Walz, discussing the high rate of gun violence in the United States compared to other rich nations. Walz cautioned against using mental illness as a ""scapegoat"" for the country's high levels of gun violence rather than ""find solutions on this that protect the Second Amendment, protect our children, that settlement.""

- Walz, noting that he is a longtime gunowner and the need to address firearm deaths by suicide and violent crime.

-- Vance, responding to how Republicans should navigate potentially unpopular and dangerous realities that face women surrounding pregnancy. Vance, who opposes abortion, said Republicans ""have got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they, frankly, just don't trust us.""

-- Walz, criticizing Trump's record on abortion. Walz said Trump ""bragged"" about appointing three Supreme Court justices who would go on to join a majority ruling that overturned the abortion protections in Roe v. Wade. ""52 years of personal autonomy and then he tells us 'Oh, send it to the states,'"" Walz said of Trump.

-- Walz, discussing the riot at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Walz said Trump's rhetoric and refusal to concede defeat in the 2020 presidential election led to the riot at the U.S. Capitol and deep ensuing divisions across politics. ""All of us say there's no place for this,"" Walz said.

-- Vance, when asked whether Trump won the 2020 presidential election and if he would support efforts to contest the election which Trump carried out that have since been deemed illegal or unconstitutional. ""First of all, I think that we're focused on the future,"" Vance said. ""But what President Trump has said is that there were problems in 2020, and my own belief is that we should fight about those issues, debate those issues peacefully in the public square."""
Arkansas medical marijuana supporters sue state over decision measure won't qualify for ballot,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/medical-marijuana-arkansas-signatures-lawsuit-93297e195fcb70c8ec8cfdb99deda0e4,2024-10-01T23:01:02Z,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Organizers of an effort to expand medical marijuana i n Arkansas sued the state on Tuesday for its decision that the proposal won't qualify for the November ballot.

Arkansans for Patient Access asked the state Supreme Court to order Secretary of State John Thurston's office to certify their proposal for the ballot. Thurston on Monday said the proposal did not qualify, ruling that its petitions fell short of the valid signatures from registered voters needed.

The medical marijuana proposal was aimed at expanding a measure that the state's voters approved in 2016. It would have broadened the definition of medical professionals who can certify patients for medical cannabis, expanded qualifying conditions and made medical cannabis cards valid for three years.

The group's lawsuit challenges Thurston's decision to not count some of the signatures because the state asserted it had not followed paperwork rules regarding paid signature gatherers. The suit comes weeks after a ballot measure that would have scaled back Arkansas' abortion ban was blocked from the ballot over similar assertions it didn't comply with paperwork requirements.

The state in July determined the group had fallen short of the required signatures, but qualified for 30 additional days to circulate petitions. But the state then told the group that any additional signatures gathered by paid signature gatherers would not be counted if required information was submitted by the canvassing company rather than sponsors of the measure.

The group said the move was a change in the state's position since the same standard wasn't applied to petitions it previously submitted.

""It would be fundamentally unfair for the secretary's newly 'discovered' position to be imposed on APA at the eleventh hour of the signature collection process,"" the group said in its filing.

Thurston's office declined to comment on the lawsuit. Attorney General Tim Griffin said he would defend Thurston's office in court.

""Our laws protect the integrity of the ballot initiative process,"" Griffin said in a statement. ""I applaud Secretary of State John Thurston for his commitment to diligently follow the law, and I will vigorously defend him in court."""
Number of voters with unconfirmed citizenship documents more than doubles in battleground Arizona,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/voting-arizona-fontes-citizenship-ballot-election-f7b9aee24c58ee8a65d437c15c2d77a7,2024-10-01T21:07:19Z,"PHOENIX (AP) -- The number of voters in the battleground state of Arizona classified as having full access to the ballot without confirmation they are citizens has more than doubled to 218,000, Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said.

That number represents 5.3% of all registered voters. While the error won't change who is eligible to vote for president or Congress, that amount of voters could sway tight local and state races, and hotly contested ballot measures on abortion and immigration.

Arizona is unique in that it requires residents to prove citizenship to vote a full ballot -- a requirement dating back to 2004. If they don't do that but attest under penalty of perjury to being citizens, they can vote in federal races only.

Fontes announced Monday that the number of misclassified voters jumped from about 98,000 last month to around 218,000.

It's unclear how officials missed the additional bloc of voters after saying two weeks ago that an error between the state's voter registration database and the Motor Vehicle Division, or MVD, had been fixed.

Aaron Thacker, a spokesperson for Fontes' office Tuesday that the fix that MVD put in place didn't solve the problem.

The Arizona Department of Transportation, which oversees the MVD, said in an email that it created a coding update in its system but didn't specify when it was implemented.

Around Arizona, a relatively small number of votes could tip the scales in competitive races for the Legislature, where Republicans hold a slim majority in both chambers. This year, voters also will decide on the constitutional right to abortion and a measure to criminalize people from entering the state illegally from Mexico.

The Arizona Supreme Court ruled last month that the original batch of voters can cast a full ballot in this year's election because they registered long ago and attested under the penalty of perjury that they are citizens. The justices said the voters were not at fault for the error and shouldn't be disenfranchised so close to the Nov. 5 general election.

Fontes said that ruling should also apply to the new batch of voters, who are nearly evenly split among Democrats, Republicans and voters who aren't registered with either of those parties."
No one expects a judge's rollback of Georgia's abortion ban to be the last word,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-georgia-ban-overturned-appeal-ec732417c9c3b714ccee3b0c9e77bc7d,2024-10-01T18:23:21Z,"SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) -- When a Georgia judge overturned the state's abortion ban this week, abortion rights advocates praised the ruling and opponents denounced it -- all knowing the state's top court could put it on hold in coming days or weeks.

Any changes to abortion policy in Southern states could have an impact that resonates beyond their borders. Most states in the region have bans in place, forcing women who are seeking abortion procedures to travel to obtain them.

So as long as the ban is lifted, it could change abortion-related travel patterns. And the ruling puts another spotlight on a contested state in this year's presidential election, in which Democrats have sought to make abortion a major issue.

Here's a look at where things stand.

Georgia's abortion law violates women's rights to liberty and privacy guaranteed by the state constitution, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled Monday.

Since 2022, the law effectively prohibited abortions beyond six weeks of pregnancy, which is before women often know they're pregnant. That's the point when cardiac activity in an embryo's cells can be detected by ultrasound. The law banned abortions once a ""detectable human heartbeat"" was present -- with some exceptions.

McBurney ruled that the law infringed on the liberty ""of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices."" He also wrote that Georgia gives women a constitutional right to privacy that includes making personal health decisions.

The judge wrote that his ruling reverts Georgia's abortion law to its prior status, which allowed abortions until viability, which is generally considered to be about 22 to 24 weeks' gestational age.

It was the judge's second ruling striking down the same law. In 2022, McBurney declared the law invalid because it was enacted by state lawmakers in 2019, when Roe v. Wade still protected abortion rights nationally.

The Georgia Supreme Court overturned that earlier ruling and sent the case back to McBurney to consider the merits of other legal arguments raised by abortion providers challenging the law. That paved the way for the Monday ruling.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, blasted the ruling, saying: ""Once again, the will of Georgians and their representatives has been overruled by the personal beliefs of one judge.""

Republican state Attorney General Chris Carr planned an immediate appeal to the state Supreme Court, a spokesperson said.

Advocates on both sides of the abortion debate in Georgia noted the state's high court could keep McBurney's order from taking effect while the state's appeal is pending.

It took the Georgia Supreme Court just over a week to overrule McBurney and reinstate the law after it was struck down the first time, in November 2022.

Georgia clinic officials told The Associated Press that they would accept patients whose pregnancies are past six weeks' gestation -- and also that they know the ban could be reimposed quickly.

That could make a big difference in the state. There were about 4,400 abortions monthly in Georgia before the ban took effect, and there have been about 2,400 monthly since then, according to estimates from the Society of Family Planning.

Allowing more abortions could mean that more women who want them can obtain them. It could also ease the flow of patients to clinics in other states, particularly North Carolina, the closest place where abortion is legal further into pregnancy. The Guttmacher Institute estimated that nearly 6,000 Georgia residents traveled to North Carolina for abortions last year.

Most Southern states have abortion bans that are either similar to the one overturned in Georgia or that are in effect at all stages of pregnancy.

So when a state lifts a ban, it could become a destination for people from nearby states seeking abortion. It's not clear whether that will happen in Georgia, given the possibility the state Supreme Court could reinstate the ban.

Even before this week, Georgia, a hotly contested state in the presidential election, has been a flashpoint in the political debate over abortion.

Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris traveled there last month to highlight reporting that two women in the state died after they didn't get proper medical treatment for complications from taking abortion pills to end their pregnancies. The vice president used the occasion to blast her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, for appointing justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who cleared the way for states to impose bans.

After Monday's ruling, it leaves 13 states with bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy and three that bar them after the first six weeks or so of pregnancy."
"Catholic hospital in California illegally denied emergency abortion, state attorney general says",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/california-attorney-general-hospital-abortion-lawsuit-2df6c59133dbb5a0ccca5b0269bd1bc0,2024-10-01T18:22:59Z,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- California's attorney general is suing a Catholic hospital, saying that Providence St. Joseph Hospital illegally denied emergency abortion care to a woman whose pregnancy was no longer viable after her water broke 15 weeks into carrying twins.

Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the lawsuit Monday, which was filed that day in Humboldt County Superior Court and details the case of Anna Nusslock. In February, Nusslock was 15 weeks into her pregnancy when her water broke and she was rushed to Providence in Eureka, where she lives.

According to the complaint, Nusslock was told by the doctor at the hospital that they could not provide an abortion ""so long as one of Anna's twins had detectable heart tones, unless Anna's life was sufficiently at risk."" The doctor recommended she take a helicopter to the University of California, San Francisco for emergency services. But she doubted her insurance would cover the $40,000 cost of the ride.

She asked if she could drive to UCSF, and the doctor advised that if she drove 270 miles (435 kilometers) south, which is about five hours, to San Francisco she would ""hemorrhage and die,"" according to the complaint. Nussbaum was discharged to Mad River Community Hospital 12 miles (19 kilometers) away, where she received the abortion at a labor and delivery unit that is scheduled to close this month, according to Bonta's office.

""They broke the law, and we are taking action to make sure they never do it again,"" Bonta said at a news conference.

A spokesperson for Providence Hospital, the hospital's parent company, said in a statement that it was reviewing the complaint.

""Providence is deeply committed to the health and wellness of women and pregnant patients and provides emergency services to all who walk through our doors in accordance with state and federal law,"" according to the statement.

Bonta's lawsuit states that California's Emergency Services Law prohibits ""the kind of patient dumping (Nusslock) experienced and requires all licensed health facilities"" with an emergency department provide emergency care to those who need it. The lawsuit alleges violations of state civil rights and unfair competition laws."
"Who is Claudia Sheinbaum, the scientist who will head Mexico as its first female president?",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mexico-claudia-sheinbaum-woman-president-aa24527fc05dafa9e30b28e4bb40ccbd,2024-10-01T04:18:22Z,"MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Claudia Sheinbaum takes office Tuesday as Mexico's first female president in the nation's more than 200 years of independence.

The 62-year-old former Mexico City mayor and lifelong leftist campaigned on a promise of continuity, of protecting and expanding the signature initiatives of her mentor, former President Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador.

In the four months between her election and inauguration she held that line, backing L√≥pez Obrador on issues big and small. But Sheinbaum is a very different person; she likes data and doesn't have L√≥pez Obrador's backslapping personal touch.

Mexico now waits to see if she will step out of his shadow.

Sheinbaum's background is in science. She has a Ph.D. in energy engineering. Her brother is a physicist. In a 2023 interview with The Associated Press, Sheinbaum said, ""I believe in science.""

Observers say that grounding showed itself in Sheinbaum's actions as mayor during the COVID-19 pandemic, when her city of some 9 million people took a different approach from what L√≥pez Obrador espoused at the national level.

She comes from an older, more solidly left tradition that predates L√≥pez Obrador's nationalistic, populist movement.

Her parents were leading activists in Mexico's 1968 student movement, which ended tragically in a government massacre of hundreds of student demonstrators in Mexico City's Tlatelolco plaza just days before the Summer Olympics opened there that year.

Sheinbaum is also the first president with a Jewish background in the largely Catholic country.

Sheinbaum led wire to wire and won convincingly in June with almost 60% of the vote, about double the number of her nearest competitor, X√≥chitl G√°lvez.

As L√≥pez Obrador's chosen successor, she enjoyed the boost of the high popularity he maintained throughout his six years in office.

The opposition's coalition led by G√°lvez struggled to gain traction, while support for the governing party carried over to Congress, where voters gave Morena and its allies margins that allowed it to pass important constitutional changes before L√≥pez Obrador left office.

Before passage of a controversial constitutional overhaul of Mexico's judiciary that will make all judges stand for election, Sheinbaum stood with L√≥pez Obrador who had pushed it.

Sheinbaum said ""the reforms to the judicial system will not affect our commercial relations, nor private Mexican investments, nor foreign ones. Rather the opposite, there will be a greater and better rule of law and democracy for everyone.""

Shortly after, when L√≥pez Obrador's proposal to put the National Guard under military command was being considered, Sheinbaum defended it against critics. She said it would not militarize the country and that the National Guard would respect human rights.

And just days before she took office, Sheinbaum stood with L√≥pez Obrador in his long-running diplomatic spat with Spain. She defended her decision to not invite Spain's King Felipe VI to her inauguration, saying in part that the king had failed to apologize for Spain's conquest of Mexico as L√≥pez Obrador had demanded years earlier.

Sheinbaum's victory came 70 years after women won the right to vote in Mexico.

The race really came down to two women, Sheinbaum and G√°lvez, but Mexico's prevailing machismo still pushed both women to explain why they thought they could be president.

Since 2018, Mexico's Congress has had a 50-50 gender split, in part due to gender quotas set for party candidates. Still, Sheinbaum inherits a country with soaring levels of violence against women.

There are also still many parts of the country, especially rural Indigenous areas where men hold all the power. And some 2.5 million women toil in domestic work where despite reforms they continue to face low pay, abuse by employers, long hours and unstable working conditions.

Mexico's Supreme Court ruled in 2023 that national laws prohibiting abortions are unconstitutional and violate women's rights.

Although the Mexican ruling orders the removal of abortion from the federal penal code and requires federal health institutions to offer the procedure to anyone who requests it, further state-by-state legal work is pending to remove all penalties.

Feminists say that simply electing a woman as president does not guarantee she will govern with a gender perspective. Both Sheinbaum and L√≥pez Obrador have been criticized before for appearing to lack empathy toward women protesting against gender violence."
DOJ accuses popular gym chain of discriminating against disabled people,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/doj-accuses-popular-gym-chain-discriminating-disabled-people,2024-10-08T21:48:53Z,"A man is in jail after he stabbed another man in the buttocks after an alleged dispute over a workout machine. (FOX 7)

The Department of Justice (DOJ) is accusing LA Fitness of discriminating against disabled people in a lawsuit that was announced on Tuesday.

In a press release published by the DOJ, the agency explained that it was suing Fitness International LLC - the company that owns LA Fitness - for ""discriminating against people with disabilities at its gym and fitness clubs.""

The DOJ is asking the Central District of California to ""stop LA Fitness from discriminating against people with disabilities, including by requiring LA Fitness to make its facilities and equipment accessible.""

According to the DOJ, LA Fitness discriminated against disabled people because some of the chain's amenities were not sufficiently accessible. The press release referenced broken pool lifts, broken elevators and broken equipment.

The chain is also accused of charging disabled patrons an extra fee for certain services. The lawsuit seeks money damages for the people who were ""harmed by LA Fitness's discrimination.""

""This includes people who were directly harmed by LA Fitness's barriers to access and broken equipment, as well people who need help to use LA Fitness's clubs and were charged extra fees to have a friend, nurse or personal assistant help them use LA fitness facilities,"" the press release noted.

LA Fitness, one of the largest chain gyms in the U.S., operates nearly 700 clubs across the country. The DOJ's lawsuit hinges on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which was passed in 1990 to ""establish a clear and comprehensive prohibition of discrimination on the basis of disability.""

""The ADA requires LA Fitness to give people with disabilities equal access to LA Fitness's services and facilities, remove architectural barriers to make its facilities accessible to people with disabilities and maintain accessible features,"" the DOJ argued.

""The ADA also prohibits LA Fitness from charging extra fees to people with disabilities.""

In a statement, Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said that access to physical health activities is ""crucial for promoting the health and well-being of all individuals, including those with disabilities.""

""For over 30 years, the ADA has prohibited gyms and fitness clubs like LA Fitness from denying patrons with disabilities the opportunity to use and enjoy facilities enjoyed by patrons without disabilities,"" Clarke said. ""Through this lawsuit, the department seeks to remedy LA Fitness's discriminatory actions and ensure that patrons with disabilities have equal access to fully participate at their local LA Fitness gym and fitness clubs.""

These results are little more than trivia questions today (the answers are 2008, 2004, and 2008 again). At the time, they raised eyebrows and changed our understanding of the electorate.

Surprises happen on election week. And when the national race looks this close, one unexpected flip can decide who wins the White House.

Vice President Harris still has the edge in this week's forecast. It predicts that Harris will take home at least 241 electoral college votes to Trump's 219.

Her advantage is no larger than it was in September, and as this column has mentioned, battleground states are usually - and mostly - won and lost together. The six toss-up states in this forecast are worth 78 votes, enough to give either candidate a victory on election night.

National polls show a tight race: a Quinnipiac survey has Harris and former President Trump tied at 48%-48% with likely voters, while Marist has the candidates at 50%-48%, well within the polls' margins of sampling error.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: TRUMP MAINTAINS LEAD ON TWO TOP ISSUES

Neither poll shows Trump slipping with the national electorate. Other recent polls showed a point worth of erosion after the September presidential debate.

Battleground state polls have been sparse. (Hurricane Helene has devastated communities in Georgia and North Carolina, and Hurricane Milton will soon make landfall in Florida. This will affect the accuracy of polling in these areas.)

Overall, this race is still anyone's game.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance debated a week ago in New York City. Vance mostly broke through the character that Democrats had constructed for him, while Walz stumbled out of the gate.

A flash poll showed neither candidate winning the night. As always, wait for results from multiple polls conducted in the weeks after the debate to properly assess the polling impact.

That was the only scheduled event that could surprise voters this month. (Fox News Media has proposed a second Harris-Trump debate later in October.)

Of course, it's the unexpected events in years past that have done more to reshape the race. And events in two categories have already resurfaced.

FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS CITE HIGH PRICES AS BIGGEST MOTIVATOR TO VOTE

Polarization will limit the impact of these events on the horserace. But watch Harris and Trump's support with independents over the coming weeks. Those voters made up 5% of the electorate in 2020, and they broke for President Biden by 15 points; recent polls put Harris in that ballpark. Trump likely needs to claw that back to win the race.

Two states that could surprise in November

There are nine ""likely"" races on the Power Rankings map. The two that would have the biggest impact on the race are Florida and Virginia.

Former President Trump improved his performance in Florida in the 2020 presidential election, bringing his margin up to about 372,000 votes.

That's a win of 3.4 points, or his second-closest victory of the cycle. (The closest was North Carolina, a toss-up in the rankings, which he won by 1.3 points.)

Republicans have strong advantages. The state's White working-class and senior voters lean towards Trump, while its large Hispanic population, particularly the Cuban and Venezuelan communities, has shifted right in recent years.

The GOP won big at every level in the midterms and enjoys a 1 million-plus voter registration advantage, and most tellingly, the Democratic Party is not making significant investments.

Democrats hope that a competitive Senate race, where incumbent Republican Rick Scott has personally spent more than $8 million, means the presidential election is closer than people think. Florida is also one of three competitive states with an abortion measure on the ballot.

It would take a blowout night for Harris to flip the Sunshine State. It would also be the first state after the battlegrounds to go blue.

Florida stays at Likely R in the rankings.

A win for Trump in Virginia would also be shocking, especially since Biden won this state by more than 10 points in 2020.

The state has a higher proportion of Black, suburban, and college-educated voters than the rest of the country, and all three groups help Democrats run up the margin. While Republicans talked about Virginia after the June presidential debate, the race has changed, and neither party is making big investments in the state today.

Some polls show a race that isn't over for the GOP. A survey from Virginia Commonwealth University in September put Harris at 47% with registered voters and Trump at 37%. A poll from the Washington Post earlier in the month had Harris at 50% to Trump's 42%.

Still, it would take a blowout in the other direction for the Old Dominion to reject Harris. Virginia remains a Likely D race.

Four weeks until election night

More than 1.5 million voters have cast their ballot as the countdown to election night continues. Early voting has now begun in:"
Michael Moore mocks Democrats panicked by tight 2024 race: 'Shocking to me' they believe Trump is going to win,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/michael-moore-mocks-democrats-panicked-tight-2024-race-shocking-me-believe-trump-going-win,2024-10-08T10:44:31Z,"Liberal filmmaker and activist Michael Moore mocked Democrats worrying about the tight 2024 race, saying he found it hard to believe former President Trump could win election.

Liberal filmmaker and activist Michael Moore knocked Democrats who are panicking over the tight 2024 presidential race, admitting he's stunned that people on the left believe former President Trump could win the election.

""Democrats, they're such a frightened group of people,"" Moore said during a Monday interview on CNN. ""I mean, they still think that Trump is going to win.""

""This is kind of shocking to me. Like, don't you live with people? Are you not aware that there's going to be a tsunami of women voting between now and Election Day?"" he said, referring to backlash over the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022.

""Anybody who thinks women are going to stay home, that women are going to stay home -- Do you not know any women? Do you not live with a woman?"" Moore continued.

MICHAEL MOORE WARNS KAMALA HARRIS TO NOT GO 'CENTRIST'

CNN anchor Brianna Keilar asked Moore if he believed polling which shows the race is close.

According to the latest national Fox News poll from September, Harris currently holds a two-point edge over Trump with voters.

""I don't think it's a dead heat,"" Moore responded. He clarified that while he wasn't outright dismissing polling, he had more faith in surveys that questioned voters on the issues, rather than the candidates.

He pointed to polling misses from the 2016 campaign, such as when The New York Times predicted on Election Day, 2016, that Hillary Clinton had an 85% chance at winning the presidential election.

""No, I don't think people should be running their lives based on these polls,"" he said.

BLUE PHILLY WORKING-CLASS VOTERS START LEANING TOWARD TRUMP AHEAD OF THE ELECTION: 'PEOPLE ACTUALLY LOVE HIM'

Moore ripped Democrats pushing Harris to the center because of these concerns, arguing that the VP's progressive policy positions on abortion, the environment, guns and jobs are actually in the mainstream.

""You mentioned Democrats who want [Harris] to 'tone it down,'"" Moore continued. ""That's something women have been told for decades.""

""The reason she's so progressive -- because she believes in a woman's right to choose, she believes a 14-year-old shouldn't take an assault rifle to school....you go down all her positions and they line up exactly with where the majority of Americans are at,"" he continued.

""The majority of Americans believe climate change is real. The majority of Americans believe the minimum wage is too low. Just go down the list,"" Moore argued.

""The majority of Americans want regulation. They want people to be making sure that, when you have a hurricane and only 1% of the people have flood insurance -- That's not the country I live in. That's not the country I'm going to live in, where people now are suffering because of this,"" he said, referring to devastation from Hurricane Helene.

Last week, Moore warned Harris to not ""move to the center"" or it could backfire for Democrats.

""If Harris is advised by her wealthy donors to shun the left and drop her more progressive positions in favor of a 'move to the center,'"" Moore warned in a post on Substack, that could ""reduce or depress the vote."""
"Early voting kicks off in Indiana, New Mexico, Ohio, Wyoming",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/early-voting-indiana-new-mexico-ohio-wyoming,2024-10-08T09:15:20Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Four more states began their early voting processes on Tuesday: Indiana, New Mexico, Wyoming and the major swing state of Ohio.

Here is everything you need to know about casting a ballot in each of the states.

Ohio is home to one of the most competitive Senate races on the map.

Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown has won the Midwestern state three times, but with Trump pushing White working-class voters toward the GOP and record spending from both parties, this is set to be a tight race. Brown faces Republican businessman Bernie Moreno.

Republicans have made inroads in the northeastern and heavily industrial areas bordering Pennsylvania. Trumbull County flipped to the GOP in 2016, and Trump increased his margin to 10 points in 2020; Mahoning County flipped in 2020 by almost two points. These counties played a key role in Trump's statewide wins.

Democrats are performing better than ever in the ""three C's"": Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. These areas have the highest percentages of college-educated voters. President Biden won the counties home to these cities by double-digit margins in 2020, with roughly 30-point wins in Franklin (Columbus) and Cuyahoga (Cleveland).

Unlike in other competitive states, Republicans still hold up in Ohio's suburban and exurban areas, particularly those surrounding Cincinnati.

Ohio's Senate race is a toss-up and the presidential race is ranked Likely R on the Fox News Power Rankings.

Meanwhile, New Mexico is also in the ""likely"" column, both at the presidential and senate level. The state delivered Biden an 11-point win in 2020, but Latino or Hispanic voters made up 35% of the state's electorate in the 2020 election, and those voters' support for the Democrat ticket has wavered in recent polls.

Republicans would need to run up their margins with these voters all across the state and keep Harris at bay in places like Do√±a Ana County, home to Albuquerque and which last voted for Biden by 18 points, to pull off a victory.

Voting also begins today in four House districts ranked Lean or Toss Up on the Fox News Power Rankings. For a full list of competitive races, see the latest Senate and House rankings.

"Kamala 2.0's challenge? Making more news, and not just with ultra-friendly hosts",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-2-0s-challenge-making-more-news-not-just-ultra-friendly-hosts,2024-10-08T07:11:26Z,"For well over a month, Kamala Harris rode a wave of the most positive press any presidential candidate has gotten in two decades, and her own skills, to turn what had been a lost cause for the Democrats into an extremely tight race.

But does she have a second act?

Kamala 2.0, under constant attack by Donald Trump and the Republicans, doesn't have much new to say. She is conducting a play-it-safe campaign, like a basketball team sitting on a lead and running out the clock.

But Harris doesn't have a lead in the three ""blue wall"" midwestern states she needs to win, and the loss of any one of them could hand Trump the presidency once again.

VANCE-WALZ VP DEBATE ENDED IN A 'DRAW': DEMOCRAT REP. DEBBIE DINGELL

For all the focus on Pennsylvania, Harris leads by 0.7 percent in Michigan - a statistical tie, based on the Real Clear Politics average.

On Sunday's ""Media Buzz,"" Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell told me her state could go either way.

""The vice president has a problem with union workers,"" Dingell said. ""Many of the men, as well as, quite frankly, African-American young men who have said to me, I was with a group with them last week. 'You know what, Donald Trump talks to us. Democrats take us for granted.'""

The lawmaker recalls how ""everybody got mad at me"" when she predicted in 2016 that Trump would win Michigan - which he did, along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

A major problem for Harris is that she doesn't seem to know how to make news. With less than 30 days to go, with many voters understandably believing they don't know her, or enough about her policies, since she took over for Joe Biden, the VP is stitching together parts of her stump speech and recycling the same anecdotes virtually verbatim.

A presidential candidate has to deliver a few new lines, a new proposal, something to break into the news cycle, which is currently being dominated by Trump.

So what's on this week's agenda? Kamala will sit down with Howard Stern (who is totally against his old pal Donald); ""The View,"" where the ladies despise Trump, and Stephen Colbert, who hosted fundraisers for Joe Biden in 2020 and this year.

For good measure, she's also spoken to Alex Cooper, whose podcast, ""Call Your Daddy,"" is about sex.

WHY VANCE EASILY BEAT WALZ IN DEBATE, SOFTENING HIS IMAGE IN THE PROCESS

I'll go out on a limb here and say these sessions are designed to be friendly - not unlike the conversation with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle, who kept agreeing with Harris and had just pronounced Trump a danger to democracy.

In fairness, Harris also sat for a ""60 Minutes"" interview, an invitation declined by Trump.

Look, there's nothing wrong with candidates showing their softer side with unorthodox outlets in our fragmented media universe. We've come a long way since critics scoffed at candidate Bill Clinton answering the ""boxers or briefs"" question on MTV, calling it unpresidential.

On ""Call Your Daddy,"" Harris was actually quite thoughtful in responding to Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying that her kids keep her humble and the VP doesn't have anyone to keep her humble.

Rather than jab at the Arkansas governor, which would have produced a cheap headline, she ruminated that families come in all shapes, bound by blood or love, that she is deeply involved with her stepchildren, and this isn't the 1950s anymore. They also discussed, uh, tampons.

Still, the party is getting nervous. ""Democratic operatives, including some of Kamala Harris' own staffers,"" says Politico, ""are growing increasingly concerned about her relatively light campaign schedule, which has her holding fewer events than Donald Trump and avoiding unscripted interactions with voters and the press almost entirely.""

Since the convention, the veep has spent more than a third of days on meeting and briefings, with no public events.

With early voting under way in more than half the states, Politico describes this ""a do-no-harm, risk-averse approach to the race.""

GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO WIN BACK PEACH STATE

Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan, who fervently doesn't want Trump to win, nonetheless is whacks Harris pretty hard:

""She hasn't fleshed out her political intent -- what she stands for, what she won't abide, what she means to establish, what she won't let happen.

What is her essential mission? Is it national 'repair,' is it to 'stabilize' an uncertain country, is it 'relaunch'?..

""She so far hasn't conveyed a sense of intellectual grasp. Her campaign has placed too many chips on the idea of the mood, the vibe, the picture.""

And vibes can only take you so far.

But the VP has certain duties, and spent two days visiting hurricane victims and relief workers in North Carolina and Georgia-which also happens to be good politics. She also met with Volodomyr Zelenskyy.

Harris attended a fundraiser over the weekend. Why bother? Her campaign has already had $400 million roll in. She's already outspending Trump 2-¬Ω to 1 on ads. She doesn't need any more money. What's more, Harris doesn't make news at these fundraisers, which in any event are off camera. A ground game is great, but it has to be married to a winning message.

Here's one more: Dan Pfeiffer, a former top Obama White House official, says on Message Box, his Substack column, that ""the media -- and Politico Playbook in particular -- are fuming over the Harris-Walz media strategy.""

Kamala ""must be on offense at all times -- say new things, be edgy enough to get attention, and dictate the terms, or the campaign could ""take on water...In this media world, there is a never-ending, insatiable appetite for content. Either serve lunch or become the menu...

""Dominating attention is Trump's political superpower...Even when he doesn't have a big moment, Trump speaks so outrageously that it shifts attention to his issues of choice.""

Now it's easy to snipe from the sidelines. For Harris to be neck and neck in the core battleground states means she's obviously done many things right. She had to overhaul the Biden operation and vet a running mate while the campaign was in full swing, like changing the tires on a speeding hot rod. She could still win.

One positive sign: The Harris camp took off the bubble wrap and allowed Tim Walz to appear on ""Fox News Sunday."" This was an attempt at damage control, since he lost the debate so badly to JD Vance.

While Shannon Bream repeatedly pressed the governor on late-term abortions, his Minnesota record and his history of falsehoods and exaggerations, Walz was far more forceful than he'd been in the CBS debate. He ducked certain questions, but an interview format is much better suited to him than friendly exchanges with his opponent.

Fox News host Sean Hannity reveals why Vice President Kamala Harris is now doing interviews before the election on ""Hannity.""

SEAN HANNITY: There is one huge reason, and only one reason, that Kamala is now going on and doing any interviews. Her internal poll numbers have got to be horrendous. Now, meanwhile, the publicly available poll numbers from the most credible pollsters in 2016 and 2020 and swing states we've been showing you (are) not great for Kamala Harris.

She is down in multiple polls in Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia. The race is even tighter in Virginia, where Kamala holds a slight lead. A brand new Yahoo News poll shows Trump surging nationwide.

Harris is desperately trying to make up ground. That's why she's finally doing friendly interviews, but lapping it up with Trump-hater Howard Stern, those hard-hitting interviewers on ""The View"" and Stephen Colbert, who's dull as dirt, or the ""Call Me Daddy"" podcast, while millions of Americans are suffering the devastating effects of Hurricane Helene and another major hurricane on the way, is not exactly the best look for the vice president when she and Joe Biden have been completely missing in action."
Georgia high court restores state's 6-week 'heartbeat' abortion law,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-high-court-restores-states-six-week-heartbeat-abortion-law,2024-10-07T22:07:07Z,"Abortion Survivors founder Melissa Ohden breaks down how Governor Tim Walz has changed Minnesota's abortion laws during an appearance on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.'

The Georgia Supreme Court on Monday stopped a lower court's ruling from last week that allowed abortions up to 22 weeks, as opposed to six weeks, as it considers an appeal filed by the state.

The order from the state Supreme Court came a week after Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled that abortions must be regulated the way they were before the ""Heartbeat Law"" went into effect, meaning abortions could be allowed until the 22-week mark.

The Associated Press reported that Justice John J. Ellington argued against McBurney's ruling, saying the case ""should not be predetermined in the State's favor before the appeal is even docketed.""

""The State should not be in the business of enforcing laws that have been determined to violate fundamental rights guaranteed to millions of individuals under the Georgia Constitution,"" Ellington wrote. ""The 'status quo' that should be maintained is the state of the law before the challenged laws took effect.""

GEORGIA JUDGE OVERTURNS STATE'S 6-WEEK 'HEARTBEAT' ABORTION LAW, CALLS IT 'UNCONSTITUTIONAL'

Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed the ""Heartbeat"" abortion bill, also known as the Living Infants Fairness and Equality Act, into law in 2019. The law made abortions after the six-week mark illegal.

McBurney called the law ""unconstitutional.""

""The authors of our Constitutions, state and federal, entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning,"" McBurney wrote in his final order last week. ""A review of our higher courts' interpretations of 'liberty' demonstrates that liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.

GEORGIA GOV BRIAN KEMP SIGNS CONTROVERSIAL 'HEARTBEAT' BILL INTO LAW

""That power is not, however, unlimited,"" the judge added. ""When a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then - and only then - may society intervene.""

McBurney continued by saying a law that prevents abortions after six weeks was inconsistent with those rights as well as the proper balance that a viability rule establishes between a woman's rights and society's interests in protecting and caring for unborn infants.

There were exceptions written into the law Kemp signed in 2019, including rape and incest as long as a police report was filed.

GEORGIA ABORTION LAW: A LOOK BACK AT WHAT HOLLYWOOD PRODUCTION COMPANIES HAVE SAID ABOUT FILMING IN THE STATE

The law signed by Kemp was blocked by a federal judge in October 2019 - before it went into effect - and ruled it violated the right to abortion as established by Roe v. Wade in 1973.

The Supreme Court then overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, clearing the way for Georgia's law on abortion to go into effect.

McBurney, in November 2022, ruled the law was ""unequivocally unconstitutional"" because it was enacted in 2019 when Roe v. Wade allowed abortions after six weeks.

But in October 2023, the Georgia Supreme Court rejected the ruling in a 6-1 decision, saying McBurney was wrong.

McBurney's ruling last week determined that the state, county, municipal and other local authorities are ""enjoined"" from seeking to enforce the six-week abortion law."

With less than a month to go until Election Day in November, a new poll indicates Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Trump among self-identified Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada, two crucial southwestern battleground states.

But Trump has made gains with younger male Hispanic voters compared to four years ago, according to a pair of Suffolk University/USA Today surveys released on Monday.

According to the poll, Harris leads Trump 57%-38% among Hispanic voters in Arizona, with Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver both under 1% support. Three percent of voters remain undecided. When asked how they voted in the 2020 election, 55% of those Hispanic voters said they voted for President Biden, while a third said they voted for Trump.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW

The vice president's lead over the former president is slightly smaller in neighboring Nevada, at 56%-40%. According to the survey, Independent American Party's Joel Skousen is just over 1%, Libertarian Chase Oliver is under 1%, and 2% are undecided. When asked how they voted in the 2020 election, 56% said they voted for Biden, while 33% said they voted for Trump.

""So far, Harris is falling short of the 24-26 point advantage that Joe Biden carried with Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada in 2020, according to the exit polls from those states,"" Suffolk University Political Research Center director David Paleologos highlighted. ""This Democratic shortfall is largely due to young Hispanic men.""

In both states, a majority of men under 50 years of age are choosing Trump over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 53%-40% among Hispanic men ages 18-34 in Nevada, and tops her 53%-39% among Hispanic men ages 35-49.

In Arizona, the Republican presidential nominee leads the Democratic Party standard-bearer 51%-39% among Hispanic men ages 18-34, and 57%-37% among Hispanic men ages 35-49.

TIGHTEST PRESIDENTIAL RACE SINCE 2000 - WITH ONE MONTH UNTIL ELECTION DAY

The economy and immigration were the top two issues on the minds of those questioned in the survey in both states.

Arizona and Nevada have referendums to protect access to abortion on the ballot in November - and the poll indicates majority support for the measures in both states.

Arizona and Nevada - along with Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin - had razor-thin margins in the 2020 presidential election that decided Biden's victory over Trump. And all seven states are likely to determine if Harris or Trump wins the 2024 election in the race for the White House.

The latest surveys in Arizona and Nevada - as well as the other five swing states - indicate margin-of-error races between Harris and Trump.

Supreme Court denies Biden administration appeal over federal emergency abortion requirement in Texas,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-denies-biden-administration-appeal-over-federal-emergency-abortion-requirement-texas,2024-10-07T15:06:02Z,"Abortion Survivors founder Melissa Ohden breaks down how Governor Tim Walz has changed Minnesota's abortion laws during an appearance on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.'

The U.S. Supreme Court decided not to hear oral arguments about whether a Texas state abortion ban is at odds with a federal emergency care law - permitting the ban in the Lone Star state to be upheld.

Supreme Court justices, for now, are keeping in place a lower court ruling that hospitals in Texas can deny terminating certain emergency pregnancies that violate state law, despite the federal requirement.

The Biden administration had requested that the justices overturn the lower court's ruling, contending that federal law requires hospitals to provide abortions in emergency situations. They referenced last term, when the Supreme Court permitted emergency room abortions to continue in Idaho while a lawsuit continues in federal court. Texas is asserting that its laws are distinct from Idaho's because Texas has a health exception for pregnant patients.

TEXAS SUPREME COURT REJECTS CHALLENGE TO STATE ABORTION BAN'S MEDICAL EXCEPTIONS

In Texas, the central legal issue is whether the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which mandates hospitals to treat emergency conditions, overrides state laws that prohibit abortion in emergencies. The case focuses on whether a state can stop an emergency physician from performing an abortion if it's necessary to stabilize a pregnant woman's health.

Previously, the Texas Supreme Court ruled in June against a group of women who suffered serious pregnancy complications and became the first in the country to testify in court about being denied abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022.

In a unanimous ruling, the court upheld the Texas law after the women filed a lawsuit in March 2023 seeking clarity on when exceptions to the abortion ban are permitted, arguing the law was confusing for doctors who might turn away patients over fears of repercussions.

The court ultimately ruled that the law's exceptions are broad enough and that doctors would be misinterpreting the law if they decided not to perform an abortion when the mother's life is in danger.

With the SCOTUS decision looming just a month before Election Day, abortion has become a major focus for the Harris-Walz campaign.

Harris echoes debunked claim about Georgia abortion limits causing woman's death despite pushback from doctors,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-echoes-debunked-claim-about-georgia-abortion-limits-causing-womans-death-despite-pushback-from-doctors,2024-10-07T10:33:58Z,"Two Georgia doctors, one a congressman and the other a state legislator, weigh in on the tragic case of Amber Nicole Thurman and media claims that state laws regulating abortion led to her death.

Vice President Kamala Harris repeated the left's claim Sunday that a woman in Georgia died due to delayed care as a result of the state's abortion limits, despite doctors previously denouncing the narrative as false.

During an interview on the raunchy and often-sexually explicit ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, host Alex Cooper asked Harris about the impact of the overturning of Roe v. Wade, blaming the death of Amber Nicole Thurman on the Supreme Court ruling and the state's abortion limits after she received a chemically induced abortion in 2022.

""So, Amber was a young mother of a six-year-old son. She was a medical assistant who was so excited because she was just getting on her feet to be independent. She got her own apartment in a gated community with a pool that her son could play in. She got accepted to nursing school,"" Harris told listeners.

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

""She was, as described by her family, so excited and so ambitious, and she had plans. Then she found out she was pregnant, and she didn't want to go through with her pregnancy. And she was living in Georgia, and she couldn't receive care there because she was past six weeks. And so she ended up going to another state, and...she couldn't get there on time. And because the other state had been so overwhelmed by all these women coming from all these southern states who couldn't get treatment in their own state, her window for her appointment had closed and instead of having a surgical procedure, she had medication and basically went back home and then had some complications and went to the hospital because she was bleeding.""

""And they delayed 20 hours before they treated her,"" Harris continued, suggesting that Georgia's laws prevented her from receiving lifesaving care.

Her remark comes after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

Harris and other members of the Democratic Party, including her running mate Tim Walz, have cited their deaths as evidence for the need to expand abortion access after the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.

""Here's the thing that's so messed up about this,"" Harris told Cooper. ""Some of these people will say whoa, but I do believe in exceptions, I believe that there should be an exception in terms of the life of the mother. You know what that means in practical terms? She's almost dead before you decide to give her care. What, so we're going to have public health policy that says a doctor, a medical professional, waits until you're at death's door before they gives you care. That's outrageous...where is the humanity?""

Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

OB-GYNs have criticized the Amber Thurman narrative as a misleading story that is being pushed by the media and Democrats.

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Charlotte Lozier Institute Vice President and Director of Medical Affairs Dr. Ingrid Skop called out the ""fearmongering"" and ""lies"" of the media that are hurting women who don't understand new abortion laws.

""I was not surprised to see this pro-abortion media try to point the blame at Georgia's pro-life laws, but, in fact, Georgia's laws allow doctors to intervene to save the life of the woman,"" Skop recently told Fox News Digital.

""I think the focus of the Democratic Party upon abortion as an issue is only because the American people do not understand the laws. Many times, women are hurt by abortions. It is not necessary for women to live their best life. And, of course, it's the fearmongering and lies that have led us to this place where we are today, where people even think there would be a reason to point at the law.""

U.S. Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., and state Rep. Mark Newton have also come out to say they don't believe Georgia laws had anything to do with Thurman's death, alleging it was caused by complications from abortion pills because doctors may have waited too long to intercede.

""We never deny a woman an abortion because it's going to harm her in some way. She will always be protected,"" McCormick said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital.

""You have every right to an abortion, even with that heartbeat law,"" he continued. ""So, let's make that very clear right now. When they say there's no exceptions, there's never any law in any state where there's no exceptions. That doesn't exist. That's simply not the way it works. The mother's life is always protected. With that said, it doesn't mean it's easy to get an abortion just because you have a complication or because something goes wrong.""

Dr. Christina Francis, CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), made similar comments on ""Fox & Friends"" last month.

""We are seeing the direct results of spreading lies and misinformation about these laws. Women are being harmed by that because they are delaying in seeking care. And so I think it's really important, no matter where somebody stands on the issue of abortion, we should all want women to have accurate information so that they seek care immediately if they're experiencing complications from things like these high-risk abortion drugs,"" Francis said.

ProPublica previously defended their story in a statement to Fox News Digital, saying, ""We stand by our reporting. The state's committee of more than 30 experts concluded that the deaths of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller were preventable, a newsworthy finding. Our ongoing reporting is illuminating the challenges doctors face in caring for patients with pregnancy complications in states with restricted access to abortion.""

The Harris campaign did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment."
SCOTUS kicks off historic term under scrutiny amid ethics code debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/scotus-kicks-off-historic-term-scrutiny-ethics-code-debate,2024-10-07T10:05:55Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The Supreme Court begins its new term today amid lingering internal strife over several recent rulings, with details of its thorny internal deliberations selectively leaked to certain media outlets.

All of this as the nine justices have come under increasing public scrutiny and criticism over perceived blatant partisanship on hot-button issues, ethics controversies and its own wilting reputation as a body remaining above politics.

""The Supreme Court, in a sense, is on the ballot this election, or at least the future of the Supreme Court,"" said Thomas Dupree, an appellate attorney and former top Justice Department official. ""So any time the court wades into political waters, it's going to be upsetting people, people who are on the side that loses. And they'll say the court shouldn't have got involved in the political fray. The court recognizes that it's not something that it wants to do, but in some cases, it has no choice.""

JUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON SAYS SHE WOULD SUPPORT AN 'ENFORCEABLE CODE' OF ETHICS FOR THE SUPREME COURT

Here are five questions confronting the Supreme Court:

Directly or indirectly, the nine members of the Supreme Court could again play an outsized role in determining who will be the next president.

There is no indication yet of another Bush v. Gore, the case in which the justices in 2000 ended ongoing litigation over the Florida election results, essentially handing the presidency to George W. Bush.

But the high court four years ago summarily refused to consider a series of lawsuits from Trump and other Republicans in five states President Biden won: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Former President Trump has again promised court challenges if he loses, and in a recent social media post, he said this election ""will be under the closest professional scrutiny"" and ""people that cheated will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law.""

Trump has proceeded with his campaign without the imminent cloud of legal jeopardy hanging over his head. His criminal sentencing in the New York business fraud conviction has been postponed until November at least.

And his two separate federal cases involving document mishandling and 2020 election interference have been deferred indefinitely. Those prosecutions could disappear entirely if Trump is elected and dismisses the Justice Department's special counsel.

All this after the Supreme Court in July ruled former presidents enjoy a substantial amount of immunity for ""official acts"" committed in office. Trump has used that ruling to demand both of his federal cases be dismissed.

Two justices took the unusual step of commenting publicly on its effect.

""You gave us a very hard question,"" Justice Neil Grouch exclusively told Fox News' ""America Reports"" co-anchor Sandra Smith. ""It's the first time in American history that one presidential administration was seeking to bring criminal charges against a predecessor. We had to go back and look at what sources were available to us.""

The Trump appointee said the Supreme Court ruled in Nixon v. Fitzgerald (1982) that civil claims cannot be brought against a president ""presumptively, in his official capacity, after he leaves office. Why? Because that would chill him from exercising the powers and duties of a president while he is president,"" Gorsuch said. ""He would be overwhelmed. His political enemies would simply bring suits against him forevermore.""

But Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who was on the losing side of the 6-3 opinion, has taken another approach.

""I was concerned about a system that appeared to provide immunity for one individual under one set of circumstances, when we have a criminal justice system that had ordinarily treated everyone the same,"" she told CBS News while promoting her new book, ""Lovely One: A Memoir.""

The Supreme Court has already gotten involved in several pre-election challenges: allowing some redistricting maps for congressional seats to go into effect and blocking others.

And the justices last month allowed Arizona to temporarily enforce its law requiring proof of citizenship on state voter registration forms.

'STOP PRETENDING': CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST WANTS DEMS BEHIND SCOTUS ETHICS RULES TO TAKE THEIR OWN MEDICINE

Five days before President Biden withdrew as a candidate for re-election, he made the Supreme Court a major political issue.

Word leaked from the White House on July 16 that Biden was seriously considering proposals to establish term limits for the justices, and an ethics code that would be enforceable under law, amid growing concerns they were not being held accountable.

The proposal was made public days later, including a congressional law limiting justices to 18-year terms despite the Constitution's guarantee of life tenure for all federal judges.

Biden framed it as an effort to address ""recent extreme opinions the Supreme Court has handed down [that] have undermined long-established civil rights principles and protections.""

Public calls for changes came after revelations of previously undisclosed free trips and gifts by the justices and lucrative book deals. Recent public polls support greater ethics reform.

Other federal judges are bound by an enforceable code of conduct, but the high court had long resisted being included.

Under Chief Justice John Roberts' leadership, he and his colleagues adopted a revised code last year, but it still lacks any enforcement mechanism, which critics say makes it feckless and ineffective.

Fox News previously reported that the court had been privately meeting for months on how to structure a new ethics code, one that would address public concerns over its behavior without abdicating what Roberts in particular had said was the court's independence on such matters from congressional oversight.

So, the justices have near-total discretion to decide whether to abide by the new code.

But growing and very public calls for more have come from some justices in recent days.

""A binding code of ethics is pretty standard for judges,"" said Jackson, ""and so I guess the question is: Is the Supreme Court any different? I guess I have not seen a persuasive reason as to why the court is different.""

""I am considering supporting it as a general matter,"" she said. ""I'm not going to get into commenting on particular policy proposals, but from my perspective, I don't have any problem with an enforceable code.""

And Justice Elena Kagan, perhaps the most vocal advocate for an enforcement provision, said this month, ""It seems like a good idea in terms of ensuring that people have confidence that we're doing exactly that. So, it seems like a salutary thing for the court.""

Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin, D-Ill., recently told the chief justice that the unilateral ethics code adopted by the justices falls short and needs an enforcement trigger.

In a closed-door meeting with federal judges attending a semiannual policymaking conference at the high court, Durbin was seated next to Roberts and made clear that failure by the justices to strengthen their judicial code of conduct could prompt congressional intervention.

Sources say Roberts made no commitments but thanked Durbin for the ongoing dialogue on the issue.

But Justice Neil Gorsuch urged caution, telling ""Fox News Sunday"" host Shannon Bream last month that he did not want to get into ""what is now a political issue during a presidential election year.""

He added about the role of an independent judiciary, ""It's there for the moments when the spotlight's on you, when the government's coming after you. And don't you want a ferociously independent judge and a jury of your peers to make those decisions? Isn't that your right as an American? And so I just say be careful.""

TOP DEM PLOTS TYING SCOTUS FUNDING TO 'ENFORCEABLE' ETHICS CODE AMID THOMAS, ALITO CONTROVERSIES

Following the contentious conclusion of the court's term in July, much was written about the ""Barrett Factor"" and the supposedly evolving jurisprudence of Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

She has become something of a recent lightning rod on the right and left over her occasional willingness to depart from her fellow conservatives, especially in cases involving the man who appointed her in 2020.

The 52-year-old Barrett took issue with some conclusions in the former president's historic immunity ruling and criticized parts of the majority ruling keeping him on the ballot in Colorado.

And breaking with conservatives, she separately authored pointed dissents on an obstruction case dealing with a 2021 U.S. Capitol riot suspect as well as an environmental case on federal rules to manage downwind air pollution.

Many court watchers on the left characterized her ""burgeoning"" legal reasoning as an ""independent streak,"" increasingly ready to ""skewer"" her right-leaning colleagues and a ""principled voice in the middle"" with a strong set of principles that present a ""different world view"" from other conservative justices.

But other legal observers say it is too early to dub Barrett the new deciding vote on hot-button cases who would resist walking lockstep with any ideological bloc.

""I don't think she's really trying to become the 'swing' justice or auditioning for that role. She's calling these cases as she sees them, and she's, generally speaking, a conservative justice,"" said Dupree. ""But what we've seen over the last term is Justice Barrett really coming into her own. She has the confidence to write separately and in some cases to break from the other conservatives when she sees the law a little differently. I suspect that will continue.""

And it remains clear Barrett's conservative credentials in most cases are solid: She has ruled to strike down Roe v. Wade, expand gun rights and scale back affirmative action in higher education.

SCOTUS GIVES PARTIAL VICTORY TO GOP TRYING TO ENFORCE PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP TO VOTE IN ARIZONA

We recently highlighted potential Supreme Court nominees in another Biden or Trump administration, based on what sources in both camps exclusively told Fox News.

Now the dynamic has shifted, with Vice President Harris heading the Democrat ticket.

Campaign sources say the whirlwind of taking over the nomination from her boss in recent weeks has left Harris, her legal advisers and campaign team little time to focus on the what-ifs of choosing justices or broader legal policy.

But it is a topic of particular interest to the former prosecutor, state attorney general and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Administration sources say that since taking office, she has been part of the inner circle cultivating an informal White House list of high court possibles. And Harris was deeply involved in spearheading Jackson's selection and confirmation in 2022, Biden's only Supreme Court nominee.

As a senator, her 2018 questioning at the confirmation hearings for now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh were especially contentious, and she later called for his impeachment after unproven allegations of past sexual misconduct.

Harris herself was under serious consideration for a Supreme Court seat during the Obama years, but sources say her percolating ambitions at the time were directed to elected office.

As for Trump, sources close to him tell Fox News he is expected to soon release his own preemptive list of candidates, as the Republican nominee did in 2016. That evolving list of two dozen or so names became a centerpiece of his successful campaign and later presidency.

This time, the former president will rely on those he has already named to the federal bench for the top names he would choose from to fill any Supreme Court vacancy.

VP HARRIS OUTLINES 'ORDERLY AND SECURE' IMMIGRATION PLAN, RIPS TRUMP IN FIRST BORDER STOP SINCE NOMINATION

The Constitution's framers viewed the judiciary as the ""least dangerous branch,"" but to hear some politicians and pundits on both the left and right, the Supreme Court is prepared to lead the country into imminent ruin.

Such attacks on the justices are nothing new, but the tenor of the criticism, especially in a presidential year, coupled with self-inflicted missteps on ethics and docket discretion, have combined to put its nine members on the defensive.

And the public seems to have noticed.

A Gallup poll this summer found 43% approve of how the Supreme Court handles its job, with 52% disapproval. That is a drop of 15 points since 2020 (58%-38%). In 2000, 62% approved of the institution.

Especially concerning the court are continued leaks to the media of its internal, mostly secretive, operations.

A draft opinion of the 2022 ""Dobbs"" abortion case, published two months before the final ruling that struck down nationwide access to the procedure, sent shock waves in Washington in a massive breach of protocol.

That was followed by selective leaks in the past year over how the court decided hot-button issues like affirmative action and election redistricting.

And in recent weeks, the New York Times received leaked internal memos from the chief justice over his leading role in the Trump immunity opinion.

Court sources say the leakers, who have never been publicly identified, have further eroded institutional camaraderie and trust among the justices, long seen as essential to doing their jobs. It has led to outside partisan finger-pointing.

Roberts, who will gavel in his 20th term next week as chief justice, has not publicly responded to the latest controversies or calls for ethics reform, declining repeated invitations from the Senate to testify.

It reflects his ""less is best"" approach to explaining and promoting his own court's resolution of thorny legal and political issues.

In September 2022, after the abortion ruling was issued, he said, ""Simply because people disagree with opinions is not a basis for questioning the legitimacy of the court. I think just moving forward from things that were unfortunate is the best way to respond,"" he said.

And he has carefully glided over his role to force internal change and to defend his court's reputation all while being unable to stop the continuing leaks over their deliberations.

""It seems like at times they're [leakers] motivated to be able to potentially lead to mistrust in the [judicial] branch, attacks on what the branch is doing,"" said Jennifer Mascott, a former law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas and then-Judge Kavanaugh and now a Catholic University law professor.

Added Dupree, ""You can't have a court deliberate and perform its constitutionally assigned function if it can't be ensured of the sanctity of its deliberations, if it thinks that anything that one justice says to another colleague or any memo that they write internally is going to appear on the front page of the newspapers the next day. That's a very, very worrisome trend. It may be the new normal.""

After a three-month recess, the justices met together for the first time this week to reset their docket and discuss appeals that have been filed over the summer.

Sources say the chief justice, who leads the closed-door meeting, had sent a memo to his colleagues indicating some of the controversies surrounding the court, like the leaks and ethics reform, would be privately and candidly discussed.

The Supreme Court in its new term will confront issues like gun rights and transgender care for minors, with pending appeals over the Affordable Care Act, religious freedom, immigration and abortion access.

It is a unique, fast-moving time of change and challenge at an institution used to being slow and deliberate.

""I did learn early on that when you are holding the reins of leadership, you should be careful not to tug on them too much,"" said Roberts in 2016. ""You will find out they aren't connected to anything."""
Battleground Senate candidate unloads on 'radical' Dem opponent for disparaging Trump voters,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/battleground-senate-candidate-unloads-radical-dem-opponent,2024-10-07T08:07:07Z,"PHOENIX, AZ - Arizona GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake is blasting her Democratic opponent Rep. Ruben Gallego and labeling him as ""radical as they come"" after a resurfaced interview of him disparaging Trump voters.

""Isn't that terrible?"" Lake said in response to Fox News Digital reporting of a comment made by Gallego in 2016 where he said that Trump voters were ""dumb"" and the ""worst people in the world.""

""He's been lying about who he is,"" Lake added. ""He's trying to paint himself as a moderate, which is it's laughable if it wasn't so dangerous.""

Lake told Fox News Digital that Gallego ""bullied"" moderate Sen. Kyrsten Sinema out of the race ""because she wasn't liberal enough.""

""Now he is doing all these ads trying to say he's a moderate when, in fact, he's voted to spend our federal dollars, our tax dollars, our money, supporting sanctuary cities and states. He's voted against securing our border every step of the way. He's for an open border America. He's voted to defund the police. He actually co-sponsored the George Floyd legislation, which would have defunded the police nationwide.""

Lake went on to tell Fox News Digital that Gallego has ""never batted an eyelash"" when it comes to spending bills and has not been strong enough defending women's sports.

""He wants biological men to participate in women's athletics.,"" Lake said. ""That means it's an end for girls sports. Anybody out there who played sports? I did for a little bit. It's an end. I mean, if you have to compete with biological men, what's the purpose of having girls sports?""

ENIGMATIC VOTER GROUP COULD SPLIT TICKET FOR TRUMP, DEM SENATE CANDIDATE IN ARIZONA

Lake added, ""It's absolutely crazy and he's as radical as they come.""

Gallego and Lake will both be attempting to sway independent voters, especially in Maricopa County, the largest county in the state, where independents make up a third of the electorate. Lake told Fox News Digital she is optimistic she can win votes from Arizonans who aren't Republicans.

""I do believe that independents are with me, I think we're doing pretty well, our polling is showing that we're building on the independent vote,"" Lake said. ""And I think a lot of Democrats, while he [Gallego] hates Trump voters and he hates Republicans. I don't hate Democrats. I actually believe that disaffected Democrats are going to help us turn the corner.""

""They're realizing, looking at Kamala Harris and Ruben Gallego, and they're saying, wait a minute, this isn't the Democrat Party that I signed up for years ago, the old Democrat Party used to care about the working class. The old Democrat Party wanted a strong economy for everybody. This Democrat Party is a bunch of globalists, and they are for, they want to spend more money helping people coming here illegally than they do people who are American citizens.""

While the Real Clear Politics average of polls shows Gallego leading Lake by about 7 points, Lake told Fox News Digital she is confident the race is much closer and says her internal polling shows that she is within the margin of error.

""We have to go into it acting like we're ten down, but we're not ten down,"" Lake said. ""This is a very tight race. I'm proud of that, considering, as I said, he spent 75 million. He's been outspending us massively and the fact that this is such a tight race is incredible. Chuck Schumer is in a panic about Arizona. He's dumping 5 million bucks a week into Arizona.""

Lake told Fox News Digital that Democrats are in a ""tailspin"" in Arizona because their efforts to make the election about abortion have not been fruitful because most voters are focused on other issues like the economy.

Lake also criticized Gallego over his record before he entered politics, including his involvement with a bank that worked with illegal immigrants, a harassment claim against him by a 20-year-old intern while he worked at city hall, and his time working for an ambulance company that was being investigated for fraud.

""The people of Arizona know me and they trust me and I love the people of the state, Lake said. ""I want to represent all of them, including people who maybe don't even vote for me. If you choose not to vote for me, I hope I can earn your vote, but I still want to represent you and I want to do a great job for you in Washington, D.C. We need decent, honest people back to D.C. and Ruben Gallego was not honest before he got into politics.""

Former first lady Melania Trump spoke with former President Trump before writing about her support for abortion in her self-titled memoir, she told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on Sunday.

""He knew my position since the day we met, and I believe in individual freedom. I want to decide what I want to do with my body. I don't want government in my personal business,"" she said in an exclusive ""Sunday Morning Futures"" interview.

""I think it's very important and, as I said in the book, and it's very well explained in the chapter, 'What does my body, my choice mean?' because timing really matters and also the restrictions, so I encourage people to read it because we live in a world that everybody should have individual freedom,"" she continued.

Trump is promoting her upcoming ""Melania"" memoir, which disclosed a shocking truth to many of her husband's supporters regarding her stance on the controversial issue, calling abortion a ""fundamental right of individual liberty,"" according to a report from last Wednesday.

MELANIA TRUMP'S ABORTION VIEWS IN NEW MEMOIR SPUR OUTRAGE FROM PRO-LIFERS: 'SHE IS WRONG'

She reportedly wrote, ""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government.""

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes. Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

MELANIA TRUMP'S PRO-CHOICE STAND ISN'T THAT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER REPUBLICAN FIRST LADIES

The revelation ignited a flurry of responses across the political spectrum, with pro-lifers slamming her for the view they argue fails to align with the Catholic faith, to which she subscribes.

Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America advocacy group, called the view ""anti-feminist"" and the ""opposite of empowerment.""

Others, including Lila Rose and president of pro-life advocacy group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Marjorie Dannenfelser, criticized the stance as well.

On the left, ""The View"" co-host Joy Behar accused Trump of lying about being pro-choice, calling her stance a ""big scam.""

Others have posed the question: why make the revelation just before the election?

""That was not written in the last week or the last month,"" Trump told Bartiromo.

""That book was written months before, and it was in print months before, so that was my belief, and it is my belief, and I wanted to put it in the book because I want to be authentic. I want people to read the book because they could find out a lot of things that were never discussed. I'm very selective in what I do, and when I'm doing interviews or not or where I am or not, and this is my story. This is my perspective and the truth, and there is a lot of misinformation about me and falsehoods written about me, so that book, 'Melania,' will bring out my truth.""

Walz tries to downplay laws he signed granting benefits to illegals in Minnesota: 'Not the VP's position',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/walz-tries-downplay-laws-he-signed-granting-benefits-illegals-minnesota-not-vps-position,2024-10-06T16:46:59Z,"Vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz discusses Israel's right to defend itself and Kamala Harris' economic policies on 'Fox News Sunday.'

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz sought to distance Vice President Kamala Harris from laws he himself signed that granted benefits to illegal immigrants in Minnesota on Sunday.

Walz made the comments during a wide-ranging interview on Fox News Sunday with host Shannon Bream. Bream pressed Walz on his military history and his record on abortion in addition to questioning him on legislation he signed in Minnesota that allows illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses and receive state-funded tuition assistance, among other benefits.

""Are those not magnets to draw people here, many times on dangerous journeys for themselves? And why should your taxpayers in Minnesota or across the states pay for those programs?"" Bream asked.

""Well, that's not the vice president's position,"" Walz admitted, before going on to defend his leadership in Minnesota.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN PUSHES BACK ON 'SNL' SKIT ABOUT ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS: 'DISGUSTING'

""But I will say this, Minnesota ranks as a top five business state. We rank as a top three state for children living, and we're a top state for health care access,"" he said. ""Look, the Vice President has made it clear that she has policies that make a difference. Her border policies are the most strongest, the fairest we've seen.""

Bream also challenged Walz to clarify his ticket's position on abortion access. The exchange ultimately led to Walz flatly accusing former President Trump of lying when he said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law.

Bream began by pointing out that Minnesota's abortion law imposes no limits on abortion procedures through all nine months of pregnancy, something that goes far beyond the provisions of Roe v. Wade, which Harris and Walz said they support.

""You signed the bill that makes it legal through all nine months. Is that a position you think Democrats should advocate for nationally?"" Bream asked.

""The vice president and I have been clear the restoration of Roe versus Wade is what we're asking for,"" Walz responded.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN PLEDGES MORE MEDIA INTERVIEWS AS VOTERS STILL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HER POLICIES

""But that law goes far beyond Roe v. Wade,"" Bream pressed. ""Let's agree, in what you signed there's not a single limit through nine months of pregnancy. Roe had a trimester framework that did have limits through the pregnancy. The Minnesota law does not have that.""

""This doesn't change anything. It puts the decision back on to the woman, to the physicians,"" Walz responded. ""And we know that this is simply something to be brought up - to be very clear Donald Trump's asking for a nationwide abortion ban.""

""[Trump] has said repeatedly that he will not sign a national abortion ban. Are you calling that a flat out lie?"" Bream asked.

""Yes, of course, and Senator Vance has in the past said so too,"" Walz said.

Bream concluded the interview by giving Walz a chance to respond to criticism of his frequent ""misstatements,"" such as his claims about military service and his assertion that he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square massacre.

""Look, I speak passionately. I had an entire career, decades before I was in public office. They know, and I'm very proud of my 24 years in service and my record. I have never disparaged someone else in this, but I know that's not what Donald Trump does. They disparage everyone,"" Walz said.

A recent poll by the Pew Research Center found that former President Trump is winning the Catholic and Protestant vote.

Conducted from Aug. 26-Sept. 2, the survey found that 52% of Catholics and 61% of Protestants support Trump for president, while 47% of Catholics and 37% of Protestants back Kamala Harris.

As more Americans become aware of how radical Harris is, it's clear to see why Trump has won this support from religious voters.

Harris may have been the surprise replacement for Joe Biden, but her position on issues is far from unknown. She claims to be a future-oriented, change candidate eager to ""turn the page and chart a new way forward.""

DEMOCRATS DRIVING RELIGIOUS VOTE AWAY FROM PARTY AS TRUMP COURTS CATHOLICS: 'ANTI-CHRISTIAN' PARTY

However, Harris is a professional politician with a radical policy record that she can't defend among the religious electorate.

Consider that in 2014, in the case of Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, Attorney General Harris filed an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court and was joined by 13 states and the District of Columbia.

Harris called on the court to force Hobby Lobby to violate its religious beliefs and cover the cost of contraception for its employees. (The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby, protecting the family-owned arts and crafts chain to operate its business in line with its religious beliefs and values.)

5 REASONS KAMALA HARRIS IS SNUBBING THE AL SMITH DINNER, CATHOLICS, AND TRADITION

Also, as attorney general of California, Harris was a vocal advocate and ""proud"" co-sponsor of the Reproductive FACT Act, which Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law in 2015. The law required medically licensed pro-life pregnancy centers to display signs advertising low-cost or free abortions available in California.

The law ""was very clear that it was targeting pro-life viewpoints,"" said Denise Harle, who served as senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom. In a 2018 decision, the Supreme Court agreed with this view and struck down the law.

Writing for the majority in National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra (initially named NIFLA vs. Kamala Harris), Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the majority opinion, ""the FACT Act unduly burdens protected speech.""

As a U.S. senator of California from 2017-2021, Harris introduced and was the lead sponsor of the Do No Harm Act, which would have ended religious exemptions for certain government mandates, such as rules requiring insurance coverage of specific medical procedures. As a legal expert at First Liberty wrote at the time, ""This country was founded on religious liberty. The Do No Harm Act strikes at the heart of that freedom.""

Additionally, the Do No Harm Act would have undermined the bipartisan Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a 1993 landmark law that protects the rights of people of faith to worship freely and in accordance with their conscience.

Further, Sen. Harris was also an original co-sponsor of the ""Equality Act,"" a bill that would have further unraveled the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and enabled the government to prosecute faith-based institutions for refusing to hire employees who openly oppose their religious teachings. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops was clear in denouncing the proposed legislation and said the Equality Act would ""run roughshod over religious liberty.""

Additionally, Sen. Harris questioned three judicial nominees on their affiliation with the Knights of Columbus, suggesting that involvement with the Catholic fraternal organization disqualifies a nominee for potential bias.

When I served as President Trump's ambassador to the Holy See, I witnessed the importance of having a president who stands up for religious freedom. President Trump has a proven track record for promoting and protecting religious freedom at home and abroad. Kamala Harris has repeatedly advanced an anti-faith agenda."
Here's what two undecided Wisconsin voters are holding out for in the 2024 election,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/heres-what-2-undecided-wisconsin-voters-holding-out-2024-election,2024-10-06T08:21:55Z,"WISCONSIN -- With only one month until the presidential election, very few voters are still uncertain about their choice, but in a battleground state like Wisconsin that has flipped in the past two elections, those undecided voters could make the difference.

Estimates of still-undecided voters in Wisconsin are in the low single digits, with the latest Marquette Law School poll reporting that just 4% identified themselves as such.

Fox News Digital spoke with two such voters, who laid out why they are still holding out and what they need to seal the deal.

TRUMP ATTORNEYS ARGUE JACK SMITH'S OBSTRUCTION CHARGES BE DISMISSED, CITING SUPREME COURT'S 'FISCHER' DECISION

""I got to make up my mind when I fill out the paper,"" said 86-year-old Edgar Schiekiera of Waukesha, Wisconsin.

""I'm going to throw a dart,"" he laughed.

Schiekiera is an immigrant from Germany who noted that he grew up during the Second World War. For him, former President Trump's comments on foreign policy have been troubling, enough so to make him hesitate to support Trump for a third time.

""I voted for Trump the first year. I voted for him the second year. I don't -- this time, I don't know,"" he said.

""I'm from Germany, and things that he's said about [the] NATO Alliance -- he wants quit it, and he doesn't know what to do,"" he said of what's making him unsure of Trump. ""A real danger lives overseas.""

Schiekiera was also concerned about what Trump has said with relation to conflicts around the world, particularly involving Ukraine and Iran. ""He can stop the war?"" he asked, in reference to Trump's own claims about the war between Ukraine and Russia. ""He cannot stop the war.""

However, he added that ""Biden or Kamala Harris -- she doesn't know what's going to happen,"" either. According to him, he isn't confident that either of the top candidates can effectively lead on the world stage in the current geopolitical climate.

There are other issues that Schiekiera is taking into consideration as well, such as abortion. ""I got my own ideas,"" he said.

He noted that Trump has appeared to change positions on ""issues nationally [and] worldwide.""

""Trump's gone one way, and then he [goes] to another way. He's undecided what he's going to do, really.""

DEMOCRATS WORRY ABOUT HARRIS' CAUTIOUS MEDIA APPROACH IN TIGHT 2024 RACE: 'VOTERS DESERVE BETTER'

In contrast, Keon Pierce of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, isn't considering Trump at all. But he is not sold on Vice President Kamala Harris either.

""I'm leaning Kamala, but I have to see. She's got to convince me a little more,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""I'm waiting to see who has the best -- the best protection for different groups of people. You know, the best rights and best laws that can help all groups of people.""

Pierce explained that he wanted to be sure the president would ""help all people. Asian people, Indian people, Black people, everybody.""

When Fox News Digital noted that Harris is both Black and Indian, he responded, ""We had a Black president before, and it didn't necessarily translate to helping the people,"" in reference to former President Barack Obama.

TRUMP CAN WIN ON THESE THREE KEY ISSUES, MICHIGAN VOTERS TELL FOX

He said he was ""open to"" Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who will appear on the Wisconsin ballot after a court challenge to see her ousted was denied.

""It's possible that I wouldn't vote as well,"" he added.

As for the Milwaukee area, Pierce explained, ""It's bad here. It's really segregated here, and opportunities are limited.""

He said he needs to hear more about what will be done to bring more ""opportunities, jobs, education, [and] a better school system in the inner city.""

In the latest Marquette Law School poll, Harris beat Trump among Wisconsin registered voters, 49% to 44%, with third-party options included.

For the poll, 882 registered voters were interviewed between Sept. 18 and 26. It had a margin of error of +/-4.4 percentage points."

Vice President Kamala Harris recently recorded an interview with the raunchy and often-sexually explicit ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, though she continues to play coy with traditional media outlets.

The Harris campaign confirmed that Harris sat down for the interview this past Tuesday where she focused on talking to audiences about abortion and reproductive rights issues. The interview is set to air sometime next week.

Harris' ""Call Her Daddy"" interview comes as she has been criticized for not doing enough traditional news interviews since the start of her presidential campaign in late July.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS IN 'DANGER ZONE' AS AMERICANS WORRY ABOUT COUNTRY'S DIRECTION, SAYS CNN DATA GURU

So far, Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., have done a combined 24 interviews, a number which pales in comparison to the Trump-Vance ticket's combined 63 interviews in that same time frame.

Harris still has not held a formal press conference since replacing President Biden as the Democratic nominee, while Trump has held five since the beginning of September.

The ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, put on by SiriusXM, is hosted by Alex Cooper and reaches a massive, predominantly female audience. According to Spotify, it is ""the most-listened to podcast by women.""

The podcast is well-known for hosting explicit discussions about sex and women's health advice. Axios reported that the vice president's appearance on the podcast ""highlights her campaign's emphasis on appealing to women voters and younger audiences."" According to CNN, the podcast generally has ""a reputation for raunchy sex and relationship conversations.""

Former President Trump and his running mate JD Vance have done multiple interviews on major podcasts shows in recent months, trying to bring their messaging to younger audiences.

Trump recently sat down with podcaster and influencer Theo Von on his podcast and did a livestream with popular influencer Adin Ross that was conducted at the former president's Mar-a-Lago residence. Vance did an interview on the Full Send Podcast in August.

That Harris would opt for a sit-down with the sex-positive show generated some chatter on social media.

Pro-Trump influencer Collin Rugg shared a clip from the show in which Cooper interviewed a porn star. He commented, ""The episode was filmed on Tuesday, in the middle of Hurricane Helene recovery efforts. The conversation reportedly focuses on reproductive rights, abortion & other women issues. Here is a previous in depth conversation Cooper had with a p*rn star.""

Ohio Sen. JD Vance, as anticipated, easily won the vice-presidential debate Tuesday, October 1, on demeanor, facts, and analysis. But in fairness to a sometimes herky-jerky and nervous Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, he had the harder task of defending the temporary pseudo-conservative make-over of Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.

His additional burdens were her co-culpability for the last three-and-a-half-years of the Biden disaster, and her unwillingness to implement her supposedly ""change"" agenda in the last months of her vice-presidential tenure.

The CBS News moderators, Nora O'Donnell, and, especially, Margaret Brennan, also as expected, ganged up on Vance. They had learned nothing, and forgotten nothing from the last disastrous, and biased debate moderators.

EMHOFF DENIES REPORT HE SLAPPED EX-GIRLFRIEND OUTSIDE RITZY OVERSEAS MOVIE EVENT

The two moderators shamelessly broke their own rules by fact-checking (wrongly and solely) Vance. They ignored questions of the administration's tardy responses to Hurricane Helene, the Ukraine war, the recent Trump assassination attempts, or crime, while only briefly touching on Iran and a Middle East on the brink of total war. Instead, they concentrated, as also expected, on climate change, abortion, healthcare and childcare.

All were issues they thought might more easily embarrass Vance. And, of course, as also expected, the two ended the debate pressing Vance on January 6. And yet Vance again parried easily and won decisively. In doing so, he dispelled the smear that he was somehow ""mean,"" when, in fact, he proved calm and magnanimous as he methodically dissected Walz.

The nation perhaps learned that a confident Trump selected him to articulate his MAGA positions, and perhaps in a manner superior to Trump's own.

In contrast, an insecure Harris picked Walz. The vice president was assuming that he would not upstage her and perhaps, by his limitations, would make her look competent in comparison.

The debate will give some momentum to Trump-Vance in the last month of the campaign.

It follows the lethargic Biden-Harris reaction to Hurricane Helene, whose toll in human life and property had been initially and vastly ignored by the media.

It follows the growing specter of a theater-wide Middle East war, as a solitary Israel faces off against Iran and its appendages (all empowered after 2020 by Biden-Harris).

It follows the chaos of a longshoremen's strike intended to shut down the entire country. And it follows Harris's continued inability to survive even serial soft-ball interviews without her memorized and banal answers.

As a result, the slow, steady hemorrhaging of support for Harris-Walz will likely still continue in the last month of the election."

Fox News Digital spoke with residents just south of Houston, Texas this week about the economy and who they trust more between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to boost the economy as president.

After shopping at Costco, local residents expressed frustration with current overall costs and the economy as a whole, both on and off camera.

""All the prices have gone up,"" Melissa told Fox News Digital.

""No, it's not doing well at all,"" said another resident, originally from Egypt.

Ralph said the economy has resulted in increased costs for his family, stating, ""I think inflation is out of control. Housing and interest rates are out of control. Grocery trips have doubled. And a good grocery trip used to be like 150-125. Now an average grocery trip is now 250-300.""

VOTERS IN CRITICAL MICHIGAN COUNTY FOCUSED ON ECONOMY, CANDIDATE CHARACTER AS 2024 RACE TIGHTENS

Locals also shared who they feel will best handle the economy as president.

""When Trump was in office, you know, things were doing well,"" said Mark.

Ralph said he ""definitely"" trusts Trump more to tackle the economy.

""I don't think Kamala even knows what's going on. I think she's a puppet,"" he said. ""He's got a proven track record, hoping he gets back in and rescuing this Harris economy.""

Another resident also said she trusts the former president more: ""Trump, because he's the only businessman that's capable of running our country.""

Mark cited Trump's time in office compared to the current Biden-Harris administration as a reason for trusting the former president.

""Trump because of what he did the last time, who was in office and what the current administration, what's happened with the current administration over the past four years,"" he said. ""If it's not broke, don't fix it. You know, they tried to fix it. So here we are today.""

No Republican presidential candidate has lost Texas since 1976, but the state has become increasingly competitive in recent elections. Trump won it by less than six points in 2020, a sharp contrast from just 12 years ago when Mitt Romney carried the state by nearly 16.

The economy remains the top issue on the minds of American voters as they prepare to cast their ballot in the presidential election.

A September Fox News national poll also in the field entirely post-debate spotlighted that 39% of voters surveyed said the economy was their most pressing issue, far ahead of immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues tested were in single digits.

While the nation's economic recovery from the pandemic continues, inflation remains a leading concern among Americans.

The former president's up 13 points over the vice president in a post-debate survey from the New York Times and Siena College, and favored by 7 points in an ABC News Ipsos survey also conducted after the showdown.

But Trump's advantage over Harris on the economy stands at only 5 points in the Fox News poll, and just 2 points in the AP/NORC survey.

Harris has touted what she calls the ""opportunity economy"" and said her administration will crack down on price gouging and also lower taxes for middle-class Americans. Trump has pointed to economic performance under his administration as successful and that a return to office would bring back those days.

The Harris ticket was buoyed on Friday by a strong September jobs report. Also, striking U.S. dockworkers returned to work Friday after reaching a tentative agreement with employers on an improved wage offer."
"Trump can win on these 3 key issues, Michigan voters tell Fox",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-can-win-three-key-issues-michigan-voters-tell-fox,2024-10-04T17:40:00Z,"Trump supporters in Saginaw, Michigan, told Fox News Digital the top issues Trump should hit as he seeks to win the critical swing state.

Michigan voters attending former President Donald Trump's Saginaw rally Thursday told Fox News Digital that the former president needs to focus on the economy to win the critical swing state, particularly job creation and curbing inflation.

""Opening up the pipelines to get the jobs back,"" one voter who attended Trump's rally on the campus of Saginaw Valley State University said when asked which issue the former president needs to focus on to win Michigan.

The comments come as Trump made yet another visit to the crucial swing state of Michigan, a state that could play a decisive role in determining who wins November's election. It also marked the second time the former president visited mid-Michigan in just a few weeks, a blue collar area of the state where the campaign believes it can make inroads with voters in what promises to be a close race.

TRUMP'S 2ND TERM FOREIGN POLICY LIKELY TO FOCUS ON 'STRENGTH' AND 'DETERRENCE': EXPERT

Vice President Kamala Harris is set to visit the same area of the state Friday, signifying the importance of Michigan as the clock nears the end of a dramatic election season.

Polls show Michigan as a toss up as of Wednesday, with the Real Clear Politics Polling average giving Harris a thin lead of just 0.7 points in the state. However, polls also showed Trump trailing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Biden in Michigan by 5.3 and 5.7 points respectively, numbers that turned out much more favorable to Trump on election day.

Trump narrowly won Michigan in 2016 before dropping it to Biden in another close race in 2020, but voters in mid-Michigan believe Trump's focus on the economy should help put him over the top in 2024.

VOTERS IN CRITICAL MICHIGAN COUNTY FOCUSED ON ECONOMY, CANDIDATE CHARACTER AS 2024 RACE TIGHTENS

""Bring inflation down and safety and security in the state of Michigan,"" one voter told Fox News Digital.

""Illegal border crossings and the economy,"" another voter said. ""Keeping jobs in America, lowering inflation.""

However, other voters signaled that Trump could win on a range of issues, including national security and reducing crime in inner cities.

""Our national security does come first. But if the people at home, if they can't make ends meet, they're living in misery, that's just as important,"" a voter told Fox News Digital. ""Being truthful to the American people, which he has been.""

""Focusing on the inner cities. Putting together ways to decrease the violence,"" another voter said.

Meanwhile, one voter who said she was at the rally to support Trump said that the former president could lead the charge in helping Michigan residents see the issue of abortion differently.

Melania Trump's pro-choice stand isn't that different from other Republican first ladies,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/melania-trumps-pro-choice-stand-isnt-different-from-other-republican-first-ladies,2024-10-04T17:11:57Z,"Former first lady Melania Trump opens up about her life before, during and after the White House in a sit-down interview on 'Fox & Friends.'

Melania Trump is not the only first lady to express pro-choice views. She joins several former Republican first ladies who have shared similar perspectives, often in their memoirs, despite this stance historically contrasting with the GOP platform.

Other spouses of Republican presidents, such as Pat Nixon, Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Laura Bush, have been recorded either during or after their husbands' tenure in office expressing pro-choice views.

""I feel very strongly that it was the best thing in the world when the Supreme Court voted to legalize abortion and, in my words, bring it out of the backwoods and put it in the hospital where it belongs,"" Betty Ford said in a CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" interview in 1975, two years after Roe v. Wade was handed down.

MELANIA TRUMP'S ABORTION VIEWS IN NEW MEMOIR SPUR OUTRAGE FROM PRO-LIFERS: 'SHE IS WRONG'

Following Ford's comments on premarital sex, marijuana and abortion during the CBS interview, then-President Gerald Ford reportedly joked that she had cost him votes.

As a more conservative first lady, Nancy Reagan avoided taking a public stance against abortion that would put her at odds with former President Ronald Reagan. However, she later revealed her personal position on the issue.

""I'm against abortion, I don't believe in abortion,"" Reagan said at George Washington University in 1994, five years after her husband left the Oval Office. ""On the other hand, I believe in a woman's choice. So, it puts me somewhere in the middle, but I don't know what you'd call that.""

Barbara Bush, former President George H. W. Bush's wife, was more reserved in her public statements about abortion and was at odds with her husband's anti-abortion stance. While she was not as outspoken as Betty Ford, she wrote in her 1994 memoir, ""I hate abortions, but I just could not make that choice for someone else.""

Former first lady Laura Bush, wife of former President George W. Bush and daughter-in-law to Barbara Bush, also differed with the former Presidents Bush on abortion.

""I think it's important that it remain legal, because I think it's important for people for medical reasons and other reasons,"" she said in an interview with Larry King Live in 2010.

Pat Nixon, then-President Richard Nixon's wife, told reporters during a 1972 press conference - as Roe v. Wade arguments were being considered by the Supreme Court - that she supported the right to choose an abortion, but opposed ""wholesale abortion on demand.""

Trump, wife of Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump, wrote the memoir entitled ""Melania"" that is scheduled to come out on Oct. 8, per the Amazon release date. In the book, according to a preview by The Guardian, she expresses a viewpoint closely aligned with that of former first ladies before her.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,"" Trump reportedly wrote.

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.

""Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

The former first lady drew criticism from pro-life advocates on social media after the excerpts were published just a month away from Election Day. This year, the Republican Party's official platform also softened its language on abortion, as former President Trump also said he would not support a federal abortion ban."

Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger Dave McCormick squared off in their first debate Thursday evening, less than five weeks ahead of what is expected to be one of the most closely watched races this election cycle.

Casey and McCormick took the debate stage Thursday at 8 p.m. in Harrisburg, where the two traded barbs over issues such as the economy and inflation, immigration, abortion. The race, which is rated as ""leans Democrat"" by the Cook Political Report, is expected to be one of the tightest Senate races across the country, with Casey himself acknowledging earlier this year that it will be a ""close, tough race.""

Casey has long been a Pennsylvania Democratic stalwart, first winning his election to the U.S. Senate in 2007. The Casey name also has deep roots in the state, with Bob Casey Sr., the senator's father, serving as the Keystone State's governor from 1987 to 1995, following years of serving in various other elected roles.

McCormick is an Army combat veteran and former CEO of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, who served as the Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security as well as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs under former President George W. Bush's administration. Former President Donald Trump endorsed McCormick in April, lauding him as a ""a good man"" who ""wants to run a good ship.""

MCCORMICK SEIZES ON PENNSYLVANIA SENATE RACE GAP, LAYING BORDER BLAME ON CASEY

The Senate race comes as the federal election spotlights Pennsylvania once again as a key battleground state that will likely determine the outcome of the presidential election. Former President Donald Trump narrowly won the state in his successful 2016 election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while President Biden declared victory in the Keystone State in the 2020 election.

As the pair squared off for the first of two debates ahead of Nov. 5, Fox News Digital compiled the top five moments of Thursday's event.

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

Casey and McCormick both weighed in on the federal election, including Casey lauding Harris following his staunch support of Biden before the president ultimately dropped out of the 2024 race as concerns about his mental acuity and age mounted over the summer.

""From your perspective, who is the better candidate for Pennsylvania? Biden or Harris?"" moderator and ABC27 anchor Dennis Owens asked Casey.

""I think Vice President Harris, who's running a strong campaign, I think she'll carry Pennsylvania. It's going to be very close, just like the Senate race will be close. But she's running a strong campaign. But the people of our state have to make two basic decisions - in addition to other statewide races. They have decided in the presidential race, and they have to decide our race, and this race is very clear,"" Casey responded.

When asked whether he believes Biden or Harris would be a better president for Pennsylvania voters, Casey brushed off delivering a direct answer.

""Oh, I don't know, Dennis. I mean, we'll never know the answer to that, but the voters are gonna make a decision,"" he said.

McCormick, on the other hand, was asked if he could offer one example where he does not agree with Trump after slamming Casey during the debate for overwhelmingly voting with Biden over the last three and a half years.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS, TRUMP LOCKED IN TIGHT RACE IN BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

""[Trump] recently said that he wanted to get rid of the ban on SALT taxes, which Sen. Casey supported, too"" McCormick responded. ""Listen, that's a that's a tax break for millionaires in New York and California at the expense of PA taxpayers. So I wouldn't support that.""

""But listen, Senator Casey stood next to Joe Biden when he could hardly finish a sentence. We saw this on the debate stage, he said 'he's ready to go,'"" McCormick continued, referring to Casey's support of Biden remaining in the presidential race until Biden ultimately dropped out. ""Then Sen. Casey said, 'Kamala Harris is great. You're going to love her when you get to know her.' This is a woman who, in the last few years, says she wanted to ban fracking, legalize illegal immigration, give them federal benefits, take away our guns, defund the police. This is her position, so she's flip-flopped on everything, and Bob Casey standing there by her.""

Both candidates accused the other of ""lies"" throughout the debate, including McCormick touting a new website called CaseyLies.com, and Casey accusing McCormick of misrepresenting himself as a Pennsylvanian.

""For your viewers tonight, I have a website that's been established today, it's just been launched, CaseyLies.com. You can go and see the actual facts by third-party sources of all the things he's saying. There will be lies throughout. But you should ask yourself, 'Why is a senator with an 18-year track record, who should be able to run on his record, running his entire campaign with a negative set of attacks on me, most of them lies?'"" McCormick said towards the start of the debate.

McCormick claimed that Casey often launched ""lies"" at him during the debate because he ""doesn't have a track record"" in the Senate to run on.

Casey shot back during the debate that McCormick has misrepresented himself as a full-fledged Pennsylvanian.

""We've heard a couple of times tonight about telling lies, but probably the biggest lie told in this whole election, that probably most Pennsylvanians have never heard a bigger lie, was the lie when my opponent said he lived in Pennsylvania, when he was living in Connecticut. The Associated Press on August the 14th, 2023, did a story that proved that he was living in Connecticut,"" Casey said.

McCormick defended that he was born in Pennsylvania and has spent ""the majority of my life"" there, but also lived in Connecticut for years when he served as CEO of Bridgewater Associates.

PENNSYLVANIA SURVEY FINDS HARRIS LEADING TRUMP NARROWLY, IDENTIFIES HER 'BIGGEST WEAKNESS,' POLLSTER SAYS

The economy is among the top concerns for voters in Pennsylvania, as well as the nation at large, with both candidates outlining how they would tackle spiraling inflation if re-elected or elected to the Senate, and what they believe is behind the rise in consumers' costs.

""Prices are too high, especially when you go to the grocery store to buy food or household items, items that people need every week, or at least every other week. And these big conglomerates, these big corporations, rig those prices and jack them up to levels we've never seen, all while they're getting record profits,"" Casey said, while defending his efforts targeting corporations he has accused of ""greedflation.""

So-called greedflation is understood as corporations allegedly exploiting inflation woes by increasing prices on consumers to produce greater profits.

""We can take it on by passing a price gouging bill to go after those companies, hold them accountable,"" Casey said.

The Democratic senator also addressed his campaign against ""shrinkflation,"" which he explained as corporations shrinking products for consumers while not lowering prices.

""We did a report on shrinkflation, which covered a lot of companies around the country. And if that's happening with regard to a Pennsylvania company or any other company around the country, they should be held accountable. When they take a product, shrink the contents of the product, or what's in a bag, and don't shrink the price, that's deceptive. That's ripping people off,"" he said, adding that such companies should be held legally accountable.

McCormick shot back that higher costs on Americans in recent years is due to ""out of control spending"" at the hands of Casey and other Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris and President Biden.

""When you've spent your entire life in public service, elected office, 30 years, you're like a hammer looking for a nail. The cause of inflation is the policies, the out-of-control spending of Biden, Harris and Casey. Bob Casey voted 100% of the time for that $5 trillion of new spending. The experts at the time, Larry Summers, the San Francisco Fed, said this would create inflation,"" McCormick said.

""Bob Casey doesn't understand how the economy works. That's why he's trying to do all this economic voodoo stuff with price controls,"" he later charged.

Casey and McCormick were both grilled about their current abortion stances during the debate, as abortion once again sits atop many voters' list of election concerns following the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Casey positioned himself as a pro-life Democrat earlier in his career, but he voted to codify abortion protections nationwide following the overturning of Roe.

""In 2022, when the Supreme Court overturned a 49-year right, it overturned Roe v. Wade, I think everyone had to make a decision, including senators. I made a decision to support the Women's Health Protection Act. I don't support Republican efforts to ban abortion across the country,"" Casey said.

BATTLEGROUND STATE DEM DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM DEFUND MOVEMENT, BUT POLITICAL RECORD SHOWS DIFFERENT STORY

McCormick was questioned about his remarks in 2022 that he supports rare exceptions for abortion, such as when the health of the mother is at risk, and has since said that he supports additional exceptions for abortion.

""This is an extremely polarizing issue. As you know, I have six daughters, so this is something we spend time talking about. I believe this should be a state's right. I believe states should decide. Pennsylvania has had a law. It's been supported by Democrats and Republicans, like was signed into law by the Senator's father, Governor Casey. I support the three exceptions. I would not favor an abortion ban of any kind,"" McCormick responded.

Casey recently came under fire from a Pennsylvania sheriff who slammed the Democratic senator's border policies for the influx of fentanyl into the U.S., which the dad said had led to his son's death.

""We can't bring back the people we've lost. But we can get rid of the weak politicians like Bob Casey who let it happen,"" Blair County Sheriff Jim Ott said in a recent McCormick campaign ad.

Casey was asked about the sheriff's remarks during his debate Thursday.

""Mr. Casey, the Blair County Sheriff, blames you for the fentanyl death of his son, saying you have not done enough to secure the border. What is your response to that,"" Owens asked.

""I met so many families across the state, and whether it's a sheriff in Blair County or a mom in Allegheny County, Janet that I met, who talked about her daughter, Brianna, this is an awful, awful tragedy for those families. That's why we need to invest in the strategies that we know work. [McCormick] won't do that, because he's weak in the face of the political pressure from his own party. . . . We can solve this problem by investing in the technology, hiring thousands more Border Patrol, so we can inspect every single vehicle coming across the border,"" he said.

Amid the immigration debate, McCormick blamed the Biden-Harris administration and Casey for the immigration crisis at the southern border.

""The border crisis is the direct result of the weakness of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And Bob Casey supported them every second. What chutzpah to run an ad on how tough he is on the border, when he voted against funding for the Border Patrol. He ran an ad in front of the wall that he voted against. He voted for sanctuary cities, he voted for federal benefits for illegal immigrants. And the fentanyl crisis that's come across our border is the direct result of the weakness of Bob Casey not standing up to these terrible cartels,"" McCormick argued.

The pair have agreed to another debate, next taking the same stage in Philadelphia on Oct. 15."

Former Trump staffer and ""The View"" co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin will join former GOP lawmaker Liz Cheney and other anti-Trump Republicans for an event in Pennsylvania next week warning of the dangers of re-electing former President Donald Trump.

Former Trump administration staffer Cassidy Hutchison - who testified against her former boss in the Jan. 6 Committee hearings - as well as Trump's former deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews will be part of the event that is meant to help deliver the swing state to Vice President Kamala Harris in November.

The panel will ""offer a warning about the threat Donald Trump poses to democracy and the rule of law,"" a source connected to the event recently told CNN.

WORKING CLASS WILL COME HOME TO HARRIS, RALLYGOERS IN POSTINDUSTRIAL PENNSYLVANIANS SAY

The aim of the chat is to convince voters of ""the need for independents, moderates, and Republicans to stop him from getting back in office,"" the source added.

The women-led program will be hosted by liberal super-PAC Democracy First in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania on Oct. 9, and is reportedly the first of many that will feature the four women speaking to voters in multiple battleground states.

Cheney, Hutchison, and Matthews have endorsed Harris for president. Griffin has not, though the media personality is a staunch critic of Trump on ""The View"" and in her role as a CNN political commentator.

The event comes as Trump and Harris are neck and neck in battleground states, with the race being especially close in Pennsylvania.

'ABUSE OF POWER': HOUSE GOP OPENS PROBE INTO UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

Recent Fox News polling in Pennsylvania finds Harris only two points ahead of Trump among registered voters in the state, while they are tied at 49% among likely voters.

""Pennsylvania is not breaking open and shouldn't be expected to,"" says Democratic Pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts Fox News surveys alongside Republican Daron Shaw. ""Both candidates have a little way to go to consolidate their bases and whoever does a better job there could determine who wins the state.""

According to the survey, the economy is the top issue for Pennsylvanians, with 71% of voters having a negative view of it. Trump has a six-point advantage over Harris on the issue, while she is viewed far more favorably on abortion.

Former President Donald Trump holds a firm lead in a key state over Vice President Kamala Harris on the question of how to handle immigration -- as the border crisis remains a top issue for voters.

A new poll released this week from Marquette Law School finds Harris leading Trump overall in Wisconsin by 52-48%.

But when it comes to immigration and border security, Trump dominates. Of voters, 49% favor Trump while just 37% favor Harris, with 8% saying they'd be about the same, and 6% saying neither are good on the issue.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

Trump holds a similar 12 point lead on handling the war between Israel-Hamas, while Harris has an 11 point gap on handling Medicare & Social Security and a 17 point lead on abortion.

Of the issues polled, immigration was near the top of the issues, with 15% of voters saying it was their most important issue, the same number who said abortion, and only behind the economy -- which was top issue for 37% of voters.

The poll is the latest indicator that Harris still has a fair way to go in convincing some voters that she is the better candidate on a topic that has dominated the headlines and remains a top issue for voters. Wisconsin, along with states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Arizona could be election deciders in the election on Nov 5.

Harris was put in charge of handling root causes of migration to the southern border in early 2021 as border numbers began to skyrocket. She was eventually dubbed the ""border czar"" by media outlets and critics -- although the White House rejected that title.

HARRIS SHIFTS KEY POSITIONS ON BORDER, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AS CAMPAIGN PROMISES 'PRAGMATIC' APPROACH

Republicans have hammered Harris on the border, saying it was the rolling back of Trump-era policies that led to the record numbers at the border. They have also pointed to her embrace of left-wing positions in her 2019 presidential bid. Since then, her campaign says her views have been shaped by the current administration, including on decriminalizing illegal crossings and closing immigration detention centers.

""Harris can never be forgiven for her erasing our border, and she must never be allowed to become president of the United States,"" Trump said in Wisconsin on Sunday.

Harris has sought to present herself as better situated to handle the border. Her campaign has noted a recent drop in border encounters since President Biden signed a presidential proclamation in June limiting asylum entries. She has also thrown her support behind a bipartisan border security bill that would place similar limits on asylum and provide additional funding and detention beds.

Conservatives said that the bill would enshrine high border numbers, but Harris accused Trump of blocking the bill for political purposes. She did so again on a trip to the southern border in Arizona last week.

""He picked up the phone and calls some friends in Congress and said, stop the bill. Because, you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem,"" she said. ""And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games."""

A Milwaukee man has been accused of swiping items from the same Walgreens store three times during a week's span. The items were mostly cleaning and sanitary items, like soaps, toilet paper, razors, lotions and other household goods.

John Dzwonkowski, 38, now faces two counts of felony retail theft, according to police records and Fox 6.

A criminal complaint indicates that Milwaukee police were first contacted on Sept. 18 at a store on Howell Avenue.

Officers spoke that morning with the store manager who told them that a ""thief"" entered the store around 7:40 a.m. and began ""removing soaps, cosmetics and toilet paper and placing the items into a backpack. The defendant then walked out of the store without paying for the merchandise.""

The complaint states that the stolen items were approximately $178 in retail value.

Officers were called to the same Walgreens location just two days later after another complaint of theft, this time with the defendant ""removing razors, lotions and other cosmetic items and placing them into two bags,"" the complaint says. The stolen merchandise this time was valued at $435.

Kamala Harris teams up with Liz Cheney in the birthplace of the Republican Party,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-liz-cheney-birthplace-republican-party,2024-10-04T01:40:14Z,"RIPON, WI - As she turns up the volume on her efforts to court disgruntled Republicans in her battle with former President Trump for the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday teamed up with the most visible anti-Trump Republican in the town that claims to be the birthplace of the GOP.

Harris campaigned in battleground Wisconsin with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, a one-time rising conservative star in the GOP who, in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, has vowed to do everything she can to prevent Trump from returning to power.

""I have never voted for a Democrat but this year I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,"" Cheney told the audience, as she formally endorsed the Democratic presidential nominee. ""As a conservative, as a patriot, as a mother, as someone who reveres our Constitution, I am honored to join her in this urgent cause.""

Harris praised Cheney as a leader who ""puts country above party and above self - a true patriot.""

WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS WHO ADVISED REAGAN AND BUSH BACK HARRIS OVER TRUMP

The campaign event took place in Ripon, Wisconsin, where a one-room schoolhouse was designated a national historic landmark due to its role in holding a series of meetings in 1854 that led to the formation of the Republican Party.

The younger Cheney was once rising in the ranks of House Republican leadership.

But she was the most high-profile of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-president Trump in early 2021 on a charge of inciting the deadly Jan. 6th attack on the Capitol, which was waged by right-wing extremists and other Trump supporters who aimed to disrupt congressional certification of President Biden's Electoral College victory in the 2020 election.

TRUMP UPS HIS ANTE IN THE 2024 FUNDRAISING FIGHT WITH HARRIS

The conservative lawmaker and defense hawk immediately came under verbal attack from Trump and his allies, and was eventually ousted from her number-three House GOP leadership position.

Cheney, who has been vocal in emphasizing the importance of defending the nation's democratic process and of putting country before party, was one of only two Republicans who served on a special select committee organized by House Democrats that investigated the riot at the Capitol.

In 2022, she was ousted in the GOP congressional primary in Wyoming by a candidate that was backed by Trump.

At a speaking event in early September at Duke University in swing state North Carolina, Cheney announced that she would be voting for Harris in the presidential election. Cheney's father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, also endorsed Harris.

Cheney on Thursday warned that ""our republic faces a threat unlike any we have faced before. A former president who attempted to stay in power by unraveling the foundations of our republic.

She argued that Trump ""can never be trusted with power again"" and emphasized that ""in this election, putting patriotism ahead of partisanship is not an aspiration, it is our duty.""

""What Jan. 6 shows us is there is not an ounce, not an ounce, of compassion in Donald Trump. He is petty. He is vindictive. He is cruel. And Donald Trump is not fit to lead this good and great nation,"" Cheney claimed.

WHAT THE LATEST POLL IN BATTLEGROUND WISCONSIN SHOWS

Harris, speaking after Cheney, highlighted that ""anyone who recklessly tramples on our democratic values as Donald Trump has, anyone who has actively and violently obstructed the will of the people and the peaceful transfer of power, as Donald Trump has....must never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States.""

And Harris emphasized that ""I take seriously my pledge to be a president for all Americans.

Cheney was not always a fan of Harris.

The Trump campaign on Thursday repeatedly pointed to a social media post by Cheney during the 2000 election where she argued that ""@KamalaHarris has a more liberal voting record than Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Her radical leftist views-raising taxes, banning gun sales, taxpayer $ for abortion & illegal immigrant health care, eliminating private health insurance-would be devastating for America.""

Trump, speaking with Fox News' Bill Melugin during a rally in Michigan on Thursday, said that Cheney was ""terrible"" and ""a stupid warhawk. All she wants to do is shoot missiles at people.""

On Cheney's backing of Harris, Trump argued ""I think they hurt each other. I think they're so bad, both of them.""

The Cheneys are part of a growing list of prominent Republicans who are supporting Harris.

Two other high-profile anti-Trump Republicans -- former Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan - had speaking roles at the Democratic National Convention, which was held six weeks ago in Chicago.

And Harris is backed by more than 200 alumni who served in both Bush administrations or worked for the late Sen. John McCain and Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2008 and 2012 GOP presidential nominee. She's also supported by more than 100 Republican former national security officials and other prominent Republicans.

Ripon is not the only town that claims to be the birthplace of the GOP. Exeter, New Hampshire also has some bragging rites, as it was the site of meetings in 1853 - a year ahead of the Ripon gatherings - by disenchanted political leaders who discussed the formation of a new party of Republicans.

But officials in Ripon said the group in Exeter never actually formed a political organization, or chose officials, as they did in Wisconsin.

Wisconsin is one of seven crucial battleground states with razor-thin margins that decided Biden's 2020 White House victory and are likely to determine if Harris or Trump wins the 2024 presidential election.

With less than five weeks until Election Day in November, Harris and Trump are locked in a margin-of-error race in the key swing states.

While Trump retains vast sway over the GOP, even a small sliver of Republicans supporting Harris could make an important impact in what will likely be a race within the margins in the battleground states."

James Carville harshly criticized the Harris-Walz campaign for not doing more to combat the claim by vice presidential hopeful JD Vance that former President Donald Trump ""saved Obamacare"" during Tuesday night's debate.

The Democratic strategist unloaded on the Harris/Walz campaign for what he believes to be an ineffective response to Vance's comments that Trump ""salvaged"" the Affordable Care Act (ACA) while he was president.

""Why isn't Harris herself out today talking about that,"" Carville seethed on the Politics War Room podcast. ""Get off your a--. Move, move, move!""

""[Trump] did everything in his power to destroy it and this is not an issue that people don't care about,"" Carville said. ""It's not a nitpicking thing and I got to tell you, the White House response and I think by and large, to a large extent, the press response is not at all measured to the gravity of this lie, of the importance of this.

Tim Walz attempts to clarify remarks he made about being in Tiananmen Square during the 1989 pro-democracy protests during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Vice presidential candidate Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., has been called out so many times for false claims, one news outlet warned it may unravel his public image.

CBS debate moderators confronted the governor during his vice presidential debate with Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, Tuesday regarding Walz's claim that he had been in Hong Kong in May 1989 during the Tiananmen Square protests, when he actually traveled to Asia in August, a few months later.

Politico observed this is part of a history of factual inaccuracies Walz has told about his past, in an article headlined, ""Tim Walz has a tendency to misspeak. It may haunt the campaign.""

""Since being tapped as Kamala Harris' running mate, the folksy, plain-speaking Minnesota governor has had to explain a growing number of inaccurate statements -- and at times embellishments -- about his past,"" Politico's Meredith Lee Hill and Mia McCarthy wrote. ""They range from comments about his military service to his visit to Hong Kong more than three decades ago to clarifying that his family didn't specifically use in vitro fertilization.""

BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT TELLS DR. PHIL HE SAW 'PANIC' ON WALZ'S FACE DURING KEY DEBATE MOMENT

""It's unclear whether Walz's verbal errors will undercut his credibility with voters. But the need to continually clean up those claims could politically hurt Walz and Harris, who are locked in a tight race with Donald Trump and JD Vance,"" the reporters added.

""And in some cases, key members of Harris' circle weren't aware of some of the inaccurate statements until they became public despite the vetting process, according to four people familiar with the conversations who were granted anonymity to discuss the matter.""

The writers said, ""Walz's misstatements could contradict the image that the campaign has painted of him as an upstanding, everyday Midwest guy.""

During the debate, Walz responded to a question about his Tiananmen Square claim by speaking about how he ""grew up in a small rural Nebraska town, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies 'til the streetlights come on,"" then described joining the National Guard and becoming a teacher. He glossed over his trips to China but acknowledged, ""I've not been perfect, I'm a knucklehead at times.""

When confronted again by one of the moderators for not answering the question, he conceded he ""misspoke"" about the Tiananmen timeline.

The day after the debate, Walz told reporters during a campaign stop in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, ""Yeah, look, I have my dates wrong. I was in Hong Kong in China in 1989... I speak like everybody else speaks. I need to be clearer.""

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

A spokesperson for the campaign defended Walz's record to Politico, noting he ""cares deeply about democracy.""

""As the governor has said, he sometimes misspeaks. He speaks like a normal person and speaks passionately about issues he cares deeply about, including democracy and stopping gun violence in our school,"" the Harris-Walz campaign said, adding former President Trump and Vance ""repeatedly lie and mislead about their plan to ban abortion nationwide"" and other topics."

Former first lady Melania Trump is drawing heat from pro-life advocates over an excerpt in her memoir where she suggests a woman's right to choose an abortion is a ""fundamental right of individual liberty,"" according to a report Wednesday.

Melania Trump wife of Republican presidential candidate and former President Trump, wrote the memoir entitled ""Melania"" that is scheduled to come out on Oct. 8, per the Amazon release date. In the book, according to a preview by The Guardian, Melania expresses a viewpoint that has historically been at odds with the Republican Party's platform.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,"" Melania reportedly wrote.

TRUMP RISKS LOSING SOME PRO-LIFE VOTERS UNLESS HE CHANGES 'HIS TUNE' ON ABORTION, ACTIVIST WARNS

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.

""Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

The excerpts quickly drew the ire of pro-life advocates who have already been disgruntled by some of Trump's seemingly ambiguous comments regarding abortion.

""Melania Trump's support of abortion is anti-feminist and clearly outside the teaching of our Catholic faith. She is wrong,"" wrote Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America advocacy group.

Lila Rose, founder of leading pro-life advocacy group Live Action, also responded to a promotional video Melania posted for her memoir in which she states, ""Individual freedom is a fundamental principle that I safeguard... what does my body my choice really mean?""

""Who is this Melania Trump, or Kamala Harris? Functionally the same exact position on abortion,"" Rose wrote on X.

President of pro-life advocacy group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Marjorie Dannenfelser, wrote on X: ""The women of America are capable of great strength and creativity. They are naturally inclined to speak for those who are powerless. Abortion is not the source of their freedom and liberation.""

In August, Trump sparked confusion among pro-life supporters about where he stood on an amendment that would upend Florida's ban on abortions after six weeks' gestation. Trump, after saying ""I think the six-week is too short, there has to be more time,"" to an NBC reporter when asked how he would vote, later walked it back and said he would vote against the amendment.

Other spouses of Republican presidents, such as Pat Nixon, Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Laura Bush, have been recorded either during or after their husbands' tenure in office expressing pro-choice views.

Co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin agreed that it was a ""strategic"" move.

""I think she hates him. Okay, so we can all agree that. That's a given. I also think that she wants to take him out. She does not want to be the first lady anymore.

Wisconsin is among a handful of swing states that are likely to determine the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. Other states like Ohio and Pennsylvania are also critical to either a Trump or Harris victory.

Pennsylvania in particular is one of the tightest contests in the nation, where Harris leads Trump in a razor-thin 49%-47% match-up, according to new data from AARP.

Body language expert tells Dr. Phil he saw 'panic' on Walz's face during key debate moment,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/body-language-expert-tells-dr-phil-he-saw-panic-walzs-face-during-key-debate-moment,2024-10-03T09:42:56Z,"Body language expert Carole Lieberman, M.D., weighs in on Vance-Walz VP Debate.

Body language expert Scott Rouse called out Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., for panicking and trying to avoid answering a question about his presence at Tiananmen Square during the vice presidential debate Tuesday.

One of the debate's most surprising moments came when the CBS debate moderators confronted the governor about his claim that he had been in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protests, when he actually traveled to Asia in August 1989, a few months later.

Dr. Phil, who previously asked Rouse to analyze body language in September's presidential debate, asked him what to look for when reviewing this clip of Walz.

""I'm going to look for the things that tell us we know he wasn't there, and this, I'll put all my money on this, we're going to see fear, we're going to see panic, we're going to see shame, and the grief muscle as well,"" he said, adding, ""Everything's in this one.""

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

The host then showed CBS' Margaret Brennan confronting Walz about the Tiananmen claim, noting that reports indicate ""you actually didn't travel to Asia until August of that year, can you explain that discrepancy?""

Walz began his response by talking about growing up in rural Nebraska. Rouse said his body language spoke volumes, ""As that head goes sideways, that's panic. Because he's not sure how he's going to defend this. He knows the question's coming, so he's got something ready, but it's not coming out the way he thought about it, so he's got inner dialogue going on, he's thinking about it. That's why I see that head turn, those eyes get really, really wide. I know what that looks like, that's what's happening.""

Rouse noted what he called the upside-down horseshoe shape of the ""grief muscle"" as well as other signs on Walz's face.

""And the rest of this, this is panic, we see his eyes doing this, that's panic,"" Rouse said, drawing on the screen. He added further that Walz's lower face and head indicated he was in ""panic mode.""

He then called attention to what he said was Walz's biggest hand gesture of the night, ""This is the one that's come out further from his body than anything else, because he's trying to make sure- 'I want you to believe me! You gotta believe me!' That's what we're seeing, the panic here. Wide eyes, grief muscle, and everything's far out.""

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

Dr. Phil said a quick and direct answer followed by an explanation immediately seems more trustworthy than starting an answer with a long explanation.

""Don't you want to hear the answer up front?"" Dr. Phil asked the audience. ""And the question was, 'You said you were in Tiananmen Square during that showdown. And were you or weren't you?'"" He then mocked Walz's answer about growing up in a small Nebraska town.

Rouse replied that this tactic of dumping unrelated information is a well-known ploy to change the conversation.

""We call that 'chaff and redirect,'"" the expert said. ""He gives out a lot more information, hoping that your brain will follow that information and not ask any more questions and forget what you're talking about. That's why when you're asking a question, they go, 'Well, listen, here's what really happened. When I get up in the morning, I eat toast every day' and they start talking about stuff that has nothing to do with what the answer is.""

Dr. Phil then proposed a way Walz could have better answered the question.

""Would it have been better off if he'd have said, 'No, I wasn't, and I said I was. Let me explain. I took student groups over there probably 30 or 40 times, 35 years ago. And I remember this being a really big deal, and I just got it confused timing wise. Bad mistake on my part. I apologize. Next question.'""

Dr. Phil then joked, ""But then we wouldn't have known where he was born."""
MORNING GLORY: The VP debate is an example of Kamala Harris's horrible judgment when it comes to picking staff,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-vp-debate-example-kamala-harriss-horrible-judgment-when-comes-picking-staff,2024-10-03T09:09:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The debate between the candidates for vice president -- GOP nominee Ohio Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz -- was dominated by Vance, and all but a handful of hardened partisan pundits agree on that conclusion.

Walz wobbled and panicked from the first question -- which everyone in the world knew would be about Iran's ballistic missile attack on Israel earlier in the day. Yet Walz still fumbled his response, and it got worse from there until the CBS moderators invoked the unwritten mercy rule for left-wing moderators watching the Democrat melt and tossed Walz some softballs on J6 at the debate's close, by which time the internet was howling and laughing at the Minnesota governor.

There were three important takeaways:

NEW YORK POST CALLS OUT CBS FOR 'RIDICULOUS' FACT-CHECK OF JD VANCE: 'SHAMEFUL MOMENT'

First, Vance is a superb and calm debater and a reassuring figure on the national stage.

Second, Walz is not, and he represents the one big decision Vice President Kamala Harris has had to make since President Joe Biden dropped out. It was a terrible decision. Imagine her Cabinet and White House staff if somehow, she wins.

Third, legacy media is irretrievably broken and cannot be reclaimed from its lurch into rote leftism and extreme partisanship, or even pulled back to a minimum level of seriousness on big occasions.

Do executives at these networks -- ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC -- not see what has happened? Americans don't trust the news divisions at the legacy networks. It's as if those divisions are run by a combination of fresh-from-campus-demonstration interns and hardened partisans from the Obama years.

The CBS debate was not, however, as overtly biased against Vance as ABC's earlier debate was against Trump, but it was still very, very biased against the center-right and conservative audience. Viewers saw the question set veer quickly from a world crisis and the border crisis to get to the left's favorite issue of abortion.

With the world tuning in only hours after Iran launched 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, the moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan did open with an obligatory round of questions on that crisis. But, after 10 minutes, they plowed on to a quick exchange on immigration and the Biden-Harris massive fail on the relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene's savaging of North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Virginia in order to get to ... abortion, which had been discussed at length in the ABC debate and about which there are zero mysteries.

Three rounds of questions on abortion, really? And three rounds marked by the rote framing favored by the hard left? Predictable but still shocking.

The debate ended in a morass of childcare questions and then the obligatory ""Wasn't January 6th terrible?"" questions.

What a farce. Not one question on China's vast military build-up and its threat against Taiwan and the Philippines. Not one question on the Chinese Communist Party spies shot through our country, including the office of New York's current and past governor. Not one question on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Yes, there was a quick dash through the consequences of more than 10 million illegal immigrants flowing across the southern border under the Biden-Harris regime, but also a quick cut-off when Vance began what was an obviously embarrassing factcheck of the CBS factcheck on the ""legal status"" of the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio. ""We have a lot to get to,"" was the trigger for cutting off anything uncomfortable.

Walz was asked about his lying about his trips to China -- sort of. It was left hanging. A knuckleheaded answer for a knuckleheaded team of debate organizers. Chinese President Xi Jinping is a sort of Voldemort for the networks -- never to be named -- perhaps because ABC and CBS all have corporate ties to companies that must do business there?

Look, whatever votes were moved by the debate moved toward the GOP because Vance hammered that the costs of everything from food to gas skyrocketed under Biden-Harris, gave a quick tutorial on why construction costs have soared and thus the price of houses, and repeatedly reminded the audience of Harris's failure in her job as ""border czar,"" while also stressing the need for more domestic energy production. Tim Walz provided comic relief.

The loser wasn't just Walz though. It was also CBS, which joined ABC in a legacy media hall of shame. When we get back to debates in four years, the good news is the ""debate commission"" is already dead and that, by 2028, the idea of the big networks hosting debates unchecked by center-right moderators will be as well. The candidates will call on C-SPAN and find some fair moderators. Siri could have done a better job in our past two debates this year.

What has to be dawning in the C Suites of networks -- if they are at all self-aware -- is that their product and their talent are awful, and their audiences have already left or will soon leave. Tuesday night was just the most recent example of why."
"Why Vance easily beat Walz in debate, softening his image in the process",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/why-vance-easily-beat-walz-debate-softening-his-image-process,2024-10-03T07:12:39Z,"A panel of Republicans, Independents, and Democrats react in real-time to claims made by Trump running mate JD Vance in reference to 2020's election results during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Credit: CBS)

And there's no question that JD Vance easily won the vice presidential debate. Tim Walz did better than anticipated - perhaps those expectations were deliberately set low - but despite some strong counterpunching, he frequently stumbled.

Each man had a mission: to defend his running mate and rough up the opposing presidential candidate.

But Vance had a second goal beyond talking up Donald Trump, and that was softening his own image. He made a concerted effort to project empathy, to appear reasonable, to be open to opposing viewpoints.

VOTERS REACT TO GOV TIM WALZ DODGING TIANANMEN SQUARE QUESTION: 'I'M A KNUCKLEHEAD AT TIMES'

There is a caricature of the Ohio senator as a hard-right ideologue with little sympathy for women, as reflected by the famous childless cat ladies comment. But when the subject of abortion came up, he went out of his way to sound sympathetic to the pro-choice side:

""I know a lot of Americans don't agree with everything that I've ever said on this topic. And, you know, I grew up in a working-class family in a neighborhood where I knew a lot of young women who had unplanned pregnancies and decided to terminate those pregnancies because they feel like they didn't have any other options. And, you know, one of them is actually very dear to me. And I know she's watching tonight and I love you.

""And she told me something a couple of years ago that she felt like if she hadn't had that abortion, that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship. And I think that what I take from that as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable, is that my party? We've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they frankly just don't trust us.""

(Vance's website describes him as ""100 percent pro-life."")

Walz countered with specific stories of women who died or whose health was damaged because they lived in states that tightly restrict abortion.

The Minnesota governor hit his talking points, but regularly took a long time to get to his main argument. A question about Kamala Harris' plan to build 3 million housing units produced a detour about how Walz has only bought one home.

Walz often spoke in a clipped shorthand - the ACA, Springfield, Vance creating stories - without explaining, for instance, that he meant the false tale of Haitian migrants eating pets.

The CBS moderators, Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, edged into ABC territory by fact-checking only Vance, despite saying they would try to avoid that. After the senator referred to illegal immigrants in the Ohio town, Brennan said Springfield ""does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected."" That's a point Walz should have made, but didn't.

Many questions were framed from the left. ""Senator Vance,"" said Brennan, ""you oppose most gun legislation that Democrats claim would curb gun violence. You oppose red flag gun laws and legislation to ban certain semi-automatic rifles, including AR-15s.""

Walz's worst moment was one he should have anticipated, a story in the New York Times and elsewhere saying he was not in China for the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests as he had claimed, but got to Hong Kong months later. The governor began with a word-salad answer about growing up in Nebraska before retreating to ""I've not been perfect. And I'm a knucklehead at times.""

Pressed again, he said he had misspoken.

Vance's worst moment was about Jan. 6. O'Donnell began, ""You have said you would not have certified the last presidential election and would have asked the states to submit alternative electors that has been called unconstitutional and illegal.""

POLITICS HIJACKS HURRICANE DEVASTATION IN THE SOUTH, BIDEN CALLS TRUMP A LIAR

The senator countered that Trump ""said that on January the 6th, the protesters ought to protest peacefully. And on January the 20th, what happened? Joe Biden became the president. Donald Trump left the White House.""

This time Walz was ready. Trump ""lost this election and he said he did. 140 police officers were beaten at the Capitol that day, some with the American flag. Several later died.""

He turned to Vance and said: ""Did he lose the 2020 election?""

When Vance tried the ""focused on the future"" line again, Walz called that ""a damning non-answer.""

But Vance largely came off as a Bush-style compassionate conservative. He must figure that win or lose, he'll be running for president in 2028 and needed to combat all the negative coverage.

Walz looked like a man who was happy to survive his turn on the national stage. The debate would have looked very different if Harris had picked Josh Shapiro, given that she's tied with Trump in Pennsylvania.

The Harris campaign has bubble-wrapped Tim Walz, not allowing him to do a single solo interview. JD Vance is constantly doing interviews, podcasts and press conferences, the best kind of preparation for a big debate. And that, in the end, may have been the difference."

Stevie Nicks' first single in four years is an ""anthem"" to abortion rights and the 2022 Dobbs decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

The former Fleetwood Mac singer released the music video for ""The Lighthouse"" on Thursday, though she explained in a statement that the song was years in the making.

""I wrote this song a few months after Roe v. Wade was overturned,"" she said. ""It seemed like overnight, people were saying, 'What can we, as a collective force, do about this...' For me, it was to write a song. It took a while because I was on the road.""

Her statement continued, ""Then early one morning, I was watching the news on TV and a certain newscaster said something that felt like she was talking to me -- explaining what the loss of Roe v. Wade would come to mean. I wrote the song the next morning and recorded it that night. That was Sept. 6, 2022. I have been working on it ever since.""

Lyrics for the song included, ""All the rights that you had yesterday are taken away / And now you're afraid / You should be afraid/ Because everything I fought for long ago in a dream is gone.""

The music video also spliced images and clips of several women's marches.

Nicks emphasized in her statement upon the song's release how important it was to her and other women.

""It seemed like overnight, people were saying, 'What can we, as a collective force, do about this...' For me, it was to write a song,"" Nicks said. ""I have often said to myself, 'This may be the most important thing I ever do.' To stand up for the women of the United States and their daughters and granddaughters -- and the men that love them. This is an anthem.""

Nicks has been outspoken about her support for abortion rights, previously calling it ""my generation's fight."" In 2020, she discussed her own abortion and said it was necessary to keep the band going in 1979.

""I would have had to walk away,"" Nicks said. ""And I knew that the music we were going to bring to the world was going to heal so many people's hearts and make people so happy.""

"Politico: Vance's beard a sign of 'aggression' to women, Walz's 'saucer' eyes showed his 'passion'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/politico-vances-beard-sign-aggression-women-walzs-saucer-eyes-showed-his-passion,2024-10-03T00:07:43Z,"Fox News contributor Joe Concha joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss why he believes the CBS moderators were biased against JD Vance and his reaction to an ABC anchor comparing Tim Walz's performance to President Biden's.

Female voters who watched the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate on Tuesday may have viewed Ohio Sen. JD Vance's beard as a sign of toxic masculinity, according to one body language expert.

Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, faced off against Democratic vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at the Tuesday night debate, sparring for 90 minutes on a wide range of issues including immigration, the economy and abortion.

Former FBI agent and body language expert Joe Navarro analyzed each candidate's body language at the event for Politico Magazine, giving his opinion about how they presented themselves on stage.

The first thing Navarro noticed was Vance's facial hair. He claimed the ""masculine"" trait could turn off female voters.

VANCE OOZED CONFIDENCE COMPARED TO JITTERY WALZ, BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT SAYS: 'CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP'

""As POLITICO Magazine has noted before, Vance is the first White House wannabe to wear facial hair in 80 years. Our appearance is fundamental to our body language, and research indicates that voters see beards as (surprise, surprise) more masculine,"" Navarro wrote. ""That can be positive to some, reading as strength and competence. But to others, especially women, it can be negative, conveying aggression and opposition to feminist ideals.""

Navarro isn't the only media commentator to associate the Republican ticket with negative perceptions of masculinity. Since the Harris-Walz ticket emerged, several journalists, including MSNBC contributor Katty Kay, have argued that Republicans appeal to men with a more ""macho,"" what they consider, outdated version of masculinity.

MSNBC host Jen Psaki and The Washington Post's Catherine Rampell have also made the case that the Democratic ticket appeals to men who are more ""supportive"" of women.

While critiquing Vance's beard, Navarro praised Walz for his bugged-eyed expression throughout the debate, saying it ""showed his passion"" on the issues.

""When Walz felt especially passionate about something, he'd open his eyes wide as saucers. Eye-popping can sometimes be a sign of surprise, but for Walz, it simply revealed his emotional intensity,"" Navarro wrote. ""Early humans would have made such facial gestures to communicate strong emotions, like 'danger is close.' For Walz, it gave extra weight to his feelings and held our gaze.""

The body language expert spoke positively about how Vance used his hands to convey emotion and leadership during the debate, but claimed a ""little frown"" by the Republican at one point showed where his ""weaknesses lie.""

""When Walz brought up Project 2025, Vance exhibited a little tell that carried a big message: a slight squinting of the eyes and a small frown. Clearly, this was a sore subject,"" Navarro wrote.

""We have to guard against such behaviors in high-stakes interchanges like negotiations or, say, vice-presidential debates -- they reveal to your opponent what topics you want to avoid and where your weaknesses lie,"" he wrote.

At the same time, Navarro gave credit to Walz for frowning to show his disapproval while Vance was speaking.

""During a disagreement over democracy, he furrowed his glabella forcefully at what Vance was saying. Then he held his eyebrows like that, in tension, for some time. While Vance had the floor, this was a way for Walz to silently say, 'No way, that's not right, and I am going to challenge you on this,'"" he wrote.

The only negative assessment of Walz was about his finger-wagging at the camera.

""[H]e pointed at the camera with his index finger, like Uncle Sam in those old 'I Want You' posters. It was a bold, almost accusatory gesture -- which made it great for the poster, but can come across as almost hostile. Our brains immediately perceive a point as 'calling us out' -- in other words, as threatening. Walz wanted our attention there, and he certainly got it,"" Navarro wrote.

Both candidates displayed ""Midwestern politeness"" by tilting their heads and turning their bodies toward the other while speaking, the expert said."

Former Harris advisor complains about Walz's 'niceties' towards Vance: 'Why should they vote for you?',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/former-harris-advisor-complains-about-walzs-niceties-towards-vance-why-should-vote-you,2024-10-02T21:21:30Z,"MSNBC host Symone Sanders-Townsend argued that cordiality and demonstrating common ground between Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio failed to demonstrate differences to the American electorate.

MSNBC host Symone Sanders-Townsend criticized Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., for being too agreeable with his opponent Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, during the vice presidential debate on Tuesday.

The showdown between Walz and Vance was noticeably cordial throughout the evening, despite their ideological differeances. Sanders-Townsend, who served as chief spokesperson and senior adviser for Vice President Kamala Harris before joining MSNBC in 2022, suggested that if Walz and Vance have so much in common, it's a mystery why voters wouldn't support the Republican ticket.

""Debates are about performance, and they are about policy. And why this debate was very important is that there are many Americans out there, not just moderate Republicans, there are base Democratic voters that are saying they want to and need to hear more. Now, I think it is very fair for people to want to criticize those base Democratic voters who say, 'Well, what more do you need?' You can do that. But that is their lived reality, and so if you are trying to win their votes, you have to meet them where they are,"" she said. ""There were so many niceties on that debate stage tonight, I am just kind of like, well, if you agree so much with J.D. Vance, why should they vote for you?""

She went on to argue that both candidates were strategically putting on a dishonest performance.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

""I fully believe that Gov. Walz went out there tonight and did what was practiced in debate prep, did what the strategy was that the team put together. That was not the Gov. Walz that we -- that I had seen out on the campaign trail. That's not the Gov.Walz that I had seen during the veepstakes, right?"" she said. ""That was not the J.D. Vance that I know to be true. I mean, goodness! J.D. Vance was on that stage, he was sorry about Amber Thurman, he was -- he was sorry about -- he was sorry about a lot of stuff. He -- 'We get things wrong.' But do you agree with the policy?""

Sanders-Townsend, who also hosts a weekend show on MSNBC, also took aim at the CBS moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margret Brennan.

""That's not the Margaret and Norah that I know! Margaret don't do that on Sunday morning,"" she said.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

After the debate, Walz was criticized for coming off as nervous and not as polished as Vance.

""I think JD Vance strategically went in to do 'Midwestern nice' to disarm Tim Walz. And Tim Walz kind of took the bait so he wasn't in fighting mode. There were some fact checks he could have done that he dropped the ball on,"" ""The View"" host Alyssa Farrah Griffin said.

""Vance was far nimbler than the nervous Tim Walz, especially in the first half of the debate.

Despite calls from both sides of the aisle to lower the political temperature following the two assassination attempts against former President Trump, MSNBC host Joy Reid recently claimed that Democratic voters want someone to give him a ""knuckle sandwich.""

Reid employed the violent imagery during MSNBC's vice presidential debate coverage on Tuesday night, telling a network panel that the Democratic base really want someone to engage in a ""fistfight"" with the former president.

""Democrats want to see someone get up there and give a knuckle sandwich to Donald Trump,"" Reid said to the panel, which included fellow MSNBC anchors Nicolle Wallace, Lawrence O'Donnell, Rachel Maddow and others.

A VISIBLY SHAKY WALZ SAYS THE WORLD NEEDS 'STEADY LEADERSHIP'

Reid began her point by stating that Gov. Walz's, D-Minn., vice presidential debate performance seemed tailored to a ""small, narrow group"" of swing voters, who want ""more substance"" from candidates.

""Tim Walz was very detailed and he spoke the way a governor speaks about really specific issues like gun violence, like health care. He was substantive and knowledgeable, so if you are that person who the thing that is keeping you on the fence is you need more details, he gave you more details.""

She continued, explaining that the base of the party prefers to see a brawl between the two candidates, and their preferred leader taking it directly to Trump with heavy blows.

""No. 2, I don't think that small narrow group of people wanted to see a fist fight. And so, I think that the people who want the fist fight are the base of the Democratic Party.""

Reid noted that it isn't the Democratic base that ""needs this debate,"" but those swing voters who do. She argued that Walz delivered in connecting to these people.

""I think the reason that Tim Walz was effective in the way he did it - he wasn't angry, he was disappointed. And that's actually in some ways stronger,"" she said, elsewhere adding, ""Tim Walz gave you that specificity that I think is going to get those people to feel more comfortable"" voting for the Democratic ticket.

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

Several X users blasted Reid for using the violent imagery against Trump only weeks after he was nearly killed by a second would-be assassin at his golf course in Florida.

Popular conservative account Libs of TikTok criticized the host, stating, ""2 ass*ss*nation attempts and Iran plotting to try to get Trump and Democrats are still calling for violence.""

Conservative commentator Paul Szypula chimed in, stating, ""Joy Reid is an angry person filled with hate. She needs help.""

""Steve Bannon's War Room"" co-host Natalie Winters remarked, ""Wow, @JoyAnnReid just said the quiet part out loud. Democrats want a 'fist fight' and someone to 'give a knuckle sandwich to Trump.'""

(Credit: CBS)

Voters watching Tuesday's debate between Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz had a largely positive response to an exchange between the two vice presidential candidates on shootings.

""I got a 17-year-old, and he witnessed a shooting at a community center playing volleyball. Those things don't leave you,"" Walz said, eliciting a response of ""awful"" from Vance.

The answer from Walz on shootings began a portion of largely positive reactions from viewers of the debate as Walz explained his stance on gun safety measures, according to Fox News dials of Republican, Democratic and Independent voters that measured their responses to the candidates answers in real time.

""I'm a hunter. I own firearms. The vice president is -- we understand that the Second Amendment is there, but our first responsibility is to our kids to figure this out,"" Walz said, eliciting an increasingly positive response from Independent and Democratic voters while Republicans remained mostly in the middle.

All three groups of voters showed an increasingly positive response to Walz's remarks as he acknowledged Vance in a rare bipartisan moment.

""I 100% believe that Sen. Vance hates it when these kids... it's abhorrent, and it breaks your heart. I agree with that, but that's not far enough when we know there's things that work,"" Walz said.

Independent and Republican voters also started to have a positive response when Vance was given the opportunity to respond to Walz's remarks, with the Ohio senator calling it ""awful"" that the Minnesota governor's son witnessed a shooting.

Jones visited Steak 'N Egger restaurant in Muskegon after Tuesday night's CBS News Vice Presidential Debate, where many watchers gave Vance the advantage over Walz.

""[Walz] did terrible in many respects, but he is just honest and truthful also. He doesn't know what he's talking about and he kind of admitted it,"" one voter said.

Another voter said Walz appeared ""too nervous.""

""[Walz is] phony. He's too plastic. He doesn't know the topics like Vance.""

A few voters at the diner, however, defended Walz's performance and argued the Democrat won the pair's only debate showdown.

""[Walz is] very articulate. He knows his facts,"" one woman said. ""JD Vance totally switched the script last night. He told untruths. He flipped the switch. He lied throughout the whole entire debate last night. What he said was untrue - his stance on abortion, his stance on housing, his stance on the finance - everything was was not true.""

The woman conceded that Vance's ""experience on public stages"" may have impacted the number of voters and pundits giving the senator the win.

Tuesday's debate covered a variety of subjects ranging from immigration to climate change to abortion as the two lesser known politicians sought to make their introductions to American voters before Election Day.

One Michigan voter said she is voting for Vice President Kamala Harris because she likes the idea that ""we get to vote every four years instead of, 'if you vote me in, you won't ever have to vote again.'""

Another woman voiced her support for Trump ""because he's for America, and he's for me. And he's for the unborn child.""

""If you are for the person who cannot defend themselves, then you are for the rest of us,"" she said. ""And if you don't care about those that are not able to defend themselves, you certainly aren't going to be in charge of us or care for us.""

"WATCH: Voters react in real time to key Vance-Walz debate moments on immigration, democracy, abortion",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/watch-voters-react-real-time-key-vance-walz-debate-moments-immigration-democracy-abortion,2024-10-02T16:27:52Z,"Fox News Digital ranks the top five memorable moments from the 2024 Vice Presidential Debate between Senator JD Vance and Governor Tim Walz.

A Fox News Digital focus group of Republicans, Democrats and independents reacted to key moments from the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate between Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday night, offering real-time responses to the candidates' statements.

In a focus group hosted by Lee Carter, participants across the political spectrum used dials showing their favorable, unfavorable or neutral responses to Vance and Walz. Their reactions gave insights into how the voters who will help decide the election felt about the demeanor, character and policies of the two men, one of whom will be the next vice president.

Here are some of the most significant voter reactions from Tuesday night's focus group.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

Vance's argument that the U.S. needed to ""stop the bleeding"" at the border during Tuesday's debate elicited a mixed response from voters.

Vance received mixed responses when he said, ""Before we talk about deportations, we have to stop the bleeding... we have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies.""

While Republican views of Vance's answers had an immediate positive response, Democratic viewers of the debate went in an opposite direction, the dials showed. Independents, meanwhile, hovered around a neutral response to Vance's answer.

Voters began to see Vance's response in a more positive light when he touched on former President Trump's border policies, arguing that the next administration should return to handling the border similar to how Trump did during his four years in office.

Democrats and independents reacted moderately-to-highly favorable to Walz's rejoinder on the migrant crisis and his criticism of the Trump administration.

Walz touted the bipartisan immigration bill that Trump pushed to kill earlier this year and defended Kamala Harris' record in California on the issue. Republicans were unfavorable to Walz but independents and Democrats gave him high marks throughout his answer.

""Pass the bill, she'll sign it,"" Walz said.

Republican, Democrat and independent voters reacted differently when Vance stated that he and Trump support ""clean air, clean water"" when climate change was brought up at the debate.

""Look, a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns. I think it's important for us, first of all, to say, Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water. We want the environment to be cleaner and safer,"" Vance said.

The Fox News Debate Dial showed support among independents and Democrats dipping downward when Vance made that statement. Support among Republicans remained fairly consistent.

But support among independent viewers began to rise again when Vance referenced how Democrats bring up carbon emissions when discussing climate change.

""This idea that carbon emissions drives all of the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true just for the sake of argument. So we're not arguing about weird science. Let's just say that's true,"" Vance said. ""Well, if you believe that, what would you -- would you want to do? The answer is that you'd want to restore as much American manufacturing as possible, and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world.""

One of Walz's most difficult moments at the debate received poor to middling reviews across the board from the focus group.

Moderators confronted Walz on his prior claim that he was present at the Tiananmen Square protests in Hong Kong in 1989, when he didn't travel to Asia until later that year. Walz gave a meandering answer that showed sub-par responses from Democrats, Republicans and independents almost throughout his entire comment, which didn't directly address the discrepancy.

At one point, he admitted he could be a ""knucklehead."" He eventually admitted he'd misspoke.

Walz's support among Republicans dipped to its lowest point - under 10% - when he said former President Donald Trump would have benefited from participating in one of his China trips, arguing Trump would never have befriended Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Despite CBS announcing that it would not allow live fact-checking during the debate, moderator Margaret Brennan interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming public resources in Springfield, Ohio.

Independent and Republican voters disapproved of the interjection, but independent voters dipped significantly when Vance began explaining his stance.

Independents were mixed, while Republicans were highly favorable of Vance saying he was ""wrong"" about Trump in the past when confronted about his past criticism of his running mate.

""Sometimes, of course, I've disagreed with the president, but I've also been extremely open about the fact that I was wrong about Donald Trump. I was wrong, first of all, because I believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record,"" Vance said.

When Walz was asked whether he supports abortion up until the ninth month as Minnesota is one of the least restrictive states for abortion, he responded, ""That's not what the bill says.""

While Republican voters dipped significantly as Walz spoke, independent and Democratic voters stayed mostly in the approval zone.

""What we did is restore Roe v. Wade, we made sure that we put women in charge of their health care,"" Walz said.

Independents dipped slightly in approval while Democratic voters shot up during his statement. The two eventually evened out and stayed in the approval zone.

""This is a basic human right,"" he later said.

The independent voters stayed slightly under the Democratic approval line, as Republicans significantly disapproved.

Vance received a positive reaction across the board from Democrats, Republicans and Independents when he told Walz he was sorry his son was once a witness to a shooting.

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting, and I'm sorry about that,"" the senator told Walz.

Independents gave Vance an immediate low rating when he said he was focused on the future after Walz asked him if Trump lost the 2020 election.

Republicans on the Fox News Debate Dial had been unimpressed with Walz's line of questioning and the dial went down, with the approval staying generally the same with Vance's answers, but the dials for independents and Democrats took a sharp dive as Vance brushed off the question. It dove the sharpest among independents.

Liberal media pundits repeatedly played and discussed the clip in the debate's aftermath, saying it was one of Walz's strongest moments in a night that Vance otherwise controlled.

Trump says Walz 'embarrassed himself' compared to Vance's 'brilliance' at VP debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-walz-embarrassed-himself-compared-vances-brilliance-vp-debate,2024-10-02T16:05:42Z,"EXCLUSIVE: Former President Trump said Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz ""embarrassed himself"" during Tuesday night's vice presidential debate, while Sen. JD Vance's steady presentation ""reconfirmed"" his choice to make the senator from Ohio his running mate.

Trump spoke exclusively with Fox News Digital on Wednesday morning, hours after Vance, R-Ohio, and Walz faced off in the CBS News vice presidential debate in New York City. The two sparred on issues like foreign policy, border security, abortion and climate change, while introducing themselves and their records to the American people.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

""JD was fantastic last night -- it just reconfirmed my choice,"" Trump told Fox News Digital. ""There was a brilliance to what he did.""

""On the other hand, Tim Walz proved to be a man that doesn't have it in any way shape or form for the office that he is seeking, though I would put him a large number of steps above Kamala,"" Trump said.

The former president and Republican presidential nominee said Walz ""embarrassed himself and the Democrat Party last night but was made to look even worse by JD's brilliant performance.""

""This is what the country needs; smart people, not people that can't put two sentences together,"" Trump said. ""We have to take our country back.""

Vice presidential debates are traditionally seen as second-tier, but with Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris unlikely to debate again before voters cast their ballots on Nov. 5, the stakes were raised for their running mates as they attempted to tackle the most important issues facing the nation.

CBS News anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan moderated the debate in New York City Tuesday night, which was filled with more substantive policy discussion than personal jabs. Tuesday began with nearly 50,000 unionized dockworkers going on strike from Maine to Texas and ended with Iran launching its largest attack on Israel in history, firing nearly 250 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State.

The first question for Walz and Vance was whether they would support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran.

A visibly shaky Walz had a rough start to the debate, pausing and stumbling over his words as he spoke about the need for ""steady leadership"" from the White House. Instead of answering the question, Walz took a shot at Trump.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz said, pointing to Trump's debate performance against Harris last month. ""It's clear, and the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago. A nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment.""

But Vance, in his first answer, defended Trump, saying he ""delivered stability to the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence.""

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""People were afraid of stepping out of line,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States' global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.""

As for a preemptive strike, Vance said, ""It is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe. And we should support our allies wherever they are, when they're fighting the bad guys.""

Walz fired back. He slammed the Trump administration for pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, saying Iran is ""closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership,"" adding Harris is providing ""steady leadership.""

""You blame Donald Trump, but who has been the vice president for the last 3¬Ω years? And the answer is, your running mate, not mine,"" Vance said.

Vance, again defending Trump, saying he ""consistently made the world more secure.""

""Gov. Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump has already done it once before.""

Vance also urged voters to ask themselves, ""When was the last time that an American president didn't have a major conflict break out?""

""The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was president,"" Vance said.

The debate shifted to the ongoing crisis at the southern border, a top issue for voters.

Vance said he has already been to the border more than ""border czar"" Kamala Harris, while touting Trump's plan to secure the border.

But Walz blasted Trump for his alleged efforts to get Republicans to vote against a border bill.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

""As soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this, Donald Trump said no, told [lawmakers] to vote against it, because it gives him a campaign issue,"" Walz said. ""What would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things?""

On the same topic, moderators asked Vance whether he and Trump would support family separation as part of Trump's proposed ""mass deportation"" should he be elected.

""We have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost,"" Vance explained. ""Some of them have been sex trafficking. Some of them, hopefully, are at homes with their families.

""Some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules. The real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris' wide open southern border. And I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, she said she was going to do this. Real leadership would be saying, 'You know what, I screwed up. We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border policies.' I wish that she would do that. It would be good for all of us.""

As for the issue of abortion, another top issue for voters this cycle, Walz maintained that he and Harris are pro-choice, while Vance said Republicans need to ""do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they, frankly, just don't trust us.""

""And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us, as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies,"" Vance said. ""I want to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family. And I think there's so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options right now."""
Majority of NY Times columnists agree JD Vance won debate: 'Much more forceful speaker',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/majority-ny-times-columnists-agree-jd-vance-won-debate-forceful-speaker,2024-10-02T14:38:02Z,"GOP, Democrat, and Independent voters react in real-time to Ohio Senator JD Vance's claims that he and former President Trump care about the environment during Tuesday night's CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Credit: CBS)

A majority of the 13 columnists and contributors polled by The New York Times agreed that JD Vance won the debate against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday night.

Multiple New York Times columnists, including Binyamin Appelbaum, said that Vance was overall effective in his presentation on the debate stage. Seven of the columnists and contributors said that Vance defeated Walz in the debate, with two saying that the face-off was a draw and three writers concluding that Walz won.

""He made Trumpism sound polite, calm and coherent,"" Appelbaum said of Vance.

GOP LAWMAKERS, LEADERS REACT TO VANCE, WALZ DEBATE: 'SPITTING COLD, HARD TRUTH'

""Vance was far nimbler than the nervous Tim Walz, especially in the first half of the debate. But as the debate went on, Vance stumbled on two issues -- abortion and the 2020 election -- where his rhetorical skill could not salvage the very unappealing material he was working with,"" Josh Barro, author of the newsletter Very Serious, wrote.

""Walz won,"" Times columnist Charles M. Blow wrote. ""You could tell that he was a teacher, because he clearly did his homework. Anyone afraid that Vance would roll over him could breathe easily.""

Newsletter writer Matt Labash said that ""Nobody truly dominated.""

""But I'm giving the slight edge to Walz, since Vance embarrassingly soft-pedaled Jan. 6 and Trump posted this to Truth Social during the debate: 'More Notes! Why Can't Walz just remember what he has to say? Low IQ!' Reminding us that Vance's boss should watch more Hallmark Channel, less Newsmax.""

VANCE, WALZ FACE OFF ON BORDER, CLIMATE CHANGE AND ABORTION DURING VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Other writers said that the debate outcome was more even.

Contributing Times Opinion writer Jane Coaston wrote that ""Vance seemed smoother and more practiced, but 'won' is a very strong term here.""

Times columnist Gail Collins said that the debate was a ""draw"" because ""Walz was so bad in much of his delivery. Vance was a much more forceful speaker while spewing lies on everything from abortion to Biden's foreign policy.""

Contributing Times opinion writer Peter Wehner said that Vance proved he was ""sharp and in command and ... an excellent debater.""

""At times he tried too hard to appear likable; I came away more convinced that he's a hollow man, radioactive and incendiary one day, conciliatory and agreeable the next,"" Wehner said. ""But the 'good Vance' did a lot to repair his tattered image.""

Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital, ""Senator JD Vance completely dominated the debate and showed why we need to return President Trump to the White House."" He added that Trump's vice presidential nominee ""gave clear answers how the Trump-Vance ticket will turn around our economy, secure our southern border, make our streets safe once again, and restore peace in the Middle East.""

Cheung continued by saying that Vance ""exposed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz for being failed, radical leftists who are all slogans with zero substance.""

""He called out Kamala Harris for destroying our southern border. He called out Harris for creating the record inflation making life unaffordable for millions of Americans. And he called out Harris for enabling Iran, leading to the current attacks on Israel,"" the spokesman added.

Members of the legacy media appear to agree that Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz underperformed at the CBS News Vice Presidential debate.

""I think there was a clear lack of preparation and execution on Walz's part,"" CNN anchor Abby Phillip said.

ABC News' Linsey Davis called out Walz's ""uncomfortable, cringey moments,"" linking his debate performance to President Biden's disastrous showing at the CNN debate.

""It kind of reminded me of the June 27 debate when Kamala Harris said that night of Joe Biden 'It was a slow start but a strong finish.' And that's how I felt that Tim Walz kind of did tonight,"" Davis said.

Others made it clear that Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio was the clear winner of the night.

""I would rate that the most successful Republican debate performance of this century, eclipsing Romney in the first debate with Obama in 2012,"" New York Times columnist Ross Douthat said.

""Vance is going home tonight with Walz's wallet. Vance didn't even have to snatch it, Walz just handed it over, along with a bunch of unearned compliments to Vance's fine character,"" The Atlantic's David Frum concluded.

""Vance is winning the debate. He is clearly the best debater of the 4 candidates running for president or vice president. His abortion answer/pivot was masterful,"" former CNN editor-at-large Chris Cillizza said. ""Walz has been fine -- but uneven. His answer on the lie that he was in China during Tiananmen Square was AWFUL.""

""Malpractice that Walz didn't have a sharp, succinct answer to the Tiananmen Square question ready to go,"" The Atlantic writer Tim Alberta similarly noted.

""I say this with love: Democrats are too dependent on friendly treatment from the moderators,"" Washington Post columnist Megan McArdle reacted to Alberta's comment.

Some critics knocked Walz's lack of media exposure leading to his fumbling performance.

""I think the lack of interviews he has done with national media, with local media, it showed,"" said CNN anchor Dana Bash, the only journalist who has interviewed Walz since he joined the Democratic ticket.

""I think that Walz did seem unsteady,"" ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl said. ""And frankly, what I saw is somebody who has not faced questions on a national stage since he became the Democratic nominee. He was simply out of practice. I mean, I don't know why they've done it, but they've kept him out of the limelight. They've kept him away from reporters. They haven't had him do any interviews. And he was clearly unsteady through much of that debate. In contrast, J.D. Vance was very smooth.""

""Hate to say it but Walz would have benefitted from doing a few Sunday morning shows, as Vance has been,"" Financial Times associate editor Edward Luce said.

MSNBC's Rachel Maddow perhaps offered a more charitable take on the debate.

""I wouldn't describe them as evenly matched because they are so different, so different in style and so different on substance,"" Maddow told her MSNBC colleagues.

Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., met face to face on Tuesday night in New York City for the only vice presidential debate before the election.

The event covered a variety of subjects ranging from immigration to climate change to abortion as the two lesser known politicians sought to make their introductions to American voters before election day.

Here are the top moments from the debate:

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

After CBS News' Margaret Brennan offered an impromptu fact-check in response to Vance describing cities being overwhelmed by illegal immigration, noting that many Haitians in Springfield, Ohio have been granted a legal status, Vance hit back at her for violating the terms of the debate.

""Margaret, the rules were that you are not going to fact-check. And since you're fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" he said. ""So there's an application called the CBP one app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand.""

Vance told Walz that he was sorry to hear that his son had been witness to a shooting, in a moment of civility that was particularly frequent during the vice presidential debate. This civility has also been less and less common during presidential debates, which have proven contentious in recent election cycles.

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting, and I'm sorry about that,"" the senator told Walz.

""The American citizens have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border. It is a disgrace, Tim,"" Vance said during the debate.

""And I actually think I agree with you,"" the Ohio senator said, adding, ""I think you want to solve this problem.""

""But I don't think that Kamala Harris does.""

Walz claimed there would be ""a registry of pregnancies"" under what he said was Trump and Vance's Project 2025. The Project 2025 is an endeavor of conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation.

""It's going to make it more difficult, if not impossible, to get contraception and limit access, if not eliminate access, to infertility treatments,"" he said.

But Vance denied this claim. ""No, certainly we won't,"" he pushed back at the statement.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

Walz referred back to his notes in one answer on Tuesday night, after frequently scribbling down observations during the debate.

""Economists can't be trusted. Science can't be trusted. National security folks can't be trusted,"" he listed, referencing Vance's skepticism of those heralded as experts. ""Look, if you're going to be president, you don't have all the answers. Donald Trump believes he does.""

Even Trump poked fun at the noticeable amount of notes that the Minnesota governor was taking, writing on Truth Social, ""Walz is taking so many notes - Never seen a Candidate take more! He needs the notes to keep his brain intact."""

Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance took the same stage for their first and only vice presidential debate this election cycle on Tuesday evening, when the pair had a handful of fiery clashes over top voter concerns.

The CBS News Vice Presidential Debate showcased the two vice presidential candidates' platforms on issues such as the ongoing war raging in the Middle East, abortion laws and their respective tickets' economic records. Amid the 90-minute debate, Vance and Walz had a handful of clashes, including moderators turning off Vance's microphone.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

The CBS debate's rules included leaving microphones on for both candidates no matter who was speaking, breaking from the two presidential debates this cycle that muted microphones when a candidate was not speaking. The outlet, however, reserved the right to turn the microphones off if they felt it was warranted.

Moderators Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell did mute the pair Tuesday when Vance spoke up to complain that the moderators were trying to fact-check him on his remarks regarding illegal immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.

""The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border. It is a disgrace,"" Vance said referring to about immigration issues in a city in his home state.

After Vance and Walz both delivered responses regarding immigration, Brennan told viewers that Springfield ""does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status.""

Vance took issues with the on-air ""fact-check"" before he was muted.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS ADMITS FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP WAS BECAUSE CNN LET HIS STATEMENTS 'HANG' AT FIRST DEBATE

""The rules were that you were not going to fact-check, and since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" Vance said. ""So there's an application called the CBP. One app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand. That is not a person coming in. Applying for a green card and waiting for ten years.""

Moderators tried to quiet Vance before cutting his and Walz's mics.

""Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Margaret Brennan said. ""We have so much we want to get to.""

Walz was forced to answer questions regarding his travel to China during Tuesday night's debate.

Walz has said he was in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets, however, are now reporting that Walz actually did not travel to China until August of that year.

CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan asked Walz to explain the discrepancy.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""Look, I grew up in a small rural Nebraska town, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service,"" a visibly shaky Walz said. ""I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher.""

""I came back home and then started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams. We would take baseball teams. We would take dancers. And we would go back and forth to China,"" Walz said, noting the trips were ""to try and learn.""

""Look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community, and I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect,"" Walz continued.

""And I'm a knucklehead at times.""

Brennan pushed back, reminding Walz of the question and again asking him to explain the discrepancy.

""All I said on this was, as I got there that summer and misspoke on this,"" Walz said. ""So, I will just -- that's what I've said. So, I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests, went in and, from that, I learned a lot of what needed to be in in governance.""

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Walz claimed during the debate that a woman in Georgia likely died due to the state's ""restrictive"" abortion laws after Roe v. Wade was overturned, sparking a clash with Vance.

""There's a young woman named Amber Thurman. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurmond died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights, as basic as the right to control your own body, is determined on geography,"" Walz said during the debate while sparring with Vance on abortion laws.

""There's a very real chance that if Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe v. Wade,"" he said.

Walz's remarks come after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits after the women received chemically induced abortions in 2022.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

Vance shot back that a Minnesota abortion law does not require doctors to save a baby who survives an abortion.

""First of all, governor, I agree with you, Amber Thurman should still be alive, and there are a lot of people who should still be alive. And I certainly wish that she was. And maybe you're free to disagree with me on this and explain this to me. But as I read the Minnesota law that you signed into law, the statute that you signed into law, it says that a doctor who presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide lifesaving care to a baby who survives a botched late term abortion,"" he said.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

""That's not true,"" Walz said.

""Choice or not option that is fundamentally barbaric,"" Vance continued.

The pair also sparred over immigration a handful of times throughout the debate, including Vance slamming Vice President Kamala Harris for her handling of immigration.

""First of all, the gross majority of what we need to do to the southern border is just empowering law enforcement to do their job,"" Vance said during a discussion on the Haitian migrant surge in Springfield, Ohio, and immigration overall.

""I've been to the southern border more than our 'border czar' Kamala Harris has been. And it's actually heartbreaking because the Border Patrol agents, they just want to be empowered to do their job.""

Vance continued by saying that, ""of course, additional resources would help,"" but that the issue is mostly about the Biden administration not empowering law enforcement to say ""if you try to come across the border illegally, you've got to stay in Mexico"" and ""go back through proper channels.""

VANCE RIPS WALZ ON ECONOMY, SAYS HE'S FORCED TO 'PRETEND' TRUMP DIDN'T LOWER INFLATION

""Now, Gov. Walz brought up the community of Springfield, and he's very worried about the things that I've said in Springfield,"" Vance said. ""Look, in Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed. You've got hospitals that are overwhelmed. You've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.

Walz repeatedly argued Trump shut down a Senate immigration bill earlier this year that he believes would have made strengthened border security.

""It is law enforcement that asked for the bill,"" Walz said. ""They helped craft it. They're the ones that supported it. It was because they know we need to do this. Look, this issue of continuing to bring this up, of not dealing with it, of blaming migrants for everything.

""On housing, we could talk a little bit about Wall Street speculators buying up housing and making them less affordable, but it becomes a blame. Look, this bill also gives the money necessary to adjudicate. I agree it should not take seven years for an asylum claim to be done.""

""This bill gets it done in 90 days. Then, you start to make a difference in this, and you start to adhere to what we know, American principles. I don't talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about to the least amongst us, you do unto me. I think that's true of most Americans. They simply want order to it. This bill does it. It's funded. It's supported by the people who do it, and it lets us keep our dignity about how we treat other people.""

The pair of vice presidential candidates also sparred over the threat of censorship on Tuesday, as Walz pressed Vance on the 2020 election and Jan. 6, 2021.

""It's really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th, as we have done for 250 years in this country. We are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election,"" Vance said after Walz cited Jan. 6, when Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol.

""We have to remember that for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections. Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time, and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board. But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had, I don't buy that, governor,"" Vance continued.

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

Walz countered that ""Jan. 6 was not Facebook ads.""

""This idea that there's censorship to stop people from doing, threatening to kill someone, threatening to do something, that's not that's not censorship. Censorship is book banning. We've seen that. We've seen that brought up,"" he continued.

Walz continued that Trump has repeatedly claimed he won the 2020 presidential election.

""Did he lose the 2020 election?"" Walz asked Vance of Trump during the last election cycle.

""Tim, I'm focused on the future,"" Vance replied. ""Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 Covid situation?""

""That is a damning non-answer,"" Walz said. ""I'm pretty shocked by this. He lost the election. This is not a debate, it's not anything anywhere other than in Donald Trump's world.""

""It's a damning non-answer for you to not talk about censorship,"" Vance shot back.

Reactions from conservatives on social media poured in during and following the first and only vice presidential debate on Tuesday night with the majority praising JD Vance for his performance.

""This was a massacre,"" Outkick founder Clay Travis posted on X. ""JD Vance absolutely destroyed Tim Walz.""

""JD Vance just won big,"" conservative commentator Charlie Kirk posted on X along with a video montage of facial reactions by the two candidates. ""And it wasn't even close.""

""Tonight's debate underscored that the Harris-Walz ticket is the most radical in our nation's history,"" Jessica Anderson, President of Sentinel Action Fund, said in a statement.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

""As Governor, Walz implemented his far-left agenda in Minnesota, with soft-on-crime policies, authoritarian COVID lockdowns, and support for limitless abortion. As Vice President, he will expand his extremism beyond Minnesota as the unapologetic wingman for Kamala Harris.""

""Vance absolutely crushed it tonight and secured a very bright future in the GOP,"" American Principles Project President Terry Schilling posted on X.

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

The Harris campaign released a statement following the debate expressing why it believes that Walz, not Vance, had the strongest night.

""Tonight, Governor Walz showed exactly why Vice President Harris picked him: he is a leader who cares about the issues that matter most to the American people,"" Harris-Walz Campaign Chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a statement. ""In the debate, Americans got to see a real contrast: a straight talker focused on sharing real solutions, and a slick politician who spent the whole night defending Donald Trump's division and failures.""

""On every single issue - the economy, health care, foreign policy, reproductive freedom, gun violence - Governor Walz won. He spoke passionately about the Vice President's vision for a new way forward for the country. And in what was the most critical moment of the entire debate, which came in its final exchange, he stood up for our Constitution, while JD Vance admitted he'd put Trump ahead of the country.""

O'Malley Dillon continued, ""The choice facing the American people in November was on full display tonight: between charting a new way forward, or going backwards. Vice President Harris believes that the American people deserve to see her and Trump on the debate stage one more time. She will be in Atlanta on October 23 - Donald Trump should step up and face the voters.""

The Trump campaign said in a statement that Vance ""unequivocally won tonight's debate in dominating fashion"" in what was ""the best debate performance from any Vice-Presidential candidate in history.""

""Senator Vance spoke the truth, eloquently prosecuted the case against Kamala Harris' failed record, and effectively held Governor Tim Walz accountable for his lies on behalf of the Harris-Biden Administration,"" Trump senior advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said. ""Senator Vance also perfectly articulated the Trump-Vance vision to make America safe again with their plan to launch the largest mass deportation operation in history; to make America strong again with a peace through strength foreign policy agenda; and to make America wealthy again by cutting taxes, unleashing American energy dominance, and ending inflation.""

""Tonight, Senator Vance proved why President Trump chose him as his running mate. Together, they make the strongest and most dynamic presidential ticket ever, and they are going to win on November 5th."""
New Jersey Democrat proposes bill to create travel advisories to inform pregnant women of state abortion laws,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-jersey-democrat-proposes-bill-create-travel-advisories-inform-pregnant-women-state-abortion-laws,2024-10-02T07:37:38Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

A New Jersey Democrat introduced legislation establishing travel advisories informing women of restrictive abortion laws in other states they may be visiting.

The bill, proposed by state Sen. John Burzichelli, would require New Jersey's health and state departments to launch a website that would list color codes for states depending on how restrictive their abortion laws are, according to NJ Spotlight News.

""If you're an individual, a woman, traveling across this country for business -- or if you're thinking about going to school in Mississippi [for instance] -- it will help you to know what kind of medical services are available to you should you need emergency care of some kind,"" Burzichelli told the outlet.

The color codes under the ""Reproductive Health Travel Advisory"" are blue, yellow and red.

GEORGIA JUDGE OVERTURNS STATE'S SIX-WEEK 'HEARTBEAT' ABORTION LAW, CALLS IT 'UNCONSTITUTIONAL'

Blue would mean women can exercise normal caution and access to abortion would be available without fear of civil or criminal prosecution, and yellow would mean women should exercise increased caution as abortion restrictions could result in civil or criminal prosecution. Red would mean women are urged to reconsider travel because abortion access is extremely restricted and could result in medical issues and civil or criminal prosecution.

""Right now, there's no single place to go to say, 'OK I have to travel. I have to go to Texas and then move over and go to Tennessee,'"" Burzichelli said. ""You don't have that info at your fingertips. You can find it, but it's a hodge-podge.""

""You, as an American female, do not have equal rights across all 50 states,"" he added. ""And it's important for you to know what rights you don't have when you go somewhere, because something unexpected could happen.""

JUDGE BLOCKS NY AG LETITIA JAMES FROM TRYING TO SILENCE PREGNANCY CENTERS THAT PROMOTE ABORTION PILL REVERSAL

The proposal comes after the U.S. Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in 2022, returning the power to make laws on abortion access back to the states.

Following the ruling, a number of Republican-controlled states enacted laws restricting abortion access, with some exceptions such as in cases of medical emergencies, while some Democrat-controlled states have approved advanced protections of abortion access.

""It's hard to imagine we're even talking about this in 2024 in America,"" Burzichelli said. ""To think that we have to think about even doing this just speaks volumes about where we are at the moment,""

New Jersey expanded access to abortion, enacting statutory protection for abortion as a fundamental right, and the state's highest court ruled the ""fundamental right of a woman to control her body and destiny"" is protected under the state's constitution, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights.

The state also welcomes women who travel from other states for an abortion because their own states have bans in place. Additionally, the Garden State protects them from being extradited after the procedure."
Vance vs. Walz debate: Top takeaways from VP candidates' face-off,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/vance-vs-walz-debate-top-takeaways-from-vp-candidates-face-off,2024-10-02T05:50:19Z,"In recent weeks, Tim Walz' team tried to lower expectations for his debate with rival JD Vance. Now we know why.

Democratic vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Walz did not turn in a disastrous performance on the debate stage, but he was clearly outclassed by Ohio Sen. Vance. Trump supporters who have questioned the young Ohio senator's qualifications for the nation's second-highest office, or asked why the former president chose him to be his running mate, slept better on Tuesday night. He was sharp, appealing, and policy-savvy. Most important, Vance totally upended the media's unflattering characterization of him by being sympathetic, respectful and likeable.

Vance had the advantage of having held dozens of press interviews in recent weeks; he was ready and tested. By contrast, Walz has done almost no unscripted encounters with the media since he became the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate; his inability to go beyond talking points and delve deep into policy was not surprising.

VANCE, WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENDS WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TOUTING 'NEW' FUTURE

Walz spent much of the debate talking about programs he claimed to have successfully enacted in Minnesota, like paid family leave. What he was supposed to do on Tuesday night was make the case for running mate Vice President Kamala Harris.

Over and over during the nearly two hour debate, Vance asked the most salient question, also posed by Trump during his debate. Harris has been in the White House for the past three and a half years - why hasn't she moved forward on the policies she now claims will solve the nation's problems?

As with the ABC presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, the CBS News moderators embarrassed themselves by clearly favoring the Democrat contestant. Moreover, CBS' Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell affected a grating school-marmish tone, overly eager to chaperone what was an extremely orderly debate.

Their questions featured well-worn Democrat priorities (climate change, abortion) and they largely avoided topics that could have played well for Vance, like crime. O'Donnell challenged the senator on Trump formerly calling climate change a ""hoax"" and then asserted gratuitously that ""the overwhelming consensus is that the climate is changing.""

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

Moreover, having said they would not fact-check the candidates, the two women intervened more than once to question a response from Vance, while doing so only one time with Walz.

Unhappily for the Minnesota governor, that one probing question was calamitous. Asked why he had falsely claimed to be in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Walz launched into a word salad that would have made Kamala Harris proud, talking about his experiences traveling in China. Asked again to answer why he had been untruthful, Walz misfired and looked stunned. In effect, he was caught out in a lie. Since he has a history of spinning falsehoods about his past, and especially about his military rank, this was not helpful.

Vance, like Walz, was meant to argue the case for his running mate, and that he did. When the moderators and Walz derided Trump's claim during the presidential debate that he had the ""concept of a plan"" on health care, Vance said that Trump did not have a plan - he had a record. More than once during the evening he reminded the audience that during Trump's presidency inflation was low, the border was closed and the world was at peace.

KAMALA HARRIS MAKES A DESPERATE MOVE ON A CRITICAL ISSUE TO SAVE A SINKING CAMPAIGN

When moderator Margaret Brennan pushed Vance to explain why Trump had abandoned the Iran nuclear deal, thus purportedly allowing the terror state to speed up its efforts to build a nuclear weapon, Vance noted that for the past three-plus years Harris and Biden have been in charge. He rightly pointed out that they helped rebuild Iran's ability to wage war by not enforcing the Trump sanctions, thus allowing the mullahs to grow their income by $100 billion. With Iran just having attacked Israel with 180 missiles, Vance's referencing the Reagan-Trump doctrine of peace through strength resonated.

While Walz repeated Harris' vague promises about making life better for middle class families, Vance reminded the audience that take-home pay had risen under Trump and inflation was low, while under Harris, prices on everything from food to housing had shot up more than 20%. When Walz claimed economists backed Harris' plan over Trump's, Vance responded that Trump didn't have Ph.D.s on his team, he had common sense.

When Walz accused Trump of wanting to enact tariffs on imports, which would serve as a new tax on Americans, Vance congratulated President Joe Biden on keeping the former president's tariffs on China in place, defusing the issue.

Over and over during the nearly two hour debate, Vance asked the most salient question, also posed by Trump during his debate. Harris has been in the White House for the past three and a half years - why hasn't she moved forward on the policies she now claims will solve the nation's problems?

Vance clearly won the dispute over the border, noting that Harris had bragged for three years about undoing all the restrictions that Trump put in place. When Brennan challenged Vance on how Trump would handle separating families while carrying out deportations, Vance referred to the horrifying report that the Department of Homeland Security has lost track of more than 320,000 children brought across the border illegally - a damning and heartbreaking situation that has resulted from Harris' open border.

Not surprisingly, the debate got heated on the subject of abortion. Vance criticized the Minnesota law signed by Walz that does not require the doctor to do everything necessary for the care of a baby that survives a late-term abortion. Walz disputed the characterization, but Vance is correct. Walz, meanwhile, charged Vance with having earlier backed a 15-week national abortion ban. Vance explained that he shares Trump's view that the states are now charged with setting the regulations.

The candidates sparred on other topics, and took expected swipes at each other's running mates, but both maintained their composure and even agreed that on some issues, like school safety, they could likely find some common ground. Especially given the Harris-Walz strategy of avoiding scrutiny and trying to hide their progressive agendas, it was an unusually useful event for America's voters.

The winner of the night, without a doubt, was JD Vance. Will it matter? After all, many argue that no one votes for the V.P. But voters tell pollsters they do not enough about Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.

Now they know more, and on the basis of Tuesday night's performance, Vance might have won over a few folks. With the race a dead heat, everything matters."

Ohio Sen. JD Vance's argument that the U.S. needed to ""stop the bleeding"" at the border during Tuesday's debate elicited a mixed response from voters,

""Before we talk about deportations, we have to stop the bleeding,"" Vance argued during Tuesday's debate. ""We have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies.""

According to Fox News debate dials, which measure how Republican, Democrat, and Independent voters are responding to particular answers by candidates during the debate, the response by Vance received mixed responses.

While Republican views of Vance's answers had an immediate positive response, Democratic viewers of the debate went in an opposite direction, the dials showed. Independents, meanwhile, hovered around 50% approval with Vance's answer.

Voters began to see Vance's response in a more positive light when he touched on former President Donald Trump's border policies, arguing that the next administration should return to handling the border similar to how Trump did during his four years in office.

Voters also responded well to Vance's remarks on deportation, where the Ohio Senator argued in favor of focusing on those who have committed crimes in addition to crossing the border illegally.

JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walz's performances at the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

The largely civil and arguably quite informative debate between Democratic nominee Gov. Tim Walz and Republican nominee Sen. JD Vance on Tuesday night has underscored one thing. We need another presidential debate.

Both Walz and Vance stuck to familiar positions on the issues on the debate stage, whether it was on the economy, health care, energy or immigration. No new ground was broken, no dramatic changes in policy were unveiled.

Still, the debate, in my estimation, was very important for a fundamental reason: it was civil, it was informative, and it included a surprisingly high degree of bipartisanship that has been noticeably absent from the 2024 presidential race.

It is certain that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump watched the debate. And both, I am sure, concluded that their respective running mates did an excellent job in both underscoring their core positions as well as attacking their rivals.

VANCE, WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENDS WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TOUTING 'NEW' FUTURE

But most importantly, on Tuesday night there was a comment that I think both candidates underscored in their own way: That we can do better as Americans, we can solve our problems and provide leadership as people who disagree, and sometimes vigorously, but have a broader purpose beyond our narrow partisan concerns.

The nearly two-hour event underscored this key point: you can't just run on joy and you can't just run on bitterness about what has happened in the past.

This is not simply a homily. It's much more. It is a large-scale call for a different kind of politics, even if implicitly made by both candidates, it is a recognition of the extraordinary challenges we face, both domestically and internationally, in the wake of Iran's attack on Israel. And most of all, it underscores to me why both presidential candidates need to quickly accept the invitation of various news networks for another debate or more debates in the final 35 days of this campaign.

It's virtually certain that no minds were changed on Tuesday night.

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

To be sure, the pundits will be vetting what the candidates said or didn't say about immigration and abortion. Two topics on which they disagree vehemently. But the two vice presidential candidates were largely repeating and underscoring what their respective nominees have said and believe.

The key now is for the media to focus on what the American people want and require as this extraordinary race comes down to the finish line. The two presidential campaigns need to face off, at least once, if not more times, to discuss and debate their positions on the issues with a greater degree of specificity and precision than they have done previously.

The 2024 presidential race is now an effective statistical tie. This is especially true when one looks at the seven key swing states in this election. There is a degree of uncertainty about precisely where the candidates stand on the important issues facing our country after a raucous presidential debate last month that was more personally divisive than it was informative.

JD VANCE REMINDS CBS MODERATORS OF DEBATE RULES AFTER THEY TRY TO FACT-CHECK HIM

For us to make an informed choice as Americans, we need to replicate what happened on Tuesday night with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The two presidential candidates need to tell us, in programmatic terms, what they will do on the economy, immigration, crime, health care, energy and, of course, on foreign affairs, a critical topic which did not get anywhere near the attention it deserved and required.

The level of dissatisfaction of the American electorate with the candidates and with the political process cannot be overestimated. We saw what the American people deserve but have not received until now in this presidential election.

The nearly two-hour event underscored this key point: you can't just run on joy and you can't just run on bitterness about what has happened in the past.

Both vice presidential candidates were likable on Tuesday night. Vance had heretofore not been seen that way. On the debate stage, it was hard not to empathize with him, even if you disagreed with him. Likewise, Walz delivered as a likable everyman figure.

I came away from the presidential debate last month not wanting to have dinner with either Trump or Harris. After the V.P. debate, I wanted to get to know both candidates better.

My takeaway from Tuesday night is that, for virtually the first time in this election cycle, Vance and Walz quietly acknowledged that the electorate requires something more before Election Day. It's up to Trump and Harris to give it to them--in person--at least one more time, if not more."

JD Vance addresses the Iran Nuclear Deal during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Democrat vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz faced off Tuesday night in their first -- and only -- debate, sparring over issues from foreign policy to border security; abortion to climate change; and introducing themselves and their records to the American people with just five weeks to Election Day.

Vice presidential debates are traditionally seen as second-tier, but with former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris unlikely to debate again before voters cast their ballots on Nov. 5th, the stakes were raised for their running mates as they attempted to tackle the most important issues facing the nation.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

CBS News anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan moderated the debate in New York City Tuesday night, which was filled with more substantive policy discussion than personal jabs, on a day that began with nearly 50,000 unionized dock workers going on strike from Maine to Texas and ended with Iran launching its largest attack on Israel in history, firing nearly 250 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State.

The first question for Walz and Vance was whether they would support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran.

A visibly shaky Walz had a tough start to the debate, pausing and stumbling over his words as he spoke about the need for ""steady leadership"" from the White House. Instead of answering the question, Walz took a shot at Trump.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz said, pointing to Trump's debate performance against Harris last month. ""It's clear, and the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago, a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment.""

But Vance, in his first answer, defended Trump, saying he ""delivered stability to the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence.""

""People were afraid of stepping out of line,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.""

As for a preemptive strike, Vance said ""it is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe.""

""And we should support our allies wherever they are, when they're fighting the bad guys,"" Vance said.

Walz fired back, slamming the Trump administration for pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, saying Iran is ""closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership,"" while saying Harris is providing ""steady leadership.""

But Vance fired back.

""You blame Donald Trump, but who has been the vice president for the last three and a half years? And the answer is, your running mate -- not mine,"" Vance said.

Vance, again defending Trump, said he ""consistently made the world more secure.""

""Gov. Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump has already done it once before.""

Vance also urged voters to ask themselves ""when was the last time that an American president didn't have a major conflict break out?""

""The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was president,"" Vance said.

The debate shifted to the ongoing crisis at the southern border -- a top issue for voters.

Vance said he has already been to the border more than ""border czar"" Kamala Harris, while touting Trump's plan to secure the border.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

But Walz blasted Trump for his alleged efforts to get Republicans to vote against a border bill.

""As soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this, Donald Trump said no. told [lawmakers] to vote against it, because it gives him a campaign issue,"" Walz said. ""What would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things?""

On the same topic, moderators asked Vance whether he and Trump would support family separation as part of Trump's proposed ""mass deportation"" should he be elected.

""We have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost,"" Vance explained. ""Some of them have been sex trafficking; some of them, hopefully are at homes with their families; some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules,"" Vance said. ""The real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris's wide open southern border. And I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, she said she was going to do this. Real leadership would be saying, you know what, I screwed up. We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border policies. I wish that she would do that. It would be good for all of us.""

Walz pushed back, saying children have not been used as ""drug mules,"" and defending Harris, saying she was attorney general in California and ""prosecuted transnational gangs for human trafficking and drugs.""

Walz also hit Vance over claims he had made about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, saying he had demonized them.

""Look in Springfield Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans,"" Vance said.

At that point, moderators tried to correct Vance--but the GOP vice presidential nominee pushed back, reminding that the moderators said they would not fact-check the candidates.

The moderators said that many Haitian residents in Springfield, Ohio have legal temporary status. Vance jumped in to ""say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process and tying it to a Harris-backed process, the moderators spoke over him, sarcastically thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Tim Walz attempted to argue with him.

""We have so much we have to get to, thank you so much for explaining the legal process,"" Margaret Brennan said before asking her co-moderator to ask the next question.

As for the issue of abortion, another top issue for voters this cycle, Walz maintained that he and Harris are pro-choice, while Vance said Republicans need to ""do so much better of a job at earning the American People's Trust back on this issue, where they frankly, just don't trust us.""

""And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies,"" Vance said. ""I want to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family. And I think there's so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options right now.""

Vance echoed Trump's view of abortion--supporting the Supreme Court's decision to return the issue of abortion back to the states, while supporting exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: TRUMP MAINTAINS LEAD ON 2 TOP ISSUES AHEAD OF VP DEBATE

""The proper way to handle this, as messy as democracy sometimes is, is to let voters make these decisions,"" Vance said. ""Let the individual states make their abortion policy. And I think that's what makes the most sense in a very big a very diverse. And let's be honest, sometimes a very, very messy and divided country.""

Meanwhile, the moderators switched to questions of leadership -- with the moderators pressing Walz on whether he was actually in China for the Tiananmen Square protests, like he claimed.

A visibly nervous Walz attempted to explain the discrepancy, ultimately saying he ""misspoke"" and was not there until later that year.

And the question for Vance was about his past criticisms of Trump.

Vance said, at the time, he disliked Trump because he ""believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record.""

""Donald Trump delivered for the American people rising wages, rising take-home pay, an economy that worked for normal Americans, a secure southern border. A lot of things, frankly, that I didn't think he'd be able to deliver on. And yeah, when you screw up, when you misspeak, when you get something wrong and you change your mind, you ought to be honest with the American people about it,"" Vance said.

Meanwhile, Vance offered his sympathies to Walz during the section of the debate focused on gun violence, when he learned that Walz's son had witnessed a shooting.

Walz said his 17-year-old son ""witnessed a shooting at a community center playing volleyball.""

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting. I'm sorry about that -- Christ, have mercy,"" Vance said.

The two spoke about school shootings and their plans to solve gun violence.

""We have to make the doors locked better. We have to make the doors stronger. We've got to make the windows stronger, and of course, we've got to increase school resource officers. Because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience,"" Vance said.

Walz said the conversation was a good start but had to go further.

""Even though they have a high gun ownership rate in the country, there are reasonable things that we can do to make a difference. It's not infringing on your Second Amendment. And the idea to have some of these weapons out there, it just doesn't make any sense,"" he said.

And on another top issue this cycle: democracy.

Vance was pushed on his past comments, in which he said he would not have voted to certify the 2020 election results on Jan. 6, 2021.

Vance fired back at the assertion that Trump could pose a ""threat to democracy,"" saying that he believes ""we actually do have a threat to democracy in this country.""

""But unfortunately, it's not the threat to democracy that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz want to talk about. It is the threat of censorship. It's Americans casting aside lifelong friendships because of disagreements over politics. It's big technology companies silencing their fellow citizens,"" Vance said.

Walz redirected the discussion back to Jan. 6, 2021, blasting Trump and Republicans for allegedly denying the events of that day.

""I will tell you this, that when this is over, we need to shake hands this election and the winner needs to be the winner. This has got to stop. It's tearing our country apart,"" Walz said.

But Vance replied, saying it is ""really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th.""

""As we have done for 250 years in this country, we are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election. And of course, I hope that we win, and I think we're going to win,"" Vance said. ""But if Tim Walz is the next vice president, he'll have my prayers. He'll have my best wishes and he'll have my help whenever he wants it.""

But Vance reminded Americans that ""for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections.""

""Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time, and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board,"" Vance said. ""But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had, I don't buy that, governor.""

As the debate came to a close, Vance and Walz both promised voters a new direction for the United States.

""Kamala Harris is bringing us a new way forward,"" Walz said. ""She's bringing us a politics of joy. She's bringing real solutions for the middle class. And she's centering you at the heart of that, all the while asking everyone, join this movement. Make your voices heard.""

Vance also gave a message of change to the voters.

""We need change. We need a new direction. We need a president who has already done this once before and did it well. Please vote for Donald Trump,"" Vance said. ""And whether you vote for me or vote for Tim Walz, I just want to say I'm so proud to be doing this and I'm rooting for you.

Walz came into the debate with better poll numbers than Vance.

According to the latest Fox News national poll, Walz was slightly above water with a 43% favorable rating and a 40% unfavorable rating. Vance stood in negative territory, at 38%-50% favorable/unfavorable.

Heading into the debate, Vance had been very talkative, sitting for scores of interviews and taking plenty of questions from reporters on the campaign trail.

Both running mates get right back on the campaign trail on Wednesday in two of the key seven battleground states that will likely determine whether Harris or Trump succeed President Biden in the White House.

Vance holds campaign events in Auburn Hills and Marne, Michigan. And Walz takes part in a campaign bus tour swing through parts of central Pennsylvania which kicks off at the airport in Harrisburg, the state capital."
Walz repeats Georgia abortion death falsehood decried by doctors as 'fearmongering',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/walz-repeats-georgia-abortion-death-falsehood-decried-doctors-fearmongering,2024-10-02T03:19:45Z,"Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., discusses abortion access during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz claimed during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate that a woman in Georgia likely died due to the state's ""restrictive"" abortion laws following the overturning of Roe, despite doctors previously denouncing such a narrative as ""fearmongering.""

""There's a young woman named Amber Thurman. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurmond died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights, as basic as the right to control your own body, is determined on geography,"" Walz said during the debate while sparring with Vance on abortion laws.

""There's a very real chance that if Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe versus Wade,"" he said.

Walz joined Ohio Sen. JD Vance in New York City on Tuesday evening where the pair squared off on key voter issues this election cycle, including the economy, immigration and abortion.

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Walz's remarks come after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits after the women received chemically induced abortions in 2022. Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

Members of the Democratic Party, including Vice President Kamala Harris, have cited their deaths as evidence for the need to expand abortion access following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.

""Good policy, logical policy, moral policy, humane policy is about saying a healthcare provider will only start providing that care when you're about to die?"" Harris said during an Atlanta campaign event last month, while citing Thurman's death.

OB-GYNs have since criticized the narrative as a misleading story that is being pushed by the media and Democrats.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

""I was not surprised to see this pro-abortion media try to point the blame at Georgia's pro-life laws, but, in fact, Georgia's laws allow doctors to intervene to save the life of the woman,"" Charlotte Lozier Institute Vice President and Director of Medical Affairs Dr. Ingrid Skop recently told Fox News Digital.

""I think the focus of the Democratic Party upon abortion as an issue is only because the American people do not understand the laws. Many times, women are hurt by abortions. It is not necessary for women to live their best life. And, of course, it's the fearmongering and lies that have led us to this place where we are today, where people even think there would be a reason to point at the law.""

Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., and state Rep. Mark Newton have also come out to say they don't believe Georgia laws had anything to do with Thurman's death, but was instead caused by alleged complications from abortion pills, as doctors may have waited too long to intercede.

HARRIS CALLS FOR ELIMINATING FILIBUSTER TO PASS 'ROE' ABORTION BILL INTO FEDERAL LAW

""We never deny a woman an abortion because it's going to harm her in some way. She will always be protected,"" McCormick said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital.

""You have every right to an abortion, even with that heartbeat law,"" he continued. ""So, let's make that very clear right now. When they say there's no exceptions, there's never any law in any state where there's no exceptions. That doesn't exist. That's simply not the way it works. The mother's life is always protected. With that said, it doesn't mean it's easy to get an abortion just because you have a complication or because something goes wrong.""

Disgraced ex-CBS New anchor Dan Rather says old network looking to avoid 'blowback' ABC received,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/dan-rather-says-ex-employer-looking-avoid-blowback-abc-received-fact-checking,2024-10-02T01:18:17Z,"""Saturday Night Live"" had some fun at the expense of ABC News and its anchor David Muir for their ""biased"" presidential debate earlier this month.

Former CBS News anchor Dan Rather scolded his former employer for declining to fact-check during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate, saying the network is ""trying to avoid the blowback ABC got"" for fact-checking former President Trump.

Rather stepped down from his role as CBS' evening news anchor in 2005 and eventually left the network the following year after reporting a discredited story about then-President George W. Bush. He took to Substack Monday ahead of his old employer hosting the CBS Vice Presidential Debate between Sen. JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walz, which will be moderated by Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell.

""There are few guarantees in life, but odds are that more than one lie will be told by Donald Trump's protege and running mate, JD Vance. If there's one thing Vance has learned from Trump, it's that lying to get ahead is OK. If you get caught, just double down and lie some more. Who's going to fact check you? Well, apparently not CBS News,"" Rather wrote.

ABC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: MODERATORS DAVID MUIR AND LINSEY DAVIS FACT-CHECK TRUMP 5 TIMES, 0 FOR HARRIS

Rather said he was ""reluctant"" to criticize CBS News, where he worked for 45 years, but he feels it is necessary. His call for fact-checking come after ABC News was widely criticized for correcting Trump multiple times but failing to fact-check Vice President Kamala Harris during the recent presidential debate.

""With that as background, it is necessary to report and comment on the fact that CBS News has decided not to fact-check the candidates in real time. I would love to know what went into this decision, because it feels spineless, especially after ABC's Linsey Davis and David Muir effectively and correctly fact-checked Trump during the debate with Kamala Harris,"" Rather wrote.

""CBS says it is up to the candidates to fact-check, though 'the moderators will facilitate those opportunities' during rebuttal time,"" he continued. ""While both fact-checking (ABC during the Harris-Trump debate) and not fact-checking (CNN during the Biden-Trump debate) have drawn criticism this year, for the most part, the criticism was unsurprisingly partisan.""

Rather noted that CBS News would fact-check the candidates online, but dismissed viewers for being able to follow along in real time.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH ABORTION FACT-CHECK AGAINST TRUMP: 'COMPLETELY INTERJECTS HERSELF'

""Simply put, this 'rule,' imposed by CBS, incentivizes lying. It invites the participants to bend the truth, since their opponent then has to spend his rebuttal time calling out the lie, rather than giving an opposing view. And the calling out of a lie by an opponent rather than an impartial moderator is less credible,"" Rather wrote.

""It seems clear that CBS is trying to avoid the blowback ABC got after the presidential debate. A journalist, much less a news organization, should not be afraid to take heat,"" Rather continued. ""Their responsibility is to call out lies. If they don't do that on live television, during the most consequential election in modern history, they are the lesser for it. But the biggest loser is the American electorate.""

CBS News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Biden has 'privately complained' about how quickly Democrats have moved on from him: Report,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-has-privately-complained-about-how-quickly-democrats-have-moved-from-him-report,2024-10-01T18:29:04Z,"President Biden had some fun on ""The View"" by pretending to squash former President Trump like a bug and said his former rival has no ""redeeming value.""

A new report disclosed that President Biden is feeling left out in the cold by the Democratic Party after going all in on Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign.

According to the Monday NBC News report, Biden has mentioned to his allies his feeling that his accomplishments and legacy as president are being forgotten by the party, especially as Harris has tried to distance herself away from her boss' policies and forge her own political identity after replacing him on the Democratic presidential ticket.

""President Joe Biden has privately complained to allies that his name and his accomplishments have virtually disappeared from the national conversation and about how quickly the party that he has served for more than five decades appears to have moved on from him, according to six people familiar with his comments,"" the piece reported.

PELOSI DEMURS ON IF 'EVERYTHING IS OK' BETWEEN HER AND BIDEN: 'YOU'D HAVE TO ASK HIM'

According to these sources, the president has commented on Harris not mentioning him during recent campaign speeches, noting that he believes she should acknowledge his economic accomplishments while touting her own vision on the issue.

""Biden has noted at times that Vice President Kamala Harris... hasn't been mentioning him in her campaign speeches lately, including when she talks about an economy he believes his policies set on a positive trajectory, these people said,"" according to NBC.

Additionally, the sources told NBC that Biden ""was particularly stung"" by Harris' recent line during her debate with former President Trump in which she drew a stark distinction between her and her boss.

""Clearly, I am not Joe Biden. And I am certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country,"" the vice president said during the debate, drawing a stark contrast between her and Biden's policies, as Trump was trying to grill her over the current administration's record.

Those familiar with Biden's feelings on the matter acknowledged that he still wants Harris to win and ""that he plans to do whatever he can to help her,"" the report noted.

An anonymous senior Harris campaign official said that Biden ""always just says to her, 'The most important thing is that you win.'"" The official added, ""We have to tell people who she is and what she would do.""

They also noted, ""There wasn't a real interest in hearing about [Biden's] accomplishments when he was running. That's still the case.""

However, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates denied the claims made by these sources, telling the outlet, ""These uninformed claims are the polar opposite of the truth.""

""President Biden welcomes the strong response the American people are having to Vice President Harris' leadership and to policies that move us into the future, away from dangerous agendas from the past like MAGAnomics and abortion bans,"" Bates added.

The spokesperson doubled down on his rejection of these claims, telling Fox News Digital they are ""not"" true.

The sources have said that Biden understands the political reasoning behind shifting away from his record, though they noted it still ""frustrates him at times.""

""But while Biden is attuned to political realities, he also has expressed a range of emotions about his exit from the race -- from feeling his legacy rests on a Harris victory to anguishing over his imprint's vanishing from the national stage, according to the people familiar with his private comments,"" the article stated.

One source described his mixed emotions on the issue, stating, ""It's very complex.""

Another Harris campaign official defended Harris' pivot away from Biden, telling NBC, ""She has to become her own person. She needs to do that to win.""

Despite Biden's acceptance of Harris' candidacy, he maintains that he would have beaten Trump in November if he was still in the race. He told the co-hosts of ""The View"" last week that he was ""confident"" he could have beaten Trump and said he didn't sense an ""overwhelming reluctance"" about his re-election effort from fellow Democrats.

""I was confident I would beat Trump -- he's a loser,"" he declared.

DAVID MARCUS: The Vance vs. Walz debate is best scored using boxing rules,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-vance-vs-walz-debate-best-scored-using-boxing-rules,2024-10-01T17:53:41Z,"DEBATE DAY: Live coverage begins today at 8 p.m. ET for the Fox News Simulcast of the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate.

The first rule of deciding who won a major political debate is that nobody wins a major political debate. There is no final score as the buzzer sounds, no final wink to be tiddled, it is a purely subjective matter. And that will be true of the vice-presidential debate between Republican nominee JD Vance and Democratic nominee Tim Walz.

That having been said, I've recently adopted a method of scoring debates from the world of pugilistics, that I think actually gives a pretty decent assessment of what most American voters see.

My advice in picking a winner is to borrow the scoring system of a boxing match. The basic rules are relatively simple. In each round the boxer who wins the 3 minutes gets 10 points, the loser gets 9, unless there is a knockdown or it is overwhelming, in which case the round is scored 10-8. A tie is 10-10.

Obviously, a knockout ends the fight.

HEIGHTENED 'SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPORTANCE' AS VANCE, WALZ FACE OFF IN VP DEBATE

I first tried this approach last month with the Trump vs. Harris debate. And I wound up with Trump winning 157 to 150. It wasn't the only reason I thought and wrote that night that Trump won the debate, despite overwhelming media insistence that girl boss Kamala had kicked ass. But it was part of it.

And with polling showing no significant bump for Harris since their face-off and the fact that we've even seen some Trump swing state surge since their debate, my ostentatious declaration of a Trump victory looks a little less crazy today.

The legacy news media, who wanted any excuse to hand Harris a W anyway, viewed the t√™te-√†-t√™te as a kind of Lifetime movie in which Harris had finally spoken truth to power, but I find in most of America that narrative doesn't have a whole lot of purchase. The voters want answers.

THE WHO, WHAT, WHERE, AND WHEN OF TUESDAY'S JD VANCE-TIM WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

That's where boxing scoring comes in. If openings, closings, and each question, are the ""rounds"" of the debate, you wind up with about 15. See what I'm saying? The incremental 10-9 or 10-8 scores of each, mirror the nuance of how swayable voters watch the event.

The basic philosophy behind boxing scoring is that the primary job is to survive the round, so if you manage that, you get an automatic 8 points, winning the round, and can only bump that up by at most 2.

One could argue there is a fundamental unfairness here, that if I am 40 percent better at landing punches in a round than my opponent, I only get a 10 percent point advantage in scoring, but that is also the beauty of the system. Fights aren't just about math.

This actually tracks very well with how political debates work.

The audience, which is to say the voters, do tend to see each question or issue as one round, and if Walz can get a 10-8 on abortion, or Vance can on the border, that goes a long way towards the kind of 7 point win I gave Trump over Harris.

Another way to think of this is that 90 percent of Americans likely already know who they are voting for, only 10 percent can be swayed, and boxing's unique scoring system almost perfectly corresponds to this.

Eighty to 90 percent we are just scoring as a wash.

There is, of course, the chance of a knockout, but these days, that chance seems remote. Back when Reagan said ""There you go again,"" or Obama, in retrospect wrongly, told Romney the 1980s wanted their foreign policy back over fears regarding Russia, the possibility of something near consensus on the question existed.

Those days are no longer with us, if they aren't over forever.

Nobody really wins a debate, but we can still score them, we can still pay close attention to who is and isn't actually answering the questions, and that has a lot of value.

So give a shot, grab a pad and paper, if you still have those, and just jot down your score for each question, 10-10, 10-9 or 10-8. Like a Ouija board your political leanings might push the pen a bit, but even so, you might be surprised by the results.

As Mike Tyson once put it, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. Let's keep a close eye on the flying rhetorical hands of Tim Walz and JD Vance."
Fox News Power Rankings: Trump maintains lead on 2 top issues ahead of VP debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/power-rankings-trump-maintains-lead-two-top-issues-ahead-vp-debate,2024-10-01T13:08:36Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance are hours away from the first and only vice presidential debate.

As the latest Fox News Power Rankings reveal, Vance starts the evening with a lead on the economy and immigration, while Walz has an advantage on abortion.

Vice presidential hopefuls do not attract as much attention as their bosses when they debate, but as Fox News' Arnon Mishkin argued Monday, they have changed the direction of at least six elections in the last 50 years.

In most cases, these debates are won on policy. Voters are not as familiar with these nominees as they are with former President Donald Trump or even Vice President Kamala Harris, and they do not need to make their choice.

The smart play for these vice presidential candidates is to focus on the major issues at stake and how their administrations would solve them.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: HARRIS TICKS UP AND SENATE REPUBLICANS TAKE CHARGE

That is especially true for Walz on the economy and immigration, since the Harris campaign continues to lag on those issues. Vance, meanwhile, has struggled with poor favorability ratings, so his challenge is to hammer the popular parts of the Trump agenda and avoid wading into the culture war trenches.

There are also style points up for grabs. Many voters will only ever see this debate in short clips on social media, so acting like a policy wonk is less likely than ever to get the job done.

Trump continues to hold an advantage on two of the top three issues in this campaign. He leads on the economy by nine points and immigration by 11.

Those numbers have barely budged since Harris and Trump debated. In August, when the Power Rankings last looked at the major issues, the former president led on the economy by eight and immigration by 13.

Harris is far out in front on abortion. She leads by 17 points on that issue, also a negligible movement since the last tracker (Harris +18).

This tracker includes polls from Fox News, Quinnipiac, CNN/SSRS, NBC News and the New York Times/Siena.

Trump lost a point in the horse race after his debate with Harris while the vice president gained one; these modest shifts mirrored those after the first debate in 2020.

Together, these results suggest that the cause of Trump's slight decline was style rather than substance.

Conversely, while Harris won the debate and held on to her advantage on abortion, she has not consistently closed the issues gap, particularly on immigration.

That is not ideal for her, given the economy (38%) and immigration (17%) are two of the top three issues for voters. A recent Fox News national survey showed those issues and abortion (16%) were the only three that a double-digit percentage of voters called their ""most important"" issue in deciding their vote.

According to the same survey, Harris has strong leads in issues outside the top three. That includes health care, helping the middle class and climate change. These are ""bread and butter"" issues that the left has relied on to drag out base voters in previous elections.

The Democratic candidate also has a lead in uniting the country and, as consistent with previous trackers, having the right temperament for the job.

The candidates are evenly divided on national security. Neither has an advantage in handling a crisis that puts the country at risk, being commander in chief or decisions about using nuclear weapons. Trump's temperament deficit should give Harris an opportunity to lead on some of these qualities, but that has not materialized.

ARNON MISHKIN: JD VANCE IS AN EXCELLENT DEBATER AND PRACTICES FOR THE DEBATE EVERY SUNDAY

Finally, voters prefer Trump on foreign policy. He has a six-point lead in handling the Israel/Hamas war and an eight-point lead on the Ukraine/Russia war.

Tuesday is debate night. Walz and Vance will face off at an event hosted by CBS News in New York City. Fox News will simulcast the debate with special coverage anchored by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum at 8:20 p.m. ET.

Fox News Media has proposed a second Harris-Trump debate to be moderated by MacCallum and Baier in October.

Voters can now cast a ballot in more than half of all states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina.

Montana GOP Senate candidate Sheehy says he was in Afghanistan while Jon Tester was 'eating lobbyist steak',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/montana-gop-senate-candidate-sheehy-says-he-afghanistan-while-jon-tester-eating-lobbyist-steak,2024-10-01T09:53:21Z,"Montana Senate candidate Tim Sheehy joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the importance of the race and what issues matter most to voters as he fights to oust Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.

Montana U.S. Senate candidate Tim Sheehy, a Republican, ripped his opponent, incumbent Democrat Sen. Jon Tester, for his ties to lobbyists during a debate on Monday.

Tester is seeking to hold onto his Senate seat to continue representing the red state of Montana in a race that could determine which party controls the upper chamber of Congress, and recent polling shows that Sheehy is leading just weeks before Election Day.

During the debate on Monday, Sheehy knocked his Democrat opponent for his relationship with lobbyists in Washington, D.C.

""Sen. Tester knows all about backroom meetings, he's been taking them for 20 years ... While I was fighting in Afghanistan, he was eating lobbyist steak in D.C.,"" said Sheehy, a former U.S. Navy SEAL.

'WHOEVER GETS ELECTED': VULNERABLE DEM TESTER DIGS IN HEELS ON NOT ENDORSING HARRIS

Lobbyists have donated more heavily to Tester during this election cycle than to any other member of Congress, according to the non-partisan group OpenSecrets.

Tester is the last remaining Democrat to hold high office in Montana, where Republicans, including former President Trump, supported Sheehy's campaign with the hope that he could defeat the vulnerable Democrat and help the GOP win back control of the Senate.

Republicans need to gain only two seats in next month's election to win the Senate majority. GOP West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice is considered a lock in his state's Senate race against Democrat Glenn Elliott, meaning the Senate majority could run through Montana.

Trump won Montana by about 17 percentage points in 2020 and, given that the state is overwhelmingly Republican, Sheehy has often sought to tie Tester to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as the Republican candidate looks to take advantage of public dissatisfaction over the administration's struggles to address the influx of illegal immigration at the Southern Border.

JON TESTER CASTS DOUBT ON UNFAVORABLE POLL IN MONTANA SENATE RACE: 'GIVE ME A BREAK'

""Democrats on the Hill refused to hold the administration accountable for the largest mass migration in the history of this country,"" Sheehy said.

Tester, however, has declined to endorse Harris and has attempted to distance himself from her on the campaign trail, and he skipped the Democratic National Convention in August, when she was named the party's nominee for president after Biden dropped out.

The Democrat has also criticized some of the administration's policy decisions. This includes his opposition to the move for tighter pollution rules for coal plants and his calls for more to be done on immigration.

""Look, I'll be the first person to tell you that President Biden has not done a good job on the southern border,"" Tester said Monday.

Sheehy and Tester also addressed abortion, in which the Democrat said he wants to reinstate Roe v. Wade after the landmark ruling was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court two years ago, returning the power to make laws regarding abortion back to the states.

The Republican acknowledged that remarks he made last year about Native Americans were ""insensitive,"" but refused his opponent's request to apologize. Sheehy had told a group of laughing supporters about bonding ""with all the Indians ... while they're drunk at 8 a.m.,"" while working cattle at a ranch on the Crow Indian Reservation.

""Yeah, insensitive,"" Sheehy said. ""I come from the military as many of our tribal members do. You know, we make insensitive jokes and probably off-color jokes sometimes.""

Tester pressed his opponent, ""Tim, the statement you made degrades Native Americans across this country. You're a big guy, just apologize.""

""Will you apologize for opening the border?"" Sheehy shot back."
What Working Millennials Of Color Are Feeling About Project 2025,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasminebrowley/2024/10/08/what-working-millennials-of-color-are-feeling-about-project-2025/,2024-10-08T20:16:05Z,"Project 2025, a manifesto created by the conservative organization The Heritage Project and a playbook of likely actions to be taken within the first 180 days in office if Donald Trump is elected (despite his protestations about the plan). Although the sweeping proposal touches on everything from critical race theory to abortion bans, one of the most immediately concerning parts of the plan is how will affect the future of work for millennials workers of color.

Some of the agenda focuses on proposed changes to workplace policies that could adversely affect workers' pay, security, and right to organize against grievances.

For instance, Project 2025 outlines a concerted slashing to overtime pay for workers' leaving with smaller take home pay. Data shows millennials are still the hardest working generation in comparison to Gen X and Gen z, the two age group millennials are sandwiched between.

The plan also proposed that eliminating the Biden administration-led rule that raised the salary threshold to $58,656 and expanded the protection to 4.3 million more workers. Project 2025 reads like it is aiming to help business owners and investors save money over time by skimping on employee protections, but the plan could make way for larger financial disasters.

Project 2025 includes details that rolls back post-crisis policies that protect consumers, investors, and the stability of financial markets by limiting regulators' ability to step in during periods of volatility. This includes putting a stranglehold on the Federal Reserve's ""lender-of-last-resort"" function in which failing banks are able to borrow emergency funds to stay solvent.

An example of this can be seen in the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) crisis in which the Federal Reserve and other regulators stepped in to ensure the bank's customers would have access to their funds by the next day - beyond just the $250,000 guaranteed by the FDIC. The bank's potential collapse could've devastated a number of Black businesses and employees since Silicon Valley Bank has been one of the most pivotal in aiming to help narrow the funding chasm for Black founders, as ESSENCE points out.

""We all know that young Black founders get a fraction of the business loans and venture capital their non-Black counterparts get,"" Shila Nieves Burney of Zane VC says.

Zane VC, a firm that boasts an investment catalog of young startups aims to address the health equity gap, in the most effective way it can, through infusions of much needed capital. Nieves Burney says that if Project 2025's proposed actions are implemented, already vulnerable Black and Brown workers could be in dire straights.

""I'm sitting on the side of the table where Black women typically aren't seated,"" she says. ""I get to push against the narrative that Black founders don't exist and ensure they get the funding they deserve but my job will be made harder if these proposed restrictions get implemented.""

Another lynchpin in the workforce section of proposed initiatives of Project 2025 is its plan to address DEI, which is often described as an attack on America's progress by conservatives.

""The next conservative President must make the institutions of American civil society hard targets for woke culture warriors,"" Project 2025 authors write. ""This starts with deleting the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (""SOGI""), diversity, equity, and inclusion (""DEI""), gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights, and any other term used to deprive Americans of their First Amendment rights out of every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists.""

Dominic K. Hawkins, Vice President Of Communications at the NAACP says the proposed roll backs to DEI efforts will cause great harm to the country.

""Project 2025's policies will weaken civil rights protections, increase workplace discrimination, and ultimately set us back years,"" Hawkins says. ""As a Black professional who has worked across private and public sectors, I've seen how DEI practices only strengthen organizations and give opportunities that our community might be barred from due to the legacy of enslavement and systemic racism. If Project 2025 is enacted, what's to stop companies from blocking my application even when I'm more qualified? Nothing! And there would be no federally powered recourse.""

He adds, ""On top of that, it could create a dearth Black leaders at the top of organizations, who can't then help guide operations and they wouldn't be able to serve as role models and mentors for the next generation. As a Black executive, I wouldn't be where I am today with out sponsors at the C-level. Project 2025 would seek to wipe that out.""

The far reaching plan not only has the ability to touch business owners and corporate leaders, but content creator community as well. Quentin ""Funky Dineva"" Latham and Patrick ""Mr. Jones X"" Jones both expressed their fear for what's to come if the project is fully rolled out.

""It's terrifying, honestly,"" Latham says. He hosts a video podcast on his Youtube channel, which boasts more than 440k subscribers. Although he generates income from his broadcasts, Latham shares that government sanctions on DEI-driven initiatives could affect growth opportunities, including strict censoring rules that could impact the way he creates content.

Jones, on the other hand, shares fears of how his overall safety could be affected since he is a public figure that often comments on hot-button political topics. His combined social media pages boast more than 100k followers.

""Some people that existed on the TikTok platform that weren't very fond of my messaging {about Project 2025 potential ills} found out where I lived and sent the law enforcement to my house, which is where I work,"" Jones stated. ""I do believe that action is a direct manifestation of that group feeling emboldened by the conservative right's anti-DEI push.""

Overall, he says this is the apt time for working millennials like himself to empower and educate themselves about the future of work, and how the upcoming election could affect it.

""Be willing to learn more about the policies that can affect your life and do something about it,"" Jones advises. ""Use that as a motivation to stay the course. Never stop having the important conversations because it could be the difference between living the life you worked for, or having it shift in ways you could never imagine."""
Inside Project 2025 And Its Connection To Donald Trump,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2024/10/08/inside-project-2025-and-its-connection-to-donald-trump/,2024-10-08T20:15:42Z,"There has been a lot of discussion about Trump's connection to Project 2025, a 922-page document, written by the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation. Is the Democrat's assertion that Trump is connected to the effort, correct? What does Project 2025 actually say? Project 2025 contains a multitude of items, more than we can cover in this article.

Is Trump connected to Project 2025? According to the slightly left leaning newspaper USA Today, this is a false assertion (read more here). The slightly right leaning NY Post also refutes the notion that Trump is connected to it. CNN has gone on record to say that Harris has made false claims about Trump and Project 2025. She said Trump, if elected, would cut Social Security. While the document says very little about Social Security, it does not propose cuts in the program (read more here).

Why then are Democrats claiming a Trump connection to Project 2025? In this hotly contested political race, each party is looking for ways to attack the credibility of the other and instill fear in the electorate to garner votes. To accomplish this, each party has made assertions about their opponent with the hope that it will resonate in the minds of undecided voters. While there may be several reasons to be hesitant about a second Trump presidency, his connection to Project 2025 or lack thereof, isn't one of them. What is true about Project 2025? Here's what I found after reading much of the 922-page document.

The Heritage Foundation published Project 2025 in 2023. There were 34 authors, 276 contributors, and 2 editors. Among the contributors, about 71% of them worked for the federal government during the first Trump administration. Some worked closely with Trump himself.

What prompted the creation of Project 2025? The premise behind it is that the federal government is far too powerful and too inefficient. This is a widely held belief among Americans. However, there are a few items in the document that run contrary to the Democrats agenda. For example, Project 2025 would restore the definition of ""sex"" as ""biological sex at birth"" instead of ""sexual orientation and gender identity."" According to a Pew research poll from May 2022, 60% of those polled believe gender is determined by the sex assigned at birth. Yet, Democrats continue to define sex as ones ""sexual orientation and gender identity."" Thus, the document states, ""The CDC should immediately end its collection of data on gender identity, which legitimizes the unscientific notion that men can become women (and vice versa)...""

Another example involves abortion. Liberals promote abortion as health care. The Project 2025 document (page 455) states, ""It should fund studies into the risks and complications of abortion and ensure that it corrects and does not promote misinformation regarding the comparative health

and psychological benefits of childbirth versus the health and psychological risks of intentionally taking a human life through abortion."" Conservatives see the issue as more than a woman's right to choose. They see abortion as the taking of life. In general, conservatives are against abortion but do believe exceptions to protect the life of the mother, rape, incest are appropriate.

Project 2025 also exposes some conflicts of interest in the federal government. One such conflict is found in the National Institute of Health (NIH). It states, ""In 2018, it was revealed that a $100 million NIH study on the benefits of moderate drinking was funded by the beer and liquor industry."" It also points out how the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) owns half of the patent for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, among thousands of other pharma patents. It goes on to say that several NIH employees personally receive up to $150,000 per year from Moderna vaccine sales.

Project 2025 does have some controversial items within the document, but its overarching theme is that government has become too large, too inefficient, and there are too many agencies whose actions go well beyond their charter. In short, the document makes suggestions that would reorganize the federal bureaucracy, returning agencies to their original mandates.

Democrats have suggested Trump will enact its provisions if elected in November. While Trump may indeed implement some of the provisions of Project 2025, many of them are standard conservative ideals and not something from a horror movie as Democrats have suggested."
Stevie Nicks' New Single Instantly Debuts In The Same Position On Multiple Charts,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2024/10/08/stevie-nicks-new-single-instantly-debuts-in-the-same-position-on-multiple-charts/,2024-10-08T12:28:51Z,"Stevie Nicks returned a little more than a week ago with ""The Lighthouse,"" her latest solo single. The Fleetwood Mac star's fan base snapped up copies of the tune the moment it dropped, and they've collectively sent the song to multiple charts in the U.K. this week, immediately making it into something of a quick, if minor, hit.

""The Lighthouse"" launches on both the Official Singles Sales and Official Singles Downloads charts this time around. Coincidentally, the tune is new at No. 48 on the two tallies.

It's not entirely uncommon for songs to debut in similar spots on those two rankings, as they are both ranked based on pure purchases. Most sales of individual tracks take place on download storefronts like iTunes and Amazon, so it makes sense that new arrivals on the Official Singles Downloads list would also perform just as well-or, almost as well-on the Official Singles Sales roster at the same time.

""The Lighthouse"" marks Nicks' second solo hit on the Official Singles Sales chart. She debuted on the list of the top-selling songs in the U.K. in 2020. That year, ""Edge of Seventeen"" peaked at No. 7, and it still stands as her top placement.

Nicks' latest offering marks her fourth career win on the Official Singles Downloads ranking. It's her second-highest appearance, coming in ahead of the No. 72 high point that ""Dreams"" by Deep Dish reached years ago, as well as the No. 98 peak that ""Show Them the Way"" mustered.

""The Lighthouse"" stands as the fifth-highest debut on the Official Singles Downloads chart, landing behind tracks from Kylie Minogue, Callum Beattie, Jack Savoretti and Miles Kane, and Josh Baker. On the Official Singles Sales list, Nicks claims the sixth-loftiest entrant. In addition to the five names mentioned above, The Veronicas also hit the tally with their years-old single ""Untouched,"" which reaches the list for the first time.

Nicks released ""The Lighthouse"" as a means to inspire discussions about women's rights and the issue of abortion. For the moment, the track is a standalone single, as it's not connected to any larger project-at least for the time being."
Kamala Harris' 'Call Her Daddy' Appearance Divides Podcast Host Alex Cooper's Listeners,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/10/07/kamala-harris-call-her-daddy-appearance-divides-podcast-host-alex-coopers-listeners/,2024-10-07T19:54:16Z,"Podcast host Alex Cooper interviewed Vice President Kamala Harris on her popular ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, Spotify's second-biggest podcast which has a large audience of women listeners, drawing criticism from some of Cooper's conservative-leaning listeners.

""Call Her Daddy"" has ranked as Spotify's second-biggest podcast, only behind Joe Rogan's ""Joe Rogan Experience,"" for the past two years. Spotify also says it is the biggest podcast for women on its platform. ""Call Her Daddy"" ranked as the fourth-biggest podcast across all platforms for the second quarter of 2024, according to Edison Research, behind Rogan, ""Crime Junkie"" and The New York Times' ""The Daily."" Cooper also has a significant social media following, with 2.4 million followers on her ""Call Her Daddy"" Instagram account and 3.9 million followers on the podcast's TikTok. Cooper regularly hosts high-profile celebrity guests on her podcast, including Simone Biles, Post Malone and Katy Perry. Cooper has also raised her podcast's profile through media appearances, including a stint as a host at the Paris Olympic Games this summer for NBC. Her podcast has been highly sought after by streaming services: SiriusXM spent $100 million on the rights to her podcast in August, three years after Spotify paid $60 million for exclusive rights.

Though it's unclear how much of Cooper's listening base is made up of conservatives, Cooper said she has a ""very mixed audience when it comes to politics"" prior to her Harris interview, acknowledging she seldom talks about politics to make her podcast a welcome space for all listeners. Cooper, however, has previously spoken out in favor of abortion rights. In one ""Call Her Daddy"" episode released in October 2022, Cooper spoke with women who had to travel from states with restrictive abortion laws to other states to receive care, which she said was to highlight the impact of anti-abortion legislation on women. She also criticized the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Cooper's podcast also exploded in popularity after it was acquired in 2018 by Barstool Sports, the media company founded by Dave Portnoy known for its conservative-leaning audience that Politico called ""Barstool Republicans.""

Cooper released her interview with Harris on Sunday, in which she largely asked the vice president questions about women's issues, including reproductive rights. Harris slammed state laws she called ""Trump abortion bans"" and dismissed Trump's claim that he would be a ""protector"" for women as president. She also addressed comments made by Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Republican, last month in which she said Harris does not have biological children to keep her ""humble."" Harris said she feels ""sorry"" for Sanders, stating many women are ""not aspiring to be humble"" and ""have a lot of love in their life, family in their life and children in their life"" who lift them up.

""I couldn't see a world in which one of the main conversations in this election is women, and I'm not a part of it,"" Cooper said, defending her decision to interview Harris despite her politically mixed audience, as well as her choice to center their conversation around women's issues.

Cooper ranked No. 12 on Forbes' list of the top-earning creators of 2023, with estimated earnings of $20 million. She was also included on Forbes' 30 Under 30 list in 2022.

Harris' ""Call Her Daddy"" interview was one of several media appearances she has scheduled for this week. Also this week, Harris will appear on ""The View,"" ""60 Minutes,"" ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" and Howard Stern's radio show.

Public Opinion 101: How Do Voters Decide?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bowmanmarsico/2024/10/07/public-opinion-101-how-do-voters-decide/,2024-10-07T19:32:46Z,"Why do people vote the way they do? What factors influence them as they make this decision and other crucial ones about things such as their health care? Those in the Washington political bubble tend to place considerable emphasis on the acquisition of factual material. But is that how other Americans make these big decisions?

In the aftermath of the Vance-Walz debate, fact checkers worked overtime to confirm the accuracy of both candidates' statements. Their work may aid voters' decisions, but their efforts seem to appeal more to their fellow journalists and political pundits. As such, they are unlikely to have much impact on public opinion.

Facts are important, of course, but in the words of the late sociologist Daniel Yankelovich, they are not ""the royal road to judgment."" Other things matter. In 2024, some voters will vote on a single issue. Since 1992, for example, Gallup has tracked the proportion of registered voters that say they will only vote for a candidate who shares their views on the abortion. In June of 2024, 32% gave that response. A much smaller number will vote on climate. Still others may be Second Amendment purists and evaluate candidates based on their views of guns. Some will vote on character or because they dislike a candidate. Still others will cast their ballots for their party just as their parents and grandparents did.

There are many others whose party ties are weak, who don't follow complicated policy issues, who don't have a single most important issue, or who don't hate the other party's candidate. They will vote for other reasons. But where do these decisions originate?

Yankelovich wrote about decision making in his 1999 book The Magic of Dialogue, and I am indebted to his work. He notes that journalists and social scientists base their opinions on the accumulation of facts, but the general public does not make its determinations this way. The public, he says, ""forms its judgments through dialogue and discussion. People weigh what they hear from others against their own convictions. They compare notes with one another in terms of what makes sense to them.""

In many years of following the polls, I have been struck by Americans' responses when they are asked how they form their opinions. Conversations with friends and family often top the list. A new Morning Consult poll for the Public Affairs Council asked people about their most trusted source for political news and information. ""Friends and family"" swamped the other categories, far ahead of the parties, business, and social media.

An August Syracuse University/Ipsos poll asked people to imagine that they had 100 minutes to cast an informed vote on the 2024 election. When asked how much time they would spend speaking to a variety of sources, the mean response for family and friends was the highest, followed distantly by eight other sources including broadcast news, cable news, national newspapers, and social media. The results were virtually identical in their July and May polls. In these three soundings, Democrats, Republicans, and independents all gave the most attention to the views of friends and family.

On a very different often highly complex subject, Axios/Ipsos asked people who they trusted to provide them information on ""health topics."" Eighty-six percent said they had a great deal or fair amount of trust in information from their personal physician, followed by information from friends and family (74%). Information from the CDC, the FDA, the NIH, or the governor of their state ranked far behind in terms of high trust.

Yankelovich believed people start with their values. The public doesn't distinguish between facts and values the way journalists do, he says. He was suspicious of the ""conventional paradigm of knowledge with its sharp distinctions between 'objective' facts and 'subjective' values."" What he called the public's ""pre-scientific ways of knowing"" actually has ""greater validity for the important questions of living together than current theories of knowledge."" A poorly informed public can make sound, even wise, judgments, he argued.

The process of arriving at these judgements often takes time, and it is probably harder in our polarized age. In our current environment in which institutional trust is so low, understanding how much people rely on discussions with their family and friends is surely important.

The fact checkers will continue their work for those of us in the Washington bubble and beyond. But they alone will not help Americans arrive at decisions about the 2024 candidates or other important decisions in their lives."
Five Things Small Business Owners Can Do To Prepare For The Election,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyshoenthal/2024/10/07/five-things-small-business-owners-can-do-to-prepare-for-the-election/,2024-10-07T16:49:24Z,"As the U.S. braces for the upcoming presidential election, small business owners harbor a unique set of concerns around how the outcome might impact their day to day operations. From legislation that could affect taxes, healthcare costs and regulation, the political climate will have a domino effect on consumer behavior, financial markets and more.

Regardless of who wins, it's critical for small business owners to stay informed on new policies and regulatory shifts, as new legislation could reshape things like employee benefits and compliance requirements. With one month to go, many small business owners are curious about proactive steps they can take to prepare for the looming uncertainty. Experts suggest five key principles to prepare for the election's outcome:

1. Monitor policy changes.

It's widely known that election years can bring market volatility. That's why it's critical for small business owners to stay informed about proposed changes in regulations, taxes, healthcare and labor laws that could directly impact their operations. Understanding candidates' platforms will help anticipate shifts and plan for potential changes accordingly.

Jen Stark, who serves as a strategic advisor to Don't Ban Equality, advises small business owners to pay attention to local laws that might impact employee health benefit concerns, especially around reproductive care.

""Small businesses in states that have passed abortion bans and restrictions are left with the burden of shouldering the costs and chaos facing workers and communities,"" she says. ""Those workers have to travel out of state, resulting in more time off and greater healthcare costs out of pocket even if their employer has a benefits program to support them.""

Shifts in economic regulations are another area small business owners should pay close attention to.

""Political uncertainty in the months leading up to the presidential election can affect confidence and decision-making for consumers, which leads to impact on small business owners and can cause a decrease in consumer spending,"" says Cate Luzio, former banker and founder of Luminary, a professional education and networking platform. ""The election results themselves can eventually cause a change in business regulations that small business owners need to be aware of, along with the impact that might have on their business, their growth, their customers and more.""

2. Focus on consumer and employee engagement.

Consumer spending patterns may shift during an election year due to uncertainty. Many people tend to cut back on discretionary spending when they feel uneasy about the economy.

Consider changes you can make to your business to prepare for this sentiment shift. Do you offer essential products or services that are less impacted by economic swings? Are there ways to re-engage your most loyal consumers right now? Focus on those if possible.

At the same time, this is a prime opportunity to foster civic engagement among employees.

""As this election season kicks into high gear, entrepreneurs and business leaders have an opportunity to use their trusted voice to protect American democracy,"" says Katie Vlietstra Wonnenberg, principal of Public Private Strategies. ""Consumers want businesses to be active in protecting America's democracy and they support actions to ensure it.""

Wonnenberg cited research from the Business & Democracy Initiative, which revealed that 75% of consumers support businesses who promote employee civic education and agree that employees should have time off for political engagement.

""Taking these steps during election season can help with employee retention and can build trust and loyalty with consumers,"" she points out.

3. Scenario plan.

Given the potential for significant regulatory changes, business owners should consider the changes that might occur under different administrations. Think through any adjustments you might need to make within operations or budgets when considering factors like minimum wage hikes, healthcare mandates, trade policies and more.

""Company leadership should always be preparing for uncontrollable changes by discussing different scenarios with their teams so they are prepared,"" says Chantell Preston, a healthcare development consultant who advises small businesses on reducing risk.

Preston suggests playing out different scenarios so your company and employees are prepared for any outcome. ""Enlist feedback and engage with your stakeholders so they know you are preparing,"" she says. ""Communicate and be transparent with your employees to build trust and reduce uncertainty.""

4. Remind your employees that they have a say.

Presidential elections can influence labor laws and healthcare regulations, which impact employee pay and HR policies. Business owners should keep a close eye on any proposed changes to healthcare, minimum wage, or employee benefits that could impact overhead costs, communicating openly with employees to prepare for any potential changes that might occur following the election.

Kimber Lanning, CEO of Local First Arizona, suggests starting this conversation prior to the election by reminding employees that they actually do have a say in shaping the outcome.

""A great way to get involved in an election while staying out of divisive politics is to stick to a message of getting out the vote,"" she says. ""Consider giving your employees time off to go to the polls on Election Day. Encourage your customers to vote by placing signs in your establishment or stickers at the cash register. Sponsor or organize a voter registration event. Using your voice as a business owner to support democracy is a noble thing to do.""

5. Be prepared to dip into cash reserves.

Election years can bring about economic uncertainty, which leads to market volatility. Small businesses should consider building up cash reserves to cushion against any potential downturns.

Experts recommend postponing major investments until after the election, reviewing current tax strategies and being prepared to dip into cash reserves in case of significant disruption.

Preston recommends having at least 18 months of capital available. She also suggests researching regulatory perspectives from all parties and evaluating supply chains in case of issues.

Lanning suggests treating an election cycle like any other slow season. She points out that, ""In Phoenix, our summers are hot, so businesses know to plan for decreased revenue as customers go away on vacation. In the months running up to a major election, business owners should do the same thing.""

""No matter what industry you're in, sales activity slumps as Americans hold their money tighter, wondering how the election will turn out and what policies a new president will implement that may affect their pocket book,"" says Lanning. ""You may need to pause hiring, dip into savings or wait to make a big purchase to keep your business healthy.""

Luzio acknowledges the financial anxiety that comes with the election can lead to impulsive, shortsighted decisions.

""Get your 2025 financial projections in order with scenarios around growth, flat and down performance,"" she suggests. ""At a macro level, key issues may have an impact on your numbers: taxes, regulation, trade and consumer spending/customer acquisition. It is important for business owners to be informed about issues and make sure they're aware regardless of which way the election goes. Doing an updated SWOT analysis for your business can help, especially as it relates to how to mitigate or protect your business against threats.""

Finally, Luzio recommends talking to your trusted experts such as insurance professionals, financial advisors, cybersecurity experts, attorneys and banking partners to help mitigate risk.

""Discuss potential business impacts with these experts to help you feel informed about decision making around the business,"" says Luzio.

""The election is out of your control,"" she says. ""So don't panic, please vote, and focus on awareness to support your business through this time."""
New Supreme Court Term Starts Today: Here Are The Biggest Cases To Watch -- So Far,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/07/new-supreme-court-term-starts-today-here-are-the-biggest-cases-to-watch-so-far/,2024-10-07T15:02:28Z,"The Supreme Court's new term kicks off on Monday, with justices already slated to hear major cases on such topics as transgender rights and guns -- and other huge cases could still be added, including on the 2024 election and former President Donald Trump's criminal cases.

Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines. Text ""Alerts"" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.

The Supreme Court's term begins on Monday and will run through the end of June. It's unclear when rulings in the court's major cases will come out. Decisions are usually released a few months after the court hears oral arguments, meaning rulings will come out quicker for cases heard earlier in the term, though the biggest decisions of the court's term are often released in June.

The Supreme Court is likely to add a number of other major cases to its docket this term. The court has already been asked to hear such cases as a lawsuit seeking damages for oil companies' impacts on climate change and a challenge to a school's race-neutral admissions practices, but has not yet ruled on taking those up. A number of gun-specific challenges have also been filed with the court, including cases regarding Maryland's assault weapons ban, the ban on people convicted of felonies possessing guns, whether states can ban 18-to-20-year olds from purchasing guns and whether people under felony indictment can buy guns. Lawsuits taking issue with the Biden administration's new efforts on student loan forgiveness are also winding through the courts, and while the Supreme Court already upheld a block on a student debt relief effort in August, it could be asked again to consider the issue more fully. The Supreme Court punted last term on abortion when it ruled challengers trying to restrict abortion drug mifepristone didn't have standing to bring the case and dismissed a challenge against Idaho's abortion ban, but both cases are still moving forward in lower courts as plaintiffs try to make the cases work, and could return to the high court.

After ruling last term that Trump and other ex-presidents have some immunity from criminal prosecution -- ruling he can't be charged for anything he did that was an ""official act"" as president, but can be prosecuted for actions outside his official duties -- justices could be asked this term to weigh in on the issue for a second time. The Supreme Court directed Trump's criminal case for trying to overturn the 2020 election to go back to the lower court, and U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan now has to decide which charges against Trump comply with the Supreme Court's ruling and can proceed to trial. Trump is all but certain to appeal whatever Chutkan decides, however, and it could be up to the Supreme Court to make the final determination on the issue. Special Counsel Jack Smith is also now trying to revive the federal case against Trump for allegedly mishandling White House documents, after Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon threw it out because she found Smith had been unlawfully appointed. That appeal could also go to the Supreme Court to determine whether Smith and other special counsels have the appropriate authority.

The Supreme Court is also likely to play a role in the November election, as it did in 2020. Justices were repeatedly asked to weigh in on cases challenging the election results in that election, which could happen again this year should Trump lose the election. There are also lawsuits challenging various voting rules that could still make their way to the Supreme Court before Election Day or become a factor while ballots are being counted, most notably regarding whether ballots must be received by Election Day.

The Supreme Court's term kicks off as Americans have become increasingly dissatisfied with the 6-3 conservative bench, amid a series of ethics scandals and controversial rulings. The court ended its last term with a slew of major rulings, including the Trump immunity case, striking down a ban on bump stocks for guns, killing Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy settlement, allowing a ban on ""public camping"" that targets the homeless, limiting charges for Jan. 6 rioters and overturning a longstanding precedent that gave broad power to federal agencies. Justices have also refused to enact a binding ethics code amid a series of controversies involving potential conflicts of interests, particularly by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. A Gallup poll conducted in September found 51% of Americans now disapprove of the Supreme Court as its new term begins, versus 44% who approve of the job justices are doing. Results broke heavily along party lines, with 83% of Democrats disapproving of the high court versus only 19% of Republicans."
What Does Abortion Look Like In Your State? An Alphabetical Guide,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/evaepker/2024/10/05/what-does-abortion-look-like-in-your-state-an-alphabetical-guide/,2024-10-05T13:36:04Z,"In exactly one month, voters across the United States will cast their ballots - and for residents of 10 of those states, those ballots will include questions about the future of abortion. For nearly 50 years, the U.S Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade established that a person's individual right to an abortion was protected by the U.S Constitution. The U.S Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization in 2022, however, overturned that prior ruling, leaving states with the power to regulate abortion.

Since then, 20 states have banned or restricted abortions, seven states have already voted on abortion rights, and multiple states have abortion-related laws and guidelines that simply aren't clear. For example, four states (Arkansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and South Dakota) allow abortions only to save a pregnant person's life but not to improve her health. Healthcare professionals then have to decide - sometimes in the middle of a medical emergency - whether an abortion would qualify as life-saving or, in other words, legal or not. They are then liable if they have found to have broken the law and could face punishments such as fines, jail sentences, loss of license, or a combination of the three.

This state-by-stage guide aims to clear up some unknowns about abortion, such as where it is legal, what exceptions might exist, what lawsuits or laws are pending, and what voters - and the rest of the U.S population - should know in advance of Election Day.

Alabama: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life or health: both physical and mental. Alabama is actually the only state that explicitly includes mental health concerns as an exception to its abortion ban but requires that a psychiatrist both to diagnose the pregnant individual with a ""serious mental illness"" and to document that her mental health condition could cause her to engage in behavior that might threaten her life or that of the fetus.

There are no exceptions to the abortion ban for fatal fetal anomalies or in cases of rape and/or incest.

Alaska: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Arizona: Abortion is legal up to 15 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person counseling from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission before the abortion.

In September 2024, Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs signed the legislature's repeal of an 1864 near-total abortion ban.

Arizona residents will be also be voting on Arizona Proposition 139, the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" will amend the state Constitution to provide the fundamental right to abortion before the point of fetal viability (which is usually between 22 and 26 weeks and marks the point where the fetus has a high chance of surviving outside the uterus without any significant medical intervention) unless ""justified by a compelling state interest"" (such as improving or maintaining the health of the individual seeking an abortion). Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment.

Arkansas: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exception to this ban is to save a pregnant person's life. There are no exceptions for risks to the pregnant person's physical health, for fatal fetal anomalies, or for rape and/or incest.

Arkansans for Limited Government tried to get an abortion rights amendment on the ballot in 2024. If passed, the amendment would've legalized abortion up to 18 weeks and protected abortion access after that time period in the cases of risks to the pregnant person's life or health, for fatal fetal anomalies, and for rape and/or incest. In August 2024, the Arkansas Supreme Court ruled that Arkansans for Limited Government had failed to file the paid canvasser training certification and had failed to comply with state law so the amendment wouldn't appear on the 2024 ballot.

California: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

In 2022, California residents passed California Proposition 1, the Right to Reproductive Freedom Amendment, which supported amending the state Constitution to prohibit the state from interfering with or denying an individual's reproductive freedom, including the right to an abortion. The Proposition passed with 67% support.

Colorado: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian or adult relative (if the minor lives with that relative and not with one or both parents) must be informed at least 48 hours before the abortion.

Next month, residents will vote on Colorado Amendment 89, the Right to Abortion and Health Insurance Coverage Initiative. Voting ""yes"" would both enshrine a right to abortion in the Colorado Constitution and allow the use of public funds for abortion. Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment and would uphold a current constitutional provision that bans the use of public funds for abortion.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, there is no parental/guardian involvement required.

Delaware: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors under 16, a parent/guardian, grandparent, or mental health professional must be notified.

Florida: Abortion is legal up to six weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person counseling from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian must be notified at least 48 hours before and must give permission.

Next month, residents will vote on Florida Amendment 4, the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" would both enshrine a right to abortion in the state Constitution up to fetal viability (or when necessary to protect a pregnant person's health, as determined by their healthcare provider) while maintaining the current law that requires that a parent/guardian be notified if a minor is seeking an abortion. Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive information from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. (They do not have to receive that information in person; it can be mailed to them or read over the phone to them.) For minors, a parent/guardian must be notified.

In September 2024, Georgia Judge Robert C.I. McBurney struck down the prior state law, which prohibited most abortions after six weeks. Georgia's Republican attorney general has already appealed this ruling, though, and the Georgia Supreme Court will likely make the final decision.

Hawaii: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Idaho: Abortion is illegal as of August 25, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life and physical health or for rape and/or incest.

The Idaho Supreme Court ruled in 2023 that there is no constitutional right to an abortion in the state. Since then, two consolidated court cases (Idaho v. United States and Moyle v. United States have argued that healthcare professionals should be able to perform emergency abortions to preserve a pregnant person's physical health - not just save her life. The Supreme Court received this case but dismissed it in June 2024, sending it back to the federal appeals courts for further litigation. Until a decision is made, the exceptions to the abortion ban do currently include preserving the pregnant person's physical health.

In cases of rape and/or incest, an abortion can be legally performed up to 14 weeks but requires a police report or report from child protection services.

There are no exceptions to the ban for fatal fetal anomalies.

Illinois: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Indiana: Abortion is illegal as of September 15, 2022.

In 2023, the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that the state Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion with three exceptions. Abortions can be performed at any time to preserve the life and health of the pregnant person; up to 20 weeks for fatal fetal abnormalities; and up to 12 weeks gestational age for rape and/or incest .

Four residents and the group Hoosier Jews for Choice have argued that abortion is an exercise of religion; banning abortion thus violates Indiana's 2015 religious freedom law. The Indiana Supreme Court is expected to hear the case soon.

Iowa: Abortion is legal up to six weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian or grandparent must be notified at least 48 hours before.

Kansas: Abortion is legal up to 22 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, both parents/guardians (or a singular parent/guardian if that individual has sole custody) must give permission.

Kansas was the first state to vote on abortion rights following Dobbs. In November 2022, its residents rejected the Value Them Both Constitutional Amendment, which would have ruled that there was no right to abortion in the state Constitution, subsequently enacting a near-total ban on abortion. 53% of voters rejected that proposed amendment.

Kentucky: Abortion is illegal as of June 15, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life or physical health (with affirmative defense). There are no exceptions for fatal fetal anomalies or for rape and/or incest.

In November 2022, Kentucky residents rejected Kentucky Constitutional Amendment 2, the No Right to Abortion in Constitution Amendment, which would have amended the state Constitution to say explicitly that it doesn't protect the right to abortion. 52% of voters rejected that proposed amendment.

In February 2023, the Kentucky Supreme Court rejected a request to block the state's abortion ban, ruling that abortion providers lacked the standing to challenge the state's abortion ban. The Kentucky Supreme Court, though, didn't elaborate whether or not the state Constitution secured abortion rights, and abortion remains banned in the state as a result.

In late February 2024, Republican Rep. Ken Fleming of Louisville introduced House Bill 711 that would make abortions legal up to six weeks in cases of rape and/or incest, of fatal fetal anomalies, or of fetuses who died in the womb. No action has been taken on the bill since then.

Louisiana: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life or physical health or in limited cases of fatal fetal anomalies. There are no exceptions for rape and/or incest.

Maine: Abortion is legal until fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Maryland: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must be notified unless the minor doesn't live with a parent/guardian or reasonable efforts to give notice to a parent/guardian are unsuccessful.

Next month, residents will vote on Maryland Question 1, the Right to Reproductive Freedom Amendment. Voting ""yes"" would support amending the state Constitution to establish a right to ""reproductive freedom"". Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment.

Massachusetts: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors under 16, a parent/guardian must give permission.

Michigan: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission.

In 2022, Michigan residents passed Michigan Proposal 3, the Right to Reproductive Freedom Initiative, which supported providing a constitutional right to reproductive freedom, including the right to an abortion. The Initiative passed with 57% support.

Minnesota: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Mississippi: Abortion is illegal as of July 7, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life, for a limited number of fatal fetal anomalies, and for rape and/or incest. For the latter, an abortion can be legally performed up to six weeks gestational age but requires documentation from law enforcement. There are no exceptions for risks to the pregnant person's physical health.

Missouri: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life or physical health (with affirmative defense). There are no exceptions for fatal fetal anomalies or for rape and/or incest.

Next month, residents will vote on Missouri Amendment 3, the Right to Reproductive Freedom Initiative. Voting ""yes"" supports amending the Missouri Constitution to provide the right to ""reproductive freedom"" and allowing the state legislature to enact laws that regulate abortion only after fetal viability. Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment and would oppose allowing the state legislature to enact laws that regulate abortion only after fetal viability.

Montana: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required. In August 2024, Montana's Supreme Court ruled that the law requiring parental/guardian permission for a minor seeking an abortion was unconstitutional.

In 2022, Montana residents rejected Legislative Referendum No. 131 which would've required medical care for ""infants born alive"", such as those born prematurely or those who were born due to a botched abortion. 53% of voters rejected that proposed referendum.

Next month, residents will vote on Montana CI-128, the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" supports amending the Montana Constitution to provide the right to ""make and carry out decisions about one's own pregnancy, including the right to abortion"" and allowing the state to regulate abortion only after fetal viability. Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment and would oppose allowing the state legislature to enact laws that regulate abortion only after fetal viability.

Nebraska: Abortion is legal up to 12 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive information from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. (They don't have to receive that information in person; it can be mailed to them or read over the phone to them.) For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission.

Next month, residents will vote on both Nebraska Initiative 434, Prohibit Abortions After the First Trimester Amendment and Nebraska Initiative 439, Right to Abortion Initiative.

Voting ""yes"" on Initiative 434 would support amending the state Constitution to ban abortions after the first trimester except to preserve the pregnant person's life or physical health or for rape and/or incest. Voting ""no"" would oppose banning abortions after the first trimester.

Voting ""yes"" on Initiative 439 would support amending the state Constitution to provide a right to abortion until fetal viability. Voting ""no"" on Initiative 439 would oppose adding this Amendment.

Nevada: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Next month, residents will vote on Nevada Question 6, the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" supports amending the state Constitution to protect the right to an abortion and to allow the state to regulate abortion only after fetal viability. Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment and would oppose allowing the state to regulate abortion only after fetal viability.

New Hampshire: Abortion is legal up to 24 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before 24 weeks have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must be notified.

New Jersey: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

New York: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Next month, residents will vote on New York Proposal 1, Equal Protection of Law Amendment. Voting ""yes"" would support adding language to the New York Bill of Rights that would give prevent discriminating against all persons, including due to ""pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy"". Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this language.

North Carolina: Abortion is legal up to12 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 72-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person counseling from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian or grandparent (if the minor has lived with them for at least six months) must give permission.

North Dakota: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive information from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission.

In September 2024, North Dakota Judge Bruce Romanick declared North Dakota's total abortion ban ""unconstitutional"". Republican Attorney General Drew H. Wrigley said that he planned to appeal that decision, though, while the Republican-controlled legislature may try to enact another ban when it reconvenes in January 2025.

Ohio: Abortion is legal up to 22 weeks

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission.

In November 2023, Ohio residents passed Ohio Issue 1, Right to Make Reproductive Decisions Including Abortion Initiative, which supported amending the Ohio Constitution to guarantee the right to abortion until fetal viability as well as the right to other reproductive health decisions. The Initiative passed with 57% support.

Oklahoma: Abortion is illegal as of May 25, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to save the pregnant person's life. There are no exceptions for risks to the pregnant person's physical health, for fatal fetal anomalies, or for rape and/or incest.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive information from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. If the person seeking an abortion is 18 or older, that information can be read over the phone to them; if the person seeking an abortion is 17 or younger, they have to receive that counseling in person with a parent/guardian. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission.

Rhode Island: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission.

South Carolina: Abortion is legal up to six weeks (or up to 12 weeks for rape and/or incest as long as the physician reported the rape or incest within 24 hours of performing the abortion).

Those seeking an abortion before six weeks have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive information from their abortion provider and when they can receive the abortion. (They don't have to receive that information in person.) For minors under 17, a parent/guardian or grandparent must give permission.

South Dakota: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve a pregnant person's life. There are no exceptions for risks to the pregnant person's physical health, for fatal fetal anomalies, or for rape and/or incest.

Next month, residents will vote on South Dakota Constitutional Amendment G or the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" would support providing a state constitutional right to abortion in South Dakota using a trimester framework. During the first trimester, the state would be prohibited for regulating abortion; during the second trimester, the state may regulate abortion but ""only in ways that are reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman""; during the third trimester, the state may regulate or prohibit abortion, except ""when abortion is necessary, in the medical judgment of the woman's physician, to preserve the life and health of the pregnant woman"". Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment.

Texas: Abortion is illegal as of July 1, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve a pregnant person's life (with affirmative defense). There are no exceptions for risks to the pregnant person's physical health, for fatal fetal anomalies, or for rape and/or incest.

A group of Texas women who had serious pregnancy complications were the first in the country to testify in court about being denied abortions after Dobbs. And yet, the court has advised Texan physicians only that they should ""meticulously document"" their decision-making around abortions without any clarification about what actions - regardless of documentation - might put them at risk for prosecution.

Utah: Abortion is legal up to 18 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 72-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person counseling from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian must be notified at least 24 hours before the abortion and give permission.

A state law that completely banned abortion in Utah went into effect on June 24, 2022 but was challenged in court by Planned Parenthood Association of Utah. On August 1, 2024, the Utah Supreme Court prevented this total ban from taking effect while the lawsuit continued.

Vermont: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

In November 2022, residents of Vermont passed Vermont Proposal 5, the Right to Personal Reproductive Autonomy Amendment, which supported amending the Vermont Constitution to protect the right to personal reproductive autonomy - such as the decision to receive an abortion - and to prohibit government infringement in these matters unless ""justified by a compelling state interest"". The Amendment passed with 77% support.

Virginia: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion then have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian (or adult family member or parent-like individual with whom the minor regularly lives) must be notified at least 24 hours before the abortion.

Washington: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Washington D.C: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

West Virginia: Abortion is illegal as of September 16, 2022.

The exceptions are to preserve the pregnant person's life or physical health, for fetal anomalies, and for rape and/or incest. For the latter, abortions can be performed up to eight weeks (or up to 14 weeks for minors) as long as the assault has been reported to law enforcement.

Wisconsin: Abortion is legal up to 22 weeks

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person counseling from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian, grandparent, or a sibling or aunt or uncle who is at least 25 years old must give permission.

Abortion opponents have claimed that a law from 1849 bans abortion in all cases except when the pregnant person's life is in danger. Lower level courts have argued that the law in question applies only to infanticide and not consensual abortions. The Wisconsin Supreme Court will hear that case.

Wyoming: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must be informed at least 24 hours before the abortion.

The Wyoming Supreme Court received this case but dismissed it in April 2024, sending it back to the lower courts. Until a decision is made, abortion remains legal in the state up to fetal viability.

Trump Campaign Thinks Abortion Ballot Measures Might Actually Help Him,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/04/trump-campaign-thinks-abortion-ballot-measures-might-actually-help-him/,2024-10-04T20:11:04Z,"Battleground states' ballot measures on abortion could benefit former President Donald Trump in the election, the Trump campaign's political director told The Washington Post Friday, as polling suggests Republicans are willing to turn out to support abortion rights but still back Trump, despite Democrats trying to use the ballot measures to their advantage.

Polling shows Trump is leading in battleground states even as respondents trust Harris more on handling abortion. A 56% majority of Fox News' Arizona poll respondents said they trusted Harris to do a better job on abortion -- though the respondents still preferred Trump overall -- as did 53% of Arizona respondents in the Times/Siena College poll. Fox News' polling in August found 58% of voters from Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina preferred Harris on abortion, but only 48% overall said they'd support her (compared with 47% who backed Trump).

Politico reports abortion ballot measures may also impact voters in subsequent elections, noting that Democrats are reporting pro-abortion rights voters in Michigan -- where abortion was legalized via ballot measure in 2022 -- aren't as fired up this year because they think their reproductive rights are safe. A KFF poll found in July that 60% of Michigan women believe abortion's legality is now a ""settled"" issue in their state, with Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow telling Politico there's a ""false sense of comfort"" among voters that abortion is no longer under threat. Democratic candidates have had to argue to voters that their rights could still be taken away if Trump wins, Politico reports, as candidates claim Trump would enact national restrictions if elected that would override any state measures.

Democrats have continued to insist they expect their candidates will be buoyed by abortion ballot measures. They hope it will help them in the presidential election and key Senate races, as Democrats face close races in states with abortion ballot measures like Montana, Florida and Arizona. ""Wherever they've been on the ballot, we've had a significant turnout of folks who care deeply about reproductive freedom,"" Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., who leads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told The Post. ""Folks who turn out understand that the Republican candidates tend to be diametrically opposed to that -- and so they vote for the referendum and they vote for the Democratic candidate.""

Harris and Trump are still neck-and-neck in the polls. While polling has largely been in support of abortion ballot measures coming out in favor of reproductive rights -- and no ballot measure since the Supreme Court's ruling has yet come out against abortion rights -- it remains to be seen how the measures in this year's election will fare. Florida's ballot measure will require 60% of the vote in order to pass, meaning it will have to clear a particularly high bar compared with other states that only need a simple majority.

What Trump would actually do on abortion if elected. Though the ex-president has repeatedly said he does not support a national abortion ban, Democrats have been highly skeptical. Anti-abortion advocates have reframed their rhetoric to push for ""national minimum standards"" on abortion rather than ""bans"" -- phrasing restrictions differently to get around the unpopularity of abortion bans -- and the Trump campaign has not yet responded to a request for comment on if he supports a ""national minimum standard."" Anti-abortion groups have continued to push for Trump to enact national restrictions even as the ex-president has said he wants to leave it up to the states, and while the GOP's national platform doesn't call for a national ban, it does call for giving constitutional rights to fetuses, which would ban abortion by default.

The Supreme Court's ruling overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022 has made abortion into a key electoral issue, with Democrats relying on abortion rights as a tool to galvanize the party's base. Abortion ballot measures have been a key part of that strategy, emerging as the primary way for abortion rights advocates to harness public support and protect access even in states with Republican leadership. Republicans have downplayed their anti-abortion views in elections that have taken place since the Supreme Court's decision, with candidates editing their websites and toning down anti-abortion rhetoric so as to not alienate voters who support the procedure remaining legal. Trump said in April he supported abortion being left up to states after previously suggesting he could endorse a 15-week national ban, and has continued to insist he won't restrict abortion and tried to downplay the issue. His running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, has backed a national abortion ban in the past, but has more recently toned down his views, saying he supports Trump's view of leaving the issue to the states and falsely claiming at Tuesday's vice presidential debate that he never supported a national ban. The Harris campaign has continued to insist voters should not take Trump at his word, believing the ex-president would still listen to his anti-abortion base and take steps to ban or restrict the procedure if elected."

A number of the biggest names in Hollywood came out in support of Biden before he dropped out of the race, before turning their support to Harris. Olivia Rodrigo, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris by sharing a video of a speech the vice president gave promising to ""stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans."" Major Democratic fundraiser George Clooney, who used a New York Times essay to call for Biden to drop out of the race, lent his support to Harris and Barbra Streisand said she would support Harris because of her vow to fight for reproductive rights. Musician John Legend, who performed at the Democratic National Convention in 2024, posted he was ""so ready"" for a Harris presidency. Director Spike Lee, ""West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin and director Ken Burns hrew their support behind Harris, along with actresses Rosie O'Donnell and Jamie Lee Curtis. Robert De Niro, who narrated an advertisement for the Biden campaign, praised the president's ""selfless patriotism"" in a statement that did not mention Harris but said ""there is nothing more important for our country than defeating Donald Trump at the ballot box."" British pop artist Charli XCX brought Harris into the Gen Z fold by tweeting ""kamala IS brat,"" an endorsement that was met by Harris' team changing the background photo on her X account to the ""brat"" green color and using the same font used on Charli XCX's album of the same name. Rapper Cardi B, who in May said she wouldn't be endorsing Biden, tweeted ""AHAHAHAHA LETS GOOOOO I TOLD YALLL KAMALA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 2024 candidate...."" Pop musician Kesha said she plans to support Harris in November and, when asked how she felt about Vance, responded ""f -- - that man."" Beyonc√© has not made a public endorsement but did give the Harris campaign permission to use her song ""Freedom"" in a video of her first official visit to her campaign's headquarters, a rare approval from the superstar musician. Beyonc√©'s mom and businesswoman Tina Knowles endorsed Harris with an Instagram post. Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle and former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have also thrown their support behind Harris. Former President Jimmy Carter, 99, reportedly told his son last week he was trying to make it to his 100th birthday so he could cast his vote for Kamala Harris. ""Sex in the City"" actress and former New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon threw her support behind Harris and her Vice Presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, in a post that read: ""I'm Walzing on air!"" Billionaire Mark Cuban, who previously said he was committed to voting for Biden, has also supported Harris and endorsed Walz as her running mate, calling him someone who ""can sit at the kitchen table and make you feel like you have know him forever."" Actor Tony Goldwyn, Republican political commentator Ana Navarro, comedian Mindy Kaling and actress Kerry Washington each supported the Harris-Walz campaign by hosting one evening of the Democratic National Convention. Nick Offerman, Jane Fonda, Ben Stiller, Kathy Griffin, John Stamos, Ed Helms, Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz were among those who appeared on a ""Comics for Harris"" virtual rally via Zoom, which reportedly raised close to half a million dollars for the Harris campaign. Over Labor Day weekend, a fundraiser for the Democratic ticket in Southampton, New York was hosted by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and fashion designer Tory Burch, among others. Actors Matt Damon and Lin-Manuel Miranda will attend fundraiser in New York City in September -- for which tickets are listed at $25,000 per person -- to support the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket, Bloomberg reported. Actress Aubrey Plaza posted a photo of herself on Instagram holding Grumpy Cat -- the face of a famous meme -- with the caption ""HARRIS üá∫üá∏ WALZ. Mel Brooks said he was ""all in"" for the Harris and Walz ticket in a post to social media holding his dog, adding ""I don't have a cat, so a dog will have to do!"" Stevie Nicks did not name a particular candidate when she encouraged her followers to vote in an Instagram post this week, but signed her message ""Childless Dog Lady."" Billionaire pop star Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris in an Instagram post minutes after a debate between Harris and Donald Trump wrapped up, with a photo of her holding her cat that has since been recreated by several other celebrities. After declining to endorse a candidate in 2020, Martha Stewart said at the Retail Influencer CEO Forum she will supporting Kamala Harris in the election because she wants a president ""who doesn't hate New York"" and ""doesn't hate democracy,"" the Daily Beast reported. Pop star Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas, a songwriter and producer, made a video about National Voter Registration Day and Billie said they would both be voting for Harris and Walz ""because they are fighting to protect our reproductive freedom, our planet and our democracy."" Famous television scientist Bill Nye, in a video posted to the Kamala HQ TikTok account, called Trump a ""climate change denier"" and encouraged viewers to ""vote with the climate in mind."" Nye participated ""Geeks & Nerds for Harris"" fundraiser on Sept. 28 hosted by ""Wonder Woman"" star Lynda Carter that will also feature ""Star Trek"" actors LeVar Burton and Anthony Rapp, actor Misha Collins of ""Supernatural,"" Star Wars actor Mark Hamill and others.

Former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan ripped off his shirt while on stage at the Republican National Convention last month to reveal a Trump-Vance campaign shirt underneath, and called Trump his ""hero"" and the ""greatest president of the United States."" Musician Kid Rock has been vocal about his support of Trump in the past and at the RNC revamped his song ""American Bad Ass"" to include references to Trump. UFC President and personality Dana White called Trump the ""toughest, most resilient human being."" Rapper and reality TV star Amber Rose gave a speech at the RNC in support of Trump. Country music stars Chris Janson and Jason Aldean also appeared at the convention. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy in January said voting for Trump over Biden was a ""no-brainer."" Public-facing billionaires like Elon Musk and Steve Wynn have also supported the former president. Actress Rosanne Barr, a longtime conservative supporter of Trump, clapped back at Cuban's endorsement of the Harris-Walz ticket and called the VP pick ""another reason Harris is a disaster."" Rapper Azealia Banks last year said she would vote for Donald Trump in Novemebr and she appeared at a rally in Florida this summer. Actor Jon Voight has defended Trump on multiple occasions. 50 Cent's 2023 song ""Many Men (Wish Death)"" started trending online after the assassination attempt of Trump last month. The rapper responded by putting Trump's face on the cover of his ""Get Rich or Die Tryin.'"" While it's hard to call the response an official endorsement, he did appear to support the president in 2020 before apparently backtracking. Other celebrities who have supported Trump in the past, but not outright endorsed him yet this election season, include Lil Wayne and ""Happy Days"" star Scott Baio. Trump thanked Brittany Mahomes, wife of NFL superstar Patrick Mahomes, for her ""defending him"" after she lashed out at social media users who criticized her for liking several pro-Trump posts last month (Mahomes has not formally endorsed a candidate). At a rally in Las Vegas, Trump thanked reggaeton star Nicky Jam for his endorsement, but apparently thought he was a she -- saying: ""Do you know Nicky? She's hot. Where's Nicky?"" -- before correcting himself after Jam climbed to the stage, saying, ""Oh, look, I'm glad he came up.""

Notable names missing from the list of public supporters include billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who called the decision ""too important to rush."""

""There's no question the discussion around family life, childbearing and pronatalism has gotten a lot more popular and gotten media attention because of JD Vance,"" Brad Wilcox, the director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, told the Associated Press.

The total fertility rate in the United States fell to 1.62 births per woman last year, a 2% decline from the year before and the lowest recorded rate since at least the 1930s. Reasons for the declining birthrate are varied and plentiful -- women are getting married later and pushing off having children as they pursue careers and higher education; the rising cost of living has impacted the economic realities of starting a family; and the U.S. lacks affordable child care and universal paid family leave policies, to name a few. Both Democrats and Republicans have supported policies that encourage family growth -- Republican senators have drafted a plan for monthly cash benefits for working families and Vice President Kamala Harris has proposed a $6,000 tax credit to parents of newborns, for example -- though conservatives tend to be more vocal about the goal of boosting birth rates. Economists have warned that a declining birth rate, and aging population, could spell disaster for the nation's Social Security program -- without enough young, working people to counterbalance the number of Social Security dependents, the existing system isn't sustainable. The same is true of other economic institutions that need to continue to replace retiring workers with those of the next generations. Experts also say that a low birth rate demonstrates an overall decline in American stability -- people aren't expressing a desire to have fewer children, research shows, but they are more worried about the economic and social impacts that they are excited to start a family.

The United States isn't the only developed nation experiencing a decline in birth rates, and it's not the only one to be encouraging reproduction at the government level. France in 2023 had the lowest number of babies born in the country since 1946; the Japanese government has described the situation ""critical"" after years of a declining birth rates; and Italy's birth rate has declined more than 34% since 2008. Each country has implemented new policies to address the situation, including an Italian parental leave that can be taken until a child is six years old and Japan extending public insurance coverage to maternity expenses. Hungary's birth rate, once the lowest in the European Union, has started to increase over the last decade as the country implements policies like exempting women who have more than three children from income tax providing home buying and building subsidies that increase based on their marital status and the number of children per household.

Donald Trump, who made conservative appointments to the Supreme Court resulting in the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, has supported states determining their own abortion policies. Since Roe v. Wade was overturned, 20 states have banned or restricted abortion earlier in the stages of pregnancy than what was established by Roe v. Wade, according to The New York Times. However, the former president stopped short of supporting a national ban on abortion after being coy about the matter, saying in a Truth Social post this week he ""would not support a federal abortion ban, under any circumstances."" Melania Trump's stance on abortion was largely unclear prior to her memoir. The memoir will dive into details about the former first lady's private life, which she said in a video last month ""has often been the subject of public scrutiny and misrepresentation.""

ndustry watchers predict generative AI could lead to an administrative battle of the bots between doctors and health insurers over care decisions. That leaves patients in limbo without access to medications or other treatment while institutions duke out prior authorization and denial letters by fax, phone or algorithm. Warris Bokhari is trying to change that by putting the power of AI in the hands of patients.

Bokhari, a physician-executive who has worked at Amazon, Apple and Anthem (now Elevance Health), saw that large language models like GPT-4 could be useful to summarize information for patients at different reading levels. The idea behind Claimable, his startup that launched Wednesday, is to use these models to flip the script. Or in his words, to ""take a patient story and transform it into something compelling to an insurance company.""

The company is starting by partnering with rheumatology clinics, since many patients with conditions like arthritis are on expensive drugs known as biologics, which are often subject to prior authorization. For Bokhari, this fight is personal, his mom had rheumatoid arthritis, but because he grew up in England, his family didn't have to go bankrupt to afford medication.

While building in stealth mode, he found that health insurers are often issuing denials because the guidelines for certain diseases are significantly out-of-date. Bokhari said Claimable is prompting and fine-tuning GPT-4 with the latest clinical guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology, as well as all of the FDA labels and trial data for specific drugs, in order to generate appeals letters for a flat fee of $39.95.

After testing the tech and having it generate ""hundreds and hundreds"" of letters with a human-in-the-loop for quality assurance, the fully-automated software pilot phase has generated around 50 appeal letters for real patients with an 80% denial overturn rate, said Bokhari. Most cases have been resolved in under 10 days. With a seed round led by Walkabout Ventures (he declined to disclose the amount), Claimable is hoping to add more than a hundred conditions in 2025, for patients with multiple sclerosis, cardiac diseases, diabetes, obesity, asthma and certain cancers. ""We think we could achieve a lot just by getting the patients to be heard,"" said Bokhari.

Judy Faulkner, who founded electronic health records giant Epic in 1979, has bucked convention from day one, starting with the company dress code: ""When there are visitors, you must wear clothes.""

While competitors like Cerner (now Oracle Health), Allscripts (now Veradigm) and Athenahealth, grew by taking venture capital money, executing mergers and acquisitions, going public and then private again, Faulkner has eschewed any outside interference. And she intends to keep it that way. Faulkner told Forbes she has set a plan in motion to ensure that Epic remains private, independent and employee-owned in perpetuity with a unique trust structure.

Does Project 2025 Plan A 'Registry Of Pregnancies'?

Tim Walz claimed at Tuesday's vice presidential debate that the right-wing policy agenda Project 2025 calls for a ""registry of pregnancies,"" repeating claims he's made on the campaign trail -- but that mischaracterizes the conservative proposal, which wants states to report detailed abortion, though not pregnancy, information to the government.

Vice President Kamala Harris described Project 2025's proposal more accurately in her speech at the Democratic National Convention, decrying that Republicans want to ""force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions.""

In addition to monitoring abortions in a more comprehensive way, Project 2025's proposal also calls for the CDC to stop collecting data on gender identity -- part of a broader move away from the federal government supporting transgender rights -- claiming that collecting that data ""legitimizes"" arguments in favor of transgender rights ""and encourages the phenomenon of ever-multiplying subjective identities.""

Project 2025's policy agenda -- which broadly calls for a total overhaul of the executive branch if former President Donald Trump wins the election -- is overwhelmingly opposed to abortion, proposing a total focus by the federal government to push a pro-family agenda that rejects abortion rights. The agenda says HHS should be known as the ""Department of Life"" by ""explicitly rejecting the notion that abortion is health care"" and having a mission statement that protects Americans' well-being ""from conception to natural death."" Project 2025 broadly calls for restricting abortion, suggesting the Food and Drug Administration should rescind its approval of abortion drug mifepristone and the federal government should start enforcing the Comstock Act, a long-dormant 19th century law that would ban abortion pills and any abortion equipment from being sent through the mail.

It's unclear if Trump would take up Project 2025's proposals on abortion or other issues if he's elected. The ex-president has sought to distance himself from Project 2025 and its policy proposals as they've come under controversy, though he does have ties to the Heritage Foundation -- the group spearheading the agenda -- and could always take up its proposals if elected regardless of what he says while campaigning. Trump has said he wants to leave abortion up to the states and said he opposes a national abortion ban, but has not commented on any federal reporting of abortions in states where it is allowed. Vance, who has strong links to the Heritage Foundation, said only at the debate that ""certainly we won't"" create a ""federal pregnancy monitoring agency,"" but did not comment beyond that on any increased surveillance of abortions. Vance has called for banning abortion nationwide in the past -- even as he denied doing so at Tuesday's debate -- but has more recently said he backs Trump's view that it should be left to the states.

625,978. That's the number of U.S. abortions that were reported to the CDC in 2021, the most recent year for which data is available. The CDC already requests data including the pregnant person's age, state of residence, gestational age of the fetus, race, marital status, method of abortion and number of previous births and abortions, though Project 2025's proposals would add more data like why people got abortions and impose consequences if states don't report the data. The CDC's most recent data is from before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and states started banning the procedure, though reports from non-governmental organizations suggest abortion rates have actually gone up despite the restrictions.

Polling shows that most Americans are broadly in favor of abortion rights and the issue has historically galvanized voters since the Supreme Court's June 2022 ruling, with a series of ballot measures all breaking in favor of abortion rights and races in which abortion has been a big focus often breaking in favor of Democrats. Trump has tried to minimize the issue and said he now supports leaving abortion rights up to states after previously floating support for a national 15-week ban, and Vance, who previously touted his anti-abortion views on his website prior to becoming Trump's nominee, has downplayed them since getting on the ticket. The senator said Tuesday he acknowledges Republicans have ""to do so much better of a job at earning the American People's trust back on this issue, where they frankly just don't trust us."" Democrats and the Harris campaign have also used Project 2025 as a key argument against Trump, repeatedly pointing to its extreme proposals as a key reason for voters to oppose the ex-president and insisting he will carry out its plans even as Trump has tried to distance himself."
Collapse Of Reproductive Rights In America On Exhibit In Dallas,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chaddscott/2024/10/02/collapse-of-reproductive-rights-in-america-on-exhibit-in-dallas/,2024-10-02T14:04:32Z,"Artists from around the South brought together to share stories of a national healthcare crisis.

Tens of millions of Americans found themselves asking that question in spring 2022 when news leaked that the Supreme Court would be throwing out 50 years of supposedly settled law and overturning the Roe v. Wade decision guaranteeing women access to abortion nationwide.

Dallas-based curators Emily Edwards and Sara Hignite were among those in disbelief.

Is it Real? Yes It Is! (1969), the title of Juanita McNeely's multi-panel painting depicting her harrowing illegal abortion experience in the permanent collection and presently on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.

The feeling and artwork gave name to an unprecedented exhibition from Edwards and Hignite, the first organized and mounted in the American South directly addressing abortion access and reproductive rights. The pair has assembled more than 30 artists, most from or connected to the South-where reproductive rights have suffered their greatest assault-most representing marginalized communities-those most at risk from the politicians' and judges' anti-woman cruelties.

Like 28-year-old Amber Nicole Thurman, a Black woman from Georgia who died during childbirth from a preventable infection after being denied life-saving healthcare by the state's draconian abortion laws. Art curators work their entire lives hoping shows intersect with current events, capturing lighting in a bottle, drawing crowds and media attention. Not in this case.

In the case of ""Is It Real? Contemporary Artists Address Reproductive Freedom,"" it's ""ripped from the headlines"" feel represents tragedy. Ongoing tragedy. Needless tragedy.

""The United States is experiencing a reproductive care emergency across the board, and the worst states are in the South, and that's why this exhibition is based in the South,"" Hignite told Forbes.com. ""That's why we're featuring and focusing on artists who have connections to the southern states. If you look at the numbers, potentially every state in the South has a ban on abortion because you've either got total bans or six-week bans. We're living it every single day.""

""Is it Real"" opens at Lagoon Studio in Dallas (1105 Lagoon Drive, Dallas, TX, 75207) on October 5 and runs through October 26, 2024, nine days before Election Day in America.

The symbolism of debuting the presentation in Dallas-where Roe v. Wade was first argued in 1970 before reaching the Supreme Court in 1973-and in Texas-where dogma and control trump safety for pregnant women-is not lost on the curators.

""Is it Real"" examines strategies contemporary artists employ to address the topic of reproductive freedom. Leading with empathy and fact, and challenging often deeply rooted misinformation, the exhibition seeks to destigmatize and humanize reproductive care.

""By transporting people who are experiencing the show into so many different perspectives, into, quite literally, the shoes of some of the experiences, (visitors) are able to see how multifaceted this reproductive freedom crisis is,"" Edwards told Forbes.com. ""(The artists) help foster empathy by rooting (issues) in emotion and in beauty.""

That's what artists can do. They can't wave a magic wand and change laws, but they can change minds.

""Sarah and I both believe in the soft power of art,"" Edwards added. ""If someone comes in and they want to protest the work, they're likely not leaving being like, 'I'm going to vote blue,' but there's a softening that happens, and I think that's the hope for everyone who comes in here who is either on the fence, isn't sure, maybe is not an activist, maybe is just not informed on these issues. I've seen people soften, including my own parents who do not view this topic the same way I do. They've come to every show, and I see them soften, and I see them care, and I see them ask questions, and those questions turn into people changing their minds over time.""

Minds do change. Ballot initiatives related to abortion access nationwide since the repeal of Roe have overwhelmingly gone in favor of more access.

""I have had conversations with people who have started having conversations with family members and friends or people in their community who didn't believe in the right to abortion and maybe we're moving the needle now as they're hearing about this project,"" Hignite said. ""I don't want to overstate it. Obviously, this exhibition is not changing the landscape of abortion access in the country, but if we can just start cracking the window to the idea of coming around to believing in everyone's right to self-determination and bodily autonomy, then we will be so proud.""

While abortion access draws most of the headlines in the contemporary struggle for reproductive rights in America, it's not the only issue, nor the only issue approached in the exhibition.

""It's about the mortality rate of pregnant women, particularly Black women,"" Edwards said. ""It's about rape and sexual assault. It's about trans men who are also experiencing these experiences, and so having these different stories coming together in the show that really all interwoven to show how widespread this is, how this impacts everyone.""

Maternal mortality is on the rise in America. Black women, Native American and Alaska Native people suffer disproportionately. The South, of course, leads the way. Restrictive abortion policies have always gone hand-in-hand with higher maternal mortality. Not that anywhere in America can brag. America ranks 55 globally for maternal mortality, worst of any developed nation.

Broadly speaking, the U.S. is experiencing a reproductive care emergency. From proposed total bans on abortion-including in the case of rape and incest-to threats against birth control, Plan B, and IVF. Abortion access serves as the flash point for a frightening regression of not only reproductive care in America, a subject always impacting women more gravely, but also a frightening regression in how women are viewed, treated, and respected societally.

In November, 70 million or so Americans will vote for Donald Trump for president. He was found liable for rape. His running mate J.D. Vance has verbalized insulting, denigrating, dehumanizing opinions related to women across a spectrum of subjects over many years that would have been cringe-worthy in the 1960s. Comments that would have immediately disqualified a candidate for local office, let alone national office, just 10 years ago.

""Is It Real?"" exposes the harsh realities of the current political climate and envisions a more just country in which every human has the basic right to control their own body and determine their own future.

That hardly seems radical, but in 2024, in Dallas, in Texas, across the South, it is. An advertising poster for the show featuring a Guerrilla Girls Broadband artwork was banned from Dallas Rapid Transit rail stations.

That's why Edwards and Hignite chose to finance and present their project themselves, not in a museum.

""We didn't have to worry about any of the institutional challenges and bureaucracy,"" Hignite explained. ""We wanted to make sure that we could fully realize our curatorial vision, and we decided early on that the best way to do that was to do it independently.""

They've bootstrapped all the fundraising themselves, every penny, grass roots style. They've been supported by The Goss-Michael Foundation, ACLU of Texas, Texas Abortion Advocacy Network, and more than 100 individual donors. ""Is It Real?"" will also be raising funds for Texas Equal Access Fund and The Afiya Center, two Texas-based mutual aid organizations providing essential support to people needing reproductive care and related services.

Programming will include a film series organized in partnership with Spacy DTX; wellness workshops; panel discussions; Get Out the Vote initiatives; a resource library; and a reflection space organized by Make Art with Purpose. Admission to the exhibition and related programs are free and open to the public.

The collapse of reproductive rights in America and its resulting consequences represent a tragedy. In the face of tragedy and crisis and inequality and barbarity, artists make work. Curators bring that work to the public. The public's role is to vote."

Election 2024 Swing State Polls: Trump Tightens Race In These Two Harris Strongholds (Forbes)"
"As Healthcare And Politics Intersect, Doctors Urge Patients To Vote.",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/adairalandry/2024/10/01/as-healthcare-and-politics-intersect-doctors-urge-patients-to-vote/,2024-10-01T16:05:11Z,"Five years ago, a young woman with stabbing abdominal pain arrived at my emergency department. Her blood pressure steadily dropped as she developed pale, clammy skin. We told her, ""You are bleeding into your abdomen. We see blood on your ultrasound. We are worried you are having an ectopic pregnancy."" Within minutes, she was in the operating room getting a life-saving surgical procedure for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, a type of pregnancy that is considered non-viable for the fetus.

Remarkably, our pregnant patient survived. Yet, what stands out today is that the legality of our care, years ago, was never a concern. The team was centered only on providing the care she needed.

The Political Landscape of Healthcare

Today, the delivery of healthcare has become increasingly politicized. The recent overturn of Roe v. Wade reversed rights for pregnant people, leaving many vulnerable under recent state abortion bans. In states where exceptions for ectopic pregnancies exist within their abortion ban, women have still encountered hospitals that ""refused to treat their ectopic pregnancies."" This shift in regulation underscores the intersection of healthcare and politics, a reminder of how both physicians and patients should engage in the democratic process.

While a growing number of politicians have healthcare expertise, many lack a nuanced understanding of medical practice and healthcare delivery. This knowledge gap creates challenges when those who regulate medicine are not the ones providing it. ""Doctors and patients should be protected to make collaborative decisions -- without the intrusion of politics"" says Dr. Sharon Malone, physician, patient advocate, and author. The intertwining of politics and healthcare complicates efforts to address fundamental health issues. ""We haven't agreed on the most basic tenant: does everyone in this country deserve healthcare?"" she argues.

Aspects of healthcare influenced by politics extend beyond women's health. Insurance reimbursement, gun violence, criminalization of illicit substances, pharmaceutical cost-regulation are just a few active political issues that affect patient outcomes.

The Need for Voter Registration

As of 2022, there are approximately 162 million registered voters in the United States, leaving millions without a voice in upcoming elections. The journey toward change begins with voter registration. Politicians, like Elizabeth Warren, are working to streamline this process, recently announcing that patients filling out health insurance forms via HealthCare.gov will receive information about voter registration. ""The health of our democracy depends on Americans registering and exercising their right to vote,"" Warren stated.

In Minnesota and Pennsylvania, leaders have designated August as Civic Health Month to emphasize the importance of voting on healthcare. And yet, despite the clear push to increase patients' civic engagement, some critics -- including physicians -- oppose discussing voter registration in clinical settings.

Stanley Goldfarb MD, has been outspoken against doctors speaking with patients about voter-registration. He argues that ""leftists are making the doctor's office a major cog in their voter-registration and turnout machine."" Why the act of registering to vote at the encouragement of a doctor feels threatening or unwarranted is unclear to me, a physician who routinely witnesses the profound and direct impact politics has on patients. His organization, Do No Harm, states that they are focused on ""combating the attack on our healthcare system from woke activists.""

""Many believe that doctors should 'stay in their lane' and not become involved in the political process, as [patients] may see this as a conflict and not get care,"" Dr. Ayana Jordan, Associate Professor at NYU School of Medicine argues. She clarifies that our role is to be non-partisan and avoid swaying patients in our direction. ""Our role is to ensure that patients understand how to register to vote, make this process as easy as possible, and discuss issues most pertinent to them."" she adds.

Critics fear that doctors will abuse their power to sway patients towards their own individual political agenda. ""It's not just ""vote"". It is vote for Joe Biden, if we are honest. Inherently, the doctor's political bias is reflected in the encouragement. What happens if the patient's father is wearing a MAGA hat. Do you still remind them to vote?"" says one physician, Vinay Prasad MD MPH.

I do agree that physicians should certainly not impose their own beliefs onto patients. And that if they ask one patient to register to vote they should indeed ask all, when clinically appropriate. However, it is countercultural to see physicians grossly avoiding the empowerment and education of patients. A physician need only say, ""I'm sorry you can't afford your life-saving medication"" once for it to be clear there's no effective solution in that statement.

Why Clinicians Should Encourage Voting

In 2022, the AMA declared that voting is a social determinant of health. Dr. Alister Martin, physician, CEO and Co-Founder of A Healthier Democracy, a non-partisan organization that is determined to increase voter registration among patients, says that ""data demonstrates that across rural and urban regions, when voting rates are high, health outcomes are better."" While he believes the exact cause is hard to pinpoint, he suspects areas with high voter engagement are better able to pull in resources that help patients access healthcare. ""These communities have more specialty clinics, hospitals remain open, health centers are available. In the rural areas with less civic engagement, there are more hospital closures."" adds Martin.

Martin emphasizes that voting fosters a sense of agency among patients. ""Those who vote generally feel more empowered to effect change in their lives."" He also highlights a concerning statistic: 72 million eligible individuals are not registered to vote, a gap that can influence electoral outcomes and therefore healthcare related policies.

Encouraging voter registration is not only legal but also supported by leading healthcare organizations, such as the AMA. The encouragement should not be invasive, biased, or demanding. Martin advocates for integrating questions about voter registration into patient social histories, asking, ""Do you smoke? Drink? Are you registered to vote?"" He believes that by enabling patients to exercise their voting rights, we can all contribute to a healthier democracy."
JD Vance Vs. 'Childless Cat Ladies': VP Candidate's Views Explained Ahead Of Tonight's Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/01/jd-vance-vs-childless-cat-ladies-vp-candidates-views-explained-ahead-of-tonights-debate/,2024-10-01T16:04:55Z,"Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio is likely to be asked at Tuesday's vice presidential debate about comments he made denouncing Vice President Kamala Harris and others as ""childless cat ladies"" who don't have a ""direct stake"" in the country's future, which reflects a worldview that has affected Vance's policy views as he stands to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.

Vance will face off against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at Tuesday's debate in Philadelphia. The debate comes as the Harris campaign and Walz -- a cat owner himself -- have repeatedly highlighted Vance's ""childless cat ladies"" comments on the campaign trail. Walz has posted videos with cats and said when Taylor Swift endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, ""It's not as if I didn't warn these guys a few months ago: You mess with cat people, you will find out."" The governor attacked Vance for his comments even before he was named Harris' running mate in August, criticizing the senator for apologizing to cats instead of women for his comments and telling MSNBC, ""My god, they went after cat people ... It would be funny if it wasn't so sad.""

In comments to right-wing journalist Megyn Kelly about his ""childless cat ladies"" comments going viral, Vance said his remarks were ""obviously ... a sarcastic comment"" and he has ""nothing against cats,"" but defended his broader views. ""People are focusing so much on the sarcasm and not on the substance ... and the substance of what I said, Megyn -- I'm sorry, it is true,"" Vance said.

Vance's views that emphasize the importance of married families with children echo views espoused by the Heritage Foundation, a private right-wing organization with close ties to Vance that's recently come under fire for its 900-page policy agenda for a second Trump presidency known as ""Project 2025."" The Heritage Foundation has publicly called for ""encouraging marriage at the front end of a woman's childbearing years"" in order to increase the birth rate, and Project 2025 heavily emphasizes the importance of the nuclear family and imposing policies that strengthen it. The policy blueprint calls for ending ""LGBTQ equity"" initiatives and others in the Department of Health and Human Services and ""replacing such policies with those encouraging marriage, work, motherhood, fatherhood, and nuclear families,"" for instance, along with restricting abortion rights and eliminating federal healthcare mandates around contraception coverage. About the Heritage Foundation's proposals, Vance spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk told Forbes, ""The views of any outside group have zero effect on JD's policy positions -- full stop."" Vance's office also directed Forbes to comments Vance has made noting Project 2025 has no affiliation with the Trump campaign and saying he thinks ""there's some good ideas in there"" and ""there's some things that I disagree with.""

Vance's comments denouncing ""childless cat ladies"" have drawn widespread condemnation from the left, particularly from female voters. Actress Jennifer Aniston said in an Instagram post she ""truly can't believe that this is coming from a potential VP of the United States."" Addressing Vance, she added ""I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day."" Swift's post endorsing Harris was accompanied by a photo of the singer holding her own cat. Former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., also criticized Vance on X, saying she is a ""proud mom"" of stepchildren -- like Harris -- and she and husband Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., were trying to conceive through in vitro fertilization before she was shot in 2011. ""To suggest we are somehow lesser is disgraceful,"" Giffords said. While Harris has not commented on his attacks directly, her stepdaughter Ella Emhoff posted an Instagram story saying, ""How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I,"" referring to her brother. ""I love my three parents,"" she added. Harris also garnered a significant amount of high-profile support from female voters in her campaign's opening days as Vance's comments first went viral, with more than 100,000 women joining a Zoom call Thursday to support the Harris campaign and fans of Taylor Swift mobilizing for the vice president.

How Vance's policy views would actually affect a potential Trump presidency. The vice presidential candidate is likely to fall in line with Trump's chosen policy agenda, and the ex-president has publicly espoused more moderate positions than Vance on issues like abortion, calling for the issue to be left up to the states. (Abortion rights advocates believe he may take harsher action if elected, however.) Trump has also publicly distanced himself from Project 2025 and its more extreme proposals, though many involved with his first presidential administration helped author the policy agenda.

Trump named Vance as his vice presidential candidate on July 15 as the Republican National Convention was underway, siding with allies like son Donald Trump Jr., who had pushed for Vance to be the nominee over more moderate choices like Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. Vance was elected to the Senate in 2022 and was previously best known as the author of memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy."" He notably spoke out against Trump in the 2016 election before he ultimately claimed his views had changed and he now strongly supports the ex-president. Trump's selection of Vance has come under increasing scrutiny as his more extreme views have gone viral and as President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and Harris replaced him, shaking up a contest that polling previously suggested could go more easily for Trump. The vice presidential candidate has struggled in the polls, with a FiveThirtyEight analysis finding he is the least popular non-incumbent vice presidential nominee since at least 2004, and The Hill reported even some House Republicans denounced him as Trump's running mate."

Vance told The New York Times in February that his populist economic vision can be described as ""applying as much upward pressure on wages and as much downward pressure on the services that the people use as possible."" The senator said he supports raising the minimum wage as an incentive to get workers back in the workforce -- and has co-sponsored legislation to raise it -- and other government intervention to boost industries, like providing subsidies or tax credits. He does not support more stringent government regulations on private businesses, however, telling The Times that to boost the economy, ""there's a lot you can do on the regulatory side -- make building nuclear facilities easier, make building natural gas pipelines easier, make building housing easier -- that doesn't cost money and in fact brings in money."" Vance also supports tariffs that impose taxes on foreign goods, saying that while that can result in higher prices, ""when you are forced to do more with your domestic labor force, you have all of these positive dynamic effects."" He told The Times that while he wouldn't want to raise taxes on middle class Americans, he isn't necessarily opposed to raising taxes on the wealthy, but asked, ""How much revenue does that actually raise?"" Vance is also a big proponent of cryptocurrency, holding bitcoin himself and drafting legislation that would help the cryptocurrency industry.

Vance told The Times he supports Social Security, saying, ""I don't know why people think that you solve many problems by taking a bunch of elderly people and saying, 'You're on your own.'"" The senator suggested he believes in raising more money for the program through a combination of tariffs and bolstering the American labor force, arguing that if more Americans are working rather than relying on public assistance, it would mean more money can go toward Social Security.

Vance has been widely criticized for his views on abortion. In 2022 he said he ""certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally"" and opposed the idea that pregnant people could simply cross state lines to obtain an abortion if the state where they reside banned the procedure. He has also compared abortion to slavery, saying in 2021, ""While the people who obviously suffer the most are those subjected to it, I think it has this morally distorting effect on the entire society."" The senator was part of a broader group of GOP lawmakers who asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to enforce the Comstock Act in 2023, a long-dormant law from the 19th century that would ban the mailing of anything related to abortion. While the letter specifically asked to stop the mailing of abortion pills, experts have suggested the law could be interpreted more broadly to ban the mailing of abortion-related equipment altogether, which would effectively ban the procedure in practice by ensuring physicians can't get the necessary materials to perform it. Vance has more recently downplayed his former support for restricting abortion and endorsed Trump's view of leaving the issue up to the states.

Vance has echoed Trump in calling for mass deportations of immigrants from the U.S. and criticized the Biden administration for allowing an influx of undocumented immigrants. He also helped spread false rumors against Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, and disapproved of the Biden administration extending temporary legal protections to Haitian migrants. The senator has denounced using immigrants for cheaper labor in the U.S., saying business owners should instead increase incentives to lure American workers.

Vance has perhaps garnered the most attention for his attacks on childless Americans, with comments resurfacing from 2021 in which he complained about Democrats being ""childless cat ladies"" who ""want to make the rest of the country miserable too"" and don't have a ""direct stake"" in the country's future. While Vance has claimed his comments were a joke, they do reflect his broader views, as the senator has pushed policies that would incentivize people to have children and benefit families. He has suggested there should be a higher tax rate for childless adults and even said in 2021 parents should have more voting power than voters without children, and has touted a policy in Hungary that provides loans to married couples and then forgives those loans if the couple has children. Vance has supported ""universal childbirth"" policies that would provide healthcare coverage for childbirth, though he has opposed ""universal childcare"" proposals, which he said in 2021 are a ""massive subsidy to the lifestyle preferences of the affluent over the preferences of the middle and working class."" He has also supported expanding child tax credits for low-income families, but has been criticized for missing a Senate vote on the issue. The senator made comments in 2021 suggesting he was against no-fault divorce -- though he did not explicitly call for repealing it -- claiming that ""children suffered"" because of more relaxed views around divorce and calling for a return to viewing marriage as ""sacred"" in order to preserve American families.

Vance has deep ties to the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank spearheading the controversial Project 2025 policy agenda proposing an extreme overhaul of the executive branch should Trump win the election. The senator authored the introduction to Heritage president Kevin Roberts' forthcoming book -- which calls for a ""second American Revolution"" and says ""it's time to circle the wagons and load the muskets"" -- and has long been allied with the organization, with Roberts telling Politico in March Vance is ""absolutely going to be one of the leaders -- if not the leader -- of our movement."" Prior to joining Congress, Vance penned the introduction to a Heritage Foundation report that endorses many of the policies also mentioned in Project 2025, promoting heterosexual nuclear families and decrying abortion and public assistance programs. He has also expressed support for a key pillar of the Project 2025 agenda, which calls for replacing career civil servants with political appointees. Vance has not explicitly endorsed Project 2025, however, particularly as the Trump campaign has tried to distance itself from its proposals. He said in July, prior to becoming Trump's running mate, that he thinks ""there's some good ideas in"" Project 2025's policy blueprint, but it also has ""some things I disagree with.""

LGBTQ+ advocacy groups criticized Vance's nomination as Trump's running mate due to his record on LGBTQ+ rights. As a senator, Vance introduced legislation opposing transgender rights, authoring bills that would classify gender-affirming care for minors as a felony and ban ""X"" from being used as a neutral gender designation on U.S. passports. Vance also said in 2022 he would vote no on legislation to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, and has voiced support for policies like Florida's law known as ""Don't Say Gay,"" which restrict what schools can say about sexual orientation and gender identity.

Vance is one of the GOP lawmakers who has vocally opposed providing additional aid to Ukraine, and has come under fire for saying in 2022 that he ""do[esn't] really care what happens to"" the eastern European country. The senator called at the Republican National Convention for the U.S.'s allies to ""share in the burden of securing world peace,"" saying there should be ""no more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer,"" and told The Times in June the U.S. ""should be dealing with other countries based on whether they're good or bad for America's interests."" He criticized the Biden administration's Ukraine policy to The Times, saying the U.S. was not sufficiently working to deter China from invading Taiwan because ""we're sending all the damn weapons to Ukraine,"" though also acknowledged that handling the situation in Ukraine means ""there's going to have to be some American security assistance over the long term."" Vance also agreed that Russia gaining control of Ukraine is ""is not in our interest."" The senator has expressed strong support for Israel in its war against Hamas, saying at a rally on Saturday that his peace plan is ""elect Donald Trump"" and suggesting he aligns with Trump's view that ""the only way to get to peace is to destroy Hamas and let Israel finish the job.""

Vance's views stand in stark contrast to Democratic rival Walz, who has championed progressive policies including abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights and opposing climate changes. Walz is a gun owner but is strongly in favor of gun control measures like universal background checks and banning bump stocks, in contrast to Vance, whom the National Rifle Association described as ""a true Second Amendment champion"" and has opposed gun control reforms. As governor of Minnesota, Walz has signed bills into law that include free meals for school children, expanded protections for workers, restoring voting rights for the formerly incarcerated, climate change initiatives and legalizing marijuana, among other measures. Like Vance, Walz supports expanding the child tax credit, and he helped enact a nation-leading $1,750 tax credit in Minnesota after a federal tax credit expired. Walz's administration also eliminated many beneficiaries' income taxes on Social Security benefits, which Trump has also called for.

While Vance's economic philosophy has a strong emphasis on bolstering the American worker, the senator has come under fire from the left for his mixed record on supporting labor unions. Though Vance made headlines for visiting striking United Auto Workers union members on the picket line, the senator opposed the PRO Act that would have strengthened protections for unionized workers and codified the collective bargaining process. He told Politico in March that he opposed the legislation in part because he favors a system where industries negotiate union deals, rather than individual workplaces or companies, and because he ""think[s] it's dumb to hand over a lot of power to a union leadership that is aggressively anti-Republican.""

Vance has reached across the aisle for several of his efforts in Congress, working with Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, on a bill to improve rail safety standards after the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on legislation regarding banking regulations. The vice presidential candidate told Politico in March that his wariness of big corporations often aligns him with progressive Democrats even as he disagrees with them on other issues, saying, ""If you look at the people that I've worked with most successfully, it's people who, even though they're from the left, recognize that something's pretty fundamentally broken about American society."" Warren, for example, is ""at least thinking deeply about what's going on in the country and why things seem to be going off the rails,"" Vance said. In his June interview with The Times, Vance said ""Bernie Bros"" are the group on the left ""whose politics I'm open to,"" while criticizing ""center-left liberals who are doing very well,"" arguing them and their center-right counterparts ""have an incredible blind spot about how much their success is built on a system that is not serving people who they should be serving.""

34.7%. That's the average number of U.S. adults who have a favorable view of Vance as of Monday, according to a compilation of polls by FiveThirtyEight, versus 45.7% of Americans who have a negative view of him. Polling suggests the Ohio senator is the least popular non-incumbent vice presidential candidate in at least the past 20 years, according to FiveThirtyEight."
A Faux 'October Surprise' -- How Misinformation Could Upend The Election,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/01/a-faux-october-surprise-how-misinformation-could-upend-the-election/,2024-10-01T14:08:23Z,"As we head into the final weeks before Election Day, the political campaigns are likely bracing for an unexpected ""October Surprise"" that could influence voters and impact the results. The term was first coined by William Casey, who served as campaign manager for Ronald Reagan during the 1980 presidential campaign, yet, there have been October election-upending events going back to the 19th century.

What Casey and his predecessors likely never expected was how misinformation -- and even disinformation -- could be employed to sway voters. Advances in technology like Deep Fakes, an overreliance on social media for news and information, and foreign actors who seek to undermine confidence in our elections have created a perfect storm for such a nightmare scenario.

Nearly eight years ago, a video of then-candidate and now-former President Donald Trump surfaced in which he bragged about grabbing women by their genitals. It was an ""October surprise"" that almost derailed his campaign. Four years later, Trump contracted Covid-19 and was forced to cancel a debate with then-candidate Joe Biden and stop all campaigning.

With just weeks to go until Election Day, there could be a similar surprise -- and perhaps even a made-up one. Yet, the consequences could be huge.

""When Hillary Clinton recently warned Kamala Harris about the threat of an October surprise, she knew what she was talking about. Remember James Comey, just 11 days before the 2016 election? That turned out to be a nothing burger -- and Comey was rebuked in subsequent investigations for his actions. Or Pizzagate? That, too, turned out to be false,"" said Susan Campbell, distinguished lecturer in the College of Arts & Sciences at the University of New Haven.

""This year, voters must be on guard for the biggest threat to a free and fair election: Misinformation. They must steel themselves against lies and distortions, particularly on social media,"" added Campbell. ""Recently, an army of bots and trolls took to X(witter) to say that the federal government had not done enough to help the people harmed by Hurricane Helene, which was false.""

The spread of misinformation and disinformation during an election season isn't new and actually dates back to the country's founding. Smithsonian magazine previously reported how in the 1800 election Thomas Jefferson engaged in a ""smear campaign against then-president John Adams,"" which ""climaxed with an unexpected October broadside."" The late-season attack, carried out by Alexander Hamilton -- a critic of Adams and who went on to be Jefferson's VEEP -- remains one of the earliest examples of an effective late-campaign attack on a political rival.

During the 1840 election, rumors circulated that the Whig Party had paid residents of Pennsylvania to cross state lines and cast votes in New York during the 1838 election. There was no basis that this occurred, but people believed it -- just as some today believe illegal immigrants can head to the polls to sway the election results.

It was also 100 years before William Casey coined the term ""October Surprise"" that a disinformation campaign almost impacted the presidential election results.

The New York Truth newspaper published a forged letter on October 20, 1880, allegedly written by Republican candidate James Garfield voicing support for Chinese immigration at a time when many white Americans were opposed to Chinese immigration over fears that they were stealing jobs from American workers. In truth, both campaigns were in favor of immigration restrictions. Garfield went on to win the election by a narrow margin, but there has been speculation if the forged letter was released a little earlier the situation could have been different.

Misinformation/disinformation has clearly existed for a while, but social media could impact how it reaches the masses.

""The World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report highlights that the primary risk for 2024 is the use of misinformation and disinformation by malicious actors to disrupt society and further polarize communities,"" warned

Craig Barkacs, professor of business law and ethics in the MBA programs at the Knauss School of Business at the University of San Diego.

The October surprise may no longer be a single event or revelation. We could already see many at work, with misinformation already circulating about Senator JD Vance and his couch, and Governor Tim Walz supporting post-birth abortions.

But users of social media should be on guard for even more misinformation and disinformation in the coming weeks.

""There may be several October surprises in the works,"" said Barkacs. ""For most individuals, these may not make a significant difference as their opinions are already formed. For a small percentage, however, these surprises could be pivotal. The presidential elections of 2016 and 2020 illustrate how a tiny fraction of votes in crucial swing states can determine the outcome.""

Artificial intelligence may offer the ability to micro-target voters on social media while being strategically timed and aimed at a particular audience to help alter the results of the election.

""These micro-targeted voters are likely to be low-information voters, who are more susceptible to misinformation. These individuals, often unaware of the broader context, are the first to believe and spread unfounded stories,"" Barkacs continued. ""Research indicates that micro-targeting specific groups can influence voting behavior. We should be concerned about just what impact a deviously concocted October surprise could have on the outcome of the election.""

The most effective way to combat misinformation and disinformation is to ensure that we have a well-informed electorate, and that could users offering direct responses to the more outlandish commentary spread on the social networks.

""This go-round, there can be no passivity,"" suggested Campbell. ""For the good of the election, voters must find and amplify the truth -- to, in effect, shout down the trolls."""
