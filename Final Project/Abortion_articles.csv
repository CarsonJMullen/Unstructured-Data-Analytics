Newly revealed internal documents from TikTok show company officials acknowledging how addictive the app can be for teenagers. Fourteen attorneys general have been investigating the app for two years regarding child safety. They subpoenaed the company and obtained internal communications. At TikTok's request, the states redacted privileged and confidential parts of the suit, but in Kentucky, the redaction was not effective on some 30 pages meant to be kept secret. NPR and Kentucky Public Radio have been reviewing dozens of these pages.

Cleanup efforts are underway in Florida after Hurricane Milton battered the state with high winds, a storm surge, and torrential rains. Millions are still without power, and at least 16 deaths have been attributed to the storm. Although Milton was a serious storm, residents and officials say it was not as bad as some had feared.

SpaceX is preparing for another test launch of the Starship, the largest rocket ever made. The company aims to lift off from its test site in Cameron County, Texas as soon as Sunday. However, regulators have repeatedly delayed this launch, citing environmental concerns about the damage it will cause to surrounding areas. SpaceX's launchpad is in the middle of a major wildlife preserve that's home to hundreds of thousands of shore birds, sea turtles and other species.

What happens if a portion of the United States doesn't accept the results of this election? It was on my mind as voters told me why they were voting and what the vote meant to them during my time in Michigan. In Dearborn, I found an Arab and Muslim community fractured on how to express their political power in a time of intense grief and anger at this administration over its continued military support of Israel's war in Gaza and now Lebanon.

There are the voters who want the economy to get better and are choosing the candidate they think can deliver. Many Black voters I spoke to believe Vice President Harris will protect their civil rights and Donald Trump will roll them back. There are those who want abortion to be limited even more and those who want reproductive rights restored. Every American will make their choice on whether to vote and who to vote for in just a few weeks.

So I go back to that question, what happens if millions of Americans claim fraud if their candidate doesn't win? It's something I explored in Hillsdale County, a couple hours outside Detroit. There, the Republican Party is split between a group filled with election deniers and Republicans who still believe in the nation's institutions.

Here's everyone caught in the web of the Sean 'Diddy' Combs allegations so far,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/10/g-s1-26981/diddy-sean-combs-cassie-kid-cudi-jodeci,2024-10-11T09:07:27Z,"Sean ""Diddy"" Combs remains in a Brooklyn jail while awaiting a May 5 trial on federal charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. The hip-hop mogul has pleaded not guilty on all charges and has been denied bail twice thus far.

Before and after his arrest, Combs has also been served 12 civil lawsuits for physical assault, rape and more. The indictment and many of the lawsuits name Combs' numerous business ventures and claim they are complicit in financing and enabling the rapper's abuse inside and outside of the recording studio. They also detail how Combs allegedly used his position of power in the entertainment industry to lure, coerce and silence those around him.

Here's an ongoing list of notable people named in lawsuits and criminal investigations against Combs so far, excluding the accusers who have chosen not to reveal their names.

Casandra Ventura, aka Cassie

The R&B singer was in a personal and professional relationship with Combs for over a decade. In November 2023, Ventura filed a federal lawsuit against Combs alleging years of physical, sexual and emotional abuse. The lawsuit also names Bad Boy Entertainment, Bad Boy Records, Epic Records and Combs Enterprises. A day after the filing, the two parties settled the trafficking, rape and physical assault case out of court -- but Ventura's willingness to come forward opened the floodgates for nearly a dozen other lawsuits against Combs.

The pair reportedly met in 2005, when Ventura was 19 and Combs was 37. The following year, Ventura signed a deal with Bad Boy Entertainment and released her self-titled debut album. Ventura's lawsuit alleged this was the beginning of Combs' coercion and abuse, which she said completely took over her life and included forcing her to take illicit substances, forcing her to participate in sex with male sex workers while Combs filmed her -- encounters Combs referred to as ""freakoffs"" -- and frequent beatings. The lawsuit stated that the beatings were often witnessed by Combs' staff, employees of Bad Boy Entertainment and Combs' affiliated businesses.

Earlier this year, CNN published footage dated to 2016 that showed Combs repeatedly hitting and kicking Ventura in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel. Shortly after, Ventura took to Instagram to address the video and subsequent public response. ""The outpouring of love has created a place for my younger self to settle and feel safe now, but this is only the beginning,"" she wrote. ""Domestic Violence is THE issue. It broke me down to someone I never thought I would become. With a lot of hard work, I am better today, but I will always be recovering from my past.""

Joi Dickerson-Neal

Days after Ventura's lawsuit, a woman named Joi Dickerson filed a lawsuit accusing Combs of drugging, sexually harassing and abusing her and distributing ""revenge porn."" The suit states that Dickerson was a psychology student at Syracuse University when she agreed to go on a date with Combs in 1991. She had appeared in one of the rapper's music videos. After the pair had dinner, the suit alleges that Combs pressured Dickerson to keep the night going and drove them to a recording studio. There, Dickerson says she realized she had been drugged and was unable to get out of the car, since she could no longer stand or walk on her own. This is when the suit alleges that Combs took her to another location and proceeded to sexually assault her.

Days later, Dickerson was told by a male friend that Combs had recorded the assault and had shown it to him and several others. The lawsuit states that the ensuing feelings of violation and humiliation derailed Dickerson's studies and have had prolonged effects on her mental health, career and economic opportunities. Like Ventura, Dickerson filed the lawsuit under New York's Adult Survivors Act, which provided a one-year window for victims of sexual abuse who were age 18 or older at the time of the crime to file civil action regardless of the statute of limitations of the crimes themselves.

Liza Gardner

Last November, Liza Gardner filed a lawsuit alleging that in 1990, she was raped by Combs and R&B singer Aaron Hall. The lawsuit says that days later, Combs assaulted and choked Gardner until she lost consciousness.

In an amended complaint filed Oct. 8, Gardner adds that she was 16 years old when she was invited to New Jersey from her home in North Carolina by her friends DeVante Swing and Dalvin DeGrate of the R&B group Jodeci. The lawsuit states that Jodeci's housing, where Gardner was staying, was ""subsidized"" by their label, Uptown Records, a subsidiary of MCA and UMG. It goes on to allege that Gardner and her 15-year-old friend, Monica Case, met Combs and Hall at an MCA Records event in New York, where they were reportedly supplied with alcohol. Combs and Hall allegedly provided the minors with more drinks and with marijuana later that night.

The lawsuit states that Gardner and her friends were later taken back to Hall's apartment in New Jersey, where Combs raped Gardner. The suit states that unbeknownst to Gardner at the time, Devante Swing was in the room at the time and did nothing to stop Combs. Swing was added as a co-defendant in the new complaint for ""aiding and abetting"" the sexual assault.

The lawsuit also names UMG Recordings, Universal Music Group and more.

Rodney ""Lil Rod"" Jones

Producer Rodney ""Lil Rod"" Jones worked with Combs on his 2023 release, The Love Album: Off the Grid. In February, Jones filed a lawsuit alleging that during the making of the album -- from 2022 to 2023 -- he lived with Combs, who he says repeatedly groped him, forced him to solicit sex workers, take illegal drugs, and more. The suit states that Combs would often walk around naked in front of Jones, and that the music mogul attempted to groom the producer into engaging in sex with other men in the music industry, allegedly promising Jones a Grammy if he complied. Jones also alleges that a cousin of rapper Yung Miami, who was dating Combs at the time, sexually assaulted him in Combs' home in 2022 in front of Combs and his staff.

Jones' lawsuit also names Combs' son, Justin Dior Combs, as well as several high-ranking members of Motown Records and Universal Music Group, Love Records, Combs Global Enterprises and Combs' chief of staff, Kristina Khorram, as co-defendants. In addition to the allegations of abuse, the suit describes a shooting at a recording studio involving Combs, his son Justin Dior Combs and an unnamed victim. The suit also claims that Combs did not properly compensate Jones for his work on The Love Album.

The lawsuit originally included Universal Music Group, Motown Records, former Motown CEO Ethiopia Habtemariam and UMG chairman and CEO Lucian Grainge as co-defendants. Lawyers for Grainge and UMG denied their involvement in the allegations, eventually leading Jones' lawyer to drop Grainge and the labels from the charges.

Crystal McKinney

In May, Crystal McKinney filed a lawsuit against Combs, Bad Boy Entertainment, Universal Music Group (UMG) and Combs' clothing company, Sean John Clothing. The charges against UMG Recordings were later dismissed, and Daddy's House Recordings was added as a co-defendant.

The suit states that in 2003, McKinney was 22 years old and working as a model when an unnamed designer introduced her to Combs at a Sean John fashion show in New York City. Combs allegedly expressed interest in getting to know McKinney better and helping her modeling career grow.

Later that night, he invited her to a recording studio, where McKinney says Combs and several other men were smoking marijuana and drinking. She took a hit of a joint, which according to the lawsuit, she believed was laced with another substance. The lawsuit states that Combs pressured McKinney to continue drinking and smoking, and as she became more intoxicated, she was led to a bathroom by Combs, who forced her to perform oral sex on him. Afterward, McKinney lost consciousness and awoke in a taxi en route to the designer's apartment. The lawsuit states that following the assault, McKinney became severely depressed. According to the lawsuit, she believes Combs ""blackballed"" her in the industry, which led to the downfall of her modeling career, and has had long-lasting effects on her mental health.

April Lampros

In May, April Lampros filed a lawsuit naming Combs, Bad Boy Entertainment and Arista Records, a subsidiary of Sony Music. Lampros met Combs in 1994 while studying at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City. She says Combs often invited her to the Bad Boy studio, promised to mentor and help her advance her career and began ""love-bombing"" her. They started dating and Lampros would often travel to see Combs, though he asked that their relationship be kept private.

In the suit, Lampros accuses Combs of sexually assaulting her on four separate occasions and repeatedly threatening to harm her, both physically and professionally. In one such instance, Combs allegedly forced Lampros and his then-girlfriend Kim Porter to take ecstasy, forced them to engage in sex while he watched and then raped Lampros. Though she tried to distance herself from Combs as the relationship turned abusive, Lampros says Combs continually contacted her, and she feared the repercussions of rebuffing his advances. The lawsuit states that after Lampros' relationship with Combs had ended, she was told by someone she knew that he had seen a video of her and Combs having sex, recorded without her knowledge.

Derrick Lee Cardello-Smith

In June, a man incarcerated in Michigan filed a lawsuit against Combs alleging that the rapper drugged and sexually assaulted him in Detroit in 1997. During a hearing in September, a default judgment was granted to Cardello-Smith for $100 million after Combs and his lawyers failed to appear in court. Shortly after, the judgment was set aside on grounds that Cardello-Smith's lawsuit, mailed to a Combs residence in Los Angeles, was not properly served. Cardello-Smith is currently serving sentences for kidnapping and criminal sexual conduct.

Adria English

In July, a woman named Adria English filed a lawsuit against Combs, Bad Boy Entertainment, Sean John Clothing, Combs Global Enterprises, Tamiko Thomas, Jacob Arabov aka ""Jacob The Jeweler,"" VIBE magazine, Penske Media Corporation and several unnamed defendants. The suit alleges that in 2004, English was working as a dancer at a club in New York City when she and her then-boyfriend, aspiring model Anthony Gallo, were hired to work at one of Combs' famous ""White Parties"" in the Hamptons.

English alleges that while working at the party, she was forced to drink alcohol, which she believes was laced with ecstasy, and forced to consume narcotics. The suit alleges that Combs and a Bad Boy Entertainment employee continued to hire her to work at ""White Parties"" in New York and in Miami. According to the lawsuit, around the third event, English alleges that she was asked to swap the usual white attire for a black mini-dress and forced to begin having intercourse with guests. She believes the black dress was meant to signal to guests that she was a ""sex trafficked sex worker.""

The lawsuit names Jacob Arabov aka ""Jacob The Jeweler"" as one such guest she was coerced into having intercourse with, along with other unnamed defendants. English believes there are secret recordings of those defendants sexually assaulting her in Combs' homes while she was unconscious.

Dawn Richard

In September, singer Dawn Richard filed a lawsuit against Combs for sexual assault and battery. The complaint also states that Richard witnessed Combs beat and abuse Ventura on many occasions.

Richard first met Combs when she auditioned for the MTV show Making the Band in 2004 and was selected to be a member of the group Danity Kane under Combs' mentorship. The lawsuit alleges that Richard and her bandmates were subjected to inhumane working conditions during their time on the show and in the musical group, sometimes being forced to rehearse for up to 48 hours without food or breaks and often being berated by Combs. The complaint states that the abusive behavior continued throughout Richard's professional relationship with Combs, and that he instilled a culture of fear in the women he worked with.

After Danity Kane disbanded in 2009, Richard continued to work with Combs in the trio Diddy -- Dirty Money, along with singer Kalenna Harper -- who allegedly also witnessed much of Combs' abusive behavior and was subject to his numerous threats. The lawsuit alleges Combs would force Richard to take meetings while he was in his underwear, and he would barge into her dressing room unannounced and would grope her breasts and buttocks during stylist fittings.

In one instance in 2010, the lawsuit states that Combs berated Richard and Harper in the lobby of SIR Studios and attempted to punch Richard when she asked him to stop calling them ""bitches"" in front of people. Richard alleges the women were then ushered into a company car and that Combs and Harve Pierre falsely imprisoned them in the vehicle for over two hours.

In addition to the allegations of abuse, Richard's lawsuit demands unpaid salaries, royalties and wages for Richard's work as part of Danity Kane and Diddy -- Dirty Money. The complaint also names Harve Pierre, Remote Productions, Bad Boy Entertainment, Daddy's House Recording Studio and a number of other music, publishing and finance corporations associated with Combs for enabling his violence.

Thalia Graves

In September, a woman named Thalia Graves filed a lawsuit accusing Combs and his bodyguard Joseph Sherman of raping her, recording the assault without her knowledge and distributing the video as pornography.

Graves alleges that the assault took place in 2001, when she was 25 years old and dating an unnamed record producer who worked with Combs. She says Combs and Sherman took advantage of her relationship with their colleague to lure her to a recording studio alone, where they gave her a drink she believes was laced with some kind of drug. The lawsuit says Graves lost consciousness and awoke to find herself bound and restrained; Combs and Sherman then proceeded to take turns raping her.

Graves says she did not report the alleged crime out of fear of Combs' retaliation, and that her boyfriend at the time discouraged her from doing so because it might hurt his career. In November 2023, Graves alleges she learned the rape had been recorded by Sherman and Combs, who showed it to others with the purpose of humiliating Graves and her then-boyfriend. The lawsuit details how the crime and the knowledge of its recording has had dire, long-lasting consequences on Graves' mental health.

Aaron Hall

The R&B singer is named in Gardner's lawsuit, alleging that he and Combs raped her and an unnamed friend in 1990. Hall could not be reached for comment.

Harve Pierre

In December 2023, an unnamed woman filed a lawsuit accusing Combs, former Bad Boy Entertainment president Harve Pierre and a third man of trafficking and gang raping her when she was 17 years old. The suit states that the victim met Pierre at a lounge in Michigan in 2003 while she was still in high school, and that the record executive sexually assaulted her by forcing her to perform oral sex on him. Pierre allegedly called Combs, who convinced the underaged woman to board a private jet to New Jersey.

After the plane ride, the suit states that the unnamed victim, Pierre and two other men were driven to Combs' recording studio in New York, where they ""plied Ms. Doe with drugs and alcohol."" The lawsuit says that Combs, Pierre and another man proceeded to ""gang-rape"" the teenager, and that she has limited recollection of the trip back to Michigan the following day. The lawsuit also names recording studio Daddy's House Recordings and Bad Boy Entertainment as co-defendants. Pierre denied the allegations in a statement to TMZ.

Kristina Khorram

Khorram is named as Combs' chief of staff and a co-defendant in Jones' lawsuit. Jones alleges that Khorram frequently solicited illicit drugs and sex workers for Combs and his guests, forced Jones to carry substances for Combs and ordered Jones to hire sex workers for Combs. He also accuses Khorram of ""aiding and abetting"" Combs' sexual assault and helping Combs groom Jones. Though she is not listed as a co-defendant, Khorram is also named in a September 2024 sexual abuse lawsuit filed by an unnamed woman who says the Combs employee often paid for her to travel and ""perform"" for Combs -- the complaint alleges Combs' staffers would ""send drivers to [the victim's] home to pick her up before she agreed to travel, to the point where she did not believe she had a choice.""

NPR reached out to Khorram's attorneys Thursday morning for comment and is awaiting a reply.

Cuba Gooding Jr.

The actor, who pled guilty in 2022 to forcibly touching a woman and settled a civil sexual abuse case in 2023, was named in an amendment to Rodney ""Lil Rod"" Jones' original lawsuit against Combs. The producer alleges that Gooding Jr. fondled and groped him on Combs' yacht. The actor has denied the allegations. ""It's the most ridiculous thing ever,"" he said in an interview with Extra TV. ""Welcome to being a celebrity. Welcome to my world.""

Justin Dior Combs and Christian Combs

Sean Combs' son, Justin Dior Combs, is also named in Jones' lawsuit against the rapper, which alleges that the producer witnessed the father and son solicit sex workers and admit underaged girls to a listening party where they laced the women's drinks. The lawsuit also alleges that Jones witnessed Christian Combs, another son of Combs, drug and assault a woman. Tyrone Blackburn, an attorney representing Jones, is also part of a separate lawsuit filed in April against Christian Combs on behalf of a plaintiff named Grace O'Marcaigh, alleging the younger Combs assaulted her on a yacht owned by Combs, who is named as co-defendant. Both Justin Dior Combs and Christian Combs have denied the allegations against them.

Jacob Arabov, aka ""Jacob The Jeweler"" aka Jacob Arabo

The founder and chairman of high-profile jewelry and watch company Jacob & Co. is named as a co-defendant in English's suit, which alleges he was one of the ""White Party"" guests she was forced to have sex with. Jacob & Co did not respond to NPR's request for comment.

Joseph ""Big Joe"" Sherman

Combs' former bodyguard is named as a co-defendant in Graves' lawsuit, along with Daddy's House Recordings, Bad Boy Entertainment and more. Graves claims that Sherman actively raped her alongside Combs in 2001. The lawsuit states that when she attempted to escape the assault, Combs slammed her head into a pool table, causing her to lose consciousness. After waking up, she says Sherman continued to assault her and slapped her until she passed out a third time. Sherman has denied Graves' claims, saying he no longer worked for Bad Boy in 2001 and never met the young woman.

DeVante Swing

In an amended complaint filed on Oct. 8, Liza Gardner added Devante Swing of the R&B group Jodeci as a co-defendant to her lawsuit. Gardner alleges that Swing, who was an adult at the time, was her ""assumed co-guardian"" when he invited the underaged Gardner to New Jersey. The suit alleges that Swing ""trafficked and or coerced the child to travel across state lines from North Carolina to New York and New Jersey with the hidden intention of providing the child with alcohol, and marijuana and prostituting the child to his A&R Combs."" Gardner's friend, Monica Case, also filed a sworn declaration alleging Swing was in the room ""watching whatever Puffy was doing to Liza.""

Jimmy Iovine

In her lawsuit, Richard alleges that she attended a party where Interscope Records co-founder Jimmy Iovine witnessed Combs punch Ventura in the stomach. The lawsuit blames Iovine -- and Interscope -- for moving forward with a deal with Combs and Bad Boy Entertainment after becoming aware of his violent and abusive behavior. Separately, in 2022, Iovine was accused of sexual abuse and harassment by an unnamed woman under New York's Adult Survivors Act. The woman later dropped the case.

Kid Cudi

Kid Cudi and Ventura were romantically involved in 2011. In her lawsuit, Ventura alleged that when Combs found emails between the two on Ventura's phone, he became enraged and attacked her. Ventura attempted to run away but returned due to pressure from Combs' staff; the lawsuit alleged that Combs then hit and kicked her. The lawsuit stated that in 2012, Combs told Ventura he wanted to ""blow up"" Kid Cudi's car while the rapper was home. Kid Cudi corroborated to The New York Times that his car exploded in his driveway around that time.

Caresha Brownlee, aka Yung Miami

Yung Miami, half of the rap duo City Girls, dated Combs in recent years. In August, she denied knowing anything about the accusations that have surfaced against her ex. ""I can't speak on these allegations because I wasn't around at the time,"" she said on her Revolt TV show, Caresha Please. ""I don't know that person, and that wasn't my experience.""

In September, however, Brownlee was named in a lawsuit filed against Combs by an unnamed woman. The lawsuit alleges that the plaintiff was forced to travel and ""perform"" for Combs many times from 2021 to 2024. Much of this travel was reportedly paid for by Combs' staffer Kristina Khorram. The suit states that in 2022, the plaintiff was forced to take drugs and have sex with Combs. When she learned she was pregnant and told Combs, the lawsuit states that Brownlee -- who is not a co-defendant on the complaint -- harassed and called the plaintiff repeatedly, pressuring her to get an abortion. The stress allegedly led the woman to suffer a miscarriage.

NPR reached out to Brownlee's representation Thursday morning and is awaiting a reply.

Tony Buzbee

On Oct. 1, Texas attorney Tony Buzbee held a press conference announcing that his firm will be filing at least 120 individual civil lawsuits against Combs in the coming weeks. ""The biggest secret in the entertainment industry that wasn't really a secret at all has finally been revealed to the world,"" Buzbee said during the presser. ""The wall of silence has been broken, and victims are coming forward.""

Buzbee is known for representing clients in high-profile cases, including Texas attorney general Ken Paxton during his 2023 impeachment trial, the women who sued football player Deshaun Watson for sexual misconduct, and the victims of the Astroworld deadly crowd surge. During Paxton's trial, Buzbee took his own share of the spotlight for a public spat with the media over how they photographed his tan in the courtroom. In addition to practicing at the Buzbee Law Firm, his professional ventures include property development, a short-lived THC-infused seltzer company and local politics. He self-funded a run for Houston mayor against Democratic incumbent Sylvester Turner in 2019 and ran for Houston City Council in 2023, ultimately losing both races."
Only 2% of charitable giving goes to women. Can Melinda French Gates change that?,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/09/nx-s1-5137259/melinda-french-gates-charitable-giving-women-girls-womens-health,2024-10-09T10:05:34Z,"For most of her adult life, Melinda French Gates has helped control vast amounts of money -- and wielded the resulting power. But even by billionaire philanthropist standards, she's having a breakout year.

In May, three years after her divorce from Bill Gates, French Gates resigned from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation -- taking $12.5 billion with her. Her departure, after a quarter century spent helping to build the foundation into the country's largest charity, sent shock waves through the world of big philanthropy.

But now that French Gates gets to make all of her own decisions, she's building up an even bigger profile in philanthropy -- as well as government policy and U.S. politics. She's spending $1 billion of her money, and leveraging her ever-growing celebrity, to call more attention to a cause she has long championed: The systemic problems facing women and girls, and the persistent lack of funding to fix them.

""This is a hole that has existed for a long time. And by putting my resources there, and my voice ... I think I can shine a light,"" French Gates told NPR in an interview this week.

On Wednesday, French Gates is officially launching an ""open call"" for nonprofits to apply for grants from her Pivotal organization. The main requirement is that those applying for her funds should be addressing issues relating to women's mental and physical health.

The aim, Pivotal and its partners say, is to identify nonprofits working around the country and the world -- especially those who wouldn't normally cross French Gates' path or be invited to apply for her money.

""We hope to find organizations all over the world that are have been working on women's health issues -- probably below the radar, quietly -- and call attention to the work they're doing, so that [other] people can imitate it and support it,"" says Cecilia Conrad, CEO of Lever for Change, the nonprofit that is running the ""open call"" process for French Gates and Pivotal.

Encouraging others to join her or imitate her has become a crucial part of French Gates' strategy. And she acknowledges that governments will ultimately have to do far more than charitable billionaires to fundamentally fix systemic societal problems.

By going solo, and ""using my own personal resources to put substantial investments behind women or minorities,"" French Gates says, ""I am pointing in a direction, I hope, for other philanthropists or even other governments.""

French Gates has long been focused on a particularly brutal problem: The disparities facing women and girls, who make up half of the population -- and yet receive less than 2% of all charitable giving in the United States.

Now French Gates is donating $1 billion over the next two years towards issues affecting this half of the population. She has already committed $440 million to some U.S. nonprofits and to several individuals, who she has asked to make their own grant-making decisions with her money.

Her latest initiative will allocate another $250 million, through grants of $1 million to $5 million each, to nonprofits who apply for her women's health funds.

And her increased activity goes beyond writing charitable checks: French Gates is also advocating for access to abortion and other reproductive health care. She's endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris and has donated to her presidential campaign.

Philanthropy experts say that her growing celebrity is already making a difference for French Gates' chosen cause.

""She's going to increase the spotlight on the issues and the needs that women and girls are facing in the U.S. and globally,"" says Elizabeth Dale, a researcher and the Frey Chair for Family Philanthropy at the Johnson Center for Philanthropy.

French Gates has long been prominent in business and policy circles, thanks to her decades at the Gates Foundation and to her longstanding advocacy for women. The charity that she cofounded with her former husband is now a heavyweight in the worlds of global health and philanthropy: It gave away almost $8 billion last year alone.

Yet it was her divorce, followed by her decision to walk away from the country's largest foundation, that turned French Gates into a mainstream celebrity. It's a role that she's embraced: In recent months, French Gates has made the rounds of Vanity Fair, the New York Times and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. She has her own YouTube series, for which she's interviewed Michelle Obama and Oprah.

And she's enlisted other bold-faced names -- including Olympic athlete Allyson Felix and Hollywood director Ava DuVernay -- in her philanthropy, funneling several of them $20 million each to give towards organizations focused on helping women.

""I see so little investment around the globe in women's health,"" French Gates says. ""We all need to step up and look at these issues.""

French Gates' focus on women's health has also led her to wade into the fraught presidential election, after years of staying quiet on partisan topics. She's faced some criticism both for her previous silence on abortion, and for her presidential endorsements this year. But French Gates tells NPR she was motivated to get involved in this year's election because of the Supreme Court's decision to repeal Roe v. Wade.

The resulting abortion bans and other state restrictions have worsened conditions for women's reproductive and other health care across the country, as French Gates argues.

""Anytime, anywhere in the world, that you roll back a law related to women's health, it will have detrimental effects,"" she says. ""And we're already seeing that in our own country.""

Yet despite her endorsement of Harris, French Gates says that she hopes Republicans apply for her philanthropic funding and the new grants that she will be making through her open call.

And she adds that she could ""very likely"" vote for a Republican candidate in a future election.

""I am an independent voter,"" French Gates says. ""And what I believe in for our country is bipartisan legislation, and bipartisan funding.""

All eyes are on Pennsylvania this election cycle. Erie County demonstrates why.,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/05/nx-s1-5129676/erie-county-pa-trump-harris-2024,2024-10-09T09:11:58Z,"Campaign signs are seen in windows of the Erie County Democratic Party headquarters. Don Gonyea/NPR hide caption

In April, Erie, Pennsylvania, resident Bekah Mook was undecided on the presidential election. She didn't want to see another Trump term, but had concerns about President Biden's age.

But with just over a month until Election Day, she said she's now ""all Kamala.""

""There's not one percentage of Trump in there,"" said Mook, 34.

The change at the top of the Democratic ticket -- when President Biden suspended his reelection bid and Vice President Kamala Harris became the new nominee -- has energized voters like Mook who were not happy with their previous choices. But polls suggest the race is still neck-and-neck in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania.

Erie County is the battleground within the battleground: The county -- and the state -- went twice for Obama, then for Trump in 2016, and for Biden in 2020. Demographically, the county also mirrors the state, consisting of a Democratic city center, conservative rural areas and ideologically mixed suburbs.

Driving down a neighborhood street, you get a sense of just how closely divided this place is: One yard is bedecked with Harris-Walz signs, and the next with ""Trump 2024"" and ""Drain the Swamp."" Block after block, the signs compete with one another.

That means even slight movement to the left or right could have a significant impact.

Erie County Democratic Chairperson Sam Talarico said he's seen a surge of enthusiasm since Harris took over at the top of the ticket.

""It has been crazy, actually,"" Talarico said. ""I mean, we had 60 people on our volunteer list the day before [Biden] dropped out. And right now we have 310 people on our volunteer list.""

The issue, Talarico said, was ""Joe Biden's age, plain and simple.""

""There are a lot of people, I believe, especially younger people, that just weren't going to vote,"" he said. ""And they've been energized by Kamala Harris's entrance onto the stage.""

Across town, Erie County Republican Chairperson Tom Eddy acknowledges that Democrats have gotten a morale boost with Harris.

""All of a sudden, she becomes the best thing since sliced bread,"" Eddy said. ""Obviously, I think that's energized the other side because the other side, I think, was falling asleep with Biden.""

But he said there's no lack of enthusiasm among Republican voters, either. He has been particularly focused on encouraging Republicans to vote by mail, an area Democrats dominated in 2020. While Biden won Erie by just over a single percentage point in 2020, he won 75% of the county's mail-in ballots. The same dynamic played out for Democrats in the 2022 midterms and 2023 state judicial elections.

Democrats still hold a substantial lead in mail-in ballots requested this time around, but Eddy said the GOP is narrowing the gap.

""What I think is if Donald Trump can focus on the issues, the policies that he wants to implement, that things will go very well,"" he said.

Across Erie, Democrats and Republicans alike tell us they're worried about the economy. But Democrats also list abortion and protecting democracy as top priorities, while Republicans consistently say it's the border.

""We've got 10, 15 million people coming into this country that we're paying for,"" said 82-year-old Trump supporter Rich Pisano.

Pisano also echoed false claims by Donald Trump that these non-citizen immigrants are voting in US elections. It's one of several ways Trump is laying the groundwork to cast doubt on any election results that don't declare him the winner.

20-year-old Lacey Buswell is a student at Pennsylvania Western University's Edinboro campus. She's a Harris supporter who is concerned about protecting reproductive rights, and is turned off by Trump's campaign rhetoric.

""He convinces people to follow ideologies that don't necessarily make sense or have any groundings,"" Buswell said. ""Like the stuff that happened in Springfield - it's kind of like fear mongering a lot. A lot of his stuff is not facts, and I don't like liars.""

Mook, the previously undecided voter who was raised in a conservative and religious household, said she's also been turned off by the GOP's language and hardline stances.

""Every other word that comes out of the Republican's mouth, I feel like is just bullying,"" she said.

Mook, who works in health care and is studying to become a therapist, said she is feeling the squeeze of higher prices. But she doesn't put the blame on Harris.

36-year-old mother of two Jamie Billige said higher prices are one factor driving her vote for Trump.

""It's insane to raise a family right now, trying to buy groceries or afford anything, really,"" Billige said. ""Saving is virtually impossible. And I have a good job.""

Billige, who spoke to NPR while waiting to enter a Trump rally in downtown Erie, said she is also worried about immigration and crime. And she isn't bothered by Trump's varied legal troubles.

""It doesn't matter to me. I think we're going to be safer under him,"" she said. ""And I think that our economy is going to be better.""

In a neighborhood near downtown, 38-year-old Robin Williams said he has never voted, and doesn't plan to this election cycle. He likes what Harris has to say about helping middle- and working-class people.

""But are they really going to do what they're saying, or are they just going to play us so they can get in office?,"" he said.

Standing outside a popular local donut shop, Erie County Councilman Andre Horton said this election could come down to one thing: ""Turnout, turnout, turnout.""

Horton, a Democrat, is focused on increasing turnout in ""underperforming"" districts where many Democrats are registered, but few get to the polls, including historically black neighborhoods in the city.

""You might have 600 register, 50 vote,"" Horton said. ""I believe that with Joe Biden winning Pennsylvania by 80,000 votes or less (in 2020), and Erie being the epicenter of Pennsylvania - as goes Erie goes Pennsylvania - we believe that if we dig those underperforming votes out in those districts, that we will have a profound impact on the election.""

Each of the presidential campaigns has its own door-knocking and canvassing operations in Erie. Labor unions have also been running their own efforts -- including bringing in volunteers by the busload from union locals in other states -- to support Democratic campaigns.

In the final weeks before Election Day, Pennsylvania AFL-CIO president Angela Ferritto said her focus remains talking to workers every day about policy - not politics.

""The push is on to really help people understand how this is going to impact our jobs, our health care, our benefits, all the things that we care about as union members and the things that are important to us,"" said Angela Ferritto, president of the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO. ""We want to make sure that we're getting out to as many people as we can.""

One thing that Erie Democrats and Republicans can agree on is that living in a battleground county can be wearying.

Mook said her and her husband recently took a ""news break"" to escape the political ads and partisan bickering.

""It's constant. If it's not that, it's text messages,"" she said. ""Today I got six different text messages from, you know, 'vote for blah, blah, blah,' or 'do you want to donate?' And like - it's great, but there's a point where it's got to stop.""

Billige also said she's been frustrated by ""constant"" ads, especially when you're just trying to have some fun with the kids.

""We were watching YouTube the other day for music - we were having a dance party in the living room, and every ad that came on was a Kamala ad,"" Billige said. ""It's in your face all the time.""

But for 35-year-old Democrat Tess Jones, who recently moved to Erie from Texas with her wife, the opportunity to vote in a battleground is energizing.

""We're very used to seeing a sea of red,"" Jones said. ""And I think moving here, especially and knowing that our voice is going to be included in, especially the Electoral College decisions is astounding."""
I went to a classic Wisconsin supper club to talk politics. This is what I learned,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5138314/wisconsin-supper-club-harris-trump,2024-10-08T15:11:27Z,"The Packing House in Milwaukee caters to diners of all political persuasions. Keren Carri√≥n/NPR hide caption

When we started planning an election reporting trip to swing state Wisconsin, locals told us we had to include a visit to a supper club to experience a unique part of the state's culture. So when I finally met Chris Wiken, whose family opened The Packing House in Milwaukee 50 years ago, my first question was, ""What on earth is a supper club?""

""This is the elusive question,"" he says. ""The whole idea of a supper club is somewhere that you're going to come and spend the evening at.""

Typically, a supper club will include a few things: a Wisconsin brandy old-fashioned cocktail at the bar, seafood or prime rib in the dining room and then live music and a boozy ice cream drink to close out the night.

Even though The Packing House was remodeled about a decade ago, it still has a classic old-time aesthetic with dark wood and dim lighting. Walking through the doors feels like going back in time.

Milwaukee's main airport terminal was just across the street when The Packing House opened in 1974. Now, that terminal serves private jets where former President Donald Trump, Vice President Harris or their running mates park every time they come to town.

""The police and Secret Service come over and go, 'Hey, Chris, they have to close down the street again.' And then I go and shake my fist at them,"" he says, joking that he'll vote for whoever shuts down the street in front of his restaurant fewer times.

You won't see a Harris or Trump sign in front of The Packing House. Wiken doesn't want to alienate his customers, who have a wide range of views, as the All Things Considered crew and I discovered when we started chatting people up at the bar.

Janine Collette, having dinner with an old friend, remembers growing up in Wisconsin before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in the state.

""In high school, we used to raise money in the girls' bathrooms to help girls go to the state of New York to get an abortion,"" she says. ""We're not going back."" Collette is excited to cast her vote for the candidate she expects to become the first female U.S. president.

At the other end of the bar, Ron Raasch says that he has voted for Democrats his whole life and that this election may be the first time he doesn't. He's disillusioned with the two-party system and is considering a vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein.

""It's very hard to see the difference when both of the major parties are going to continue shipping arms all over the world and especially to Gaza,"" he says. Raasch isn't concerned that in 2016 and 2020 the margin of victory in Wisconsin for Trump and Biden, respectively, was less than 1% of the vote. ""People are throwing that as a fear tactic,"" he says. ""And I'm trying to [more so] make a statement that the two-party system is showing its age and its frailties.""

Wearing a Packers hat at the bar, Lee Cielonko is nursing a beer while he waits for his food to arrive. ""I want the economy to be put back together. I want energy. I want to drill, baby, drill, man,"" he says.

He's supporting Trump and is concerned about immigration, saying: ""People come here and they don't have the same culture as us. They don't understand and know a lot of the way our culture works.""

So much about the future, as well as this election, is uncertain; there can be something comforting in the familiar: fish fry Friday, a Wisconsin brandy old-fashioned at the bar and live music in a place that has been doing pretty much the same thing since before most Americans were born."
It's a close race for Michigan. These factors could decide it for Harris or Trump,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/nx-s1-5130163/michigan-2024-election-harris-trump,2024-10-07T09:06:21Z,"A Trump and Harris sign side-by-side in a neighborhood on Oct. 3, 2024 in Hillsdale, Mich. Sylvia Jarrus for NPR hide caption

Michigan is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House.

The state is part of the ""blue wall,"" along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, that she and Democrats need to hold to avoid a second Donald Trump presidency.

It's home to some of the key demographics that both parties are courting this election, from white voters without college degrees to the largest Black-majority city, Detroit, and one of the nation's largest Arab American populations.

But the path to victory is not easy this year. Harris and Trump remain in a close battle, as his populist message continues to resonate with white voters and union and blue-collar workers, particularly on the economy.

Dave Dulio, a professor of political science and director of the Center for Civic Engagement at Oakland University, says ""in places like Macomb County, with many blue-collar voters and union workers, Trump made inroads by pledging to get the U.S. out of bad trade deals and renegotiate NAFTA, which he did.""

""I think they still give him credit for that,"" he added.

Dulio underscores the state's significance by noting that small shifts could lead to substantial changes for candidates: ""If you take a small shift among the Arab American community and a small shift among union workers, those multiple small shifts could drive a very different result.""

Both candidates have heaped attention recently on the Wolverine State. On Oct 4, Harris visited a Redford Charter Township firehouse near Detroit, meeting union representatives. She met with Arab American and Muslim leaders then appeared with United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain in Flint and vowed support for Michigan's auto industry. Trump held campaign events twice in September and took his presidential campaign to Saginaw Valley State University in Kochville Township on Oct. 3.

Michigan also plays to the strengths of the vice presidential nominees, who hail from the Midwest. Both Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have stumped in the state in the last month.

To better understand the key issues shaping voters' decisions -- from the economy and immigration to abortion and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East -- we are in Michigan this week hearing directly from voters and political observers as part of our ""We, The Voters"" series.

A September poll by The New York Times and Siena College found that Michigan voters cared most about the economy, followed by abortion and immigration.

Economy

Michigan's unemployment rate is historically low, according to state data, but it has slowly ticked up in recent months. Meanwhile, inflation has eased, but high costs of living remain a concern.

The state continues to suffer from the decades-long decline of automobile manufacturing, and high interest rates have constricted sales of cars, according to a September study from the University of Michigan.

Both parties are trying to put focus on the economy. GOP attack ads argue that Biden and Harris are responsible for inflation, while the vice president's messaging focuses on plans to uplift the middle class and paint Trump-era tax cuts as benefiting the wealthy.

Meghan Wilson, an expert in public policy and urban development, said Harris could expand the Democratic position on economics by appealing to Black business owners and holders of student debt.

""African Americans in Detroit have a lot of small businesses, and so we're looking for capital for those kinds of small businesses. I think Kamala Harris is doing a great job of bringing the small businesses into the conversation,"" Wilson explained.

Organized labor plays a key role in Michigan's economy. Both parties are making a play for Michigan's union members, who accounted for 13% of workers in the state last year. Exit polls in 2020 showed Michigan's union voters favoring President Biden over Trump, and Biden pledged to be ""the most pro-union president"" in U.S. history, which he backed up with a visit to UAW workers striking in Wayne, Mich.

Michigan pollster Bernie Porn said Biden's visit to striking workers helped him bump up his union support, but his policies to advance electric vehicles with tax credits were unpopular with Independent and Republican voters.

""You have Harris leading among union members with 63% which is almost where Biden was in 2020 with 65%, so she's improving her lot among union members, but still, the EVs are a problem,"" he said.

Still, one encouraging sign for the Harris campaign could be Michigan's local Teamsters union backing her candidacy, breaking with the national union that declined to endorse any candidate for U.S. president, after they had supported every Democratic candidate for president since Bill Clinton.

Abortion

Two years ago, Michigan voters approved a landmark amendment to the state constitution, securing the right to abortion and other reproductive health services.

Democrats won control of all three branches of Michigan's governments since making abortion a central voting issue.

But that success may have made it a less influential issue in the 2024 election. A KFF poll in June found that women in Michigan saw abortion as ""decided"" and they were more concerned about inflation and the rising cost of living.

""The Democrats are putting an awful lot of their eggs in the basket of abortion,"" the pollster Porn said.

Dulio pointed out that Trump's main weakness stems from what has driven Democratic success in every election -- and not necessarily abortion since it's already decided in the state: ""His character remains a key weakness. He's deeply unpopular because of the Jan. 6 spectacle and doubling down on his claims that the 2020 election was stolen. That just turns off persuadable voters,"" he said.

Michigan is home to one of the largest Black populations in the nation, ahead of Louisiana, Alabama and South Carolina, and the largest Black-majority city, Detroit.

Harris would herself be the nation's first Black woman president, but some Black voters may not be as motivated to vote as they were in 2020.

""The main challenge is the enthusiasm gap,"" said Ronald Brown, a political scientist at Wayne State University. He said among Black voters in Michigan, those who were in the ""black leadership class"" -- meaning serving in government, churches, Black fraternities and sororities -- were highly likely to vote for Harris. However, those without deep connections to the party, especially working-class and poor Detroit residents, were susceptible to sitting out elections. In particular, he pointed to Detroit's recent voter turnout -- higher in 2020 than it was in 2016 -- as a key factor explaining the state's pick for Biden after it went for Trump four years earlier.

""What could occur is that among working class and poor Black voters, lack of interest could lead to fatigue and this may drive those voters not to vote. And in Michigan, you don't need many. You need enough,"" he said.

Democratic state Sen. Sarah Anthony has a different perspective. She had seen an encouraging gain among young people to help shore up Harris' base.

""The Biden coalition included many working-class white men, a group Vice President Harris has struggled to win over. While there may have been losses there, the data I've seen shows significant gains due to increased enthusiasm among young people and people of color,"" she said.

U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East

The Detroit Metropolitan area has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the U.S. Dearborn, often called the Capital of Arab America, is home to a majority of Lebanese residents who maintain strong ties to southern Lebanon.

Arab and Muslim voters here were largely supportive of Biden in 2020. However, many have since been alienated by his handling of Israel's deadly war in Gaza and the administration's ongoing military aid to Israel. Many now are similarly concerned about Israel's continuing bombardment of Beirut and ground invasion along the countries' shared border.

Abbas Alawieh, a Dearborn Democratic strategist and one of the co-founders of the ""uncommitted movement,"" backed Biden in 2020. But earlier this year, he and other organizers successfully secured more than 100,000 ""uncommitted"" votes in the Michigan primary to protest Biden's handling of the war in Gaza.

Alawieh, who had advocated for a Gaza ceasefire, told Morning Edition host Leila Fadel that he feels more despair now as the conflict spreads to his family's homeland, Lebanon.

""This is a grieving community. So, for us to give guidance to vote for Kamala Harris, when she is part of the administration that's actively killing their family members, it's like giving a campaign speech at a funeral.""

Professor Dubio said the uncommitted movement has the potential to ""have a huge impact,"" and while he believes many of them will ultimately vote for Harris, he added, ""it can't and shouldn't be ignored.""

Abbas mentioned sending letters to Vice President Harris's team, including her national security advisor, requesting meetings with those directly affected by the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. ""So far, the answer is still no.""

He added that Donald Trump visited the community, took photos with leaders, and invited them to his campaign rally.

Saeed Khan, an associate professor of Near Eastern and Asian Studies at Wayne State University, said Muslim and Arab voters were drifting toward Trump in 2016, and some continue to do so today, not only because of a push away from Democrats, but also a pull toward the Republican party's values. Many Arabs and Muslims, immigrant Muslims, voted for the Republican ticket at least until September 11 and then started to move toward the Democratic Party.

""The Republican message of self-reliance, smaller government or less government intrusion, lower taxes, social conservatism really appealed to many, especially immigrant Muslims and Arabs, because it epitomized the American Dream that they had internalized,"" Khan said."
"Medical debt snares millions of people. States, red and blue are passing laws to help",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5135641/medical-debt-solutions-hospitals-republicans-democrats-state-laws,2024-10-07T09:02:28Z,"While hot-button health care issues such as abortion and the Affordable Care Act roil the presidential race, Democrats and Republicans in statehouses around the country have been quietly working together to tackle the nation's medical debt crisis.

New laws to curb aggressive hospital billing, to expand charity care for lower-income patients, and to rein in debt collectors have been enacted in more than 20 states since 2021.

Democrats championed most measures. But the legislative efforts often passed with Republican support. In a few states, GOP lawmakers led the push to expand patient protections.

""Regardless of their party, regardless of their background ... any significant medical procedure can place people into bankruptcy,"" Florida House Speaker Paul Renner, a conservative Republican, said in an interview. ""This is a real issue.""

Renner, who has shepherded controversial measures to curb abortion rights and expand the death penalty in Florida, this year also led an effort to limit when hospitals could send patients to collections. It garnered unanimous support in the Florida Legislature.

Bipartisan measures in other states have gone further, barring unpaid medical bills from consumer credit reports and restricting medical providers from placing liens on patients' homes.

About 100 million people in the U.S. are burdened by some form of health care debt, forcing millions to drain savings, take out second mortgages, or cut back on food and other essentials, KFF Health News has found. A quarter of those with debt owed more than $5,000 in 2022.

""Republicans in the legislature seem more open to protecting people from medical debt than from other kinds of debt,"" said Marceline White, executive director of Economic Action Maryland, which helped lead efforts in that state to stop medical providers from garnishing the wages of low-income patients. That bill drew unanimous support from Democrats and Republicans

""There seems to be broad agreement that you shouldn't lose your home or your life savings because you got ill,"" White said. ""That's just a basic level of fairness.""

Medical debt remains a more polarizing issue in Washington, where the Biden administration has pushed several efforts to tackle the issue, including a proposed rule by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, to bar all medical debt from consumer credit reports.

Vice President Harris, who is spearheading the administration's medical debt campaign, has touted the work on the presidential campaign trail while calling for new efforts to retire health care debt for millions of Americans.

Former President Donald Trump doesn't typically talk about medical debt while stumping. But congressional Republicans have blasted the CFPB proposal, which House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) called ""regulatory overreach.""

Nevertheless, pollster Michael Perry, who has surveyed Americans extensively about health care, said that conservative voters typically wary of government seem to view medical debt through another lens. ""I think they feel it's so stacked against them that they, as patients, don't really have a voice,"" he said. ""The partisan divides we normally see just aren't there.""

When Arizona consumer advocates put a measure on the ballot in 2022 to cap interest rates on medical debt, 72% of voters backed the initiative.

Similarly, nationwide polls have found more than 80% of Republicans and Democrats back limits on medical debt collections and stronger requirements that hospitals provide financial aid to patients.

Perry surfaced something else that may be driving bipartisan interest in medical debt: growing mistrust as health systems get bigger and act more like major corporations. ""Hospitals aren't what they used to be,"" he said. ""That is making it clear that profit and greed are driving lots of the decision-making.""

Not every state effort to address medical debt has garnered broad bipartisan support.

When Colorado last year became the first state to bar medical debt from residents' credit reports, just one Republican lawmaker backed the measure. A Minnesota bill that did the same thing this year passed without a single GOP vote.

But elsewhere, similarly tough measures have sailed through.

A 2024 Illinois bill to bar credit reporting for medical debt passed unanimously in the state Senate and cleared the House of Representatives 109-2. In Rhode Island, not a single GOP lawmaker opposed a credit reporting ban.

And when the California Legislature took up a 2021 bill to require hospitals in the state to provide more financial assistance to patients, it passed 72-0 in the state Assembly and 39-0 in the Senate.

Even some conservative states, such as Oklahoma, have taken steps, albeit more modest. A new law there bars medical providers from pursuing patients for debts if the provider has not publicly posted its prices. The measure, signed by the state's Republican governor, passed unanimously.

New Mexico state Sen. Steve Neville, a Republican who backed legislation to restrict aggressive collections against low-income patients in that state, said he was simply being pragmatic.

""There was not much advantage to spending a lot of time trying to do collections on indigent patients,"" Neville said. ""If they don't have the money, they don't have the money."" Three of 12 GOP senators supported the measure.

North Carolina state Treasurer Dale Folwell, a Republican who as a state legislator spearheaded a 2012 effort to ban same-sex marriage, said all elected officials, no matter their party, should care about what medical debt is doing to patients.

""It doesn't matter if, as a conservative, I'm saying these things, or if Bernie Sanders is saying these things,"" Folwell said, referencing Vermont's liberal U.S. senator. ""At the end of the day, it should be all our jobs to advocate for the invisible."""

In the last few years, more than a dozen states have enacted laws that ban almost all abortions. Some include exceptions for rape, incest, and to protect the life of the mother. But a small, vocal group of anti-abortion activists say even these exceptions are morally wrong. They want to see a ban not only on all abortions but also on some fertility treatments, including IVF. They believe an embryo deserves the same rights as any human.

"Three states show how abortion, schools and taxes are at stake in legislature races",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/05/nx-s1-5124638/state-legislature-supermajority-kansas-arizona-minnesota-elections,2024-10-05T09:04:20Z,"Elections for state legislatures don't get the attention that races for president or Congress do but they often have a big impact on our lives. Congress is divided and gridlocked. In contrast, nearly all state legislatures have both chambers run by one party or another. That makes it easy to pass laws.

And they've been passing a lot. More than 20 states have imposed new limits on abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated the federal right to abortion in 2022. In education, state lawmakers create voucher programs and determine public school funding. Gun laws, taxes, criminal sentences, access to Medicaid and food stamps are just a few other issues decided by state legislatures.

Redistricting and polarization have increased the political tilt of many legislatures -- even where the state might be more balanced overall.

This year, several legislatures could see power shift if just a few seats flip in the election -- maybe just a matter of hundreds of votes in some districts. Here are three states, Kansas, Minnesota and Arizona, that illustrate the stakes around the country.

TOPEKA, Kansas -- Kansas is one of several states where the Legislature sometimes tilts more conservative than the state's voters overall. While it votes Republican for president, it has elected a Democrat for governor twice in a row and voted with 59% to protect abortion rights.

But Republicans hold 29 of the 40 seats in the Senate and 85 of the 125 seats in the House. That gives them the two-thirds ""supermajority"" to pass bills and override vetoes by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.

They've overridden Kelly's vetoes 15 times in the last two years. They used the override to pass a bill requiring doctors to question patients seeking abortions about their reasons. They overrode vetoes to pass laws banning transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports and to limit access to food stamps.

Democrats say they can break the supermajority in this year's elections -- they'd only need to flip two or three seats in either chamber. It would give Kelly a stronger veto in her last two years in office -- and Democrats more leverage over what the majority passes.

""My hope is that with the governor being able to veto and being able to sustain those vetoes, it puts us more at the table for compromise,"" says Democrat Dinah Sykes, the Senate minority leader.

National Democratic party organizations say that goal is within reach. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee is highlighting 10 legislative races in Kansas and helping with campaign logistics.

Kansas Republicans, meanwhile, have scorned that contribution as outside interference. And they defend the supermajority.

Republican House Majority Leader Chris Croft says it's a necessary counterbalance to the governor's veto pen.

""[The] supermajority in this case, while it sounds like it's this huge number, in fact, what it does is just gives us a seat at the table,"" Croft told NPR.

Even with their heavy majority, Republican's priorities aren't always veto-proof. Last session, Kelly successfully vetoed three major tax-cut proposals, including one that fell a single vote shy of an override. The fight forced the Legislature into a special session.

""You can't get everything you want in this business. This business has a little bit of give and take and that's the beauty of the process,"" Croft says. ""It's also the frustrating part.""

Supermajorities, like the one held by Kansas Republicans, have become common. Across the country as of their recent legislative sessions, one party or another held a veto-proof majority in 29 states. Republicans had 20 of those, Democrats nine.

Patrick Miller, a political scientist at Kent State University, says supermajorities have spread in part because of polarization and legislators gerrymandering their own districts.

""One of those consequences of supermajority, is a lot more ideological politics and policy,"" he says.

While the U.S. Congress is often locked in stalemate, Miller says state legislatures that are dominated by one party are able to step into the vacuum to pass laws shaping day-to-day life.

""If you care about education, if you care about health care regulation in your state, if you care about abortion, transgender rights, LGBT rights, if you care about whether your roads have potholes ... you need to be looking at your state legislature,"" he says.

TONKA BAY, Minn. -- On a sunny Tuesday morning, Republican state Senate candidate Kathleen Fowke walks door-to-door near Lake Minnetonka just west of Minneapolis. The tree-lined roads by the water are quiet but when she knocks on a door she's reminded that this is hotly contested territory.

""You're in my YouTube all the time,"" says the man inside -- a reminder of the ads targeting voters here.

The contest to win this legislative district could be the state's most expensive ever -- and key to winning the Senate.

For two years, Democrats have controlled the Legislature and the governor's office under Gov. Tim Walz -- now the Democratic nominee for vice president. They've passed more spending for affordable housing and public schools, and guaranteed protections for patients who seek or provide abortion or gender-affirming care.

Now Republicans see a chance to curb the progressive trend. They're just a few seats behind in the state House. The Senate is tied 33-33 and this vacant seat by the lake could be the tiebreaker that ends the Democrats' so-called ""trifecta"" of House, Senate and governorship.

The GOP wants to slow state spending and focus on the economy overall. Fowke, a real estate agent, says that, while voters don't always know about the work the Legislature does, what she does hear about from them is money.

""It's basically affordability, and they can't afford, you know, just to go to the grocery store anymore,"" Fowke says. ""Taxes are high. Inflation is high. They need to find a way to help lower the costs of everything all around them.""

Republicans promise to cut taxes, tighten up on spending and curb fraud and abuse in state programs. ""With one-party, Democrat control, it was easy just to push through partisan policy and partisan priorities,"" House Minority Leader Lisa Demuth says.

Democrats say they address people's cost of living with laws requiring companies to offer paid time off for illness, family leave and safe time and new money for free school lunches.

""They trust the Democrats are going to do more for their economic well being, whereas what they hear from Republicans is, 'Oh, we have to give more tax cuts to corporations,'"" says Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman. The national Democratic Party is helping fund the state party's effort.

Their candidate facing Fowke is civil engineer Ann Johnson Stewart. She's knocking on doors, too, telling people she stands for maintaining legal protections for abortion in the state. ""One of the reasons I'm running is to make sure we can continue on that track,"" she says.

She hopes Democrats will work now on carbon-free energy sources, local infrastructure, expanding mental health care and reducing gun violence.

Andrew Karch, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota, says candidates face an uphill battle getting voters to pay attention to state issues.

""There's a real tendency for these races to sort of fly beneath the radar,"" Karch says. And many voters don't focus on state issues.

""I think politics in Minnesota specifically may have been more distinctive a generation ago than they are today,"" he says. ""State and local politicians are increasingly being asked to comment on issues that we might think of as national.""

Fowke and Johnson Stewart say they hope to keep the conversations focused on what's going on in their district. But they know that's a big ask in a presidential election year.

PHOENIX -- In Arizona, the party that wins the Legislature could determine where tens of thousands of children go to school or how well their schools are funded. At issue is the state's sweeping vouchers program that gives families tax dollars for use in private schools or for homeschooling.

For Chelsea Ellison, a homeschool parent, the program has helped turn things around for a daughter who struggled in public elementary school.

""It took us a little bit of last year to get her where she should have been, in general, and now she's thriving,"" Ellison says. ""She loves school.""

But parents and teachers sticking with public schools say they've paid the price.

""I notice that the amount of resources available to the teachers, directly, it just is not there, any kind of funding for improvements at the school is not there,"" says Miriam Hoban, whose child attends a public school in Scottsdale. She says teachers or parents are forced to pay out of pocket for basic necessities like pencils and markers.

Arizona's program, called Empowerment Scholarship Accounts, is a national model for what advocates call school choice. In 2022, the Republican Legislature and then-Gov. Doug Ducey took a small program offering vouchers for kids with disabilities or in underperforming schools and made it available for any child.

Enrollment in the program leaped from 12,000 students to 78,000 students and growing. Students got a median of $7,409 per year. That added up to a total of about $718 million from the state budget, which was $93 million more than projected, according to the Arizona Department of Education.

Republicans control the Legislature with just a two-seat advantage in both the House and Senate. The narrow margin was in the national spotlight this year as lawmakers just barely repealed an 1864 law that banned abortion.

If Democrats win control, they pledge to scale back the voucher program and they can rely on backing from Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, elected after the program was expanded. ""The previous Legislature passed a massive expansion of school vouchers that lacks accountability and will likely bankrupt this state,"" she said after taking office last year.

Critics point to stories about voucher money going for private lessons in luxury cars and ski resort passes, supposedly part of a child's education. And they say much of the money goes to families that were able to pay for private schools on their own with kids already out of the public schools.

But as the program has grown and gained support among some swing voters, it could be tougher for Democrats in competitive districts to campaign against it. They'll have to temper their ambitions, says Arizona pollster Paul Bentz.

""I don't expect that they could mount a full-fledged repeal,"" Bentz says. ""I think that would be challenging for some of the swing areas for Democrats. But I certainly think at a minimum, there would be regulation on it, and probably some definite changes to the program.""

Ellison, the voucher mom, says her family did try to make it work in public schools before opting to teach at home with voucher support.

""There was larger class sizes, more budget cuts,"" Ellison says of their old public school. ""We had no STEM teacher, we had no music teacher, we had no art teacher.""

Public school supporters say the vouchers drain the money for just those kinds of needs."

Thousands of dockworkers have called off the strike that shut down East Coast and Gulf Coast ports. The International Longshoremen's Association and the United States Maritime Alliance ended the three-day standoff with both sides agreeing to a 62% wage increase over six years. The union had wanted a 77% increase over six years. Both parties agreed to extend the existing contract until Jan. 15, 2025, so they can continue negotiations.

Three former Memphis police officers received a mixed verdict in the high-profile police brutality case related to Tyre Nichols' fatal beating. Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith were found not guilty of depriving Nichols of his civil rights, resulting in death. This was the harshest charge they faced, and a guilty verdict could have resulted in life in prison. The officers were all convicted of obstruction of justice and witness tampering. Haley was also found guilty of depriving Nichols of his civil rights and deliberate indifference resulting in serious bodily injury.

Melania Trump asks in her new memoir, according to an early excerpt published by The Guardian. The former first lady is seen here alongside her husband, former President Donald Trump, in cardboard cutouts at a campaign rally in Johnstown, Pa. Chip Somodevilla/Getty hide caption

Former first lady Melania Trump says in a self-titled memoir set to be released next week that she supports women's autonomy and the right to control their own bodies -- including abortion, if they choose, according to a report Thursday.

Her stance adds another jolt to a presidential campaign season rife with dramatic events, with Melania Trump weighing in on a topic that is a central issue in her husband's bid for reelection.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy"" when deciding when and whether to have children, Melania Trump writes in the book, according to an excerpt cited by The Guardian. The newspaper says it obtained an early copy of the book.

Those decisions, she said, should be based on women's personal convictions, not on ""intervention or pressure from the government,"" according to the excerpt.

According to the The Guardian Melania Trump also writes:

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.

Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

NPR has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment about Melania Trump's writings, and is seeking independent verification of the excerpt from the book's publisher.

Abortion has long been a key issue in U.S. political campaigns, but the 2024 race comes two years after the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v Jackson that found there is no constitutional right to abortion.

Democrats have used that controversial ruling as a rallying call, emphasizing that pivotal votes on the high court's decision came from justices nominated by then-President Donald Trump.

The former president's position on abortion has been closely analyzed as he seeks to regain the White House.

""After 50 years of failure, with nobody coming even close, I was able to kill Roe v. Wade, much to the 'shock' of everyone,"" Trump said last year on his Truth Social platform.

But this year, Trump has seemingly sought to portray a more nuanced position on abortion, including saying that abortion laws should be left for states to decide.

As NPR's Sarah McCammon reported after the 2022 midterm election:

""Advocates for bans on most abortions - including a wave of state laws passed in recent years that prohibit the procedure within the first several weeks - are at odds with public opinion, according to many years of polling. While most Americans support some restrictions on abortion, most support access earlier in pregnancy.""

Melania Trump's memoir, titled Melania, has a release date of Oct. 8, by Skyhorse Publishing, with distribution by Simon & Schuster.

In its summary of the book, the publisher said of the former first lady: ""She shares behind-the-scenes stories from her time in the White House, shedding light on her advocacy work and the causes close to her heart.""

The former first lady was born in Slovenia in 1970, three years before the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. She moved to the U.S. in 1996 and became a U.S. citizen in 2006."
Too much presidential politics? State legislatures are also on the ballot,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5129659/abortion-election-michigan-arizona-minnesota,2024-10-03T09:05:03Z,"Some of the most consequential and controversial issues -- abortion and voting access, education, health care and criminal justice -- are largely decided by state lawmakers who are, more likely than not, on your ballot this year.

State legislators wield significant power, which has been amplified with Congress gridlocked and policymaking punted to the fifty so-called ""laboratories of democracy"" to pass laws dealing with abortion, guns, schools, voting, LGBTQ rights and more.

But, increasingly, voters' attention is devoted to narratives spun in national politics, even as legislatures play an outside role in modern policymaking.

Political parties and interest groups are spending millions of dollars trying to sway legislative elections this year. In at least six states, the margins are so close that partisan control of the legislature could flip.

Republicans have more legislative power than Democrats heading into this year's elections, controlling 55% of the nation's 7,386 legislative seats, according to an NPR analysis. Overall, the GOP is on top in 57 of the country's 99 legislative chambers.

Republicans have veto-proof majorities in 20 states, allowing them to override governors' bill vetoes. Democrats have veto-proof majorities in nine states.

The ability to override a governor's veto is especially potent in Kansas, Kentucky and North Carolina -- states where Republicans have supermajority control of the Legislature and a Democratic governor. Democrats in Kansas and North Carolina are hoping to win enough seats to break Republican supermajorities this year.

Here's a look at some of the legislatures where partisan control hangs in the balance this year.

Democrats believe they have a chance to win total control of Arizona's Legislature and governor's office this year with Republicans defending narrow two-seat majorities in both the state House and Senate.

Abortion access has been front-and-center in Arizona after the state Supreme Court ordered a Civil War-era abortion ban into effect and legislators scrambled to repeal it. Democrats are taking aim at GOP lawmakers who voted against repealing the ban.

And voters will decide whether to add abortion protections to their state constitution during a referendum on Election Day -- one of 10 states with a reproductive rights ballot measure this year.

The state's Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs was elected in 2022. She set a record for the most vetoes in Arizona history -- striking down conservative bills involving elections, immigration and transgender people.

But Hobbs has been cuffed by the Republican-led Legislature and hasn't been able to champion many policies on her own. If Democrats were to flip control of the legislature, they say they would scale back a massive $700 million school voucher program passed by Republicans.

Democrats haven't had full control of the governor's office and Legislature since 1966.

Democrats are attempting to preserve the trifecta they gained in 2022 after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer won reelection and the party gained narrow majorities in both legislative chambers.

Whitmer credited the abortion constitutional amendment on the ballot that year for the Democratic victories after she and other candidates made the issue central to their campaigns. Their wins meant Democrats were in full control of the state for the first time in four decades.

Since then, Michigan Democrats have passed progressive policies like abortion protections, gun safety and an expansion of prevailing wage rules while repealing conservative provisions like ""right-to-work"" legislation.

There are no state Senate elections this year and only the House is in play. Republicans argue Democrats have pushed the state too far to the left and they can provide a check on Whitmer's administration.

Republicans are also trying to undermine a trifecta in Minnesota where the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, Democrats' official name in the North Star State, controls both legislative chambers and the governor's office.

Democrats are defending a slim majority in the House and there is a political tie in the Senate after a legislator dropped out to run for Congress. A special election for the district, located in the Minneapolis suburbs, will determine control of the Senate.

Andrew Karch, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota, says it's hard to make voters aware of these elections when there's a splashy presidential race going on.

""I think that there's a real tendency for these races to sort of fly beneath the radar,"" he says. I think in a lot of ways, there aren't that many messages that actually are bubbling up. I think again, these races often tend to get overshadowed by national politics and by other statewide campaigns.""

Under Democratic control the Legislature passed -- and Gov. Tim Walz signed -- bills that provide free meals for kids at school, restore voting rights to some people with felony convictions and reinforce abortion access and transgender rights.

Control of the Granite State's largest-in-the-nation Legislature has bounced back and forth over the years, but Republicans currently have a trifecta. The GOP currently holds a slim majority with 197 of the state House's 400 seats (there are seven vacancies) and 14 out of 24 Senate seats. After five two-year terms, Republican Gov. Chris Sununu is not running again, leaving a rare open election for governor in this state without term limits. The race to succeed him is likely the most competitive in the country this year between Republican Kelly Ayotte and Democrat Joyce Craig.

New Hampshire is one of the few states in New England without abortion protections enshrined in its state constitution and Democrats hope the issue, along with the open election for governor, will boost turnout.

The Keystone State is one of two legislatures with split control -- Republicans control the Senate and Democrats control the House.

Democrats hope recent statewide victories -- the elections of Gov. Josh Shapiro and U.S. Sen. John Fetterman -- will trickle down to local races in a year when the battleground state has been flooded with national attention. That year, Democrats won control of the state House by gaining 12 seats.

If Republicans win a majority in the House and take full control of the Legislature, it likely spells conflict between lawmakers and Shapiro.

Democrats hope new political maps -- redrawn by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers after the state Supreme Court struck down Republican-drawn maps in 2023 -- will lead to a shakeup of the GOP-led Legislature.

Republicans have controlled the Legislature for more than a decade under maps that favored the GOP. According to Wisconsin Public Radio, at least 61 members of the state Assembly and Senate won't run in their old districts -- nearly half of the Legislature. Democrats are running candidates in 97 of the Assembly's 99 races and in each of the 16 open Senate races.

Democrats argue the legislative maps have been out of step with voters after a series of statewide victories, including Evers' reelection in 2022."
"It's harder to pay and travel for abortion care, but support funds are struggling",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5131573/abortion-fund-travel-state-bans-ballot-measures-national-federation-budget-cuts-repro-rights,2024-10-03T09:02:12Z,"Bree Wallace works for the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund. The group uses donations to help people pay for abortion care in Florida, and to travel to other states, but has struggled financially to keep up with the demand.

Getting an abortion can cost hundreds, if not thousands of dollars, especially if a patient must leave a state with a strict abortion ban.

But the organizations that provide financial support, sometimes known as abortion funds, are struggling financially and slashing their budgets, unable to meet the needs of the growing number of people asking for help.

Planned Parenthood of New England is warning of a projected $8.6 million deficit. Funds in Ohio, Chicago, Arizona and Florida don't have enough money to meet demand.

Even the National Abortion Federation, which runs a national hotline that helps cover procedure costs, was forced to cut its monthly budget in half, due to fewer donations.

Previously, the Federation had covered up to 50 percent of an eligible patient's costs in most locations. In July, it dropped that coverage to 30 percent.

""We're in the midst of an abortion funding crisis,"" says Oriaku Njoku, the executive director of the National Network of Abortion Funds, which provides an online search tool for patients to find a local or regional assistance fund.

Njoku and others at these funds point to intersecting pressures: increased demand for financial assistance for abortions, additional expenses due to some patients having to travel across state lines, and a decline in donor interest.

The initial wave of ""rage donations"" that flowed into the national and regional funds, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, has subsided.

""It's weird to see the divestment like, don't you see the crisis anymore?"" says Jenice Fountain, executive director of the Yellowhammer Fund in Alabama.

""We're absolutely, very much still in crisis, potentially even worse crisis than when the ban first happened.""

The Yellowhammer Fund supports pregnancy and prenatal care, and is involved in a lawsuit against Alabama's Attorney General, after he threatened to prosecute groups like Yellowhammer for helping patients travel out of state for abortion care.

""People ask 'Why should we donate if Alabama doesn't have an abortion clinic?'"" Fountain says.

""And it's like, well, that's a reason to double down on support in Alabama. We're fighting the thing. We have to exist the whole time that we fight the thing.""

But abortion hasn't faded from the news, or become less politically potent. In fact, reproductive rights have become a prominent issue in this year's presidential election.

Ten states will put ballot measures on abortion rights before voters in November, and many Democratic candidates have made it a central issue to their campaign.

The cumulative effect has been to divert donations away from the funds that support patients directly -- and towards specific candidates and ballot initiatives.

In August, more than 30 local abortion funds across the U.S. signed an op-ed criticizing national reproductive rights organizations for focusing too much on advocacy rather than patient care.

""I think there's this false hope and illusion with putting the right president in place, or winning this ballot initiative,"" says Eloisa Lopez, executive director of the Abortion Fund of Arizona.

""None of that is actually funding abortion care,"" Lopez says. ""You can have all those things in place and people are still not going to be able to get their care.""

Even after the election ends, Lopez fears that donors will continue to assume that grassroots abortion funds like hers don't need as much support -- especially if voters approve state-level ballot initiatives that affirm reproductive rights.

""I think when people see progress is being made, it's translating into people's minds, like 'We're not going to have struggles trying to get abortion anymore.'""

But advocates say that the struggles to pay out-of-pocket for abortion care, or travel elsewhere for care, will continue in all states.

Bree Wallace, an employee at the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund, typically spends her days glued to her laptop, messaging back-and-forth with pregnant clients who need help paying abortion care -- and fast, if they want to comply with Florida's six-week ban.

One afternoon in July, a woman texted the fund from the waiting room of a clinic. She needed an abortion, but couldn't pay.

The National Abortion Hotline had pledged to cover 30 percent, leaving her with a fee of $490.

""It can be pretty hefty for people,"" says Wallace, 27, the fund's director of case management.

Within minutes, Wallace committed to help. All the woman had to do was share her first name and last initial. The clinic would directly charge the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund for the balance, and the woman could move forward with her appointment.

In Florida, an abortion can cost between $600 to $800, during the first trimester. Florida law requires a mandatory in-person consultation and an ultrasound, followed by a 24-hour waiting period.

Since 1977, the Hyde Amendment has severely restricted the use of federal funds for abortion care. In practice, that means Medicaid doesn't cover it -- unless individual states cover the entire cost with state funds.

Florida Medicaid does not cover abortion care, and state law also bans coverage by insurance plans sold on the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

Many patients must therefore pay for the entire cost, and have little time to gather the funds under the state's six-week ban.

Bree explained that many women don't even know they're pregnant by six weeks. But if they do, they often have just days to act.

""Especially with six weeks right now you're kind of working against time, you don't even have time to even get that money,"" Wallace says.

Before Florida's six-week ban went into effect last spring, some patients could have saved up their own money. But now they need the fund's help, says Wallace.

At the Abortion Fund of Arizona, declining donations have forced spending cuts. In September, the Fund spent about $18,000 assisting patients -- half of what the Fund spent in July.

Often, that monthly allotment is gone in just two weeks, and staffers must turn down requests for aid, or tell patients to try again next month.

""It's a really terrible position where we're having to give people ideas about how to raise money on their own,"" says executive director Eloisa Lopez.

""'Can you ask your family or friends? Do you have a credit card? Could you take out a line of credit? Do you have items in your home you can sell?'""

Since most states near Florida also ban abortion, patients past the state's six-week mark are traveling to places like Washington, D.C. or Illinois for care.

Between last-minute airfare and hotel stays, that can push the price up another $1,000.

""There's also taking off work. That can be hard for a lot of people, finding childcare,"" Wallace says. ""Sometimes this is the first time people have ever been on a plane, ever left Florida...it can be really confusing and stressful.""

Earlier this year, the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund decided it could spend fifty thousand dollars a month helping pay for procedures and travel. But since May, it's regularly blown past that limit.

The fund doesn't want to turn down someone who really needs help, Wallace says. She read out loud a grateful text she recently received from a client.

""'Thank you,' with a million exclamation points,"" Wallace reads from the screen. ""'Thank you so much,' with even more exclamation points. 'I appreciate you for what you do, you just helped me more than you know.'""

The Tampa fund hopes to do more fund-raising this fall. But if future donations don't keep up with spending, it will completely run out of money in 3-6 months, according to Wallace.

Because of the federal Hyde Amendment, abortion funds must turn to private donations from individuals, community groups or foundations.

But in many states, federal and state funds are used to support crisis pregnancy centers that oppose abortion and often try to dissuade people from getting an abortion. In the last 5 years, about $400 million dollars in federal money flowed to crisis pregnancy centers across the country."
"Justice Department No. 3 official pledges to fight hate crimes, fueled by personal story",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/g-s1-25489/justice-department-hate-crimes-ben-mizer,2024-10-01T09:17:21Z,"Benjamin Mizer, with Attorney General Merrick Garland (left), speaks during a press conference announcing an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in March 2024. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images hide caption

When the Justice Department's third-in-command announced nearly $30 million in new federal funds to fight the rise in hate crimes last week, he paused to share a personal reflection.

Ben Mizer told the audience he was ""almost exactly the same age"" as Matthew Shepard would have been, another young gay man living in a small college town in the late 1990s. Attackers beat Shepard, tied him to a fence and left him to die in 1998, striking fear and horror across the nation. The law named after him -- and passed more than a decade later -- gave the federal government new tools to prosecute people who are fueled by hate.

""What I would say to members of the LGBTQ community is that the Justice Department is working day and day out on their behalf to ensure that their rights and dignity are protected,"" Mizer said in a recent interview. ""And I'm proud to be a member of that community and at a senior level of the department.""

The FBI reported more than 11,000 hate crimes in 2023, including a steep increase in anti-Jewish and anti-Black incidents. Mizer and other Justice Department leaders have been targeting those and other crime problems with a two-pronged approach: prosecuting offenders and making financial investments in public safety. The Justice Department administers billions in federal grants. Its Office of Justice Programs has already invested more than $70 million into fighting hate crimes over the past several years.

Mizer, 47, oversees an enormous portfolio at the DOJ, from antitrust and the environment to civil rights. In recent weeks, he's helped launch a lawsuit against the operators of a ship that brought down Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge; announce a settlement over the Norfolk Southern train carrying toxic chemicals that derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, not far from where he spent his childhood; and bring blockbuster antitrust cases against Apple, Ticketmaster and Visa.

""I think economic justice means ensuring that everyone has a fair shake, that the playing field is level and that corporations are not using their power in unfair ways to harm competition or to harm consumers,"" Mizer said.

The son of two union workers, Mizer said he went to law school at the University of Michigan to ""help the little guy."" Since then, Mizer has served as solicitor general in his home state of Ohio, and had two separate stints at the Justice Department in Washington.

In the Obama years, Mizer helped implement a U.S. Supreme Court decision that invalidated the Defense of Marriage Act, a law that defined marriage as between one man and one woman. He sat in on the oral argument at the high court for another case, Obergefell v. Hodges, that ultimately legalized same-sex marriage.

""My husband and I enjoy the benefits of the tremendous advances that were made with respect to gay rights during the Obama era,"" Mizer said. ""But that is not to say that those battles are completely won.""

Mizer said he's proud of the work the DOJ has done to challenge state laws that could deprive transgender people of gender-affirming care -- and to protect women's rights to travel to secure health care including abortion services.

It's not clear whether Mizer will stick around at Justice, in the event Vice President Harris wins the White House. But he said working at DOJ has been ""the honor of a lifetime."""
JD Vance's time on the trail has often been overshadowed by self-made controversy,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5060281/vp-debate-jd-vance-haitian-migrants-abortion-childless-cat-ladies,2024-10-01T09:10:12Z,"Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance speaks to a crowd during a rally at the Berks County Fairgrounds on Sept. 21, in Leesport, Penn. Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images hide caption

Republican vice presidential nominee Ohio Sen. JD Vance has been an aggressive messenger for Donald Trump's campaign vision for the future and is a constant fixture on the trail, doing interviews and taking questions from the press.

But in the 11 weeks since Vance joined the GOP presidential ticket, that message has been overshadowed by controversy -- often of Vance's own making.

His acceptance speech in Milwaukee at the Republican National Convention was heavy on biography and nodded towards a more polished take on Trump's often dire rhetoric.

""My friends, tonight is a night of hope,"" he said. ""A celebration of what America once was, and with God's grace, what it will soon be again. And it is a reminder of the sacred duty we have to preserve the American experiment, to choose a new path for our children and grandchildren.""

Vance's selection came at a moment when Trump was leading in key battleground polls after President Biden's poor debate performance and the GOP was rallying around Trump after an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. The freshman Ohio senator was viewed as the MAGA heir apparent to the party's future.

But in the run-up to Tuesday's vice presidential debate between Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, there have been two conflicting forces at work on the trail: the message that Vance wants to get out, and what actually sticks.

Take his first solo campaign rally in his hometown, just days after the RNC, where he delivered a populist speech vowing to help lift up ""forgotten communities all across our country.""

""We're going to fight for every single worker in this country,"" he said. ""If you work hard and play by the rules, you ought to be able to put a good dinner on the table and send your kids to whatever vacation and whatever school you want to.""

But another line that broke through to the public -- and not for good reason -- was a comment about Diet Mountain Dew.

""Democrats say that it is racist to believe -- well, they say it's racist to do anything,"" he said. ""I had a Diet Mountain Dew yesterday and one today. I'm sure they're going to call that racist, too.""

In the days that followed, Trump struggled to quickly pivot his campaign message to address Vice President Harris after President Biden dropped out of the race, but Vance was quick to fill in the gaps to question her record and make her the focus of attacks on immigration, inflation and other top Republican issues.

When Harris named Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate and the pair embarked on a swing state blitz, Vance was there, too, countering the Democratic message with the case for a Republican presidency.

""It is normal people who suffer when Kamala Harris refuses to do her job, and it is normal people who stand to benefit the most when we re-elect Donald J. Trump president of the United States,"" he said in Philadelphia.

But Vance's rapid ascension in politics means he has relatively less experience as a campaigner, delivering stump speeches or handling the intense scrutiny on past and present statements.

So the prebuttal tour came as Vance was also dealing with uproar over old comments he made deriding Democrats in charge as quote ""childless cat ladies.""

""It's not a criticism of people who don't have children,"" Vance said in an interview with Megyn Kelly. ""I explicitly said in my remarks despite the fact the media has lied about this that this is not about criticizing people who for various reasons didn't have kids. This is about criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-child.""

But the damage was done, as Vance's old comments provided Democrats an opening to attack the GOP ticket as sexist and out of touch.

Then, there's more recent remarks, like a weeks-long inflammatory crusade against Haitian migrants living in Springfield, Ohio that Vance has sought to use as a cudgel to attack Democrats over immigration.

""The American media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and I started talking about cat memes,"" Vance said in a Sept. 15 CNN interview. ""If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do.""

State and local Republican leaders in Ohio have rejected claims made by Trump and Vance about Haitian migrants in Springfield. The city's mayor told news outlets that Vance's staff knew the conspiracies about eating pets were false before Trump uttered the lies on the debate stage last month.

Several times, Vance has also staked out policy positions for the ticket that Trump has later disagreed with or shot down, like when Vance said that Trump would veto a national abortion ban.

""I didn't discuss it with JD, in all fairness,"" Trump said on the debate stage. ""And I don't mind if he has a certain view, but I don't think he was speaking for me.""

Where Trump offered a ""concept of a plan"" for health care, Vance answered a question after a Raleigh, North Carolina campaign speech with more details of how Republicans would overhaul health insurance risk pools under the Affordable Care Act, a broadly unpopular proposal.

Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Vance has also been prolific when it comes to messaging campaign goals, frequently doing media interviews, delivering speeches and taking questions after most every stop -- prioritizing local journalists.

But those Q and A sessions can turn contentious, with the crowd often booing questions from journalists as Vance takes the opportunity to paint himself as a pugilist for Trump, whether it be queries about interest rate cuts or questions about the campaign's support of North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who allegedly called himself a ""Black Nazi"" among other things on a porn forum more than a decade ago. (Robinson has denied the allegation.)

Vance, who was a combat correspondent in the Marine Corps, regularly lectures reporters about what he perceives to be unfair coverage of him and frequently directs them to ask Harris questions instead.

Even in more casual campaign settings, Vance has struggled at times to connect. At one stop at a doughnut shop in Valdosta, Georgia, an employee was awkwardly put on the spot by the candidate -- she then asked not to be filmed on camera. On another visit to a Pennsylvania sandwich shop last weekend, Vance was left standing outside in a parking lot after some initial confusion because staff at the shop were never given advance notice of his visit.

All of these things have contributed to Vance having the lowest favorability rating on this year's presidential ballot -- and one of the lowest of any VP pick in recent history."
"Poll workers can be hard to find. In Nebraska, election officials can draft them",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/nx-s1-4990797/nebraska-elections-poll-worker-draft,2024-10-01T09:06:20Z,"OMAHA, Neb. -- Joe Ricceri is busy preparing for the general election with the Douglas County Election Commission. Right now, he works at the customer service desk. But on Election Day, he'll be a district supervisor.

Ricceri is currently a volunteer. But he didn't start out as one. He was drafted.

He was actually drafted when his children were little, but deferred until they were old enough to drive themselves home from school.

""Then immediately, when the youngest was 16, [the county] contacted me. So, they were all over it. They did a good job there,"" he said with a wry laugh.

Finding poll workers is a regular challenge for election officials. But Nebraska has a unique solution: It allows counties to draft workers to fill needs, like it's jury duty.

The secretary of state's office says it's only aware of two Nebraska counties using a poll worker draft this election cycle: Omaha's Douglas County and just south of it, Sarpy County.

In Douglas County, any registered voter is eligible and may receive a letter in the mail requiring them to serve. Even though it's been used for years, Douglas County Election Commissioner Brian Kruse said many voters aren't familiar with the draft and are skeptical when they receive the letter.

""I would say most voters in Douglas County, probably their reaction is, 'Is this for real?'"" Kruse said. ""I mean, one of my best friends is the COO of a company here in Omaha, and one of his employees got [the letter], and he called me up, and he was like, 'Is this for real?' And I said, 'Yes.' And he said, 'Can I get him out of it?' And I said, 'No.'""

Kruse laughed at the memory, but he's not kidding. Voters here can't get out of the draft unless they're over 70 years old, don't speak English, or they take themselves off the voter rolls. Kruse said that is rare.

And if a draftee doesn't show up or doesn't answer that letter, they could face a misdemeanor charge.

In recent years, about half of the county's 3,000 general election workers were drafted.

""We try to get as many volunteers as we can,"" said Election Board Coordinator Brandon Olson. ""Still, we don't want to just go, 'OK, we're just gonna draft everybody.' That's not what we're doing, but ... it gives us a confidence that we aren't going to be worried about finding people.""

That's unlike a lot of the rest of the country, even if the situation has somewhat recovered from a nationwide election shortage during the peak of the COVID pandemic, according to Marta Hanson, national program manager for the group Power the Polls.

""I would say, generally speaking, about 40% of jurisdictions we're in touch with have been like, 'Actually, we're set, we're good, we're fully staffed, we have no issues. Please don't send us more people, because they'll just be disappointed,'"" she said. ""Another 40% are in desperate need of more people.""

Douglas County's draft also fills staffing needs with a more diverse group of people -- especially when many election workers are over 70.

Commissioner Kruse added that those drafted must be balanced in political party, so it's not all registered Republicans or all Democrats. The county works to ensure all five of Nebraska's political parties and nonpartisans are represented.

Carolina Lopez, executive director of the Partnership for Large Election Jurisdictions, was excited to hear about the program.

""I'm going to say it: I was geeking out. I was like, 'Tell me more. I've heard about this in practice. I want to see it,'"" she said.

Lopez said she's rooting for Douglas County and can't wait to see how the draft works this year.

""While this has been in practice in Douglas County for some time, this idea has the potential to be equally impactful for other elections communities across the country,"" she added.

Kruse said some other jurisdictions have shown interest in the method, but he hasn't seen other states employ anything like it -- yet.

Douglas is the only Nebraska county that regularly uses the draft, and Kruse thinks it may be because other jurisdictions are smaller, with fewer polling places, so they don't have as much trouble finding enough workers.

Some voters may view the poll worker draft as a pain, but Kruse said many of the draftees turn into longtime volunteers -- like Ricceri.

And he said the draft also helps more people understand fair elections.

""We have all kinds of processes and procedures in place, but it definitely gives us a broader base and we reach out to a lot more individuals, and so those individuals can see how the process works,"" Kruse said. ""They can go back to their neighborhoods, their PTAs, their schools, daycares, churches, synagogues, country clubs, grocery store, wherever they may socialize, and tell folks about the experience. We do hear over and over: 'I had no idea what all went into the process.'""

Kerri Harris received her draft letter in the mail before the primary election in May. The concept was new to Harris, who had lived in the county for 18 years. She remembered she had mixed feelings about it.

""Because I was like, well, I should serve and be a good citizen. And then it was like, that's a long day, and what if I wasn't available? You know, how do they do all that? Like, what happens to me if I don't do it? You know, it seemed kind of serious, really, like you're supposed to do this,"" she said.

Harris said she never would have volunteered to be an election worker; she does not have a big interest in politics, and she prefers to be outside rather than sitting inside a polling location.

All those who are voluntold must serve not just one election, but four. Once someone serves in four, they won't be drafted again. Harris will serve in the November general plus two more before she completes her draft duty.

Harris' service comes as some voters are questioning elections.

""I've learned a lot that I don't question the integrity of the election at all, because I see everything that everybody has to go through to make sure that the right people vote,"" she said. ""So, I think it says a lot for the integrity of Douglas County.""

Draftee-turned-volunteer Ricceri said he sees value in playing a role in the democratic process.

""You're doing the justice for the people to vote and allowing them to vote and have a voice in the government. So that's important.""

And it's an important election year in Nebraska. Voters can look forward to a packed ballot filled with six initiatives -- including on abortion and marijuana -- as well as two U.S. senators and the president. It's also the first general election in which voters are required to present an ID.

As of now, the drafted election workers and volunteers have completed their online training. But they may still get one more letter telling them they're not needed for this election, and to keep their mailboxes open for the next one."
How much can the upcoming vice presidential debate impact the election? : Consider This from NPR,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/1202833892/how-much-can-the-upcoming-vice-presidential-debate-impact-the-election,2024-09-30T21:12:17Z,"On Tuesday, two midwesterners will face off in the only vice presidential debate of the election.

Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance (R) and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) will share the stage, exactly five weeks from Election Day, in a race that's very close.

Both candidates will likely lean on their small-town, middle-of-America credentials, Vance from Middletown, Ohio, and Walz, who grew up in Nebraska.

But they have very different ideas about what America should look like. From the border crisis, to abortion, and of course, gun laws.

In a race where so much of the polling is within the margin of error -- it seems as though any one thing could affect the outcome of the 2024 Presidential election.

But have Vice Presidential Debates made a difference in past races?

NPR's senior White House Correspondent Tamara Keith dug into that existential... and political question.

Keith says that vice presidential debates are often forgettable, but the one in 1988 is seared in American popular culture.

Judy Woodruff of PBS did the introductions for Senator Dan Quayle, the Republican nominee, and Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic nominee.

Benson was in his late sixties while Quayle was only 41, and that dynamic led to one of the most iconic lines in debate history, as Quayle compared himself to John F. Kennedy, and Lloyd Bentsen replied:

""I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.""

It was a huge moment in the debate. But it ultimately had no real impact on the outcome of the race. Smackdown notwithstanding, Bentsen and his running mate, Michael Dukakis, lost in a wipe out.

Joel Goldstein is an expert on the vice presidency. He argues that the VP debates do matter.

""It's an important part of their introduction to the American people, along with the sort of the vice presidential rollout and the acceptance,"" he told NPR.

And these two could use more of an introduction. J.D. Vance is a bestselling author but has only been in the Senate for two years. Governor Tim Walz served in Congress but never had a national profile until now. Goldstein says one key test is whether voters can imagine them as president.

""If somebody is not prepared to be president on day one, they're also not likely to be the sort of person who's going to be able to walk into the Oval Office and say no to the president or tell him or her that that the president's wrong."""
Maryland seemed poised this year to legalize medical aid in dying. What happened?,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/09/29/nx-s1-5130007/maryland-terminal-cancer-legalize-medical-aid-in-dying-physician-assisted-suicide,2024-09-30T11:03:45Z,"For advocates of medical aid in dying, it seemed like the political stars were finally aligning in Maryland.

Many predicted the legislature had enough votes in the 2024 session to finally legalize the practice, after years of failed attempts and near misses.

State Senate President Bill Ferguson felt like the bill had a good chance.

""I believe it will pass the Senate,"" Ferguson said in January, at the start of the legislative session. ""I expect it to be a topic of important conversation this year.""

In the most recent survey, 74% of Americans believe terminal patients should have the right to painlessly end their lives. A majority of Americans have supported that right in every Gallup poll since 1996.

Oregon first legalized the practice in 1994. Since then nine other states and the District of Columbia have followed suit with similar laws.

Technically, medical aid in dying is ""the act of prescribing lethal medications to a consenting patient who can self-ingest them with the intent of hastening their death,"" according to the Journal of the Advanced Practitioner in Oncology. (Most patients who have used the process have cancer.)

The current state laws lay down similar regulatory guardrails to ensure a patient are making an informed, voluntary decision and are mentally competent to oversee their own medical care.

For example, the Maryland bill required the patient to navigate multiple requests and waiting periods before obtaining the legal medications. The patient must have a prognosis of six months or less to live, and must be physically able to take the medication themselves.

In Maryland, a 2024 poll found 70% of Marylanders support medical aid in dying.

In 2019, a Maryland bill stalled after a tie vote. In 2024, the opportunity seemed ripe for supporters and allied legislators to try again.

Support or opposition to medical aid in dying does not always break along traditional partisan lines. Still, the practice does tend to garner more support from Democrats.

In Maryland, Democrats hold a comfortable majority in both houses of the General Assembly. In 2022, a Democrat, Wes Moore, won the governorship after eight years under Republican Larry Hogan. Moore had indicated he'd sign a bill, if it made it to his desk.

""I think there is a slight partisan element to it,"" said Peg Sandeen, the CEO of Death with Dignity, an organization that advocates for medical aid in dying. ""But, that's not the dominant breakdown here of the vote. We will have Republicans who are voting for this bill in the end, and some Democrats who vote against it.""

In the end, the bill failed by a single vote. The failure shows how controversial medical aid in dying remains, and how Democrats are by no means united around the issue.

Although party affiliation plays a role, cultural and religious beliefs can split and fragment the vote on this issue.

""The Catholics are very much against the bill. Also, a lot of the African Americans don't like it. It seems they feel it's against their religion,"" said Ron Young, a former Democratic state senator, who had previously sponsored and supported medical aid in dying bills.

""Maryland is progressive, but it's also very diverse,"" said Donna Smith, an advocate with Compassion and Choices, which lobbies for aid in dying. ""The African American legislators represent about 30% of the legislators in Maryland. And so it's very hard to get anything passed without some of their support.""

The Black community in Maryland is a formidable voting bloc and one that legislators listen to closely, according to former state senator Ron Young. And a large percentage of Black voters oppose medical aid in dying, Young said.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Maryland is 32% Black, making it the state with the sixth highest Black population in the nation.

While the Black community isn't a monolith, there are enough who balk at the idea of medical aid in dying.

""I'm a Baptist. I don't believe in people killing themselves. Number one rule,"" said Reggie Carter, a Black voter in Maryland.

But other Black voters are open to the idea. Gee Blue, who is Muslim, said he had complicated feelings about the issue.

""It does go against a lot of religion, but I feel like personal choice is beyond religion sometimes,"" Blue said.

State Senator Malcom Augustine, a Democrat, represents Prince George's County, which has the highest Black population in Maryland. He voted against the bill in 2019 and continues to oppose it.

""What I was hearing from constituents was that this was a very, very personal and very difficult policy decision,"" he said.

Augustine said his concerns are based in fears that nursing homes might coerce people into making a decision they hadn't thought through.

Then, there is the Catholic Church, an entity that has fought for what it calls the ""sanctity of life.""

""There's people with a lot of money and a lot of power that oppose it,"" said Thaddeus Pope, a clinical ethicist at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

""Traditionally, the Catholic Church has been one of the biggest opponents. And, they have spent a lot of money in many states opposing this. It's sort of the same parties that are involved with abortion. It's not just the Catholic Church, but it's pro-life advocacy organizations.""

Pope added that after the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade, some of those organizations had more time and resources available to lobby against medical aid in dying.

Political observers and advocates agree that Maryland has a patchwork of cultures and constituencies that legislators still must cater to in their local districts.

Given those nuances, a few ""no"" votes can block any piece of legislation, despite the legislators' shared party affiliation.

""The thing about the legislative process is there's so many little gates a bill has to pass through,"" Pope said. ""The opposition doesn't need all the votes, they just need to be able to block any one of those gates that it needs to pass through and they win.""

In Maryland, the gate shut in the General Assembly when one senator changed her mind.

In neighboring Delaware, which also has a majority Democratic government, a similar aid in dying bill passed the Delaware House and then squeaked through the state Senate with an 11-10 vote on June 25.

But on Sept. 20, Delaware Governor John Carney vetoed it. Carney, a Catholic, said he is ""fundamentally and morally opposed to state law enabling someone, even under tragic and painful circumstances, to take their own life.""

Supporters in both states say they'll keep talking and lobbying, hoping that both voters and their representatives gradually become more comfortable with the issue."

Vice presidential candidates Ohio Sen. JD Vance (R) and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) will face off in a debate Tuesday for the 2024 election cycle.

This will be the only time the candidates meet on stage and simultaneously present their policy positions to the broader American public, which may be less familiar with them than with their partners on the presidential ticket.

The two hold similar roles in their respective campaigns: to appeal to working-class voters in the ""Blue Wall"" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin this fall.

Here's what you need to know about what is historically the only debate between the candidates for vice president.

When and how to watch?

This debate will be hosted by CBS News in New York City at 9 p.m. ET.

CBS Evening News anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell and Face the Nation moderator and chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan will moderate the debate at the CBS Broadcast Center. The debate will air live on CBS, CBS News Streaming Network and Paramount+ and stream live without a cable login on CBSNews.com.

Who are the running mates?

Former President Donald Trump announced Vance as his running mate on the first day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this summer.

The first-term senator, who was once a critic of Trump, came to political relevance when he wrote the book Hillbilly Elegy, blaming Biden and Democrats for the struggles of the rural economy he grew up in. In the Senate, Vance has positioned himself against Republican leadership at times but on issues like abortion, immigration and election integrity, he's closely aligned with Trump.

Vice President Harris chose Walz just weeks after she was tapped to replace President Biden at the top of the ticket.

Walz got the nickname ""Coach Walz"" for being a former football coach and teacher. As governor, Walz secured several progressive wins in his state, including clean energy mandates, universal free school meals, family and medical leave benefits and abortion protections.

What to watch for

Since his nomination, Vance has had to address controversies that are likely to come up again during the debate, including couch-related jokes and criticisms of him calling prominent Democrats ""childless cat ladies."" Vance has also come under fire for spreading the false claim that Haitian immigrants are eating pets in Ohio.

Walz, a two-term governor, has also faced questions about his response to riots in Minneapolis following the 2020 murder of George Floyd and widespread fraud during COVID-19 under a federal program intended to provide food assistance to students after schools closed. Audits have suggested lapses in oversight by the state Department of Education.

Walz has been getting help for the debate from Pete Buttigieg, the U.S. Transportation Secretary. Buttigieg helped Harris with her VP debate prep in 2020. It wasn't immediately clear whom Vance is preparing with.

The military records of both candidates are also likely to come up.

Vance criticized Walz for his military record, including for saying he carried weapons ""in war"" when he had not been in combat.

Walz, who served in the National Guard for 20 years and reenlisted after Sept. 11, only saw wartime deployment to Italy in 2003. Vance, who served in the Marines and did a six-month deployment to Iraq, also has not seen combat.

What are the rules for the debate?

The debate will last 90 minutes and both campaigns have agreed to a set of rules.

There will be no audience in attendance, and the candidates will each take a stand behind podiums. Candidates will have two minutes for closing statements. Vance won a virtual coin toss on Sept. 26 and elected to go second with his closing statement.

Vance and Walz will not be allowed to have prewritten notes or props, and topics and questions will not be shared in advance with campaigns. Unlike the presidential debates, microphones will remain on but CBS News reserves the right to turn them off.

According to CBS News, each candidate will get two minutes to answer each question, and the other candidate will get two minutes to respond. Then, each candidate gets one minute for further rebuttals. At the discretion of the moderators, candidates may get an additional minute each to continue a discussion.

What comes next?

This is likely to be the last debate before Election Day. Across several states, mail ballots have already started going out.

Harris challenged Trump to one more debate on Oct. 23 but Trump declined, saying it was ""too late."""
3 women from different backgrounds detail why they're voting for Harris,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/nx-s1-5123647/kamala-harris-georgia-women-vote-election-2024,2024-09-30T09:06:18Z,"Eustacia McCloud Carter, Latrice Cushenberry and Donna Smith Aranson sat down with NPR in mid September. Nydia Blas for NPR hide caption

The state of Georgia has never elected a female governor or U.S. senator. So, given that fact, we wanted to know: Are Georgians ready to make history and cast their 16 electoral votes for the first woman president?

In mid-September, NPR sat down with three women of different ages, races and religions who have seen politics in Georgia evolve through multiple election cycles. Each said they were voting for Kamala Harris this November, and detailed what her candidacy meant to them.

Read and listen to more of All Things Considered's recent trip to Georgia, including interviews with the secretary of state and Georgia GOP chairman.

For Latrice Cushenberry, Harris feels familiar.

""She is someone that I have seen repeatedly throughout my lifetime in my grandmother, my mother, my aunt -- [a] capable, competent African American person that basically can get the job done with empathy and compassion,"" she said.

So when Cushenberry saw Harris become the Democratic candidate for president, she says she saw someone ascending to a position that has always existed in her life: ""Of authority, of really making certain that everyone is cared for and making certain that everyone is represented.""

The fact Harris is a woman of color also resonated for Cushenberry and made her think of what she had experienced in her own life.

""I'm a person that works in a company where I'm the only person that looks the way I look,"" she said. ""I think it's important for her to be the most capable, to be the most competent. And her gender and her race is just a part of her, of who she is as a person. She shouldn't lead with that, I don't think, but it is critical for people to understand ... that people of color are capable.""

And Cushenberry believes Harris' ascension has helped redefine this narrative around people of color.

""Thank God, because it's quite exhausting, to be honest with you. It's exhausting to have to be in a constant state of proving because of the color of your skin.""

Eustacia McCloud Carter is a 20-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force and has lived in Georgia since 1998. She says it took her some time to come around to the idea of Harris at the top of the ticket.

""I was all-in for Joe Biden. I didn't care if we had to put him in a wheelchair, motorized, five oxygen tanks on his back,"" she said. ""And I was not liking the way that he was being coerced to leave. I just felt like he was a statesman and he deserved a little more respect than that.""

After Biden stepped aside, McLoud Carter said she took some time to grieve what had changed, but that once she came out of her ""mourning period"" she was all-in for Harris.

McCloud Carter believes much of the challenge in getting a woman in the White House has to do with the way that some men view women and their roles in society -- something she qualifies as a ""fallacy.""

""They see it that way, that we need to be barefoot, pregnant, in the kitchen,"" she said. ""I did a canvas of my team of 50 barber and beauty shops, and that is the one thing I heard when I went in there, especially in the African American barbershops, 'I'm voting for Trump.' And they like Donald Trump. He comes out with that machoism.""

McCloud Carter said she doesn't think all men believe this, but that there is a large part of the country that does.

""I was never raised that way. I have a father who always told me and my three sisters, 'You can be anything you want to be.'""

Donna Smith Aranson has lived in Atlanta her entire life and has volunteered for Hillary Clinton and both of Stacey Abrams' gubernatorial campaigns.

She feels the state is ready to elect the first female president.

""It's been an evolution. I think in our last election cycle ... we elected two senators who are unique in their positions, Reverend Warnock and Jon Ossoff,"" she said. ""And I'm proud to say that I voted for both of them and campaigned for both of them. Is it time for a woman? God, I hope so. I do hope so.""

""I think that women have always taken second place. I think the stand on abortion and all of the things that matter to women specifically are strong issues that [Harris] backs. And that's not to say that men don't either. But ... it feels more personal when it comes from a woman.""

Smith Aranson says she has seen a change over time, and that each election cycle she is watching stronger women step up. She is personally excited to see a woman running for the presidency, but adds that she's glad that Harris has not made her gender or race the central focus of her campaign.

""She has to appeal to all people, all genders, all religions,"" she said."

Vice presidential debates have produced many memorable moments, but it's hard to say any has made a decisive difference in the election outcome.

This year the anticipation may be higher than in the past, if only because the race is so close and neither candidate seems to have a clear advantage. The debate may provide the moment of decision for some voters and even a tipping point in a closely balanced electorate.

Much of the electorate is still getting to know the running mates chosen by former President Donald Trump and Vice President Harris. Trump's choice, Ohio's JD Vance, has only been in the Senate since last year and Harris' Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota has not previously campaigned for office outside his home state.

All 11 previous running mate debates have taken place in the month of October, just as the media and campaign aficionados find themselves needing a new angle on the presidential race. They have usually been mixed in with multiple debates between the presidential candidates themselves. But after one meeting with Harris, Trump is saying it is too late for another. So the Vance-Walz debate appears to offer the campaign's last live confrontation.

That makes this October 1 match in New York seem far more important than the VP's usual ""undercard"" status: In boxing terms, it could be the main event of the campaign's final month. That expectation and tension have hovered over the Battle of the Twos in every four-year cycle for decades now, and it's worth recalling how much media heat and drama they have generated.

Rewind to the first one

The first vice presidential debate was in 1976, the year of America's Bicentennial, when the political system needed something to restore people's faith. The nation was emerging from a decade of dissension, dispirited by the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandals that forced President Richard Nixon from office.

The 1976 presidential contest was between the unelected incumbent Republican Gerald Ford, who had been Nixon's vice president, and a newcomer named Jimmy Carter, the former governor of Georgia. (Carter will turn 100 on Tuesday, the day of the Vance-Walz debate.)

In that year, both nominees reached out to the disaffected in their own parties with their vice presidential picks. Ford chose Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, a conservative he hoped would placate those who had preferred Ronald Reagan as that year's GOP presidential nominee. Carter, a Southern moderate, chose the well-known liberal Sen. Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Both men would later rise to the top of the ticket in their respective parties, but neither would ever win the White House.

Their debate in 1976 has been remembered chiefly for a phrase uttered by Dole when talking about foreign policy. A decorated veteran of the Second World War, Dole referred to the several conflicts of the 20th century as ""Democrat wars."" Indeed, there had been Democrats in office when each of the world wars and the Korean conflict began, but support for U.S. participation had been generally bipartisan. Dole seemed to be tapping a well of isolationist sentiment long dormant in the GOP - but never extinct.

The Dole controversy lasted a few days and provided videotape for later discussions of his career, but if it did any damage it was hard to discern in November's outcome. Ford, who had been far behind Carter in the early fall, closed the gap in the closing days and nearly won.

1980 and 1984: Mondale, Bush and Ferraro

In 1980 the VP nominees were Mondale and former congressman and CIA Director George H.W. Bush, the No. 2 for Reagan, who had won the Republican presidential nomination on his third try. The debate was scheduled for Louisville, Ky., on October 2 but canceled three days earlier when both Mondale and Bush declined to attend. There had been disagreements over the inclusion of a third candidate, Patrick Lucey, the former governor of Wisconsin who was the running mate of independent candidate John Anderson that year.

Bush was back as the incumbent vice president in 1984 and game for a debate with the first woman ever included on a major party's national ticket, Rep. Geraldine Ferraro of New York. Ferraro, a former prosecutor, was poised and assured and gave Democrats a shot in the arm. At one point she took exception to Bush's dismissive tone: ""I almost resent ... your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy.""

Mondale was also back that fall, at the top of the Democratic ticket, and having done well in his first debate with Reagan, he took to featuring that performance and Ferraro's in his campaign appearances. ""Have you been watching the debates?"" he would ask, and the crowds, such as they were, would roar.

Bush generated a ruckus after the debate when an open microphone overheard him saying he had ""tried to kick a little ass."" But none of the back and forth over the debates that autumn could have mattered much Reagan was cruising toward a second term and won every state but Mondale's Minnesota, where he came within one-fifth of one percentage point.

VP debates' single greatest hit

Perhaps the best illustration of vice presidential debates elevating a candidate who would still lose in the election Lloyd Bentsen, the silver-haired Texas senator who ran with Democrat Michael S. Dukakis in 1988. Bentsen had the stature in Washington and also the appeal to the heartland that Dukakis lacked. He had also taken the measure of the youthful senator from Indiana whom Bush, now his party's pick for president, had added to the GOP ticket.

Quayle had been elected to the Senate at age 33 and was just 41 when he faced Bentsen, 26 years his senior. Answering a question about his experience, Quayle said he'd had ""as much experience in Congress"" as John F. Kennedy had when he was elected president at 43 in 1960.

Bentsen fixed his opponent with an appraising stare as he said: ""Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.""

The crowd whooped. A crestfallen Quayle recovered enough to say: ""That was really uncalled for, senator."" But if there had been a referee he would have stopped the fight right there.

Still, in November, the Bush-Quayle ticket carried 40 states and won easily.

No vice presidential debate since then has produced quite such a dramatic highpoint, but there have been several that left an indelible impression.

In 1992, Quayle was back as the incumbent vice president and as Bush's designated attack dog against the Democratic ticket of Bill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, and running mate Al Gore, then a senator from Tennessee.

But both Quayle and Gore were upstaged by the presence of a third debater, the only such addition to the format in the history of vice presidential faceoffs to date. He was retired Adm. James A. Stockdale, a hero of the Vietnam War who had been a prisoner of war and an organizer and spokesman for other POWs at the time. Stockdale was the running mate for independent candidate H. Ross Perot, a billionaire businessman who also took part in the presidential debates with Bush and Clinton.

But on debate night, Stockdale looked uncomfortable on stage and had trouble with his hearing aid. His opening -- ""Who am I? What am I doing here?"" - came across not as introductory so much as genuinely confused. It was fodder for parody and was being mercilessly mocked almost before the debate was over.

Did Stockdale hurt Perot? Not visibly. The Clinton-Gore ticket won in 1992, but Perot-Stockdale got 19% of the popular vote in November, the best showing for a third-option ticket since the 1912 ""Bullmoose"" heyday of Theodore Roosevelt.

Surprises abound but prove inconclusive

Gore returned in 1996 as the incumbent vice president to debate Rep. Jack Kemp, the vice presidential choice of Dole, who was back as the GOP nominee against Clinton. Gore and Kemp had served in the House together before Gore's election to the Senate in 1984. Their debate was spirited but cordial, and many Republicans later said their guy should have been more aggressive. In any event, the incumbents won the vote that mattered that November.

In 2000, Gore was at the top of the ticket and surprised many by choosing Sen. Joe Lieberman, a party moderate from Connecticut who had been critical of Clinton. It appeared to be an effort to distance Gore from Clinton, in part because Lieberman had been outspoken in criticizing Clinton for the relationship with a White House intern that led to Clinton's 1998 impeachment.

Lieberman was the government official in his debate with Dick Cheney, who was at the time the chairman of a private company servicing the oil-and-gas industry. But Cheney had also been in the Republican leadership in the House and been Bush's secretary of defense during the first Persian Gulf War. He asserted a kind of seniority over his Democratic rival in the debate, even though Lieberman was just a year younger and a sitting senator at the time. If there had been any doubt about Cheney when picked by GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush, such doubt was dispelled in the debate.

A few weeks later, in one of the closest elections in U.S. history, the Bush-Cheney ticket lost the popular vote but squeaked by in the Electoral College thanks to a 537-vote edge in Florida that took five weeks and a Supreme Court Decision to decide.

As the incumbent vice president four years later, Cheney was every bit as much in command when paired with Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, the running mate choice of Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts. With the memory of the terror attacks of September 2001 still vivid in voters' minds, Cheney had an advantage and kept a grip on it, knowing his reputation for glowering toughness fit the moment better than Edwards' freshness and Southern charm.

That November's outcome was not quite as close as in 2004, but the early exit polls had pointed to a Kerry-Edwards win. It was only when Ohio went for Bush-Cheney late that evening that the Electoral College had a winner.

Renewed interest in 2008

The atmosphere in the country was notably different four years later in 2008. Feeling the wind at their back as a party, Democrats fought almost all the way to the convention over whether to nominate Hillary Clinton, bidding to be the first woman president, or Barack Obama, bidding to be the first Black president. Obama prevailed and chose a Senate colleague old enough to be his father, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware, to be his running mate. Biden had connections to the white, working-class voters Obama had been losing in the primaries that year.

And Biden did well in his debate with the Republican running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who had added verve and excitement to the ticket headed by Sen. John McCain of Arizona. While Palin was bound to be the focus of the debate, Biden had opportunities and made the most of them.

At the time, Wall Street was experiencing a crisis over mortgage-backed securities that would trigger a credit crunch and a downturn soon to be dubbed ""the Great Recession."" So Biden's gravitas as a six-term senator was as welcome as his roots in blue-collar America. A month later he was the vice president-elect.

In 2012, Biden's task was entirely different. Obama's reelection was opposed by former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, and Biden found himself onstage with the brainy and capable Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee and almost 30 years Biden's junior. Ryan had first come to Washington as a congressional intern for Jack Kemp, and like him, he would be criticized for not attacking the incumbent vice president he faced in the debate. In any event, the Biden-Ryan meeting produced no surprises and probably no effect on the Obama-Biden reelection the following month.

This low-impact trend has continued in the last two vice presidential debates. It takes a moment to even remember the 2016 debate between Mike Pence, then the sitting governor of Indiana, and Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia. Pence had little trouble keeping the emphasis on the man who had put him on that stage, Donald Trump, and on the social issues that Trump wanted him to promote.

Kaine, who had been governor of Virginia and chairman of the Democratic National Committee moving on to the Senate in 2012, also made Trump the centerpiece of his debate performance, saying Trump was ""scary"" as commander in chief and far too well-disposed toward dictators and authoritarians in other countries.

But a few weeks later, when Trump-Pence had prevailed over Clinton-Kaine, no one was talking about what had happened in the running mates' debate.

Pence's Democratic rival was Biden's running mate, Kamala Harris, then a sitting senator from California, who was equally loyal when defending both Biden and herself. And she was not shy about taking on the social issues such as abortion that were so important to Pence's portfolio.

Just three months later, a crowd of rioters would chant ""Hang Mike Pence"" and erect a makeshift scaffold on the steps of the U.S. Capitol because Pence had refused Trump's urging to block the certification of the Electoral College results. Pence refused to leave the Capitol that night and in the wee hours of morning he supervised the process by which the Biden-Harris ticket formalized its win.

Pence also returned to the campaign trail to seek the GOP's 2024 presidential nomination as an alternative to Trump. Pence took part in several of the debates among the candidates, separating himself from Trump on the question of certifying the 2020 election but otherwise defending the Trump record. Unable to make much headway in polls or amass a competitive war chest, he dropped out months before the first primary was held.

Despite the frustrations of Quayle and Pence, the TV-era tradition by which former vice presidents have gone on to be their party's presidential nominee is impressive (Nixon, Hubert Humphrey, Ford, Mondale, Gore, Biden and the first President Bush).

And it continues this year with Harris, who will note that four of her seven predecessors in this group made it to the Oval Office."

Mike Coppola/Getty Images hide caption

Sean ""Diddy"" Combs has been hit with yet another sexual abuse lawsuit. The latest filing against the 54-year-old artist and record exec alleges Combs drugged, assaulted, coerced and threatened an unnamed victim over the course of two years with one of their encounters resulting in a pregnancy and miscarriage.

In the new lawsuit filed today (Sept. 27) with the New York County Supreme Court, a Jane Doe plaintiff who resides in Florida and works as a model claims she was forced to travel and ""perform"" for Combs many times in the last few years. The plaintiff alleges that after she and Combs started seeing each other in 2021, she was flown to different states, including California and New York, by his company, Bad Boy Enterprise, to have sex with the rap mogul. According to the filing, the victim often felt coerced into going to see Combs by members of his team, and Combs' chief of staff, Kristina Khorram, was among the agents who would pay for the plaintiff's travel. She says staffers would ""send drivers to her home to pick her up before she agreed to travel, to the point where she did not believe she had a choice.""

The unnamed victim alleges that throughout the spring of 2022 she was ordered to take drugs including ketamine and forced to have sex with Combs in his homes in Los Angeles and Miami. The plaintiff says the heavy drug use caused her to black out intermittently. On one of these occasions, she ""woke up and her feet were purple and bruised and she had a bite mark on her heel"" but had no memory of how she got the injuries. That summer, the plaintiff says she found out she was pregnant and when she told Combs, the label exec's girlfriend at the time, Caresha Brownlee, a.k.a. the rapper Yung Miami, harassed her by repeatedly calling her and ordering her to have an abortion. The plaintiff claims that the stress led her to suffer a miscarriage shortly after.

Additionally, the plaintiff claims to have witnessed Combs slap other women and exhibit controlling, violent behavior. She alleges that he would instruct his staff to record sexual encounters with her without her permission; that he had found a way to track her location and would monitor her phone conversations; and that he would command her to travel to him up until July 2024. The plaintiff says Combs continues to contact her in an attempt to intimidate her. She is seeking unspecified, punitive damages from Combs and Bad Boy Enterprises with the amount to be determined in a trial.

With this new complaint, the tally of civil lawsuits filed against Combs for sexual misconduct rises to 12. In addition to these civil suits, he faces criminal charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution in New York. He is currently in federal custody awaiting trial after being denied bail."
A new poll of young voters shows Harris with a commanding 31 point lead over Trump,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/24/nx-s1-5124957/kamala-harris-donald-trump-young-voters-harvard-youth-poll,2024-09-24T21:28:44Z,"Vice President Harris speaks to student volunteers during a stop at the Community College of Philadelphia during a voter registration training session, in Philadelphia.

President Biden had a young people problem. Vice President Harris may not.

In a new poll from the Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics, Harris holds a 31-point lead over former President Donald Trump among likely voters ages 18 to 29.

The poll, released Tuesday, shows Harris ahead of Trump, 61% to 30%, in a match-up that includes third-party candidates. Among only registered voters, Harris' lead drops slightly, but Trump still trails her by 23 points.

The findings represent a marked improvement for Democrats since Harvard's spring youth poll, which found Biden ahead of Trump by 13 percentage points among likely voters and just seven percentage points among registered voters under 30. At the time, young, left-leaning Americans around the country told NPR they were unhappy with their presidential options.

""This poll reveals a significant shift in the overall vibe and preferences of young Americans as the campaign heads into the final stretch,"" John Della Volpe, the polling director of the Institute of Politics, said in a statement. ""Gen Z and young millennials' heightened enthusiasm signals a potentially decisive role for the youth vote in 2024.""

It's a promising sign for Harris, who is banking on high levels of youth support. Voters under 30 played a decisive role in several key battleground states with tight margins in 2020 and overall voted for Biden by a 24-point margin nationwide.

The latest poll, which surveyed more than 2,000 individuals under 30 from Sept. 4 through Sept. 16, underscores a noticeable shift in engagement after Harris took over the ticket. Political strategists point to spikes in voter registrations in the week Biden dropped out of the race, with the highest numbers coming from young Americans, especially women and women of color.

While it's unclear who those individuals may ultimately vote for, these are groups that tend to vote for Democrats. And that interest, particularly among young women, is reflected in the latest Harvard youth poll.

In the spring poll, young female likely voters sided with Biden over Trump by 22 points, but in this latest survey, their support for Harris is even more pronounced, with a margin of 47 points. Harris also increased support among young men, but at comparatively lower rates. Biden held just a five-point lead in the spring. Under Harris, it's risen to 17 points.

What's more, an increasing amount of young Democrats also say they will definitely vote this fall, moving from 66% in the spring to 74% in this latest survey. Republicans have less interest -- in the spring poll, 64% committed to voting, versus 60% now.

Roughly a third of independents said they would definitely vote, which is a drop from four years ago at this time.

Linked with Harris's rise in enthusiasm following the launch of her presidential campaign was a series of viral internet memes remixing her past comments and speeches. It's a style the campaign went on to embrace in its digital organizing and social media.

Despite the likes and shares, the poll found that half of young Americans feel that memes about Harris had no effect on their opinion of her, and six in 10 also said memes about Trump had no effect on their views of him.

On the issues, the poll found that young Americans continue to trust Trump at higher rates on topics relating to the economy, national security, immigration and the Israel-Hamas war -- but his edge is razor thin at just a few percentage points.

Harris holds wide leads on issues relating to climate change, abortion and education. And despite trailing Trump on certain issues, Harvard researchers argue that Harris has increased trust among voters overall, compared to Biden.

""It's pretty much across the board on every issue,"" said Harvard student Anil Cacodcar, who chairs the Harvard Public Opinion Project. ""We're seeing a move toward Harris."""
Harris says she would support ending the filibuster to bring back 'Roe v. Wade',NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/nx-s1-5123955/kamala-harris-abortion-roe-v-wade-filibuster,2024-09-24T15:02:21Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a campaign rally at the Alliant Energy Center on Sept. 20, in Madison, Wisc.

Vice President Harris says she would support eliminating the filibuster in the U.S. Senate in order to bring back federal protections for a woman's right to an abortion as they existed under Roe v. Wade.

Harris outlined her position during an interview Monday with NPR member station Wisconsin Public Radio, saying that when it comes to the issue of abortion, she believes the Senate should do away with the filibuster rule that requires a 60-vote threshold for most legislation to pass.

""I've been very clear, I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe, and get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do,"" Harris told WPR host Kate Archer Kent.

Harris' comments came as she works to sharpen the distinction between herself and former President Trump on one of the most pivotal issues facing voters in this year's presidential election. And while she has voiced support for ending the filibuster before -- including on the issue of reproductive rights -- it's a topic she has rarely addressed since President Biden's decision to abandon his reelection bid and endorse her instead.

Her message could carry particular weight in Wisconsin, a crucial battleground state where virtually no legal abortions were performed for nearly 15 months in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision in 2022 to strike down Roe.

Harris has blamed Trump for the fall of Roe, saying as recently as Friday that he is the ""architect"" of a health care crisis caused by the Supreme Court's decision in Roe -- a law that Trump's three Supreme Court nominees voted to overturn. In the same speech, she referenced recent reporting from ProPublica about two Georgia women whose deaths, after implementation of the state's new abortion law, were deemed ""preventable"" by a state committee of maternal health experts.

Trump has sought to push back against Harris, telling an audience in Pennsylvania on Monday that ""women will be happy, healthy confident and free"" if he is elected to a second term in office.

""You will no longer be thinking about abortion, it's all they talk about, abortion, because we've done something that nobody else could have done. It is now where it always had to be, with the states and they [sic] vote of the people,"" Trump said.

During her interview, Harris was also pressed on a number of other issues facing Wisconsin voters. On housing, she reiterated her plans to provide $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers, and said she would work with the private sector and home builders ""to build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term.""

Harris said she would reach that goal through a combination of tax credits for builders and eliminating red tape in the construction process.

The vice president was also asked about toxic chemicals known as PFAs that are contaminating drinking water around Wisconsin, and whether she would press for stricter regulations of these chemicals.

Harris said the Biden administration is funding billions in water infrastructure projects around the country in order to clean up drinking water and replace lead pipes. Nearly $2 billion of that funding is going to Wisconsin, she said."
U.S. officials say Russia is embracing AI for its election influence efforts,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/nx-s1-5123927/russia-artificial-intelligence-election,2024-09-23T23:07:59Z,"Russia is the most prolific foreign influence actor using artificial intelligence to generate content targeting the 2024 presidential election, U.S. intelligence officials said on Monday.

The cutting-edge technology is making it easier for Russia as well as Iran to quickly and more convincingly tailor often-polarizing content aimed at swaying American voters, an official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told reporters at a briefing.

""The [intelligence community] considers AI a malign influence accelerant, not yet a revolutionary influence tool,"" the official said. ""In other words, information operations are the threat, and AI is an enabler.""

Intelligence officials have previously said they saw AI used in elections overseas. ""Our update today makes clear that this is now happening here,"" the ODNI official said.

Russian influence operations have spread synthetic images, video, audio, and text online, officials said. That includes AI-generated content ""of and about prominent U.S. figures"" and material seeking to emphasize divisive issues such as immigration. Officials said that's consistent with the Kremlin's broader goal to boost former President Donald Trump and denigrate Vice President Kamala Harris.

But Russia is also using lower-tech methods. The ODNI official said Russian influence actors staged a video in which a woman claimed to be a victim of a hit-and-run by Harris in 2011. There's no evidence that ever happened. Last week, Microsoft also said Russia was behind the video, which was spread by a website claiming to be a nonexistent local San Francisco TV station.

Russia is also behind manipulated videos of Harris's speeches, the ODNI official said. They may have been altered using editing tools or with AI. They were disseminated on social media and using other methods.

""One of the efforts we see Russian influence actors do is, when they create this media, try to encourage its spread,"" the ODNI official said.

The official said the videos of Harris had been altered in a range of ways, to ""paint her in a bad light both personally but also in comparison to her opponent"" and to focus on issues Russia believes are divisive.

Iran has also tapped AI to generate social media posts and write fake stories for websites posing as legitimate news outlets, officials said. The intelligence community has said Iran is seeking to undercut Trump in the 2024 election.

Iran has used AI to create such content in both English and Spanish, and is targeting Americans ""across the political spectrum on polarizing issues"" including the war in Gaza and the presidential candidates, officials said.

China, the third main foreign threat to U.S. elections, is using AI in its broader influence operations that aim to shape global views of China and amplify divisive topics in the U.S. such as drug use, immigration, and abortion, officials said.

However, officials said they had not identified any AI-powered operations targeting the outcome of voting in the U.S. The intelligence community has said Beijing's influence operations are more focused on down-ballot races in the U.S. than the presidential contest.

U.S. officials, lawmakers, tech companies, and researchers have been concerned about the potential for AI-powered manipulation to upend this year's election campaign, such as deepfake videos or audio depicting candidates doing or saying something they didn't or misleading voters about the voting process.

While those threats may yet still materialize as election day draws closer, so far AI has been used more frequently in different ways: by foreign adversaries to improve productivity and boost volume, and by political partisans to generate memes and jokes.

On Monday, the ODNI official said foreign actors have been slow to overcome three main obstacles to AI-generated content becoming a greater risk to American elections: first, overcome guardrails built into many AI tools without being detected; second, develop their own sophisticated models; and third, strategically target and distribute AI content.

As Election Day nears, the intelligence community will be monitoring for foreign efforts to introduce deceptive or AI-generated content in a variety of ways, including ""laundering material through prominent figures,"" using fake social media accounts or websites posing as news outlets, or ""releasing supposed 'leaks' of AI-generated content that appear sensitive or controversial,"" the ODNI report said.

Earlier this month, the Justice Department accused Russian state broadcaster RT, which the U.S. government says operates as an arm of Russian intelligence services, of funneling nearly $10 million to pro-Trump American influencers who posted videos critical of Harris and Ukraine. The influencers say they didn't know the money came from Russia."
We're talking to Nevada voters. Here's what role the state could play in the election,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/nx-s1-5114992/nevada-vote-election-voters-swing-state-trump-harris,2024-09-23T09:06:03Z,"The Arts District in Las Vegas, Nevada on Sept.18, 2024. Krystal Ramirez for NPR hide caption

How Nevada swings on Election Day could tip the 2024 presidential election.

The southwest state -- with two Democratic senators, a Republican governor and a quickly growing population that looks to be politically purplish -- has just six Electoral College votes.

But in the race to reach 270 -- and given how close the race is in other battleground states -- Nevada's handful of votes could deliver The White House to either Vice President Harris or former President Donald Trump.

In the last two presidential elections, 15 of Nevada's 17 counties voted Republican. But the two counties that didn't -- Clark and Washoe -- make up almost 90% of Nevada's population, according to Census data.

The state voted Democrat in recent presidential elections, but not by much. Voter registration for the two main parties are pretty equally split and even more are technically registered as ""Non-Partisan.""

NPR's Morning Edition is reporting from Nevada all week telling stories about the state and its voters.

Of the six states that NPR is visiting that could determine who wins the White House in November -- Georgia, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Pennsylvania -- Nevada has the fewest Electoral College votes.

But that doesn't mean it's the least important state to the candidates.

Jon Ralston, founder and editor-in-chief of the nonprofit news site The Nevada Independent, said there's a surrogate from Harris' team in Nevada ""almost every day.""

For Republicans to win the state, they'll need to focus efforts on the two largest counties, as the 15 smaller counties voted overwhelmingly Republican in recent elections and are expected to do so again.

""While we may not be the deciding state, it's also not impossible,"" Ralston said. ""There are plenty of scenarios where Nevada could decide everything.""

Depending on how other key states vote on Election Day, Nevada could put either Harris or Trump over the 270 mark to win the election.

The state has a hefty chunk of people who haven't chosen a side. Around 40% of registered voters don't identify as either Democrat or Republican -- since many were automatically registered as ""Non-partisan"" when going to the DMV for things such as driver's licenses under a state law that took effect in 2020.

Some of these voters may not know -- or care -- that they're registered to vote, Ralston said. Candidates up and down the ticket will have to find out whether these voters lean left or lean right in order to reach them.

Among Republicans, Ralston said immigration is a big concern, though Nevada isn't a border state.

Democrats hope that an amendment protecting abortion rights that will be on the state ballot will drive their voters to the polls.

There's bipartisan support for protecting abortion rights in the state constitution, according to Joe Schoenmann, host of KNPR's State of Nevada in Las Vegas. Polls show that nearly 70% of Republicans and 90% of Democrats in Nevada oppose criminalizing abortion.

Schoenmann said the economy is top of mind. Most here have experienced cost of living increases since the pandemic.

Nevada also has the highest unemployment out of any state in the country at 5.4% with 6.7% in the Las Vegas area, compared to the national average of 4.2%.

With much of Southern Nevada -- which includes Las Vegas -- living on tips, higher prices ""can really hit home,"" Schoenmann said.

In addition, Nevada is growing fast -- with an estimated 30% of new residents moving from California.

""They're selling their homes in California for large sums of money. So they come here, they are buying homes over the asking price. And they're driving up housing costs,"" Schoenmann reported.

While efforts to build affordable housing for seniors are underway, he said virtually no affordable housing for the rest of the population is being built.

Farther north in Reno, KUNR political reporter Lucia Starbuck said voters are also concerned about the cost of living -- everywhere from the gas pump, grocery store and paying utility bills and child care.

Healthcare access is also a big concern for rural voters. In some parts of the state, residents have to drive over an hour to give birth, to get emergency care or get specialty care, Starbuck said.

Starbuck has spoken with Democrats who are ""afraid to be super public"" about their politics.

""People are wanting to have civil conversations with their neighbors about politics, but really feel that they can't,"" she said.

Across the political spectrum, Schoenmann and Starbuck say Nevada voters are concerned about safeguarding democracy. Democrats have said Trump is a threat to democracy -- especially in his rhetoric after the attack on January 6, 2021 -- and Republicans say the same thing about democrats."
Third-party voters face a tough choice in a tight election,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/22/nx-s1-5113108/third-party-voters,2024-09-22T17:46:52Z,"Voters considering a third-party candidate face the same dilemma every presidential election cycle: should they vote their values and get behind a candidate who likely won't win, or settle and support a Democrat or Republican nominee they see as flawed.

This year, Pope Francis weighed in.

""One must choose the lesser of two evils,"" he said during a news conference on the papal plane in September. He didn't say who -- between Vice President Kamala Harris or Former President Donald Trump -- was less evil. But he did describe both candidates as anti-life, citing Harris' views on abortion and Trump's on immigration.

Still, many voters can't swallow supporting either candidate. Every four years, millions of American support third-party candidates. While their candidates don't win, these voters can be influential in elections with razor-thin margins.

""It's extremely close and the third party candidates, though very low in percentage numbers, are still factors,"" Tim Malloy, polling analyst for the Quinnipiac University Poll, said. ""When you are looking at a race that could be determined by three or four percentage points, or maybe less, they are still there.""

Most polls, including the latest one from NPR/PBS News/Marist, show Trump and Harris locked in a tight race.

Third-party voters are often dedicated to single issues, Malloy said. Topics like abortion, the environment or the war in Gaza ""can determine where they go,"" he said.

GOP's 'messing around on' abortion

John Quinn of Maryland, is a millennial and self described pro-life voter. This year, he plans to vote for the American Solidarity Party -- a Christian democratic political party that opposes abortion rights.

Quinn said he knows candidates Peter Sonski and Lauren Onak -- the ASP's ticket -- will lose, but he says he believes his vote means something.

""If the American Solidarity Party's few votes for a truly pro-life vision are what costs the Republican ticket the election, hopefully in 2028 they take pro-lifers more seriously and aren't messing around on the issue the way they are this year,"" Quinn said.

Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and handed abortion back to the states, reproductive rights have become a galvanizing political position. During the 2022 midterms, voters supported the abortion-rights option on ballot measures in five states -- including Kentucky and Montana, which typically have more conservative voters

Harris has made reproductive rights a key part of her candidacy. Meanwhile, Trump has flip-flopped on his abortion stance. Just last month, he indicated he would vote in favor of an abortion-access amendment in Florida, before later clarifying he'll vote no.

For Quinn, these two options left him no choice but to vote third party.

""I wouldn't even know how to weigh which is the lesser of two evils,"" Quinn said.

It's unclear how many voters Trump stands to lose over his position on abortions, but Onak -- who is the vice presidential candidate on the ASP ticket -- said her campaign has seen an increase in interest.

""After the GOP changed its platform language on abortion, we saw an increase in people reaching out to us, following us on social media, volunteering for the campaign,"" Onak said. ""We saw an increase in donations.""

In July, the Republican Party, in new platform langue, removed references to supporting a national 20-week ban and a constitutional amendment restricting abortion.

Beyond abortion, voters are also struggling with the Republican party's shifting economic and foreign policy position. Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is a self-described ""Reagan conservative"" who supports Ukraine in its war against Russia and believes in the rule of law. He also unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination this cycle.

""I expect to write in a good Republicans name on the ballot,"" Hutchinson said. ""I'm going to stick with my pledge that I'm not going to support a convicted felon [Trump], and that's the reasons for it.""

Several high-profile Republicans, including Trump-era officials, have said they will back Harris, but Hutchinson said he believes many Republicans are in the same position as him: and will write in the name of another candidate.

Green Party 'earned my vote' over war in Gaza

In white text on a black background, Anton Navaso posted a paragraph on Instagram explaining his support for the Green Party's Jill Stein -- and his rejection of both Harris and Trump.

""First and foremost, I'm opposed to both the Republican and Democratic support for the Israeli government's actions in Palestine, and I like that the Green Party is too,"" Navaso said in a phone call while packing up for a move to Seattle.

Navazo voted for Biden in the last election. He has little hope Stein will win in 2024, but said it could matter for 2028.

""If either the Democrats or the Republicans think that the Green Party or a third-party vote is why they lost the election, then I think that the next election cycle, they need to try harder to earn the votes of those people,"" Navazo said.

Roman Fritz, a 20-year-old college student in Wisconsin, said he largely agreed with Navaso, but is conflicted.

""In November, I think I plan to vote for Harris,"" Fritz said pausing. ""I do plan to vote for Harris. However, I'm not going to campaign for Harris. I'm not going to encourage anybody to vote for Harris.""

Fritz was the only delegate from the badger state to vote ""present"" during the nomination of Harris at the Democratic National Convention. And he supports the Green Party's Stein on the issues, but can't stomach a Trump victory .

""I think that the only candidate that could win are Trump or Kamala Harris,"" Fritz said. ""Kamala Harris is the better of the two. My heart definitely, like, isn't fully there just because of the lack of a coherent cease-fire plan"" in Gaza.

Last Thursday, leaders of the ""uncommitted"" movement, a Democratic group that opposes Biden's policy toward Israel and Gaza, said they won't endorse Harris -- but encouraged Americans to vote against Trump.

Hundreds of thousands of voters cast ""uncommitted"" ballots during the Democratic primary in several states -- including Michigan and Wisconsin. Biden was at the top of the ticket then, and while Harris has garnered support from younger more liberal voters, it remains unclear how many will vote against Harris over her support of Israel.

'Wednesday morning' thought experiment

Single-issue voters feeling left in the lurch by both Harris and Trump face a dilemma in an election with high stakes.

Archon Fung, a Harvard political science professor who teaches a course titled Politics and Ethics in Unstable Times -- offered a solution to voters caught in indecision.

""If you're not in a close state, it's probably OK to really vote your values and vote for a third-party candidate,"" Fung said because that vote won't throw the election either way. ""But if you're in a state that is very close Electoral-College wise, then it's a much, much more difficult decision for you.""

Regardless, he said voters have to ""own that choice"" if they cast a ballot for a third-party candidate -- say Stein -- in a swing state like Wisconsin and their least preferred candidate wins -- Trump, for example.

In this case, Fung suggested the voter close their eyes and imagine it's Nov. 6.

""It's Wednesday morning and it's a Trump win in Wisconsin, and Wisconsin is decisive in the Electoral College,"" Fung said. ""What do you say to yourself when you look yourself in the mirror?""

If the answer is ""I'm OK"" -- then vote third party, Fung said. But if your answer is ""what have I done?"", then vote for the best between the major candidates.

""I would like for everyone to kind of run through that thought experiment,"" the Harvard professor said. ""What do I say to myself on Wednesday morning?"""
"The contest in one New Mexico swing district mirrors a larger, anxious electorate",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/20/g-s1-23961/new-mexico-gabe-vasquez-yvette-herrell,2024-09-21T10:08:24Z,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- On a warm Albuquerque evening with the majestic Sandia Mountains in the distance, New Mexico Democratic Congressman Gabe Vasquez is rallying supporters with a chant.

They're using a common Spanish refrain this time of year: ""Si, se puede,"" which translates to ""yes we can.""

The supporters were celebrating the launch of Vasquez's new Albuquerque campaign office. Harley motorcycle riders, military veterans, state politicians and retirees all gathered from different corners of this large district in southern New Mexico, where two of the biggest issues in this election -- immigration and abortion rights -- are at the heart of a tightly-contested U.S. House race.

Democrats and Republicans both think they can win the state's Second Congressional District -- one of the swingiest districts in the country. However, the outcome is anyone's guess for this largely rural corner of the state that has flipped red to blue and back again for more than 50 years.

Vasquez's supporters believe the freshman congressman will be re-elected easily, even as he's facing a tough rematch. Vasquez beat former Republican Congresswoman Yvette Herrell by only by 1,350 votes in 2022.

""The momentum is behind him. He's done an incredible job,"" said state Sen. Antonio ""Moe"" Maestas.

""I think he's probably got a better job this time,"" said Karin Kalodimos, a new resident to the district from Nashville.

""As you can tell by the turnout, people are energized,"" said state Rep. Art De la Cruz.

The Second Congressional District stretches from Albuquerque to the state's borders with Mexico and Texas. Vasquez likes to remind supporters the 2nd is larger than the state of Pennsylvania.

In an interview with NPR following a recent tour of Albuquerque's Real Time Crime Center, Vasquez said he is also bullish about his chances.

""We have worked our butts off to make sure that the people of this district are represented,"" he said. ""I know that there's a lot of national turmoil. But in New Mexico, politics truly are local and in the second district I have shown up for people. I think that's going to come out in the election results.""

Three hours south of Albuquerque at a sports bar in Las Cruces, N.M., Herrell is meeting with Republican supporters

She argues she's poised to avenge her loss against Vasquez since the issues are on her side.

""They want a secure border. They want a better economy. You know, they want safe neighborhoods. They want a good education for their children,"" Herrell told NPR about voters in the community. ""It always seems to be coalescing around those issues in the Second Congressional District.""

Herrell is hitting Vasquez on crime and border issues -- after all, Albuquerque and Las Cruces boast some of the highest crime rates in the country.

And supporters like Rebecca Dow, who is running for the New Mexico state House, says border issues hit different here.

""I know people say every community and every city is a border community now, but we've been living this, we've been living it,"" she said.

That's why Republicans angling to keep control of the U.S. House say this seat is among the top dozen races to flip this cycle.

Still, Herrell's supporters concede there's some headwinds, including Democratic redistricting in 2021 that shifted the district more blue.

Republicans are also hitting Vasquez on past controversies -- including an arrest two decades ago for outstanding traffic tickets before his time in public office.

""Yvette Herrell can run on my traffic tickets and I will run on my record,"" he said.

It marks one of many bitter turns in this fight

And while Republicans think they have the upper hand on the issues, Democrats are outraising and outspending Herrell dramatically.

They've also leaned into crime and border issues, while simultaneously blunting Republican attacks with their own on access to abortion.

""When you are very poor state and you've got people living 200-plus miles from a hospital or a health care provider, it's hard,"" Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said following a recent event with Vasquez.

They joined other state and local officials for the groundbreaking of a new reproductive health clinic

Supporters argue the new facility could be a major lifeline for women in this state and beyond.

It's all part of what makes this a critical race in what Lujan Grisham concedes are challenging political times.

""People are anxious and frustrated and angry at elected officials for a number of valid reasons,"" she said. ""You know, it's hard out there."""
Harris says strict abortion laws lead to 'predictable' suffering for women,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/20/g-s1-23971/harris-abortion-preventable-deaths-georgia,2024-09-20T22:14:28Z,"Vice President Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, speaks during a campaign event Friday in Atlanta. Brynn Anderson/AP hide caption

ATLANTA -- Vice President Harris called former President Donald Trump the ""architect"" of a health care crisis caused by a rollback of access to abortion in various states following the U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.

Speaking in Atlanta Friday, Harris called tougher abortion laws ""immoral"" and slammed Republicans for what she called ""longstanding neglect"" around maternal mortality.

""These hypocrites want to start talking about, 'This is in the best interest of women and children,'"" she said. ""Well, where've you been? ... How dare they? How dare they? Come on.""

As Harris tries to capitalize on the abortion issue on the campaign trail, on Friday she referenced reporting from ProPublica about two Georgia women whose deaths, after the state's new abortion law, were deemed ""preventable"" by a state committee of maternal health experts.

The investigations published this week tell the stories of two women, Amber Thurman and Candi Miller, who died from complications related to seeking abortions in the aftermath of Georgia's strict law that effectively bans most abortions with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.

""There is a word -- preventable -- and there is another word: predictable,"" Harris said. ""And the reality is for every story here of the suffering under Trump abortion bans, there are so many of the stories we're not hearing where suffering is happening every day in our country.""

Trump has touted his nomination of Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the constitutional right to abortion.

Thurman and Miller died from complications that arose after their bodies failed to fully expel all of the fetal tissue after medication abortions, according to records reviewed by ProPublica. Thurman died after doctors waited more than 20 hours to treat an infection; Miller died at home without seeking medical treatment ""due to the current legislation on pregnancies and abortions,"" her family told ProPublica. NPR has not independently confirmed the reporting.

Some anti-abortion groups have pushed back on the characterization of those deaths as tied to abortion laws, blaming the Biden administration's looser regulations around medication abortion instead.

""Amber Thurman and Candi Miller did not die because a law denied treatment,"" Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, said in a statement. The group blamed the administration for lifting safety requirements when it eased access to medication abortion for the deaths, as well as a lack of sufficient medical treatment.

Republicans have also pushed back on Harris' narrative around the women's deaths, with a GOP spokesperson claiming the vice president is spreading ""misinformation.""

""Georgia not only established clear exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother, but also included providing necessary care in the event of a medical emergency,"" Republican National Committee spokesperson Morgan Ackley said in a statement. ""There was no reason that doctors cannot act swiftly to protect the lives of mothers.""

Friday's event comes as the presidential campaign enters its final six-week stretch, with Georgia as one of the swing states likely to decide the winner and as abortion rights continues to be a motivating issue for Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters.

Harris was introduced by Dr. Keisha Reddick, a Savannah OB-GYN who said that tighter abortion restrictions in Georgia and other states are ""putting women's health and lives in peril.""

""I see fear in my patients' eyes,"" she said. ""I see women who have left the state to get the care that they need, and those who are unable to do so. I watch medical students and other physicians avoid coming to our state, who are packing up their lives to move across the country ... [where] they won't face jail time for upholding their oath.""

Reddick said that has left Georgia with fewer health care providers in a state that has one of the worst maternal mortality rates in the country.

Harris also discussed abortion during a campaign event Thursday with Oprah Winfrey in Michigan. She will hold a campaign rally in Madison, Wis., later Friday."
Is Georgia ready to vote for a female president? : Consider This from NPR,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/20/1200551217/georgia-female-president,2024-09-20T21:13:35Z,"A few months ago, it was looking like Donald Trump had Georgia all but locked up.

Then President Joe Biden dropped out of the election, and Vice President Kamala Harris jumped in, saying in one of her first speeches:

""I am very clear: The path to the White House runs right through this state.You all helped us win in 2020, and we're going to do it again in 2024.""

Now Georgia is once again in play for democrats. But the state has never elected a female Governor or a female U.S. senator. Will that fact determine who might win their 16 electoral votes?

Consider This host Mary Louise Kelly sat down with three longtime Georgia residents to hear their thoughts on where their home state could go in this election.

She sat in a cafe in Atlanta this past week with Latrice Cushenberry, Eustacia McCloud Carter and Donna Smith Aranson.

The three women come from different backgrounds, different religions and different races. They range in age from their 50s to their 70s.

What they have in common is they are all backing Kamala Harris for president.

So why are they all in for Harris? To Cushenberry, it's about values, and seeing herself and her family in the candidate.

""She is someone that I have seen repeatedly throughout my lifetime in my grandmother, my mother, my aunts - [a] capable, competent, African American person that basically can get the job done with empathy and compassion,"" she told NPR.

For Aranson, it was a hope for change, as a native Atlantan who has lived through many political cycles in the city, and a rotation of both Republican and Democratic governors.

""When Kamala stepped up, it was like a lightning bolt,"" she said. ""I listened to President Biden as he stepped back and turned the reins over to Kamala. And I said, 'This is it. This has got to be it.'""

For Carter, the choice wasn't so obvious from the very beginning. She first had to move past the fact that she was ready for another term for Biden.

""I wasn't kumbaya and jumping up and screaming when Joe Biden stepped down because I was all in for Joe Biden. I didn't care if we had to put him in a wheelchair, motorized, five oxygen tanks on his back. I was all in [for] Joe Biden,"" she explained.

""It wasn't that I wasn't going to ever vote for Kamala. I knew I was going to vote for Kamala. I'm a staunch Democrat. I fall in line with the party. So she was going to get my vote. She's qualified and not just because she's a woman. She's a qualified individual. Her resume speaks for itself. And, yes, she can be president.""

Harris' campaign hasn't spent much time or energy focusing on the historic nature of her possible presidency.

Aranson says that she thinks it's the right choice.""When she wins - and it's a when, not an if - she will be the president of all the people. And I think she has to appeal to all people, all genders, all religions,"" she said.

""I think the stance on abortion and all of the things that matter to women specifically are strong issues that she backs. And that's not to say that men don't either, but it's feels more personal when it comes from a woman - and a strong woman.""

As for the question of if Georgia can elect a woman to power? Cushenberry says yes - and looks to the younger generations as to why.

""There's a brand-new demographic in this election: the young people who grew up during the age of school shootings. Those children are exhausted. They went through COVID. When they went back to school, there were so many threats. They're ready for change, and I am ready for the change that they are ushering in,"" she said."
10 undecided voters explain why they haven't picked a side in this election,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/19/nx-s1-5118393/undecided-voters-kamala-harris-donald-trump,2024-09-19T09:07:33Z,"People watch the presidential debate between Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump during a debate watch party at Penn Social on Sept. 10 in Washington, D.C. Alex Wong/Getty Images hide caption

Most people have decided who they are going to vote for. Former President Donald Trump is well known and polarizing -- people either love him or hate him. Vice President Harris is famous, but voters say they don't know her as well.

Polls show an incredibly tight race between them, and a handful of swing voters could decide the election, depending on who they vote for or if they decide to stay home.

Only a tiny slice of the electorate is considered persuadable -- anywhere from 6% or less to the low teens.

There were nearly four dozen undecided voters in the NPR/PBS News/Marist poll in the last four months who gave permission to call them back to follow up. To understand their current thinking and motivations, NPR tried them all and got in touch with 10 by phone in the days following the Harris-Trump debate. What we found was notable.

First, the debate was important for Harris. Most who watched said she performed better than Trump. They were not all moved to vote for her as a result, but four who seemed to need a degree of reassurance about Harris are now voting for her or leaning Harris' direction after the debate.

And while undecided voters often have unique reasons for what influences their votes, there was a clear gender divide. All four who say they are now voting for or leaning toward Harris are women. That also reflects the wide gender gap seen in polls between the candidates.

The other six -- one woman and five men -- were a mix. Five said they likely won't be voting for Harris, most citing the economy or immigration as reasons. One other said he is still truly undecided, but said prices are a major concern. Two are leaning toward Trump; another said she aligns more with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.; a self-described progressive said he doesn't like Harris' stance on the war in Gaza; and one other, a conservative, said he might not vote at all.

Many did not want to use their full names; some didn't want us to use any name at all. They cited security concerns. They said in this political environment, they were apprehensive about giving out too much personally identifiable information.

Here's what they had to say:

On the debate, Brady said, ""Kamala [Harris] did a better job articulating her points, obviously.""

He added: ""I don't want to go through another four years of a Trump presidency.""

But his vote is largely contingent on his personal financial situation, and he noted, ""Things have gotten more expensive.""

""I have probably a middle-class income for my family,"" he said, ""and it doesn't feel like it's getting any easier -- even as my wife and I have advanced in our careers.""

Brady said he aligned more with former President Barack Obama, and said he doesn't ""like her policies"" on the economy.

Asked what specifically he doesn't like, he said, ""I can't say I'm super knowledgeable about the specifics, but from a how-our-family-is-feeling standpoint, just not sure.""

Lee did not like how ABC handled the debate, specifically the fact-checking. He felt the moderators ""teamed up on Trump.""

He felt Harris did almost too well, saying it was ""almost like rehearsed."" But he said he ""never got any message from Harris"" and said she ""skirted issues,"" including the Biden administration's ""inability to stop the flow of migrants"" and the economy.

""Trump stuck his foot in his mouth multiple times,"" Lee said, though.

He said he wanted to see Trump, whom he trusts more on the economy, debate again and was unaware that Trump had said he would not do another debate with Harris. When told that, Lee said he was ""disappointed.""

He said he's ""not a big Republican, not a big Democrat."" He voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders, the progressive independent from Vermont, in the 2016 primary and is now leaning toward Trump, independent Cornel West or the Green Party's Jill Stein (not from an environmental standpoint, however, because he thinks the Green New Deal ""went too far"").

""But I don't want to piss away my vote,"" he said, pointing out that he is leaning most toward Trump because of that.

Of the debate, the respondent said, ""I was like, OK, who are these people? They were like bad actors. Kamala, suddenly she was so articulate when it's usually word salad. There was something weird going on there.""

Trump, on the other hand, she said, it was like ""something was in his water,"" and he wasn't his usual self.

She said this of her ideal ticket: ""If RFK [Jr.] was on the ticket with [former Rep.] Tulsi Gabbard [of Hawaii], it would have been a slam dunk for me.""

Of Trump and Harris, she said: ""I am reluctant to vote for Trump, but I have absolutely no confidence about Kamala Harris' ability to do anything about the border at all. We're suffering for it.""

She said she didn't vote in the 2020 election, and that she doesn't trust Trump fully, because he signed the CARES act, a COVID relief bill.

""He is aesthetically lacking,"" she said, laughing, but ""the major Trump haters are missing the whole point. They're not looking at issues; they're looking at personality.""

Proffitt did not see the debate or follow news about it afterward. She said she voted for Trump in 2016 and did not vote for president in 2020. But she is resolved to do so this time.

""I'm going to go out and will vote this year,"" said Proffitt, a mother of five. ""It's a right I should exercise. I want to show my kids that's a right.""

Of the candidates, she said she doesn't know much at this point about Harris' policy positions, but she is leaning her direction because of Trump.

""I feel Trump's disrespect for women is not befitting of a president,"" she said. ""He is not someone I want my girls to look up to as a role model.""

About Harris, she added: ""She's a woman, and maybe having a female president would do the country some good. ... I gave the other guy a try, why not give her a try?""

A Republican and former interior decorator and rancher, Bohlman said she made the switch to vote Democratic when Trump came on the scene.

""No, I have not voted for Trump, nor will I ever,"" Bohlman said. ""I have never been able to stand the guy since he came into the picture years ago. I even took a book away from my 16-year-old son that [Trump] had written about making money. He didn't make his money; he inherited it and lost it. He's not a good businessman. He's not anything but a narcissistic misogynist.""

She was undecided in May, but is now locked in for Harris. She said she saw the debate and thought Harris performed well.

""I will vote Democrat,"" Bohlman said. ""I will vote for Kamala. I liked the way she came across in the debate. She is a very astute, intelligent woman, who knows exactly where she's going. She doesn't hinge her judgment on whether she likes someone or not.""

She went on to cite the overturning of Roe v. Wade abortion protections, which she blames squarely on Trump, as another motivating factor for her to vote for Harris.

""I am so angry about that,"" she said of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision. ""It's so unfair that a bunch of men are making decisions for women. I think it's horrific.""

Bohlman also brought up the siege at the Capitol on Jan. 6, which she said was ""appalling,"" called out GOP leaders' hypocrisy in criticizing Trump initially and then trying to get back in his good graces, and she noted that she has lots of family members who are ""adamantly pro-Trump.""

""They do not look at the whole picture,"" she said of Trump supporters. ""I'm sure after this second [assassination] attempt, they'll be saying, 'God is protecting him.' It's just a bunch of crock.""

Annette is a registered independent who generally votes Democratic. In June, she was undecided if she would vote at all because she was concerned about President Biden's age and ability to do the job.

""I didn't realize how bad he was,"" Annette said after watching Biden in the June 27 debate. ""He lost his oomph. He made Trump look good.""

But now, she is enthusiastically backing Harris.

""I would never vote for him,"" Annette said of Trump. She called herself ""happily surprised, maybe not surprised, but happy with [Harris'] presentation"" at the debate. Annette said Harris proved she's ""perfectly capable.""

Remensnyder is a registered independent, but described herself as a ""Republican at heart.""

""I really liked Nikki Haley,"" Remensnyder said. ""I was hoping she would run [as the Republican nominee].""

The retired audiologist voted for Trump in 2016 and then Biden in 2020. Remensnyder said she owned three doctors' practices. As a business owner, she said, ""I thought I could trust Trump. He was a businessman, but he was an absolute disaster"" from the start, Remensnyder said.

And ""as a medical professional,"" she said she thought ""what he did with COVID was embarrassing.""

But this time around, Remensnyder said she was ""despondent"" at the choice between Biden and Trump. She felt Biden's mental fitness had declined too much to do the job any longer.

""I couldn't trust him to run the government. ... It really scared me,"" she said.

When Harris entered, Remensnyder gave her a shot.

""I watched her,"" she said. ""I listened to her. I am a woman, and women's needs are first, even before party.""

Remensnyder is pro-abortion rights and said she liked how Harris has advocated for women's reproductive freedom, and she liked Harris' experience as a litigator.

Remensnyder said she thought Harris did fairly well in the debate, but ""did not answer most of the questions. She did skirt the issues. I don't think she's the best. I really, really wanted Nikki Haley.""

But she added that she is ""confident"" in Harris' ability to do the job, though not confident she will win because of the clear gender divide she sees. Remensnyder said her husband and son are conservative and tell her they are leaving the presidential line on the ballot blank.

""They can't force themselves to vote Democratic,"" she said.

A college student born in Brazil, he described himself as a progressive whose top issue is the war in Gaza.

""Donald Trump won't get my vote,"" Thiago said, pointing out that Trump's position on the war is a nonstarter.

After Biden dropped out, he was waiting to see what Harris would do, but Thiago said her posture on Gaza ""hasn't been a great one.""

""I'm still undecided whether it's worth it to vote for Kamala, given her not-great stance on Palestine,"" Thiago said, ""and given she's reaching out more to conservatives than more-progressive members of her party.""

He watched the debate and said Trump was ""off the ball in the same way Biden seemed entirely way too old and needing to step aside. Trump seemed to inherit that and seemed rattled by Kamala.""

Even if you're on Trump's side, Thiago said, it was ""obvious"" that ""Trump didn't do great in that debate.""

Thiago said he's still going to vote down-ballot, but short of Harris saying she will cut off weapons shipments to Israel, he likely will leave the presidential line blank.

A registered Republican, Gideon voted for Trump in 2016, but didn't vote for him in 2020 ""because of some of the choices he made."" He didn't specify which ones.

Of Trump and Harris: ""They both have their challenges.""

But he won't be voting for Harris. ""I understand her economic plan,"" he said, ""but her liberalism is a little bit too liberal.""

Gideon added: ""This might be a situation where neither one of them gets my vote.""

John is a registered independent originally from Nassau County, N.Y., and has a blue-collar background as the son of a firefighter. He considers himself a ""liberal union Democrat."" He voted for Obama twice, even volunteered to ""work the phones,"" he said, and thought former President Bill Clinton ""did a great job as president.""

He did not vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 because of a personal experience; she didn't show to an event he was involved with planning. In 2020, he said his son, who was 5 then, essentially cast his ballot for Biden, because he wanted to vote for him.

John said he's not following the current presidential race that much, but did watch ""a little bit"" of the debate. His biggest concerns are housing affordability, groceries and gas prices.

""Trump was cuckoo for saying that the dogs and cats were being eaten,"" John said, ""but Kamala Harris wasn't really answering any of the questions,"" especially about the economy.

John said he wants to see something put forward to ""stop the inflation."" John also doesn't trust Harris (mispronouncing her name as ""Camilla"" at one point) because of her changed positions on things like fracking.

""I think Joe Biden did the best he could,"" John said. ""If he could have just grabbed the horns on inflation -- things are through the roof. ... It's gone freakin' nuts."""

"Abortion providers  --  and patients  --  are on the move, as state laws keep shifting",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/09/17/nx-s1-5114359/abortion-rates-guttmacher-planned-parenthood-ban-states,2024-09-17T13:02:37Z,"Anti-abortion protesters march past the Planned Parenthood in Bloomington, Ind., after the Rally for Life march in January 2023.

Soon after a series of state laws left a Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbia, Mo., unable to provide abortions in 2018, it shipped some of its equipment to states where abortion remained accessible.

Recovery chairs, surgical equipment and lighting from the Missouri clinic -- all expensive and perfectly good -- could still be useful to other health centers run by the same affiliate, Planned Parenthood Great Plains, in its three other states. Much of it went to Oklahoma, where the organization was expanding, CEO Emily Wales said.

When Oklahoma banned abortion a few years later, it was time for that equipment to move again. Some likely ended up in Kansas, Wales said, where her group has opened two new clinics within just over two years because abortion access there is protected in the state constitution -- and demand is soaring.

Her Kansas clinics regularly see patients from Texas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas and even Louisiana, as Kansas is now the nearest place to get a legal abortion for many people in the Southern United States.

Like the shuffling of equipment, America's abortion patients are traveling around the nation to navigate the patchwork of laws created by the Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, which left policies on abortion to the states.

Since that ruling, 14 states have enacted bans with few exceptions, while other states have limited access. But states that do not have an abortion ban in place have seen an 11% increase in clinician-provided abortions since 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a national nonprofit that supports abortion rights. Over 170,000 people traveled out of their own state to receive abortion care in 2023, according to the institute.

Not all of the increase in abortions comes from interstate travel. Telehealth has made medication abortions easier to obtain without traveling. The number of self-managed abortions, including those done with the medication mifepristone, has risen.

And Guttmacher data scientist Isaac Maddow-Zimet said the majority of the overall abortion increase in recent years came from in-state residents in places without total bans, as resources expanded to improve access.

""That speaks, in a lot of ways, to the way in which abortion access really wasn't perfect pre-Dobbs,"" Maddow-Zimet said. ""There were a lot of obstacles to getting care, and one of the biggest ones was cost.""

Last year, the estimated number of abortions provided in the U.S. rose to over 1 million, the highest number in a decade, according to the institute.

Still, abortion opponents hailed an estimated drop in the procedure in the 14 states with near-total bans.

""It's encouraging that pro-life states continue to show massive declines in their in-state abortion totals, with a drop of over 200,000 abortions since Dobbs,"" Kelsey Pritchard, a spokesperson for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, wrote in a statement.

Organizations in states where abortion remains legal feel the ripples of every new ban almost instantly. One Planned Parenthood affiliate with a clinic in southern Illinois, for example, reported a roughly 10% increase in call volume in the two weeks following the enactment of Florida's six-week abortion ban in May. And an Illinois-based abortion fund, Midwest Access Coalition, experienced a similar pattern the day the Dobbs decision was announced in June 2022.

""Our hotline was insane,"" said Alison Dreith, the coalition's director of strategic partnerships.

People didn't know what the decision meant for their ability to access abortion, Dreith said, including whether already scheduled appointments would still happen. The coalition helps people travel for abortions throughout 12 Midwestern states, four of which now have total bans with few exceptions.

After serving 800 people in 2021, the Midwest Access Coalition went on to help 1,620 in 2022 and 1,795 in 2023. Some of that increase can be attributed to the natural growth of the organization, which is only about a decade old, Dreith said, but it's also a testament to its work. It pays for any mode of transportation that will get clients to a clinic, including partnering with another Illinois nonprofit with volunteer pilots who fly patients across state lines on private flights to get abortions.

""We also book and pay for hotel rooms,"" Dreith said. ""We give cash for food and for child care.""

The National Network of Abortion Funds, a coalition of groups that offer logistical and financial assistance to people seeking abortions, said that donations increased after the Dobbs decision and that its members reported a 39% increase in requests for help in the following year. They financially supported 102,855 people that year, including both in-state and out-of-state patients, but they have also seen a ""staggering drop off"" in donations since then.

Increased awareness about the options for abortion care, spurred on by an increase in news stories about abortion since the Dobbs decision, may have fueled the rise in abortions overall, Maddow-Zimet said.

Both sides now await the next round of policy decisions on abortion, which voters will make in November. Ballot initiatives in at least 10 states could enshrine abortion rights, expanding access to abortions, including in two states with comprehensive bans.

""Lives will be lost with the elimination of laws that protect more than 52,000 unborn children annually,"" wrote Pritchard, of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, citing an analysis on the group's website.

In the meantime, Wales said her clinics in Kansas don't have enough appointments to accommodate everyone who reaches out about scheduling an abortion. In the early days after the Dobbs decision, Wales estimated, only 20% of people who called the clinic were able to schedule an abortion appointment.

The organization has expanded and renovated its facilities across the state, including in Wichita, Overland Park and Kansas City, Kansas. Its newest clinic opened in August in Pittsburg, just 30 miles from Oklahoma. But even with all that extra capacity, Wales said her group still expects to be able to schedule only just over 50% of people who inquire.

""We've done what we can to increase appointments,"" Wales said. ""But it hasn't replaced what were many states providing care to their local communities."""
Trump's own version of reality continues to confound political actors and observers,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/13/nx-s1-5111649/trump-fact-check-reality,2024-09-14T09:05:09Z,"Eight years ago this month, Donald Trump announced that he had personally laid to rest the controversy about President Obama's country of origin. He gave himself credit for clearing up any questions that may have arisen because of something, he claimed, Hillary Clinton had said years earlier.

Those familiar with the facts were stunned. They knew the so-called birther conspiracy had been hatched by various Obama opponents to suggest he was ineligible to be president because he had been born not in the U.S. but in Kenya or some other country. It had been kept alive and promoted for years by a variety of Obama critics, including, most prominently, Donald Trump.

It could even be said that Trump had facilitated his transition from TV reality show star (The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice) to bona fide political candidate by exploiting the birther myth.

What Trump was actually announcing in September 2016 was a decision to stop talking about a non-issue he himself had helped sustain for years. But in finally renouncing one falsehood, he insisted on substituting another -- casting himself as a hero of the tale.

Nearly a decade after Trump began running for president we should all be accustomed to his reliance on falsehoods.

But back in 2016, the birther flip-flop seemed to deserve special recognition. It was not just blatant, it was preposterous.

Or so we thought. Surely it would diminish the man even in the eyes of his admirers. And it may have done so, in some cases. But it did not alter his trajectory. He stunned the world a few weeks later by winning the Electoral College vote for president.

It was said in the early Trump years that the media took him literally but not seriously. It's hard to deny that many of us took him too literally and not seriously enough. At the same time, many of Trump's ""base"" voters were said to take Trump seriously but not literally. That worked for him, and those attitudes surely persist in 2024 much as they did in his first two campaigns.

Ten years ago, the media were accustomed to politicians who could be shamed or at least embarrassed over errors of fact and even minor exposures of ignorance. Trump seemed then, and still seems now, quite impervious to either.

Still, the most egregious trait of Trump's campaign was his willingness to state highly consequential claims that were entirely at odds with reality, standing by them when challenged and sailing on -- dismissive or seemingly oblivious to all criticism.

Far from being disqualifying, this feature of the Trump persona presents itself as part and parcel of his appeal.

This week, after a debate with Vice President Harris that he apparently did not take entirely seriously, Trump said he would not debate her again. He said there was no need for a ""third debate"" because he had clearly won the first two. He was including the June 27 debate he had with President Biden, who had been the presumptive Democratic nominee at the time.

Perhaps that was not surprising, as Trump kept Biden in his sights throughout his debate with Harris this week -- name checking Biden repeatedly without naming Harris once.

But what was surprising was Trump's claim to having won both debates. Few would question he won the June 27 meeting with Biden, who seemed so diminished as to be hard to recognize.

But quite the opposite impression prevailed after Trump's match with Harris, who had swept to the Democratic nomination without opposition after Biden's July 18 decision to withdraw.

The first CNN polls after Tuesday's debate showed nearly two-thirds of those who watched thought Harris did better than Trump (even if they were not planning to vote for her). A sizable fraction of Republicans were not willing to say Trump had won the faceoff.

Yet here was Trump, on the afternoon after the debate, telling reporters he was not interested in a rematch with Harris because he had ""won the debate according to every poll -- every single poll, I think.""

In fact, the only polls where Trump won were online polls of self-selected website samples rather than the randomized scientific samples actual pollsters use. One poll Trump cited had him winning 98% to 2%, according to Trump.

Meanwhile, actual polling organizations such as Reuters and YouGov had done their soundings and found Harris the winner in the eyes of a clear majority -- though not as large a majority as CNN's poll. Trump came out on top for just 31% of the respondents in YouGov and 24% in Reuters.

This willingness or compulsion to present claims that are utterly counterfactual has set Trump apart from conventional candidates. It continues to pose a problem for the media and the political community alike -- including conservative media such as Fox News and a sizable portion of the Republican Party itself.

Trump's claims are often expressed in hyperbolic superlatives. Trump insists he had ""the best economy"" and Biden had ""the worst inflation"" ever -- two statements that are easily disproven. The nation's economic growth was stronger for longer under Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, just to name two relatively recent presidents. Inflation was far higher and more sustained in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

But Trump has never been troubled by making such outlandish statements. Moreover, he is rarely satisfied with telling his crowds that yellow is green. It has to be the greenest green there has ever been. It is not sufficient to say up is down, it must be down farther than down has ever been.

The escalating statement of the stupendous is also a specialty. Take, for example, his casual references to the number of immigrants present in the United States illegally. On Tuesday night he started referring to millions, mentioned 21 million, then said it was surely far more than the official government estimate of 11 million. Then he again said it was more like 21 million before adding he thought the figure was ""a lot higher than"" that.

And all this without a shred of actual evidence or even a hint at the source of these wildly disparate numbers.

In the June 27 debate against Biden, the incumbent's stumbles overshadowed Trump's own missteps. But Trump still had his share of howlers. At one point he said illegal immigrants had taken ""110%"" of all the jobs created during the Biden presidency.

That would mean they had taken more jobs than were created, strongly suggesting Trump was not paying much attention to what he was saying. Indeed, as a general rule when he starts spouting statistics, he seems far more interested in what shock they may cause than whether they add up.

There may have been a time this kind of behavior could be dismissed as ordinary political rhetoric, which most Americans expect will contain exaggerations and oversimplifications. It is clear from the polls that whatever Americans think of Trump's relationship to fact, something approaching half of them still plan to vote for him.

Fact-checking has been around for more than a generation, giving newspapers and magazines a chance to offer something different and escape the ""he said, she said"" pattern. In the later decades of the 20th century, most newspapers and big broadcasters were steeped in the values of ""middle of the road"" reporting as media owners sought ever-larger and more diverse audiences.

Stories were considered balanced when different sides were presented with equal weight and respect. Deciding which side was right or more accurate or more worthy was left to the news consumer or voter.

That was never entirely satisfactory, either to the consumer-voter or to the journalists themselves. More and more news outlets turned to ""fact-checks"" or ""fact-checking,"" an effort to find and follow the facts on crime, unemployment, trade, health care, immigration and any other issues that drove the debate.

For some journalists this became a full-time assignment. The Washington Post has used veteran reporter Glenn Kessler as its official guru of fact for many years. The Poynter Institute in Florida, related to the St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times) pioneered Politifact several election cycles ago.

NPR and PBS have been fact-checking debates and other key moments in national campaigns for decades, online and on air. This week, the fact-checking operation in both shops had its hands full.

So when ABC moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis made a few factual corrections during the debate about a particular claim or statement, they were carrying on a custom that has been increasingly common in broadcast journalism.

As they did not see a need to correct as much in what Harris said, their efforts struck many Trump supporters as unnecessary, unfair and evidence of Democratic bias. Trump himself said the debate had been ""3 against 1.""

The anchors' defense was that Harris said nothing to compare with Trump's assertions about states allowing abortion after birth or Haitian immigrants eating people's pets in Ohio.

That's a judgment call, of course, and just the kind that mainstream journalists were once trained to avoid. That they now feel compelled to make those calls has a lot to do with how Trump himself has changed the rules. But it should not be surprising that changes the media have made prompt protest from those who feel abused -- particularly Trump himself.

This entails also the sea change over the use of the three-letter word we were trained as journalists to avoid: lie. We might say a politician was misstating facts or making inaccurate claims. But we could never make the leap of imputing motive. Maybe the pol was just mistaken and sincerely believed his opponent was guilty of this or that accusation. We could say he was wrong, but calling someone a liar was a big deal.

Trump has led to a change in that policy in much of the industry. Even in 2016, some TV anchors were using the word, at least on late-night TV. It has since become quite common for mainstream news organizations to refer to lies and lying.

With his latest portrayal of what happened in the Harris debate in front of 67 million TV viewers this week, Trump once again has thrown down the gauntlet to challenge the fact-checkers and the commentators alike.

Now, even the practice of fact-checking has become controversial, with Trump acolytes questioning what constitutes a fact. We have reached a point where the idea of fact-checking is regarded as polarizing.

And the more we talk about how polarized things have become, the more polarized they get."
An undecided swing state voter watched the debate. It moved the needle,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/11/nx-s1-5107673/undecided-voter-debate-harris-trump,2024-09-11T23:20:20Z,"DUNWOODY, Ga. - A small, but potentially crucial slice of voters remain undecided about the presidential election this fall, including in tossup Georgia. Just outside Atlanta, Cameron Lewellen, a father of three little kids, is one of them.

In 2020, Lewellen voted for Joe Biden. But four years prior, he cast his ballot for Trump. And in the last election, he split his ticket between the Republican candidate for governor and the Democrat running for U.S. Senate. With early voting in 2024 a few weeks away, Lewellen has felt stuck.

""This is tough,"" he says.

Suburban voters like Lewellen have helped shape recent elections in this closely divided state, as some independents and disaffected Republicans drifted from their party in the Trump era. Metro Atlanta's suburbs are also growing and becoming more diverse.

After Biden notched a win by just under 12,000 votes in Georgia, voters in 2022 sent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock back to Washington and reelected Republican Gov. Brian Kemp.

On Tuesday night, Lewellen tuned into the debate in an effort to help crystallize his choice this fall. Lewellen settled into a plush, cream couch across from a big screen TV and a spread of pizzas. On a scratch piece of paper, he wrote in permanent marker the names of the two candidates and drew a line down the middle for his notes.

Lewellen says he soured on Trump as his presidency grew so chaotic, he began to fear for the stability of government, especially after the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol. At this point, Lewellen says he knows who Trump is, but sees Harris as more of a question mark. He has some serious reservations.

""She didn't earn my vote,"" Lewellen says. ""She just was basically anointed because she was the vice president, second in charge.""

And while Lewellen felt Harris got off to a slow start in the debate, declining to directly answer a question on whether Americans were better off financially four years ago, he says he came away encouraged by her proposals to speed the construction of new homes and offer tax incentives for starting a small business. He also says he felt turned off when Trump did not offer any regrets about his conduct on Jan. 6.

""As I think about it, it makes me angry because I think that's crap,"" Lewellen says. ""Take responsibility.""

And when Trump doubled down on his remarks about Harris' race and identity, Lewellen says it stung.

""It's offensive to a lot of us,"" Lewellen says. ""Because you don't wake up deciding to be Black. I'm an African American and I've had people in the past, for me speaking the King's English, ask, 'Why are you talking white?' or whatever.""

Lewellen says while he went into the debate leaning toward Trump, now he says he is more likely to vote for Harris. But he worries about the markets and interest rates and has been searching for a job for the last several months. He notes that the pace of hiring has slowed. Finding something that fits his experience in healthcare and technology has been slow-going. He says if the economy takes a turn for the worse this fall, he will reevaluate his vote again.

""I want a president that's going to be really favorable to small business because that's how I could ultimately leave a legacy for my family. ""But if you're telling me we're going to wake up sometime in October and have a 10 percent slide on the market, I don't think Harris can run from that.""

Lewellen says it is frustrating when people press why he has not made up his mind yet. He says he has always valued carefully studying the issues and learning about a candidate's policies. He thinks both candidates have upsides and drawbacks.

At first thought, Lewellen says the choice has not been gnawing at him. ""You know, day to day, I think about my kids and what we're going to eat and soccer games and baseball."" But reflecting on the debate and the many topics he is thinking about, like the wars in Israel and Ukraine, abortion, affordability and democracy, he reconsidered."

Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump faced off last night over topics including the economy, abortion, foreign policy and immigration. Throughout the debate, Trump's tried to tie Harris to President Biden's record and distance himself from abortion restrictions. Harris tried to define herself to voters as a new and younger leader who cares about them and tie Trump to the overturning of Roe v. Wade and its aftermath. Here are some takeaways from the debate.

A government shutdown looms as Congress must pass a stop-gap spending bill before the end of the month. The House is set to vote today on an opening offer from House Republicans that will begin the negotiations. Republicans want to attach what they call the SAVE Act to the bill, which would require voters to prove citizenship to prevent noncitizens from voting. The partisan bill is drawing opposition from Democrats and some Republicans.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, today on a joint visit with British Foreign Secretary David Lammy. The trip comes hours after the presidential debate, where the candidates had starkly different views on what to do about Ukraine. The country wants the U.S. to lift restrictions on the use of long-range weapons provided by the U.S. to hit military targets in Russia.

Food production and transportation make up as much as one-third of a typical U.S. household's annual contribution to climate change-inducing emissions. An estimated 30% of food produced in the country is wasted. Once it's in landfills, rotting food creates methane -- a potent gas that heats the Earth. Minimizing waste and reducing transportation might have a significant impact on the pollution that causes climate change. One possible better solution: home delivery. That's because with a delivery vehicle, when a driver drops off your groceries they're often also delivering to neighbors during the same run.

For some people the question is almost an insult. How could they forget? For the families of the 2,977 people who died and the tens of thousands of people estimated to have been affected by the smoke, dust, falling debris and trauma, the day marks the end of one life and the beginning of another.

But for other people, especially people born after the 9/11 attacks, who were too young to remember, who lived far away or who have lots of other things to worry about -- the question might feel like a scolding in disguise. How many sad days are people supposed to hold close? How many tragedies?

We are not great with memory in America. We often think other people's memories are too long. We wonder why their ancient hatreds loom so large today. But sometimes it seems as if our memories are too short; we don't understand why pain lingers or why some people can't ""just get over it"" -- whatever ""it"" is.

Maybe there's a middle ground. On a day like 9/11, maybe we could just take a moment to notice the people around us and ask, ""Is this a special day for you? Do you want to talk about it? Did you lose someone? Tell me about that person."""

The debate between Harris and Trump wasn't close  --  and 4 other takeaways,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/11/g-s1-22023/debate-harris-trump-takeaways,2024-09-11T09:06:38Z,"Well, that was different from the June 27 debate between President Biden and Donald Trump.

If that June debate was a five-alarm fire for Democrats that eventually forced Biden from the race, after Tuesday's debate between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's proponents should probably check the temperature in their own house.

What happened - and what could it mean going forward?

Here are 5 takeaways:

The majority of the focus coming into Tuesday was about how Harris would handle her first-ever presidential debate with someone who had been on this stage many times. Could she answer questions about her position shifts, parry attacks from Trump, someone who tries to be the alpha on these stages, could she answer the attack that she's light on policy and could she appear ""presidential""?

She may have seemed nervous at first, but she quickly found her voice and more than acquitted herself well. All of those questions were quickly dispatched:

Trump's team ahead of the debate equated the Republican standard-bearer to boxing great, Muhammad Ali. If he was a boxer, Trump was cut and bleeding in the middle of the fight, and by the end, was TKO'd. Or as a Democratic strategist texted afterward, it was more like Ali vs. Berbick, Ali's last fight, decided unanimously - for Berbick.

Trump made the unusual move for a presidential candidate to go into the spin room after the debate and talk to reporters. That's not something that's normally done when someone has a good debate. That's usually reserved for low-polling primary candidates, who felt they didn't get enough time or attention during the debate.

Coming into the debate, we noted that if Harris is ""able to acquit herself passably, the spotlight and scrutiny should be heavily on Trump.""

That's because Trump did not have a very good debate against Biden in June, but his serious problems - his lack of substance and repeated lies - were overshadowed by Biden's disastrous performance, maybe the worst of any presidential candidate in history.

With a more-than-competent performance from Harris Tuesday, Trump's lies, meandering, conspiracies and often general incoherence was made even more glaring.

He wandered through conspiracies about, not just the election, but also about who is currently president (Joe Biden), the usual about immigrants who (aren't actually) coming from ""mental institutions and insane asylums"" and the newly unusual (and debunked) about immigrants who (are not) ""eating the dogs"" or ""cats.""

Trump got the conspiracy wrong, though, because it was about ducks, not dogs.

Trump even got wrong what the actual facts of Harris' misleading charge that Trump predicted ""a bloodbath"" if the outcome of this election is ""not to his liking.""

""It was a different term,"" Trump said, ""and it was a term that related to energy because they have destroyed our energy business.""

It was the correct term. He did say ""bloodbath"" back in March, but he was talking in the context of Chinese tariffs, the auto industry and a transition to electric vehicles - not ""our energy business.""

It's the very kind of thing that would have had Democrats nervous about their octogenarian former candidate and Republicans ""outraged"" on cable news about Biden's mental state.

Harris had Trump on the defensive from the get-go on the economy (about his tax cuts and tariffs), his jobs record, his handling of the pandemic and Jan. 6. There were times, even on immigration, when Trump decided to address a Harris attack instead of talking about the issue he ostensibly wants to talk most about.

For someone who likes to bill himself a straight shooter, Trump didn't answer questions directly and dumped a greatest hits of lies from this campaign. He declined to say if he wanted Ukraine to win against Russia, wouldn't answer if he had any regrets about his response to the violence on Jan. 6 and he twice refused to say if he would veto a national abortion ban, like his vice-presidential running mate said he would.

In fact, he went out of his way to say essentially that Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance doesn't speak for him in a clumsy and meandering way that led him to student loans:

""Well, I didn't discuss it with JD in all fairness. JD- And I, I don't mind if he has a certain view, but I think he was speaking for me, but I really didn't. Look, we don't have to discuss it, because she'd never be able to get it, just like she couldn't get student loans. They couldn't get student loans. They didn't even come close to getting student loans. They taunted young people and a lot of other people that had loans. They can never get this approved. So it doesn't matter what she says about going to Congress. So wonderful, let's go to Congress, do it.""

Never mind that Republicans in Congress would not act to help relieve student loans or that Republican-led states sued to end Biden's executive action on student-loan forgiveness. But Trump was digging the hole even deeper for himself on abortion rights.

""I did a great service in doing it,"" Trump said about the overturning of Roe. ""It took courage to do it. And the Supreme Court had great courage in doing it. And I give tremendous credit to those six justices.""

Nearly two-thirds have said they opposed the overturning of Roe.

Trump was also outside the mainstream of public opinion in talking about the Affordable Care Act. He called it ""lousy"" and ""not very good today"" when record numbers of people have a favorable opinion of it.

Trump's best attack was probably this:

""She's gonna do all these wonderful things,"" he said. ""Why hasn't she done it? She's been there for three and a half years. They've had three and a half years to fix the border. They've had three-and-a-half years to create jobs and all the things we talked about. Why hasn't she done it?""

But a coherent attack line was rare from Trump Tuesday night. And even this one was nearly a concession.

CNN said it was going to leave the fact checking to the candidates during the June debate between Trump and Biden.

ABC took a different approach. Moderators David Muir and Lindsay Davis interjected with fact checks four times - all were of Trump.

That was not a reflection of bias; it was because of just how many things Trump said there were blatantly false, like on crime statistics, the dogs and cats conspiracy and the 2020 election.

They did it with a mild, but clear tone and maintained control of the debate throughout the evening, getting to lots of topics and not letting either candidate run over them.

Their approach was notable, particularly with viewership expected to be high. When he went to the spin room, Trump added to his pile of grievances, claiming the debate was ""very unfair"" and called it ""three on one.""

Harris arguably handled Trump better than anyone has at a debate, whether it was Hillary Clinton in 2016 or Joe Biden in 2020 - even though most concluded that Clinton and Biden won most, if not all, of those face-offs.

Since getting into this shortened campaign, Harris has done pretty much everything right. She's tacked to the middle, raised more than half-a-billion dollars, staffed up and opened field offices across the swing states, fired up the Democratic base and now even out-debated Trump.

But the political reality is Harris could still lose.

Trump has a strong and devoted base, and the seven swing states - Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada - are more conservative than the country at large.

People still are more pessimistic than optimistic on the economy, even if that's improved some lately, and polls, including the NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll out Tuesday, have shown people trust Trump to handle the economy, immigration and the war in the Middle East more than Harris.

Could this debate have changed some minds? Maybe. But views of Trump have been ingrained. This race is very much a coin flip, according to the polls, and that's unlikely to change very much even after this debate, because of how hyper-polarized this country is."
Fact checking the Donald Trump-Kamala Harris presidential debate,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/11/g-s1-21932/fact-check-trump-harris-presidential-debate-2024,2024-09-11T05:09:30Z,"Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump faced off in their first -- and possibly only -- debate of the 2024 campaign Tuesday, taking questions on key issues like the border, the economy and abortion.

With the candidates virtually tied in the polls, and just 55 days until Election Day, Trump and Harris sought to define their visions for America in front of a national audience, and deflect attacks from the other side.

NPR reporters fact-checked the candidates' claims in real time. Here's what they found:

TRUMP: ""I had no inflation, virtually no inflation. They had the highest inflation, perhaps in the history of our country, because I've never seen a worse period of time. People can't go out and buy cereal or bacon or eggs or anything else.""

Inflation soared to a four-decade high of 9.1% in 2022, according to the consumer price index. While inflation has since fallen to 2.9% (as of July), prices -- particularly food prices -- are still higher than many Americans would like.

Other countries have also faced high inflation in the wake of the pandemic, as tangled supply chains struggled to keep pace with surging demand. Russia's invasion of Ukraine also fueled inflation by driving up energy and food prices worldwide.

Government spending in the U.S. under both the Biden-Harris administration and Trump also may have contributed, putting more money in people's pockets and enabling them to keep spending in the face of high prices.

While high prices are a source of frustration for many Americans, the average worker has more buying power today than she did before the pandemic. Since February 2020 (just before the pandemic took hold in the U.S.) consumer prices have risen 21.6% while average wages have risen 23%.

Many prices were depressed early in the pandemic, however, so the comparison is less flattering if you start the clock when President Biden and Vice President Harris took office. Since early 2021, consumer prices have risen 19.6% while average wages have risen 16.9%. Wage gains have been outpacing price increases for over a year, so that gap should eventually close.

-- NPR economics correspondent Scott Horsley

HARRIS: ""Donald Trump left us the worst unemployment since the Great Depression.""

At the height of the Great Depression in 1933, the national unemployment rate was near 25%, according to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library.

At the start of the COVID pandemic, the unemployment rate peaked at 14.8% in April 2020, a level not seen since 1948, according to the Congressional Research Service.

But by the time Trump left office, unemployment had fallen to a lower, but still elevated level. The January 2021 unemployment rate was 6.3%.

-- NPR producer Lexie Schapitl

TRUMP: ""You see what's happening with towns throughout the United States. You look at Springfield, Ohio, you look at Aurora in Colorado. They are taking over the towns. They're taking over buildings. They're going in violently. These are the people that she and Biden let into our country, and they're destroying our country. They're dangerous. They're at the highest level of criminality, and we have to get them out.""

Trump attacked Harris and Biden's records on immigration, arguing that they're failing to stem people from other countries from entering the U.S. and causing violence.

In the last two years, more than 40,000 Venezuelan immigrants have arrived in the Denver metro area. And it is true that many now live in Aurora.

A few weeks ago, a video of gang members in an Aurora, Colo., apartment building had right-wing media declaring the city's takeover by Venezuelan gangs. NPR looked into these claims.

Shortly after the video appeared, Colorado's Republican Party sent a fundraising letter claiming the state is under violent attack, and Venezuelan gangs have taken over Aurora.

It's also true Aurora police have recently arrested 10 members of a Venezuelan gang called Tren de Aragua. But Aurora's interim police chief, Heather Morris, says there's no evidence of a gang takeover of apartment buildings in her city.

What's more, violent crime -- including murder, robbery and rape -- is way down nationwide, according to the most recent data from the FBI. Notably, analysts predict violent crime rates this year will fall back down to where they were before they surged during the pandemic, and may even approach a 50-year low.

Trump also claims that migrants are driving up crime rates in the U.S. That is not true. Researchers from Stanford University found that since the 1960s, immigrants have been 60% less likely to be incarcerated than people born in the U.S. The CATO Institute, a libertarian think tank, found undocumented immigrants in Texas were 37% less likely to be convicted of a crime.

TRUMP: ""In Springfield, they're eating the dogs. The people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating the pets of the people that live there.""

This remark refers to a debunked, dehumanizing claim that Haitian migrants living in Springfield, Ohio, are abducting pets and eating them.

The claim, which local police say is baseless, first circulated among far-right activists, local Republicans and neo-Nazis before being picked up by congressional leaders, vice presidential candidate JD Vance and others. A well-known advocate for the Haitian community says she received a wave of racist harassment after Vance shared the theory on social media.

The Springfield News-Sun reported that local police said that incidents of pets being stolen or eaten were ""not something that's on our radar right now."" The paper said the unsubstantiated claim seems to have started with a post in a Springfield Facebook group that was widely shared across social media.

The claim is the latest example of Trump leaning into anti-immigrant rhetoric. Since entering the political arena in 2015, Trump accused immigrants of being criminals, rapists, or ""poisoning the blood of our nation.""

TRUMP: ""A lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, [Democrats] are trying to get them to vote.""

It is illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, and there is no credible evidence that it has happened in significant numbers, or that there is an effort underway to illegally register undocumented immigrants to vote this election.

Voter registration forms require voters to sign an oath -- under penalty of perjury -- that they are U.S. citizens. If a noncitizen lies about their citizenship on a registration form and vote, they have created a paper trail of a crime that is punishable with jail time and deportation.

""The deterrent is incredibly strong,"" David Becker, executive director of Center for Election Innovation and Research, told NPR.

Election officials routinely verify information on voter registration forms, which ask registrants for either a driver's license number or the last four of social security numbers.

In 2016, the Brennan Center for Justice surveyed local election officials in 42 jurisdictions with high immigrant populations and found 30 cases of suspected noncitizens voting out of 23.5 million votes cast, or 0.0001%.

Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger launched an audit in 2022 that found fewer than 1,700 suspected noncitizens had attempted to register to vote over the past 25 years. None were able to vote.

TRUMP: ""[Harris] was the border czar. Remember that she was the border czar.""

Republicans have taken to calling Harris the ""border czar"" as a way to blame her for increased migration to the U.S. and what they see as border security policy failures of the Biden administration.

There is no actual ""border czar"" position. In 2021, President Biden tasked Harris with addressing the root causes of migration from Central America.

The ""root causes strategy ... identifies, prioritizes, and coordinates actions to improve security, governance, human rights, and economic conditions in the region,"" the White House said in a statement. ""It integrates various U.S. government tools, including diplomacy, foreign assistance, public diplomacy, and sanctions.""

While Harris has been scrutinized on the right, immigration advocates have also criticized Harris, including for comments in 2021 where she warned prospective migrants, ""Do not come.""

TRUMP: ""It's execution, no longer abortion. ... You could do abortions in the seventh month, the eighth month, the ninth month, and probably after birth.""

As ABC News anchor Linsey Davis mentioned during her real-time fact check, there is no state where it is legal to kill a baby after birth. A report from KFF earlier this year also noted that abortions ""after birth"" are illegal in every state.

According to the Pew Research Center, the overwhelming majority of abortions -- 93% -- take place during the first trimester. Pew says 1% take place after 21 weeks. Most of those take place before 24 weeks, the approximate timeline for fetal viability, according to a report by KFF Health News.

A separate analysis from KFF earlier this year noted that later abortions are expensive to obtain and offered by relatively few providers, and often occur because of medical complications or because patients face barriers earlier in their pregnancies.

""Nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion. That isn't happening; it's insulting to the women of America,"" Harris said.

Harris also invoked religion in her response, arguing that ""one does not have to abandon their faith"" to agree that the government should not control reproductive health decisions.

As Davis also noted, Trump has offered mixed messages about abortion over the course of the campaign. He has bragged about his instrumental role in overturning Roe v. Wade, while appearing to backpedal on an issue that polling makes clear is a liability for Republicans.

TRUMP: The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan ""was one of the most incompetently handled situations anybody has ever seen.""

Trump and Republicans in Congress say President Biden is to blame for the fall of Kabul to the Taliban three years ago, and the chaotic rush at the airport where 13 U.S. troops died in a suicide bomb attack that killed nearly 200 Afghan civilians trying to flee. Of late, Republicans have been emphasizing Harris' role. But the Afghanistan war spanned four U.S. presidencies, and it's important to note that it was the Trump administration that signed a peace deal that was basically a quick exit plan.

Trump regularly claims there were no casualties in Afghanistan for 18 months under his administration, and it's not true, according to Pentagon records.

HARRIS: ""There is not one member of the military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world for the first time this century.""

This is a common administration talking point, and it's technically true. But thousands of troops in Iraq and on the Syrian border are still in very dangerous terrain. U.S. troops died in Jordan in January on a base that keeps watch over the war with ISIS in Syria.

-- NPR veterans correspondent Quil Lawrence

HARRIS: ""I will not ban fracking. I have not banned fracking as vice president United States, and in fact, I was the tie-breaking vote on the inflation Reduction Act which opened new leases for fracking.""

When she first ran for president in 2019, Harris had said she was firmly in favor of banning fracking -- a stance she later abandoned when she joined President Biden's campaign as his running mate.

In an interview with CNN last month, Harris attempted to explain why her position has changed from being against fracking to being in favor of it.

""What I have seen is that we can grow, and we can increase a clean energy economy without banning fracking,"" Harris told CNN's Dana Bash.

Under the Biden/Harris administration, the U.S. produced a record amount of oil last year -- averaging 12.9 million barrels per day. That eclipsed the previous record of 12.3 million barrels per day, set under Trump in 2019. 2023 was also a record year for domestic production of natural gas. Much of the domestic boom in oil and gas production is the result of hydraulic fracturing or ""fracking"" techniques.

In addition to record oil and gas production, the Biden-Harris administration has also coincided with rapid growth of solar and wind power. Meanwhile, coal has declined as a source of electricity.

TRUMP: ""I had a choice to make: Do I save [the Affordable Care Act] and make it as good as it can be, or do I let it rot? And I saved it.""

During his presidency, Trump undermined the Affordable Care Act in many ways -- for instance, by slashing funding for advertising and free ""navigators"" who help people sign up for a health insurance plan on HealthCare.gov. And rather than deciding to ""save"" the ACA, he tried hard to get Congress to repeal it, and failed. When pushed Tuesday on what health policy he would put in its place, he said he has ""concepts of a plan.""

The Biden administration has reversed course from Trump's management of the Affordable Care Act. Increased subsidies have made premiums more affordable in the marketplaces, and enrollment has surged. The uninsurance rate has dropped to its lowest point ever during the Biden administration.

The Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010 and is entrenched in the health care system. Republicans successfully ran against Obamacare for about a decade, but it has faded as a campaign issue this year."

In Tuesday's presidential debate, former President Donald Trump again falsely claimed that Democrats support abortions ""after birth"" and ""executing"" babies.

It's an attack line Trump has used repeatedly to paint Democrats as radical on issues of reproductive rights. But as ABC News anchor Linsey Davis mentioned during her real-time fact check, there is no state where it is legal to kill a baby after birth. A report from KFF earlier this year also noted that abortions ""after birth"" are illegal in every state.

""Nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion. That isn't happening; it's insulting to the women of America,"" Vice President Kamala Harris said on the debate stage Tuesday.

Trump was apparently referring to a statement by former Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, who is also a pediatric neurologist. Northam faced controversy in 2019 over his response to a question about how to care for an infant born with fatal complications.

As Davis also noted, Trump has offered mixed messages about abortion over the course of the campaign. He has bragged about his instrumental role in overturning Roe v. Wade, while appearing to backpedal on an issue that polling makes clear is a liability for Republicans."

This story first appeared in NPR's live blog of the presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Follow along for live updates, fact checks and analysis.

Vice President Kamala Harris quickly attacked former President Donald Trump on his association with the architects of Project 2025 in the presidential debate on Tuesday night.

""I'm going to tell you on this debate tonight, you're going to hear from the same old tired playbook, a bunch of lies, grievances and name-calling,"" Harris said in the first few minutes of the debate.

""What you're going to hear tonight is a detailed and dangerous plan called Project 2025 that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected to again.""

Trump found himself again seeking to defend and distance himself from Project 2025, the controversial plan drafted by the Heritage Foundation to overhaul the U.S. government. For weeks, Trump has been dogged by his relationship to those who drafted the 900-page, pro-Trump plan that calls for mass deportations, eliminating the Department of Education, imposing stricter controls on abortion and slashing climate protections.

""Number one, I have nothing to do -- as you know and as she knows better than anyone -- I have nothing to do with Project 2025,"" Trump said. ""That's out there. I haven't read it. I don't want to read it purposely. I'm not going to read it.""

Democrats have repeatedly sought to tie Trump to the most controversial aspects of the plans.

Allies got involved. Actress Taraji Henson brought it up at the BET awards, adding fuel to the fire.

It was also a big part of the Democratic National Convention, with comedian Kenan Thompson carrying out a cartoon-size version of Project 2025 to make fun of Trump and the effort.

It is true that the Trump campaign did not draft Project 2025. But those involved in the policy proposals include loyalists and allies of Trump, and former Trump officials.

These officials are likely to be candidates in a second Trump administration."
Opinion | Republicans are trying to rebrand as something than anti-abortion. Don't buy it.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/anti-abortion-republicans-rebrand-2024-election-rcna174079,2024-10-12T11:58:49Z,"The GOP knows being anti-abortion is a loser with voters, so they're throwing up all kinds of distractions to obscure their positions.

In an election year full of unrelenting twists and turns, Republicans have added yet another unexpected plot twist: They are trying to rebrand as ""pro-choice.""

In television ads and op-eds and on social media, Republicans in close contests are trying to proclaim a sudden change of heart on reproductive health care positions like abortion, IVF and birth control -- mere weeks away from Election Day. But Republicans' extremist agenda hasn't changed. They've just read the polls.

Abortion is now the single most important issue to young female voters, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll, and a recent Gallup Poll found a record-high 32% of Americans say they will vote only for candidates who share their views on the issue.

Protecting abortion has been one of the largest factors driving voter turnout in every election since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022. Republicans spent years orchestrating how to take this very right away from women, even as Americans' majority support for abortion has only continued to grow.

It's a miscalculation that has Republican candidates terrified about their political prospects in November. They know they can't win without distorting and obfuscating their anti-abortion agenda. So now, their only way into office is to deceive the American people. Even when the party officially adopted the policy of ""leave it to the states,"" it left loopholes that, as The Washington Post notes, leave ""open a path to legislation or court decisions that would grant fetuses additional legal rights."" But the truth is, these extremist Republicans don't have a branding problem; they have an agenda problem.

Sen. JD Vance demonstrated this strategy at the vice presidential debate, attempting to temper his extreme beliefs and feign being moderate to voters. Vance tried to claim that he has never supported a national abortion ban, despite having done so while also defending state laws that made no exception for rape or incest. (He even admitted to CNN in late 2023 that his party wanted to go where Americans wouldn't follow, saying, ""We have to accept that people do not want blanket abortion bans."") He said he supports fertility treatments for families after he voted in the Senate against protections for IVF. And he denied that a Trump-Vance administration would monitor women's pregnancies nationwide, despite Republicans' already having Project 2025's full-blown playbook for how to force states to report women's miscarriages and abortions to the federal government.

The same sorry tactic is being used by his Republican allies across the ballot, like Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, who ran ads declaring he would always protect access to IVF less than one day after he voted against IVF protections. Or Republican Maryland Senate nominee and former governor Larry Hogan, who is newly labeling himself ""pro-choice."" But records don't lie: As the governor of Maryland, he vetoed a law that would have expanded abortion access across the state and withheld millions of dollars that were allocated to train new abortion providers. It's sad, deceptive and plain anti-democratic.

The rise of the ""pro-choice"" Republican is not only a myth; it's also a losing strategy.

I've seen it fail firsthand. In the 2022 midterms, Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin spent millions trying to conceal his party's anti-abortion record and worked overtime to rally extremists around a ""moderate"" 15-week ban, only for voters to reject his Trojan horse unequivocally. Instead, they turned out to elect Democratic majorities to both chambers of the Virginia General Assembly. We worked closely with the Democratic pro-choice women who helped secure those majorities. We saw that voters weren't buying it. They knew that Republicans, if given the power, would quickly restrict access to abortion across the state.

Now more than ever, voters see through such thinly veiled attempts to mislead them.

A growing number of Americans know exactly what's at stake for our reproductive rights if Republicans win power in November. Recent research by EMILYs List -- which advocates to get pro-choice Democratic women elected -- found that while just 20% of battleground voters believed Roe would be overturned before it happened, a majority (57%) now believe that Republicans intend to pass a national abortion ban if given the opportunity. (The margin of error is +/- 2.5 percentage points.)

We can't trust what Republicans say; we can trust only what they've shown us. And everywhere you look -- their voting records, financial records, old interviews and audiotapes -- their real goal is apparent: devastating care against the will of the American people.

The stakes of this election are too high. With our freedoms on the line, Americans need and deserve one basic thing: elected officials they can trust. With leaders like Kamala Harris, we don't have to sift through ever-changing, contradictory stances on abortion -- because she has never wavered in her belief in a woman's right to choose, and she has the record to prove it."
Health experts say a second Trump term might make Americans sick  --  literally,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-public-health-proposals-covid-rcna175085,2024-10-11T21:36:05Z,"Former health official Rich Bright served under Donald Trump and warned about the dangers of a second MAGA term. He's not the only health expert speaking out.

Former Trump administration health official Rick Bright published an op-ed in The New York Times warning of the nightmarish public health scenarios likely to unfold if Donald Trump is elected president again.

Bright ought to know. He was head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency in the Health and Human Services Department but became a whistleblower in 2020 to sound the alarm on the Trump administration's mismanagement of the Covid pandemic.

In light of new and disturbing reporting about Trump giving Covid test machines to Russian President Vladimir Putin that year, Bright's warnings about the potential destruction of health institutions in a second Trump term deserve attention. As he writes, Trump would be empowered to undermine public health measures even more than he did the first time if he retakes the White House. And he has a playbook to do just that.

Bright writes:

Bright explains what that could look like in practice:

This topic -- about what public health would look like under a second Trump term -- has been on my mind since the height of the pandemic, when thousands of Americans died monthly amid Trump's arrogance and willful ignorance. And, as Bright mentioned, the threat of Trump implementing Project 2025, the far-right plan to pack the government with MAGA stooges, looms large over the health world with weeks to go until Election Day.

That's why I recently chatted with Drs. Chris Pernell and Regina Davis Moss, two public health professionals who discussed what's at stake in this election regarding Americans' health and well-being. Pernell is the director of the NAACP's Center for Health Equity, while Moss is the president and CEO of ""In Our Own Voice,"" an organization that prides itself on leading the ""National Black Women's Reproductive Justice Agenda.""

Together, as part of the ReidOut's ongoing coverage of Project 2025, we discussed abortion surveillance, anti-trans crackdowns, the health impact of hypermasculinity, the war on health equity, and the various ways conservatives' far-right agenda for a second Trump term could make Americans sick ... in more ways than one.

The guy who wrote Texas' most infamous abortion law just quietly settled his test run,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/texas-abortion-law-jonathan-mitchell-silva-rcna175032,2024-10-11T21:35:56Z,"Jonathan Mitchell enabled private parties to sue anyone who facilitates an abortion. But his test case might have collapsed when an appeals court blocked his subpoena to the woman whose abortion was at issue.

In May 2021, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed his state's version of a ""heartbeat"" ban, forbidding nearly all abortions after six weeks -- but with a twist. The Texas bill, as The New York Times reported, also empowered ""any private citizen to sue doctors or abortion clinic employees who would perform or help arrange for the procedure.""

Left unsaid was that private citizens, rather than law enforcement or other state officials, would be the only people who could enforce the ban. By empowering private actors to enforce the ban, the thinking went, abortion providers and other prospective plaintiffs couldn't sue the state to prevent its enforcement; instead, anyone and everyone could be a prospective plaintiff, and state officials would have no role at all.

That ""bounty hunter"" feature of the law -- designed specifically to circumvent judicial review -- was the conceptual brainchild of a then-relatively unknown conservative lawyer, Jonathan Mitchell, whose admirers have praised him as a ""technical magician."" And it worked. S.B. 8 took effect in September 2021, despite providers' petition to the Supreme Court to stay its implementation. It then survived a more thorough Supreme Court review months later.

Of course, S.B. 8 has never produced an onslaught of litigation, nor did anyone expect it to. The fear of being sued (not to mention the potential liability) was the whole point. And that worked too, effectively ending abortion services in Texas even before Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022.

Since then, Mitchell, who clerked for the late Justice Antonin Scalia and served as Texas' solicitor general, has become something of a conservative legal hero. In February, through a methodical, ""buttoned-down presentation,"" he convinced the Supreme Court to rule unanimously that former President Donald Trump should not be disqualified from appearing on Colorado's presidential primary ballot, thereby overturning the Colorado Supreme Court's interpretation of Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment.

But Mitchell's most notorious case has ended with far less fanfare. In March 2023, Mitchell decided to test the bounty hunter provision by filing a lawsuit in Galveston County court on behalf of Marcus Silva, who had divorced his ex-wife, Brittni, just the month prior. Silva alleged Brittni had undergone a medication abortion during their marriage with the help of two friends, one of whom obtained abortion pills from a third woman. Silva sued all three women -- but not his ex-wife, who is immune from liability under the Texas statute -- alleging they caused the wrongful death of his child and conspired ""to murder Baby Silva with abortion pills."" And Silva sought more than $1 million in damages from each of them.

Further, Silva attached to his complaint screenshots of text exchanges between and among his ex-wife and the defendants. Those text chains included discussions of how and where to obtain the pills, when to take them and even how to ensure Silva never found out about her pregnancy or the abortion.

Within weeks of Mitchell's opening legal salvo, Brittni Silva's friends sued him too, charging that her ex-husband had invaded their privacy. Despite the defendants' counterpunch, Marcus Silva's suit shocked even pro-abortion advocates familiar with Mitchell's track record. Legal commentators Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern, for instance, remarked that by representing Silva, Mitchell seemed to have twin aims: ""to set a precedent that helps isolate pregnant people through terror and surveillance"" -- or what they called ""spousal abuse via lawsuit"" -- and ""to make it clear that anyone offering advice about abortion may be bankrupted in a court of law.""

But on Oct. 10, on the eve of a trial, Mitchell filed papers to terminate the case ""with prejudice,"" meaning Silva cannot refile his suit. Mitchell's co-counsel, Briscoe Cain, told The Washington Post ""the parties have executed a settlement agreement and all claims and counterclaims have been dismissed""; a court filing confirms ""the parties' agreed resolution."" Mitchell declined MSNBC's request for comment.

Exactly what was behind the decision to settle is unclear, but the progress of the case gives some clues. In April, a Texas appeals court ruled that Marcus could not force Brittni to turn over communications relating to her abortion, including with the defendants. The court noted that his complaint alleges she violated ""numerous state and federal criminal laws,"" including the Comstock Act of 1873, which prohibits the mailing of anything ""intended for producing abortion."" Even though the Biden administration does not interpret Comstock broadly as prohibiting the mailing of abortion medication, the court reasoned that to compel her to produce the communications at issue could violate her constitutional rights, notably her right against self-incrimination.

Mitchell then appealed to the Texas Supreme Court, which denied the petition in June in a three-sentence order. One justice of that court, in a concurring opinion, called out Silva's ""disgracefully vicious harassment and intimidation of his ex-wife Brittni during the course of their marriage's demise and during this litigation,"" noting that his ""atrocious treatment"" of her made him a ""particularly unsuitable beneficiary of this Court's discretionary"" powers. (Among other things, The Washington Post reports, ""Silva's ex-wife shared with the court transcripts of recordings of the verbal abuse she said she experienced from Silva ahead of the lawsuit being filed, including threats to persecute her if she didn't have sex with him and do his laundry."")

And finally, we know that earlier this week, the trial judge refused Silva's request to delay trial, which was scheduled to begin on Oct. 14.

Neither Silva nor his lawyers have explained publicly why they backed down, but without Brittni's communications, it may be that they simply lacked the evidence to win at trial. Meanwhile, one of the defendants told the Post ""[t]here was no money exchanged in connection with"" the settlement.

And the ultimate irony? Despite losing her constitutional right to abortion, a woman's other constitutional rights may have prevented the guy who wrote the country's most infamous abortion ban from enforcing it in court."
Opinion | Kamala Harris' chat on 'Call Her Daddy' shouldn't have been such a big deal,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-call-her-daddy-interview-media-rcna175070,2024-10-11T19:48:05Z,"Countless outlets have popped up to stoke the misogyny and racism of young white men as feminist media has suffered.

Vice President Kamala Harris went on a media blitz this week, visiting CBS's The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, ""The Howard Stern Show""on SiriusXM radio, CBS's ""60 Minutes"" and ABC's ""The View."" Harris unveiled a smattering of new policy proposals as well, including an idea to cover long-term care under Medicare, which would ease the burden on middle-aged women who often serve as the primary caretakers for aging parents.

While those visits, with the exception of Stern's, were fairly par-for-the-course appearances by a presidential candidate looking for low-pressure interviews designed to hit fairly low-information voters, it was Harris' appearance on the hit podcast ""Call Her Daddy,"" followed by 5 million mostly Gen Z female listeners, that garnered the most attention from her critics.

In her interview with podcast host Alex Cooper, Harris talked in depth about women's issues like abortion, a topic Cooper said in a pre-interview video that she felt most comfortable asking about. The interview was friendly, and at times, poignant, with Harris recounting how a high school friend's story of sexual abuse once inspired her to seek the job as California's top prosecutor. At another point, the two talked about what young women should do when they are being sexually assaulted.

Some political commentators, however, felt that, with that appearance, Harris was showing a reluctance to move away from friendly ground during an election that has seen an extreme gender split among young voters. New York Post columnist Kirsten Fleming called the interview a ""joke,"" saying, ""it is a safe spot for Harris -- who has been showered with soft-focus media features and fawning takes on her cooking and clothing -- to once again be treated like a glittering celebrity.""

Personally, I think we missed getting more substantive, in-depth policy questions that more experienced journalists at others would have asked. You can't deny the reach of the ""Call Her Daddy"" audience, but someone more familiar with the finer points of abortion or sex discrimination policy could have perhaps extracted more detailed responses from Harris. But then again, I can't fault Harris for going on a show so popular with young women.

According to a Harvard Institute of Politics poll, Harris leads overall among voters under 30, 61% to 30%, but a quick look at the gender split tells a more interesting story. Among young women, the poll shows Harris leads 70% to 23%, while she only holds a 17-point lead among young men. Now it's true that every Democratic candidate has won young people as a whole in recent elections, but the gap has been narrowing. Biden won voters under 30 by only 24 points in 2020, according to Pew Research.

The Harvard poll numbers come as former President Donald Trump has made a concerted effort to tap into the youth ""bro"" vote.

Over the last few years, there have been countless outlets that have popped up designed to stoke the misogyny and racism of young white men, and a whole movement was born to appeal to young male gamers who are sick of ""woke"" content. Trump's campaign has sought to ride on the coattails of this movement, with the candidate making appearances with popular young conservative streamers like Adin Ross and F√©lix (xQc) Lengyel. It's significant that Trump still hasn't won a majority of them despite making in-roads, despite the exponential growth of conservative media designed to appeal to the demographic.

Harris's appearance on ""Call Her Daddy"" can, in a way, be seen as the gendered opposite of Trump's stream appearances. But the two gender-focused media ecosystems aren't nearly the same. While conservative commentary outlets like The Daily Wire and streamers like Ross have ridden the anti-woke, white male-oriented zeitgeist to prominence, women's media has largely fallen apart over the last decades.

Feminist giants like Bitch Media and The Toast have long since disappeared. Jezebel is a shell of its former self and under new ownership. We are now a long way away from the dramatic heights of the feminist blog era, which found its peak in the late aughts and early 2010s. Corporate greed, advertiser squeamishness and the tech bros controlling today's algorithms have simply killed the feminist voice, or twisted it into a tool to spread transphobic hate.

That has left a void in women's media to be filled with podcasts like ""Call Her Daddy,"" which got its start as the property of the consistently misogynist outlet Barstool Sports, run by sports bro turned conservative provocateur Dave Portnoy. Cooper and her podcast left Barstool in 2021, and she signed a $60 million deal with Spotify, making her the highest-paid female podcaster in the U.S. In August, she signed a $125 million deal with SirusXM.

Cooper identifies as a feminist, though some critics have questioned her girlboss, masculine-behavior-coded version of the term. But ""feminist"" has also become a pejorative to many people. Being a feminist is often seen as uncool, or not sexy. Even worse, many women (and some men) believe in the core tenets of feminism: bodily autonomy, equal rights under the law, etc., but still eschew the label.

And who can blame them when there's no real feminist media counterbalance to the growing ""bro-verse"" that freaks out whenever a woman or a person of color appears in a popular piece of media.

That's partly why I and a group of nine other experienced creatives are launching The Flytrap, a new feminist newsletter blog project that seeks to bring back the halcyon days of feminist media at a time when we need it most.

Trump winning this election will be disastrous for the bodily autonomy of women and trans people. Women across the globe continue to suffer under oppressive regimes, especially in Gaza and Afghanistan, and a Trump win will likely make those situations worse.

Like Trump has with young men, Harris should have more media options to reach young women. Her appearance on ""Call Her Daddy,"" then, shouldn't be seen as something negative. It should be seen as proof of the important conversations we'd be having, and the more informed young women voters would be, if there were a more robust women's media sphere."
The Supreme Court started the term with a close look at 'ghost guns' and executions,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/supreme-court-ghost-guns-glossip-kavanaugh-deadline-newsletter-rcna175013,2024-10-11T19:47:48Z,"Welcome back, Deadline: Legal Newsletter readers. The first week of the Supreme Court's new term is in the books. It featured hearings over ""ghost guns"" and a rare request from Oklahoma's top cop to stop an execution. Plus, we were reminded that the investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation wasn't much of an investigation.

The court started Monday with the customary annual rejection of petitions that piled up over the summer. Among the many denials were a Biden administration appeal to protect emergency abortion care in Texas and a Pennsylvania GOP challenge to the president's voter registration push.

Biden's regulation on ""ghost guns"" could be safe if Tuesday's oral argument in Garland v. VanDerStok is any indication. Ahead of the hearing, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett had joined the three Democratic appointees to temporarily allow regulation of the kits and parts for making the weapons, which are harder for law enforcement to trace. Perhaps unsurprisingly, then, the hearing reflected a similar dynamic.

We won't know until we see the final ruling, which, like the other cases that'll be argued this term, should come by July.

One of the court's stranger hearings happened Wednesday, in Glossip v. Oklahoma. Part of the strangeness stemmed from the fact that death row prisoner Richard Glossip wasn't really ""v."" Oklahoma. That's because the state's Republican attorney general agrees the defendant should get a new trial because of prosecutorial misconduct. But the justices appointed a third party to argue in defense of a state court ruling that, if upheld, would put Glossip (who maintains his innocence) in the death chamber.

While Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito unsurprisingly sounded ready to rule against Glossip, the hearing left it unclear how a majority of the court will settle the life-or-death appeal. It could come down to the votes of Roberts, Barrett and Kavanaugh.

Speaking of Kavanaugh, he was back in the news personally this week for the sexual misconduct claims that almost kept him off the court during his confirmation process. A new report from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., scrutinized the Trump White House's control of the FBI's purported probe. ""If anything,"" the report reads, ""the White House may have used the tip line to steer FBI investigators away from derogatory or damaging information.""

Next week, the justices will hear another handful of arguments to complete the October sitting. In keeping with the quirky alignment theme following the Glossip death penalty case, one of next week's hearings is in San Francisco v. EPA. That is, the caricatured liberal enclave against the agency tasked with protecting the environment (to the extent allowed by the Roberts Court). Backed by industry groups, San Francisco is complaining about how the federal government enforces water pollution rules. The State of California, however, is backing the feds.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump's legal battle continues against the government he seeks to head again. His lawyers are trying to stop even more negative information about their client from emerging in the federal election interference case. They argued that the special counsel is engaged in ""election interference"" for continuing to prosecute the case that accuses the former president of criminally trying to subvert the last election he lost to Joe Biden. They said they want to ""evaluate litigation options"" if U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan rules against them when publicizing more damaging information -- this time, regarding the appendix to special counsel Jack Smith's giant immunity brief.

Chutkan ruled against them Thursday, but we don't have any new information to examine yet, because she paused her ruling for a week so the Trump team can ""evaluate litigation options."" We should know next week whether the GOP nominee will attempt any legal challenge to Chutkan's latest order before the election.

But the more significant issue hovering over the prosecution is whether Trump wins next month's election and then crushes the case.

Election Day is 25 days away. The question I posed to kick off this term's newsletter -- will the Supreme Court decide the election? -- is still an open one. But for those rightly concerned with such an occurrence, election law expert Rick Hasen has a new piece explaining why it might not happen. He writes that ""there is reason to believe that the court will stay out of the election in any major way unless we have a close election √† la Florida in 2000 or in the unlikely event that elected or election officials seek to subvert the outcome of the vote.""

The ""unless"" and ""unlikely"" parts of that are still worrisome, but that's where we're at."
Opinion | Larry Hogan is a Trump critic. But a new report shows he's Trumpier than he'd care to admit.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/larry-hogan-maryland-business-controvery-ethics-corruption-rcna174911,2024-10-11T14:59:50Z,"It sure looks like the Maryland Republican could've used the governor's mansion to enrich himself.

Former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan is trying to win a U.S. Senate seat in deep blue Maryland on the strength of his reputation as a Never-Trump Republican. But a damning new report in Time magazine suggests that Hogan, who put a family member in charge of his real estate firm while he served as governor, resembles Trump more than we knew. Hogan may have been able to use his power as governor to help boost his business in a manner reminiscent of the former president.

Before becoming governor, Hogan was the president and principal owner of a real estate brokerage firm in Maryland. When he entered the governor's mansion, he neither divested from the firm nor formed a blind trust, as politicians sometimes do to maintain an ethical distance from their assets. Instead, Time reports, he put his brother in charge of his company and made executives at the firm trustees. He reportedly kept abreast of the firm's financial matters and the location of its real estate projects, and held routine meetings with his company's leaders.

This matters because Time found that ""[o]ver Hogan's eight years in office, nearly 40% of the competitive affordable housing awards overseen by the governor went to developers listed as clients"" on his company's website, according to a review of public records. According to the magazine, those awards ""were concentrated among six developers who competed against more than 60 other companies during that time."" Time found no record of Hogan's recusing himself from decision-making or the oversight of decision-making that could affect his assets; nor did his office provide examples of any such recusals. Time noted that, according to historians of the state, Hogan's tenure marks the first time that a Maryland governor made millions of dollars while in office.

The legality of this situation is confusing. Hogan's trust arrangement was approved by the Maryland State Ethics Commission, Time reports. ""Gov. Hogan adhered to a legally-binding Trust Agreement, approved by the independent State Ethics Commission, that prohibited his participation in any matters related to his business,"" Michael Ricci, a former state official and Hogan spokesman, said in a statement to Time. But, according to the magazine's report, in practice Hogan did participate in matters that affected his business. And Maryland public ethics law ""prohibits government officials from taking part in decisions in which they or a close relative have a known financial interest, or if the decision could reasonably be expected to 'result in a conflict between the private interest and the official State duties of the official.'"" Several government watchdogs told Time that Hogan's failure to recuse was an outright conflict of interest. Others say it warrants investigation. Sen. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., posted on X: ""What's going on here?""

I share the same question as Raskin. Hogan's set-up generated, at the very least, the appearance of a conflict of interest and appears to have potentially allowed him to use the governor's mansion to enrich himself. This is a situation in which Hogan, even if he did nothing illicit, seems to have done something self-serving and inappropriate.

There is something ironic about reports that Hogan displayed Trumpian qualities. He has long been seen as a moderate in Maryland politics, and during the pandemic he was a vociferous critic of Trump's policies and character. He sells himself as a man who stands for common-sense solutions for the middle class. But his business arrangements while he served as governor suggest someone motivated by private interest. That Trump managed to avoid any accountability for enriching himself using the presidency doesn't make it any less unethical.

Even without the Time expos√©, we know that Hogan isn't the moderate so many Marylanders have claimed he is. As governor he vetoed criminal justice reform, renewable energy initiatives, voters' rights bills and bills that would have increased the number of abortion providers in Maryland. We don't know exactly what kind of player he would be in the Senate, but he remains a part of the Republican Party, and there's no reason to think he wouldn't often side with the GOP. The most recent revelations should only give Marylanders more reason to pause and consider whether he deserves the trust of liberals and good-government fans that he claims he does."
Obama mocks Trump over rhetoric about 'protecting' women,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/obama-mocks-trump-rhetoric-protecting-women-rcna175005,2024-10-11T14:11:28Z,"As the Republican former president pitches himself as a ""protector"" for American women, his Democratic predecessor had a few thoughts on the subject.

The latest national NBC News poll found Donald Trump trailing Kamala Harris by 21 points among women voters. The good news for Republicans is that the former president is well aware of the gender gap. The bad news for Republicans is that he doesn't know what to do about it.

In late August, for example, the GOP nominee targeted his Democratic rival in ugly and misogynistic ways, amplifying online content that suggested Harris traded sexual favors to advance her career. A New York Times report added at the time that the ""repost was the second time in 10 days that the former president shared content from his personal account making sexually oriented attacks on Ms. Harris."" (A few days later, Trump told Fox News that Democrats are ""demeaning women."" He didn't appear to be kidding.)

In early September, the GOP nominee thought it'd be a good idea to lash out at some of the women who've accused him of sexual misconduct, at one point suggesting that some of his accusers weren't attractive enough to attack. In late September, Trump said women would forget all about the importance of reproductive rights after he made their lives more ""beautiful.""

All of which brings us to October and the former president's closing message. As my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim noted, Trump has started pitching himself in recent weeks as a ""protector"" who will save women from fear and unhappiness.

He echoed the line during remarks at the Detroit Economic Club, boasting, ""I think women love me because they want to be safe, and with me they're safe.""

Hours later, in remarks delivered in Pittsburgh, his presidential predecessor shared some related thoughts.

""He said, 'Don't worry, women. I will be your protector,'"" Barack Obama explained. ""I will tell you how he 'protected' you. He hand-picked three of the Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe, went out and bragged about it, and now there are Trump abortion bans in 20 states.""

Honestly, everything about Trump's pitch isn't just ridiculous, it's insulting. The idea that Americans will be ""safe"" under his presidency is apparently rooted in the idea that he'll be tougher on crime. In reality, Trump is himself a criminal; he pardoned a great many other criminals; he's running on a platform of pardoning many more violent criminals; and crime rates in the United States are better now than when he was in the White House.

It also doesn't help that the Republican's pitch is also rooted in creepy paternalism. For that matter, Obama is entirely right about the policy consequences of Trump's efforts, which have had dramatically detrimental effects on the lives of countless women.

And then, of course, there's the idea that ""with"" Trump, women are ""safe."" In reality, so many women have accused the Republican candidate of sexual misconduct that I've literally lost count (he denies any wrongdoing); Trump was recorded bragging about his willingness to grab women's genitals because he's a ""star""; and last year, a jury in New York found Trump liable for sexually abusing a woman.

If the 2024 election comes down to the question of whether women are ""safe"" with the GOP nominee, Trump should lose 50 states."
Tennessee cites Dobbs to defend ban on gender-affirming care for minors at Supreme Court,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/tennessee-gender-affirming-care-minors-sb1-supreme-court-rcna174825,2024-10-10T17:14:07Z,"Now, Tennessee is citing the Dobbs ruling to the justices in its defense of the state's ban on gender-affirming medical treatment for minors.

""That is not discrimination,"" the Republican state Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti wrote in a high court brief filed this week. ""It is an evenhanded 'regulation of a medical procedure' that turns on the reason for the procedure's use,"" the brief continued, quoting from the abortion ruling authored by Justice Samuel Alito in one of several references in Tennessee's filing.

The legal question in the case is whether the state law, called SB1, violates equal protection. The law prohibits all medical treatments intended to allow ""a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex"" or to treat ""purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor's sex and asserted identity.""

The state didn't cite Dobbs out of nowhere. The federal appeals court that sided with the state, prompting Supreme Court review, did as well to support the position that heightened legal protection ""does not apply in the context of laws that regulate medical procedures unique to one sex or the other.""

But in seeking to highlight the law's discriminatory nature, the federal government writes to the justices that it ""leaves the same treatments entirely unrestricted if they are prescribed for any other purpose, such as treating delayed or precocious puberty. Thus, for example, a teenager whose sex assigned at birth is male can be prescribed testosterone to conform to a male gender identity, but a teenager assigned female at birth cannot.""

Oral argument isn't scheduled yet in the appeal, called United States v. Skrmetti, which could lead to one of the biggest decisions of the term that started this week. A decision is expected by July."
Trump rails against 'dumb women' on 'The View' after Harris' interview,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-the-view-harris-dumb-women-rcna174654,2024-10-09T17:07:13Z,"Trump attacked the women of ""The View"" and their guest even as his campaign attempts to win over female voters.

Donald Trump, who in recent months has tried to brand himself as a champion for women, went on a tirade against Kamala Harris and the hosts of ""The View"" on Tuesday, insulting the women in personal terms and mocking their intelligence.

In a post on Truth Social responding to Harris' interview on the daytime talk show, Trump called his Democratic opponent a ""dummy"" and referred to the hosts as ""degenerates"" and ""dumb women."" He railed against Harris for saying that she would not have done anything different than President Joe Biden in his term, calling it ""her dumbest answer so far.""

Trump's attacks on Harris and the hosts of ""The View"" are especially notable in light of his recent attempts to win over female voters, a crucial and diverse voting bloc. (Harris continues to poll better among women than Trump, which may be due in part to a recent leftward shift among younger women in America.) He has tried to cast himself as a champion of women's rights and a ""protector"" of women, who he says feel ""abandoned"" and ""lonely.""

""Women will be healthy, happy, confident and free,"" Trump said at a rally in Pennsylvania in September. ""You will no longer be thinking about abortion.""

Trump's pitch is considerably at odds with his personal and political track record. As he demonstrated in his Truth Social post on Tuesday, Trump is quick to denigrate women, especially women who oppose him and women of color, and he often brings up gender as a line of attack. As president, he oversaw the undoing of abortion rights and has taken credit for it. He has been recorded making crude comments about sexually assaulting women; he has been found liable of sexual abuse in a New York civil court; and he has faced a number of sexual misconduct allegations from women in his past, all of which he denies."
DeSantis administration warns local TV stations to remove ads about abortion ballot measure,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/desantis-abortion-rights-florida-amendment-4-caroline-ad-rcna174387,2024-10-08T10:47:32Z,"The Republican administration is pressuring Florida stations to take down an ad that promotes a ""yes"" vote on Amendment 4, which would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration had already tried to put its thumb on the scale against Amendment 4, a statewide measure that could enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. And now the admin has added to that disturbing trend.

Florida's six-week abortion ban is one of the strictest in the country. The DeSantis administration recently had its election police unit investigate people who had signed a petition to get Amendment 4 on the ballot. Then the administration used taxpayer money to launch an anti-abortion website. The administration also used state money to air Orwellian television ads proclaiming that ""Florida cares about women and families.""

Now the DeSantis administration appears to be trying to intimidate people who have run an ad that promotes a ""yes"" vote on Amendment 4.

""The doctors knew if I did not end my pregnancy, I would lose my baby, I would lose my life, and my daughter would lose her mom,"" a woman says in the ad, titled ""Caroline.""

""Florida has now banned abortion even in cases like mine,"" she says.

Investigative journalist Jason Garcia published a letter from the Florida Department of Health's general counsel to the general manager of WFLA-TV, the NBC affiliate in the Tampa Bay area. The letter, dated Oct. 3, argues that the ad contains a ""categorically false"" claim about abortion in Florida -- and warns that the ad is in violation of state law.

""The advertisement is not only false; it is dangerous,"" the letter reads. ""Women faced with pregnancy complications posing a serious risk of death or substantial or irreversible physical impairment may and should seek medical treatment in Florida.""

In practice, Florida's law hasn't been so clear. Even though the law includes exceptions for rape and incest in certain cases, the law has confused doctors and caused a chilling effect among providers. The problem has been so glaring that the DeSantis administration has threatened doctors who don't provide emergency care in these confusing scenarios, which are only occurring because of the law Republicans put in place.

In another letter Garcia posted online, lawyers for the group sponsoring Amendment 4 defended the ad as true and urged a Florida TV station to continue carrying it.

The Florida Department of Health's letter ""is a flagrant abuse of power and must be rejected,"" the lawyers wrote.

The DeSantis administration sure seems like it's attempting to hide the dangerous impacts of Florida's abortion laws from public view."
Harris attacked MAGA misogyny head-on in 'Call Her Daddy' interview,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-call-her-daddy-interview-alex-cooper-rcna174337,2024-10-07T21:05:54Z,"The Democratic presidential hopeful's appearance on the popular ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast was a clear rebuttal to Donald Trump and the MAGA movement. And Harris pulled no punches.

Kamala Harris sat for an interview on the popular podcast ""Call Her Daddy,"" for an episode that was released over the weekend. The podcast, helmed by host Alex Cooper, is known for being particularly popular with young women.

The interview was part of the Democratic presidential campaign's ongoing strategy of using sit-downs with nontraditional media sources to spread its messaging to targeted groups. Harris recently did an interview on ""All the Smoke,"" a sports-focused podcast known for its popularity among men of color. On Tuesday, she will be interviewed by Howard Stern, a longtime shock jock with a large male audience.

Trump also has gone on a tour of nontraditional media, though his podcast-heavy schedule has seemed structured almost entirely to shore up his support with men (albeit in some pretty juvenile ways). Harris' ""Call Her Daddy"" interview was the antithesis of that.

Where Trump and his movement have embraced the chauvinism of the 19th and 20th century and obsessed over ""tradwives"" -- women defined by their roles as homemakers and caretakers -- the Democratic candidate spoke to the podcast's massive audience of women and encouraged them to define themselves.

Harris said her mom had taught her and her sister ""the importance of us being able to express how we were feeling,"" that they ""had agency"" in how their lives played out, and that they ought to ""figure out how you can take charge of a moment.""

When Cooper asked Harris about Trump's thinly veiled sexist attacks, in which he has called her ""crazy, weak, fake and dumb,"" the VP replied: ""I think it's really important not to let other people define you.""

At one point, the conversation shifted to the crisis of domestic and sexual violence against women. Cooper said many of her listeners have described the shame and the terror they feel about coming forward, but Harris -- a former prosecutor -- told listeners not to ""quietly suffer"" and advised them to ""tell someone that you trust.""

And when Cooper asked about how we can make the country safer for women, Harris did an effective job of explaining how women's economic independence factors into the equation. She said:

This narrative about empowering women economically runs counter to the GOP's attack on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that can assist women in the workplace.

Harris also spoke about the impact of abortion bans, describing the harrowing reality of women who are forced to travel out of state to receive reproductive care -- assuming they even have the money and means to do so.

And she attacked conservatives' arcane view of women when asked to address Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' claim that Harris ""doesn't have anything keeping her humble"" because she does not have biological children. (The vice president, of course, has two stepchildren.)

""I don't think she understands that there are a whole lot of women out here who, one, are not aspiring to be humble,"" Harris said of Sanders. ""Two, a whole lot of women out here who have a lot of love in their life, family in their life and children in their life, and I think it's really important for women to lift each other up.""

The interview was essentially a message to young women that they don't have to accept the MAGA movement's restrictive roles for them -- and that the Harris campaign supports them leading more self-determined lives."
"Katie Phang: As questions swirl over Trump's mental fitness, is Vance ready to be president?",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/vance-25-amendment-trump-presidency-rcna174325,2024-10-07T20:08:02Z,"In some ways, vice presidents are like understudies; you may never need them to step into the breach but they're there just in case something goes wrong.

And as we inch closer to November's election, I want you to consider this: If elected, Donald Trump -- who is currently 78 years old, regularly frequents McDonald's, and loves his Diet Cokes -- would end his second term as the oldest person ever to serve as president of the United States. On the final day of his presidency in January 2029, Trump would be 82 years, seven months and six days old.

The former president's rambling, meandering speeches on the campaign trail have led some mental health experts to go on the record, raising concerns about his potential cognitive decline. Despite these concerns, Trump refuses to release even the most basic information about his health.

So what happens if Trump wins in November and then, days, weeks, months or years into his presidency, dies or becomes incapacitated and can no longer serve? Well, according to Section 1 of the 25th Amendment, in that event, the vice president would become the president automatically.

To state it plainly: Sen. JD Vance is a heartbeat away from the presidency of the United States. The same Vance who, right now, has poll numbers labeling him the least popular vice-presidential candidate of the 21st century -- unsurprising given his many extremist views on everything from child care to the truth of who won the 2020 election. I mean, not admitting your running mate lost the last election is a huge red flag that you have an issue with the truth.

During last week's vice-presidential debate, Vance got caught in another lie. The senator claimed he never supported a national abortion ban. However, in 2022 while he was running for the Senate, Vance said on a podcast he ""certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally.""

Then there's his extremist stances. Also during that 2022 run for the Senate, Vance delivered a 30-minute speech titled ""The Universities are the Enemy"" at the National Conservatism Conference.

""I think if any of us want to do the things that we want to do for our country and for the people who live in it, we have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country,"" the then-candidate told the crowd. ""Ladies and gentlemen, the universities do not pursue knowledge and truth, they pursue deceit and lies, and it's time to be honest about that fact.""

Now, in my opinion, the best way to pursue a good and fulfilling life is through education, but it seems Yale-educated Vance wants to overhaul the education system in his image. Under Project 2025, a Trump-Vance administration could eliminate the Department of Education, privatize K-12, and dismantle the current collegiate system.

He's a threat to everything Americans hold dear: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And if something were to happen to Trump, the big job would go to Vance: the guy who refuses to acknowledge that Trump lost the 2020 election, promotes anti-immigrant hate rhetoric, and supports a national abortion ban.

And let's be clear, 40-year-old Vance is fully aware that Trump is 78 years old. You're kidding yourself if you think he didn't consider Trump's physical and mental health issues when contemplating his career advancement and upward mobility prospects as the Republican VP nominee.

So, before you cast your ballot in this year's election, you should remember this: Any vote for Donald Trump is a vote for a potential automatic JD Vance presidency. Vote accordingly."
Opinion | Texas and Florida are too big an opportunity for Dems to pass up,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/senate-texas-florida-democrats-cruz-scott-rcna174071,2024-10-07T10:26:25Z,"With the path to maintaining their Senate majority narrowing, Democrats are going on the offense against Sens. Ted Cruz and Rick Scott.

Democrats can look at Florida and Texas in a couple of ways. From one angle, the states are both places where victory has been just out of reach -- a tantalizing ""what if?"" From another, they offer an unlearned lesson in heartbreak, a constant loop of Lucy yanking the football away from Charlie Brown at the last second.

For now, the former point of view is winning out as Senate Democrats look to hold on to their slim majority. A new wave of money and interest has begun to pour into Florida and Texas as polls show tightening races and Election Day fast approaches. And with incumbents like Republican Sens. Rick Scott of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas as their targets, it's not hard to see why Democrats see going on the offense as a risk worth taking.

The electoral map was never a good one for Senate Democrats this cycle, forced to defend far more seats than their Republican counterparts. With the GOP set to claim a seat from retiring Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.Va., the upper house is already starting from a 50-50 split. The odds for Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., pulling off an upset in his now deep-red state have continued to narrow, forcing Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to look elsewhere for a path to a majority. And that road requires knocking off at least one of the two least likable members of the GOP caucus.

Things are looking tight in Texas again this time around, with Democratic Rep. Colin Allred closing in on Cruz. Most polls still have Cruz ahead by around 3 points, but an outlier run by Morning Consult had the congressman up by 1 point. That's still within the margin of error, but the numbers have galvanized Democrats' hope that the state might be a jump ball. Accordingly, the Cook Political Report shifted the rating in that race from ""likely Republican"" to ""lean Republican"" on Tuesday, reflecting Allred's momentum.

Cruz at least is extremely aware of his own vulnerability. He roared into the Senate in 2012 and quickly made a name for himself as a darling of the far-right tea party movement. But his bid for president in 2016 faltered and his first re-election bid in 2018 ended up a squeaker that he won by less than 3 points. In the last two years, as he's prepared to face voters again, Cruz has sought to refashion himself as a bipartisan moderate, a hard task when you've built your whole brand on being a provocateur and ideological bomb-thrower.

Scott, on the other hand, hasn't bothered following Cruz's lead in playing for the middle (despite winning his seat that same year by just 0.1 points). Instead, the first-term senator is angling to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., at the top of the GOP caucus and take the title of majority leader, if all goes according to plan. But his time at the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee during the most recent midterms wasn't exactly a wild success, nor was his bid to pounce against McConnell last year.

Former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell isn't faring quite as well against Scott as Allred is against Cruz, but she is gaining traction. Five Thirty Eight's polling average has Scott up by 4 points, which is half of the lead he held over the summer. Mucarsel-Powell has also been set on making the race into a referendum on reproductive rights. In doing so, she's hoping to draw enough support from the abortion amendment on the ballot to negate any benefit Scott could get from riding former President Donald Trump's coattails.

The optimistic view is that each contest could be won with either more dedicated discipline from local Democrats or greater resources and attention from the national party. But recent history has shown that neither is a guarantee of success. Cruz's challenger in 2018, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, was popular both locally and nationally, seen as a real contender at finally winning a statewide race in Texas after a more than 20-year drought for Democrats. Likewise, former Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., transformed her race in 2022 against Sen. Marco Rubio into a national referendum on the GOP, but neither managed to unseat their opponent.

Those two races raised -- and spent -- a jaw-dropping amount of money in the process. O'Rourke's campaign drew in a staggering $80 million, the most a single U.S. Senate candidate has ever raised. Demings managed to raise almost as much for her race, considerably outspending Rubio in the process. This year, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee announced in late September that both Mucasal-Powell and Allred will get support in the form of a multimillion-dollar ad buy in their states, but the DSCC has yet to disclose exactly how much is going to each candidate.

The two biggest unknowns in these races are factors outside of the individual candidates' control: infrastructure and demographics.

Florida was once the biggest swing state in the country but has shifted to the right in the last decade, producing blowout wins for the GOP in the 2022 midterms. It doesn't help that the Democratic Party there has been a bit of a mess, if we're being honest, which has left a vacuum for Trump to fill in his new home state. And Scott, who has already spent $8 million of his own money in this race, is sure to keep shoveling in cash to offset the DSCC's investment.

Conversely, Texas is deep Republican territory that Democrats have spent the last decade trying to transform into a purple state. An influx of people into the Austin and Houston metro areas has come with a boost in liberal voters. A major question mark hovers over how the state's Latinos wind up voting this year, as the GOP has been making major inroads with border communities. Meanwhile, Texas' Republican attorney general has been cracking down on voting rights, potentially alienating Latinos in the process.

With less than four weeks to go, this is not an ideal scenario for Democrats. There's plenty of reason for cynicism in the face of these odds and so many prior disappointments. But with this much on the line, there's little choice but to square up and take a running start at that football again. Better to land flat on your back than be left wishing you'd taken the chance at dispatching the likes of Scott and Cruz."

The hateful lie pushed by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating their neighbors' pets not only endangered those migrants, it also led to an Ohio sheriff three hours away threatening citizens who show support for the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.

In a Sept. 13 Facebook post that he later claimed ""may have been a little misinterpreted,"" Portage County Sheriff Bruce Zuchowski suggested tracking ""all the addresses of the people who had [Harris] signs in their yards"" so that ""when the Illegal human 'Locust' (which she supports!) Need places to live...We'll already have the addresses of their New families...who supported their arrival!""

There's no misinterpreting the racism in that post, described to me by the county's NAACP president as ""vile and egregious."" There's no excusing the lie from the sheriff that Springfield's Haitians -- who are there as part of a federal humanitarian program for migrants -- are here illegally. On top of that, referring to human beings as pests (ravenous pests, at that) has preceded too many global atrocities for Zuchowski's hateful statements to be excused.

And that's before we get to heart of the matter, which is that Zuchowski veered into unconstitutional territory with the suggestion that residents lawfully expressing a political opinion warrant law enforcement's attention. Zuchowski's defense -- that he has a ""First Amendment right"" to post what he did -- is doubly offensive. His status as a public servant ought to come before his desire to express his opinion, and his post made his constituents afraid their government would be monitoring their constitutionally protected expression of speech.

Zuchowski, who has declined to speak to NBC News and multiple media outlets, took down his post after the Portage County NAACP and the League of Women Voters complained to the Ohio secretary of state, and as the Ohio ACLU was gearing up to sue him. But if Zuchowski succeeded in making people afraid that he and his deputies are watching their political activity, it seems unlikely that his deleting the post is enough to make them breathe easy.

On its face, the story out of Portage County, where I happen to have multiple loved ones who vote, is evidence that a malignant lie about an innocent immigrant population metastasized into a threat against innocent citizens hours away. But it's also part of what appears to be a larger campaign from conservatives to bully everybody else into political inactivity or silence.

In Florida, voters who signed a petition that put that state's abortion referendum on the ballot cried foul at being questioned by Gov. Ron DeSantis' election police unit. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton executed search warrants against members of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), one of America's oldest Latino civil rights groups, about two weeks after LULAC endorsed Harris' presidential campaign. He says he was investigating ""allegations of election fraud and vote harvesting"" in 2022. The Republican National Committee's so-called ""Protect the Vote"" project aims to recruit people from the suburbs to monitor the polls in urban Democratic strongholds, which it has falsely declared are hotbeds of voting fraud.

""I've never felt less protected and more scared than I do right now,"" a resident of Ravenna, Ohio, wrote Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, according to the Akron Beacon Journal. At least 59 residents complained to Yost's office, the paper reported. Zuchowski ""has made me feel unsafe in my home of 24 years,"" a Kent resident said.

Portage County NAACP President Renee Romine said at the emergency meeting her organization held about Zuchowski's post that there were ""people almost in tears"" and ""not wanting to go to the voting polls"" because Zuchowki's office provides security for in-person absentee voting. ""People did not even want to go and vote if they were going to be there.""

The county's board of elections voted to remove the sheriff's office from that security role, which Romine described as a ""big win for the people."" But to Freda Levenson, the legal director of the ACLU of Ohio, the win was Zuchowski removing the offending post.

""We were going to ask a federal judge to make him take down his post. So as soon as he took down his post, we no longer had anything to ask for,"" she said. ""He backed down, which is what we wanted. Not just what we wanted, it's what the Constitution required him to do.""

But what the ACLU counts as a win may be cold comfort to Portage County voters. He made a post about monitoring who's supporting Harris. There's no reason they should believe that his being forced to take the post down has been accompanied by any change of heart."
Why the race for control of the U.S. Senate is intensifying,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/race-control-us-senate-intensifying-rcna174013,2024-10-04T17:04:32Z,"Which party will control the U.S. Senate next year? With 11 closely watched contests, the chamber appears to be up for grabs.

As most fair-minded observers would probably agree, the race for the White House remains anybody's guess. No matter who wins the presidential contest, however, he or she is going to look to the U.S. Senate to help govern, and as it turns out, figuring out which party will be in the chamber's majority next year isn't easy, either.

As regular readers know, the Senate Democratic conference currently has a one-seat majority, but with Sen. Joe Manchin retiring in West Virginia, Republicans have, for all intents and purposes, already flipped one seat.

With this in mind, Republicans will need a net gain of just one additional seat to secure a majority, which is hardly unrealistic given the number of tough races in states where there's currently a Democratic incumbent -- including races in states where Donald Trump is all but certain to win easily.

So where do things stand with 32 days remaining? Let's take stock.

There are, by most measures, 11 Senate races that could credibly be described as ""competitive."" Taking them one at a time, in alphabetical order:

Arizona: Incumbent independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema is retiring

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego has led failed Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake in nearly every poll for months, and with an abortion-rights ballot measure likely to boost turnout, Gallego is the clear favorite.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Despite Lake's baggage from her 2022 race, the election denier isn't being blown out, and the fact that the race is competitive is keeping Democratic money flowing into the state, instead of other contests.

Florida: Incumbent Republican Sen. Rick Scott is seeking a second term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: The far-right incumbent is not well liked; he has no accomplishments or record of successes; an abortion-rights ballot measure likely to boost turnout; and polls suggest former Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is keeping this contest far more competitive than most thought possible.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: At the end of the day, Florida is a red state, filled with voters who probably won't care about the senator's awful record; Scott is able to invest heavily thanks to his considerable personal fortune; and Mucarsel-Powell is struggling to keep up financially in a massive state with several expensive media market.

Maryland: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin is retiring

Why Democrats feel good about the race: In one of the nation's reliably blue states, Angela Alsobrooks' polling lead appears to be growing, and it won't hurt that there's an abortion-rights ballot measure on the statewide ballot.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Larry Hogan remains popular in the state, and the former governor is benefiting from massive investments from Republican megadonors.

Michigan: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow is retiring

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Most recent polling shows Elissa Slotkin well positioned to prevail in a state that has elected a Republican senator only once in the past 50 years.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Despite former Rep. Mike Rogers' baggage -- he moved to Florida after retiring from Congress -- he's keeping the race close.

Montana: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is seeking a fourth term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Tester is a respected and accomplished incumbent, running on a record of success, and it won't hurt that there's an abortion-rights ballot measure on the statewide ballot.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Polls suggest Tester is nevertheless losing to a struggling Republican businessman who's facing controversies surrounding his racist rhetoric, his record of dishonesty about a gunshot wound, and alleged plagiarism in his book.

Nebraska: Incumbent Republican Sen. Deb Fischer is seeking a third term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Independent Dan Osborn has stunned much of the political world by running a strong race -- Republicans have scrambled in recent weeks to start airing ads in a state they expected to ignore -- and polls suggest he's within striking distance of an upset victory. The fact that the ballot will include measures on abortion policy might also help tip the scales.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: At the end of the day Nebraska is a reliably ruby-red state.

Nevada: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen is seeking a second term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Nevada is one of the nation's most closely divided battleground states, but polls suggest Rosen is well positioned to prevail. Nevada is also one of the states with an abortion-rights measure on the statewide ballot.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Republican Sam Brown isn't far behind the incumbent, and there's still a lot of GOP money backing his candidacy.

Ohio: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is seeking a fourth term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Like Tester in Montana, Brown is a respected and accomplished incumbent, running on a record of success. Unlike Tester, recent polling shows Brown hanging on to a small lead.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Bernie Moreno isn't exactly an impressive candidate, and he isn't exactly running a good campaign, but he's still within 3 points of a popular senator, thanks in large part to the fact that Ohio is becoming a reliably red state.

Pennsylvania: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey is seeking a fourth term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Like Tester in Montana and Brown in Ohio, Casey is a respected and accomplished incumbent, running on a record of success. The latest polls also show the senator with modest but steady leads.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Despite his carpetbagger problem, Dave McCormick is still within striking distance of defeating a longtime incumbent.

Texas: Incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz is seeking a third term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Democratic Rep. Colin Allred is exactly the kind of candidate who can appeal to a broad audience in Texas -- ""Republicans for Allred"" has some established and well-known figures on board -- and many GOP insiders have started to express real anxiety in response to surprisingly close polls.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: For all of Cruz's many troubles, he still has an ""R"" after his name in Texas. With Trump expected to win the state with relative ease, are there really a significant number of voters who will vote for Trump and Allred on the same ballot? GOP insiders believe the answer is no.

Wisconsin: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin is seeking a third term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Like Tester in Montana, Brown in Ohio, and Casey in Pennsylvania, Baldwin is a respected and accomplished incumbent, running on a record of success. The latest polls also show the senator with modest-but-steady leads.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: In a dynamic similar to the Ohio contest, Eric Hovde isn't exactly an impressive candidate, and he isn't exactly running a good campaign, but he's still within 5 points of a popular senator."
Trump reshares a video portraying himself as God's gift to earth,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/god-made-trump-video-christian-nationalism-masculinity-rcna173945,2024-10-04T10:38:48Z,"""I need somebody with arms strong enough to wrestle the deep state and yet gentle enough to deliver his own grandchild.""

That creepy line comes from a video called ""God Made Trump,"" which Donald Trump has shared in the past and did so again Wednesday. It's essentially an ad that portrays the Republican presidential nominee as God's gift to Earth.

As Phoebe Jones wrote for California's Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey earlier this year, the video -- which plays on Paul Harvey's ""So God Made a Farmer"" speech -- shows how Trump and the Christian nationalist movement he leads are steeped in toxic notions of masculinity:

At one point, the ad literally says God needed a man who cares for the flock, as if to reiterate God's purported preference. Trump has leaned into this kind of messianic masculinity with some of his recent rhetoric.

And evidence suggests that all of this is likely to appeal to Trump's base, given the conservative movement's evangelical beliefs and arcane ideas of manhood and masculinity. A Public Religion Research Institute poll from September, examining the connection between authoritarianism and Christian nationalism in the U.S., found that nearly 7 in 10 Republicans think society has become too soft or feminine.

The poll also found Christian nationalist ""adherents"" or ""sympathizers"" were more likely than others to agree with these statements:

Today's fiercely Christian conservative movement in the U.S. has become a hypermasculine cult of personality with Trump at the helm. He has permitted Christian men to cloak their desires for domination and power in religiosity -- and is even selling Trump-branded Bibles.

And men in this movement have made hay with their shamelessness, openly promoting misogynistic policies like bans on abortion and trying to end no-fault divorces (along with discouraging abused women from divorcing their partners).

This hypermasculinization of the American church has coincided with a perhaps predictable trend. As The New York Times reported last week:

My suspicion is that this is a byproduct of MAGA masculinity pervading American Christianity -- and crowding out young women who, given the choice, don't want to suffer underneath it."
Opinion | Harris could win these three Southern states if late deciders show up,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-florida-georgia-north-carolina-rcna173735,2024-10-04T10:34:05Z,"The polls can't capture the procrastinators who aren't yet engaged in the election.

More than a million Americans have already cast their ballots in the presidential election, but the ones who may prove decisive may not have even started paying attention.

For political junkies like me who have been following every twist and turn in this election for the last two years, the next 32 days are the most stressful as we wait to see what voters will decide.

If you already know which candidate you're supporting in the presidential race between Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris -- not to mention everything from governor down to local school board -- it can be frustrating to wait for these seemingly indecisive, procrastinating Americans to get to it.

But late deciders are important, and this year, I think they are the reason that Harris may have a chance to win Georgia, North Carolina and Florida.

No, that's not a typo. I said what I said. President Joe Biden won Georgia in 2020, and North Carolina has been close for a while. But Florida? The one state where the promise of a ""red wave"" in the 2022 midterms actually materialized? The state that has voted for Trump both times he's been on the ballot? It's still close enough that a late-breaking group of Harris voters could make a difference.

Now, it's important to understand who these voters are. I think of them as intentional voters, because they'll usually tell you what they think of the candidates and the race or that they don't intend to vote at all. Months out from the election, if you were to ask whom they'd vote for, they'll give a reflexive response. They'll cite something they heard in an ad or skimmed in a news article that may or may not closely approximates which candidate they're leaning toward. In fact, that candidate may not be whom they end up supporting.

But, as we get closer to Election Day, these voters become more engaged. Their intentions begin to shift and may even harden into support as they read up on the two candidates, listen closer to their arguments, and shift their attitudes. When they do, they can change the political landscape dramatically in short order.

That's especially likely in the 2024 election, which has seen a lot of tumult so far.

Consider when Biden dropped out of the race and Harris became his successor. The country saw 40,000 new voter registrations in just 48 hours, according to Vote.org CEO Andrea Hailey. That's a 700% increase in the site's daily registrations, and young voters accounted for 80% of them. According to ActBlue, the campaign and its joint fundraising committee raised more than $86 million from online donors, many of whom were donating for the first time. This averaged out to around $65 per person from more than a million people. That's a lot of voters who were activated quite suddenly.

Or look at Taylor Swift's influence. Her Instagram post endorsing Harris and urging her fans to vote regardless of their candidate led to at least 337,000 visits to Vote.org. That's a large group of potential voters who were quickly activated and are not likely to be casting their ballot for Trump.

There are also signs that Trump's own popularity has been slipping. Those signs aren't coming from polls, but from his actual performance in the primaries as his own voters shift in their intentions since the Republican convention, as career political adviser Mike Madrid recently noted.

Finally, there's the potential for local issues to have a dramatic effect on turnout.

North Carolinians may turn out to rebuke Trump-endorsed Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson in the state's gubernatorial race. Robinson recently made headlines for allegedly referring to himself as a ""Black Nazi"" on a porn site forum, among a litany of other disgusting comments, all of which he denies making. That's in addition to his extremist views on abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.

Trump has distanced himself from Robinson but not pulled his endorsement, and it's not clear if that would even help at this point.

Then there's Georgia. In past elections there, we've seen controversial voting policies be met with determination and expanded turnout due to the resilience of Peach State voters, pushing Democrats to statewide victory in a presidential election and three Senate races. It's possible some of the last-minute, ham-fisted changes to election rules by the state Board of Elections will also provoke a backlash.

And in Florida, voters will also be considering ballot measures to legalize recreational cannabis and codify abortion rights -- popular policies that align with the Harris-Walz agenda.

To be clear, I'm not saying that Harris will outright win Georgia, North Carolina or Florida -- or even that she'll win at all. What I am saying is that the polls can't yet capture what these late deciders intend to do. It happened in 2016 when Trump won unexpectedly, in 2020 when Biden won even as down-ballot Republicans did well, and in 2022 when a much-prophesied red wave failed to materialize. Yeah, those late voters can be pretty intentional

So, as you're going over the polls and casting about for some kind of clue as to what may happen, remember that there's still a lot of uncertainty. The only thing you can do is cast your own ballot, encourage your friends and family to do the same and volunteer to help out a campaign and persuade as many intentional voters as you can along the way. After that, all you can do is wait as they make their intentions known."
Melania Trump reveals pro-abortion stance that's completely at odds with the GOP,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/melania-trump-abortion-rights-book-rcna173791,2024-10-03T16:37:17Z,"The former first lady's revelation is hard to square, given her husband's singular role in rolling back a right she calls essential to women ""from birth.""

In her forthcoming self-titled memoir, Melania Trump espouses an unflinching belief in abortion rights -- a view on one of the biggest issues of the election that is entirely antithetical to that of her husband and her political party.

In reviewing an early copy of her book, The Guardian reports that Melania Trump says it is ""imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy"" in deciding whether to have children, ""free from any intervention or pressure from the government.""

""Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body,"" she adds.

On Thursday morning, she also posted a video to social media that references her position on abortion rights. ""Without a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth: individual freedom,"" Melania Trump says in the video. ""What does 'my body, my choice' really mean?""

According to the Guardian, Melania Trump's book acknowledges the extreme circumstances in which some people make such decisions, including rape, incest or severe medical conditions in the fetus. But she also defends abortion access later in a pregnancy, which her husband has repeatedly demonized and misrepresented as a ""radical"" Democratic view.

She writes:

The former first lady's revelation is astonishing, given how out of step she is with her party, and in light of her husband's singular role in rolling back the right that she professes is essential to women ""from birth.""

And the timing of her declaration is no less circumspect: Melania Trump chose not reveal that she is pro-abortion when Roe v. Wade was overturned, or after Republican legislatures imposed draconian state abortion bans, which have caused preventable deaths and forced women to travel out of their states for the procedure. Rather, her apparently unwavering belief in abortion rights comes just ahead of a closely contested election in which Republicans are trying desperately to rebrand their extreme abortion views -- and in a memoir she is selling for upwards of $40."
Opinion | JD Vance tried to mansplain his way into the good graces of women. It didn't work.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-vice-presidential-debate-fail-rcna173598,2024-10-02T23:54:23Z,"Vance admits Republicans have a problem when it comes to women's trust. That doesn't mean he has a plan.

Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance arguably had one job going into Tuesday night's debate: convince the American public that he, and his party, don't hate women.

Even with that painfully low bar, I'd say he failed to do the job. The once anti-Trump senator did wear a pink tie, but did not face up to his past comments about menopausal women, ""childless cat ladies"" and a historically low favorability rate. Instead, he used most of his allotted speaking time to mansplain his views to the two women who were moderating, women who vote, and even his own wife.

During a question on immigration, Vance tried to talk over CBS moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, after he regurgitated dangerous lies about Haitian immigrants living in Springfield, Ohio. To Vance's dismay, Brennan reminded the audience that the immigrants in Springfield are there legally.

""The rules that you were not going to fact-check,"" Vance quipped, referring to CBS' statement that it would leave it to Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to fact check each other during the debate. ""And since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.""

Vance talked over and interrupted both O'Donnell and Brennan as they tried to move forward with the debate.

""Thank you, senator, for describing the legal process,"" Brennan said, before the network then muted Vance's mic.

""The audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Brennan said. ""We have so much we want to get into. Thank you for explaining the legal process,"" she added, in a tone every woman sitting in a cubicle, boardroom or classroom knows deep in her bones.

Unlike his windmill-, shark- and Hannibal Lecter-obsessed running mate, Vance deftly wields a very specific type of misogyny that, while far less obvious, is just as insidious -- one that can come off as empathic, but is undeniably condescending as it normalizes the most draconian right-wing policies.

One example of this was Vance consistently referring to Brennan -- a woman he does not personally know -- by her first name rather than addressing her appropriately. The slight-of-hand misogynistic move may have been Vance's attempt to appear likable and down-to-earth, but many viewers saw it differently: condescending, patronizing and rude.

Vance himself admitted that the Republican Party has a problem when it comes to women's trust. He reminded women watching Tuesday that they do not trust Republicans when it comes to abortion and the human right to bodily autonomy -- yet failed to explain how he, his running mate and his fellow party members plan to address the problem.

""We've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue where they, frankly, just don't trust us,"" Vance said, before claiming that is ""one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do.""

To demonstrate his party's commitment to earning that end, Vance lied about not supporting a nationwide abortion ban, the realities of abortion care later in pregnancy, and Minnesota's PRO Act, signed by his opponent, Gov. Tim Walz. Because nothing says ""trust me, I know what's best for you"" like holding an impromptu masterclass on gaslighting.

While Vance was able to appear far more level-headed than Trump in his fateful debate performance against Vice President Kamala Harris last month, it was Vance's faux praise of his wife while discussing the necessity of child care that truly embodied his very specific type of mansplaining and misogyny.

""I speak from this very personally because I'm married to a beautiful woman who is an incredible mother to our three beautiful kids, but is also a very, very brilliant corporate litigator, and I'm so proud of her,"" Vance began. ""But being a working mom, even for somebody with all of the advantages of my wife, is extraordinarily difficult.""

It's telling, when a man publicly laments the challenges his working wife faces, yet doesn't seem to face those same challenges as a working father. While appearing to appreciate all his wife does, Vance still chose to mansplain how hard it is to work outside the home while managing the majority of child care and household responsibilities without structural support -- the exact structural support Republicans have historically opposed.

For his bropropriating coup de gr√¢ce, Vance then pontificated on the importance of giving a ""family care model that makes choice possible.""

""The cultural pressure on young families, and especially young women, I think, makes it really hard for people to choose the family model they want,"" Vance said, ignoring how anti-abortion laws make it difficult, dangerous and in some cases impossible for women to choose when and how to start creating a ""family model"" in the first place.

Overall, it's true that during Tuesday's debate Vance succeeded in portraying himself as a level-headed, somewhat ordinary politician (if the definition of ""ordinary"" is calmly discussing the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history). But that is perhaps what makes Vance far more Machiavellian than Trump even. And it's what should put us all on high alert as we prepare to head to the polls in November."
Ali Velshi: Project 2025's plan to globalize the GOP's culture war,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/project-2025-usaid-abortion-climate-authoritarian-rcna173345,2024-10-02T21:11:47Z,"Republicans want to use one of the world's biggest humanitarian organizations to spread their far-right agenda.

No area of government seems to be safe from the clutches of Project 2025; that includes the U.S. Agency for International Development, also known as USAID. Chapter 9 of the far-right blueprint is dedicated to USAID, which distributes aid to more than 100 countries in the form of humanitarian assistance, health infrastructure and economic development.

Project 2025 sees USAID's status as one of the world's biggest humanitarian organizations as an opportunity to export its right-wing culture war obsessions to the world. That includes abortion.

On page 260, Project 2025 calls for reinstating the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy, widely known as the ""Mexico City Policy."" It's an old policy that blocks U.S. federal funding for organizations that perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning in foreign countries, first introduced by President Ronald Reagan.

But if the Mexico City policy's goal was to stop abortion ... it didn't work. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa affected by the policy, for example, saw increased abortion rates, according to a 2019 study featured in the Lancet Global Health Journal.

On page 265, Project 2025 asserts, ""The continued high rate of maternal and infant mortality is a persistent global tragedy. Contrary to current publicity, this problem is not solved by abortion."" That's actually contrary to reality. Decreased access to abortion means increased maternal mortality rates. According to the World Health Organization, nearly half of all abortions conducted worldwide are considered ""unsafe,"" and according to the Guttmacher Institute, nearly 11% of all maternal mortality comes from these unsafe abortions.

As I've said time and time again: Abortion is health care. In America and around the world, restricting abortion means restricting women's health care.

Project 2025 also wants the president to be able to dictate abortion policy worldwide. A section on page 261 reads:

The goal here is to hold the rights of women hostage, with the carrot of U.S. aid in exchange.

This chapter's war on women continues. On page 259, the plan suggests:

This head-in-the-sand approach to those big scary woke words may be in line with right-wing domestic politics, but fighting this culture war on the global stage would be an incredible disservice to women everywhere.

The USAID Office of Population and Reproductive Health actually helps fight child marriage. It also supports programs aiming to end female genital mutilation and gender-based violence. But Project 2025 is so immersed in the right-wing culture wars that it abandons all other reasoning.

Case in point: On climate change, page 257 reads: ""The aid industry claims that climate change causes poverty, which is false. Enduring conflict, government corruption, and bad economic policies are the main drivers of global poverty.""

Again, reality would disagree. The impacts of climate change, like increased frequency of extreme weather, more droughts and harsher heat, could push more than 100 million people into poverty by 2030, according to a report from the World Bank. Yes, you read that correctly: not keep 100 million people in poverty, but push 100 million more into it.

Page 257 is chock full of ideas: It suggests that:

This would be a death blow to the fight against global climate change. USAID's climate strategy is full of goals to reduce emissions, conserve at-risk ecosystems, and develop renewable energy systems around the world. Cutting this funding would hurt the folks already disproportionately feeling the effects of climate change: The 74 lowest-income nations contribute to only one-10th of emissions but stand to be affected the most by climate change.

So there you have it: Women as breeding stock and the world as a dumping ground -- that's international development courtesy of Project 2025."
"MAGA abortion bans are an attack on men's freedom, too",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/maga-abortion-bans-attack-mens-freedom-rcna173625,2024-10-02T19:49:35Z,"Men 4 Choice co-founder Oren Jacobson spoke with The ReidOut Blog about how his group is defying hypermasculine norms and tagging men into the fight for reproductive rights.

This post is the third in ""MAGA and Masculinity in 2024,"" an ongoing series examining the societal fallout from right-wing hypermasculinity -- and the people fighting its toxic messaging by positively redefining what it means to be a man. You can read the first post here and the second post here.

Oren Jacobson, co-founder of reproductive rights advocacy group Men 4 Choice, said he had an ""aha-slash-oh-s--- moment"" in 2015 that led him, a progressive organizer at the time, to shift his focus toward reproductive rights and bodily autonomy.

That was the year he became convinced of the real potential for Roe v. Wade to be overturned and for abortion to be criminalized, Jacobson told me on Tuesday. He cited Pew Research Center data that shows majorities of both men and women support abortion being legal in all or most cases. However, he argued, voices critical of abortion seem to dominate coverage of the issues.

""I was struck by the fact that the men who were speaking were the ones who were trying to criminalize abortion, while the six in 10 of us who thought that was bulls--- were saying nothing and doing nothing,"" Jacobson said. ""And that struck me as this really interesting puzzle.""

Men 4 Choice garnered national attention last year and earlier this year when second gentleman Dough Emhoff invited the group to participate in roundtables on ways to get male allies to help advocate for abortion rights. And the group's ads have drawn support from other prominent activists.

In my interview with Jacobson on Tuesday, we discussed hypermasculinity, men's role in the reproductive rights movement, and the powerful moments at the Democratic National Convention this year, when Josh Zurawski and Derek Cook took the stage as symbols of the righteous impact men can have on the fight reproductive rights.

This interview has been slightly edited for length and clarity.

Jah'han Jones: What are the lessons your work has taught you about men's views on abortion rights?

Oren Jacobson: Number one is that most men don't understand the harm abortion bans cause. It's a little easier now, after Dobbs, because you have Josh Zurawski speaking out or Derek and Anya Cook's story or the couple stories out of Georgia we've seen where women have actually died. So that harm is a little bit more front and center. But especially pre-Dobbs, and in ways that people don't even see still, it wasn't as obvious to many men how people are harmed by the denial of access to care, whether it's like care in an emergency situation or just like, ""Hey, when you start banning and criminalizing abortion, OB-GYNs leave your state and less people have access to all reproductive health care."" So the number one lesson is the need for men to understand harm. How does this actually hurt my family, my community, and my people?

OJ: Number two is that most men don't see this as their issue. It's a woman's issue in their mind. They think, ""It doesn't directly impact me. I'm not affected.""

The third is that most men don't see a natural entry point into this organizing work. Most of the organizations and organizing and messaging and communications and outreach is focused on women and pregnant people, which makes endless amounts of sense. But pick any population in the country and say, ""If you're not engaging them, what are the odds that they actually engage with you civically, right?""

And then the fourth is that men don't have a playbook. They just don't know what to do and don't know what to say. And so even if you get them through the first three pieces, you give them an entry point. You help them see the harm. You help them create ownership. You still need to tell them what to do and how to do it, because they know they're not experts, and they're worried that they're going to screw up.

JJ: What kind of messaging have you seen work in terms of getting men to better understand that abortion is their issue, too?

OJ: We tell men this isn't just about abortion. It's about freedom and power and control. Because no person can be free if they don't have the power to control their own body and reproductive decisions, right? Not if the government has the power to control you, or the power to control the most important decision you could ever make -- which is if, when and how to build a family. So we start in this place of grounding the question in these universal value frames that all of us understand. The word freedom is just such a part of our political and cultural discourse.

JJ: Absolutely.

OJ: The second piece of this is what I would call stakeholder messaging, which is different than allyship messaging and different than beneficiary messaging. Allyship means I stand up for you because you're hurt. Our message is actually different. It's about what men have to lose. It frames them as someone whose body may not be under attack, but someone whose rights are -- whose family is and whose freedom is.

We'll use a story like Josh's as a way to point that out: If the government has the power to control your wife's body, the government has the power to control your family. So your body may not be under attack, but your rights are, your family is, and your freedom. Josh and Derek almost lost everything because their partners were denied access to basic, essential reproductive health care.

JJ: I hear you.

OJ: I should say, men who are LGBTQ+ are quicker on the draw on this. They see the connection between the legal structure of their rights around privacy, around government, and the government attacking and controlling people. If you're a queer man in America and you live in a state that's banning abortion, you probably happen to also live in a state that's attacking your rights.

JJ: Sure, and in that case you might be better equipped with the language to fight back against things like attacks on bodily autonomy and what that means for pregnant people, too.

OJ: Yes, and that's why we focus on terms like freedom, power, control. It's finding a way to center men -- putting men into the center of the [abortion] story without making the story about men, if that makes sense.

JJ: It does. And I appreciate those efforts at a time when the MAGA movement is using those words to promote a toxic masculinity rooted in brutishness and bravado. I see your organization deploying them toward better ends.

OJ: A lot of young men in particular are susceptible to what that movement is doing because the world around them is changing. We're all socialized into ideas. Some of them are good. Some of them are bad. We think that -- not just until Election Day, but beyond this -- we need to build a plan and a movement to win on this question. To win and fight for young men."
Opinion | Why JD Vance's abortion debate answer sounded eerily familiar,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/vance-abortion-debate-trump-ban-rcna173646,2024-10-02T18:55:09Z,"By Susan Rinkunas, freelance reporter covering abortion, reproductive health, and politics

Ohio Sen. JD Vance acknowledged during Tuesday night's vice presidential debate that Republicans have a believability problem on abortion. It's a notable admission, given that he and his running mate are asking voters to trust that they won't enact a national abortion ban after the demise of Roe v. Wade -- the Supreme Court precedent that the GOP swore was safe, until it wasn't.

Vance said during his debate against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz that the GOP has ""got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue where they, frankly, just don't trust us."" He then claimed that Trump believes the proper way to handle the issue is to ""let the individual states make their abortion policy.""

Trump himself fired off a social media post during the debate that stressed this talking point in capital letters. ""EVERYONE KNOWS I WOULD NOT SUPPORT A FEDERAL ABORTION BAN, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, AND WOULD, IN FACT, VETO IT,"" he wrote, ""BECAUSE IT IS UP TO THE STATES TO DECIDE BASED ON THE WILL OF THEIR VOTERS (THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE!).""

It's not the first time Trump and Vance have downplayed the chances of a national ban. But people have zero reason to trust them: A federal abortion ban is absolutely on the table. From the top of the presidential ticket on down, Republicans are using condescending language eerily similar to what conservatives said in past elections: that Democrats and women, especially, are fear-mongering about a federal ban and are being hysterical.

At a Sept. 23 rally in Pennsylvania, Trump said that ""all [Democrats] can talk about is abortion and it really no longer pertains"" because, he claims, abortion is a state issue and ""a vote of the people."" In a bit of wishcasting, Trump added that if he wins, women ""will no longer be thinking about abortion."" That line was a rehash of another deranged, all-caps Truth Social post from three days earlier -- his repetition of this message shows how desperate he is for voters to believe the lie that abortion access won't get worse if they elect him.

During the presidential debate in September, Trump told moderator Linsey Davis that he ""won't have to"" veto a federal ban, because it would never pass Congress. That pat dismissal came after another answer in which Trump said Vance didn't know his stance on a nationwide law, and twice declined to say he'd veto a ban if it came to his desk.

Since that debate, Vance has parroted the line that congressional action was highly unlikely and really dialed up the dismissiveness -- stopping just short of calling women crazy. He told NBC News' Kristen Welker that a federal abortion ban was ""kind of a ridiculous hypothetical,"" adding that it would get about 10 votes in the Senate. When pressed by Welker, Vance said that Trump ""thinks it's ridiculous to talk about vetoing a piece of legislation that isn't going to come before the president in the first place.""

Ohio GOP Senate candidate Bernie Moreno made explicit what Vance kept implicit: At a Sept. 20 town hall, Moreno said suburban women are ""crazy"" for being single issue voters on abortion. Other Republicans have stuck to minimizing voters' concerns. Trump ally and battleground member of Congress, Florida GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna claimed: ""The Supreme Court said, as a federal legislator, that my opinion on the matter doesn't really matter."" Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., made a similar argument. Nowhere did the court say that Congress can't pass abortion laws. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, suggested that such a bill wouldn't pass: ""Thinking about the politics, it doesn't seem like that's really on the table.""

All this dodging is reminiscent of conservatives' dismissive reassurances in years past when they said Roe would never be overturned. Then-Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., notoriously said in 2018 that women protesting the Brett Kavanaugh nomination were engaging in ""hysteria."" It was ""absurd,"" he argued, to suggest that the Supreme Court would overturn Roe and women would die as a result. Supreme Court architect Leonard Leo told Fox News even before Kavanaugh was chosen that Democrats only talked about the fall of Roe as a ""scare tactic"" to mobilize base voters.

Trump himself famously claimed in a September 2020 debate that neither Joe Biden nor anyone watching could possibly know how his nominee Amy Coney Barrett would rule on Roe. ""There's nothing happening there,"" Trump said. ""You don't know her view."" (This is the same man who, in 2016, said he would only appoint anti-abortion justices and that Roe would be overturned ""automatically."") Just months after that debate, the court took up an abortion case out of Mississippi and, about a year later, Roe was gone -- with Barrett voting to overturn it.

Another telling debate moment, about the very meaning of the word ""ban,"" epitomized the Republicans' shell game. When the moderators asked Vance about his past support for a 15-week abortion ban, he claimed the proposal wasn't a ban but rather a ""minimum national standard."" Maybe Trump and Vance believe ""ban"" means a total abortion ban but make no mistake: A federal ban at any gestation would override state laws, in direct contradiction to their ""states' rights"" argument. Even more chilling, a second Trump administration could also enact a national ban by enforcing the 19th-century Comstock Act, which could ban abortion pills nationwide, if not all procedures.

Two years ago, a nearly 50-year precedent Republicans had argued was safe was overturned. Now, women are bleeding in hospital parking lots, losing fallopian tubes and, yes, dying. Obscenely yet predictably, they're trying to tell women reporters and women voters across the country that everything is fine but we know it's not. Vance is right that people don't trust Republicans on abortion and they shouldn't."
Amber Thurman's family slams GOP on abortion again after Vance equivocates at debate,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/amber-thurman-abortion-republicans-vance-debate-rcna173630,2024-10-02T18:52:20Z,"""Amber Thurman should still be alive,"" Vance said, as he defended the very circumstances that led to her preventable death in 2022.

On the debate stage Tuesday night, Sen. JD Vance found himself agreeing with his opponent, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, that a woman who died from abortion complications in 2022 due to Georgia's draconian abortion ban should still be alive.

""Governor, I agree with you,"" the Republican vice presidential nominee said. ""Amber Thurman should still be alive -- and there are a lot of people who should still be alive -- and I certainly wish that she was.""

Vance's acknowledgement that Thurman's death was preventable and his expressed desire for the GOP to ""earn people's trust back"" on abortion doesn't square with Republican lawmakers actively restricting people's ability to make such choices for themselves. After the debate, Thurman's family issued a statement condemning the GOP for ""seek[ing] to further restrict women's access to necessary healthcare under the false guise of protection.""

""Amber's tragic death was a direct result of Georgia's archaic and dangerously restrictive abortion laws, which denied her the life-saving care she so desperately needed,"" Thurman's family said. ""We are grieving an unimaginable loss that no family should have to endure.""

In the debate, Vance said that the American people ""just don't trust"" Republicans when it comes to abortion, and that he wanted the GOP to become ""pro-family in the fullest sense of the word."" He also claimed that he has never supported a federal abortion ban (Vance did, however, say as recently as 2022 that he ""would like abortion to be illegal nationally"") and defended the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

After lamenting Thurman's death, Vance immediately went on to talk about ""partial birth abortion,"" a highly misleading political term that refers to an abortion that happens later in pregnancy. He also asserted that allowing states to impose their own abortion laws is the right thing to do, despite that being exactly the circumstance that led to Thurman's death."
Why JD Vance's 'fact-checking flashpoint' in the debate mattered,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vances-fact-checking-flashpoint-debate-mattered-rcna173588,2024-10-02T13:23:12Z,"The Ohio senator spent much of the vice presidential debate brazenly lying. No wonder he grew agitated in response to a brief fact-check from a moderator.

About a third of the way into the vice presidential debate, the discussion turned to Springfield, Ohio -- a community torn apart by a racist and false conspiracy theory promoted by the both members of the Republican Party's presidential ticket. It was against this backdrop that Sen. JD Vance, who ostensibly represents the city, referred to ""millions of illegal immigrants"" and parts of the country that have been ""destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border.""

The Republican senator was peddling a multi-layered lie: The border isn't ""open""; the vice president isn't responsible for the nation's immigration laws; and Springfield's Haitian immigrants entered the country legally. Indeed, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic nominee, took the opportunity to note that his rival had ""vilified a large number of people who were here legally.""

At that point, one of the debate's moderators, CBS News' Margaret Brennan, told viewers, ""To clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio, does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status.""

The GOP nominee was not having it. The New York Times referred to it as the debate's ""fact-checking flashpoint,"" and NBC News' report summarized it this way:

""The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" the senator complained.

In reality, even that wasn't quite true: As the Times' report noted, CBS News executives had indicated ahead of the event ""that the moderators may choose to clarify a fuzzy point if they determined it had been left unclear.""

Or put another way, Vance lied about fact-checking after having lied about immigration policy.

But the on-air clash had a larger significance. The Ohio Republican wasn't upset because the debate moderators were wrong; he was upset because the debate moderators were telling the public the truth.

And as Vance made clear over the course of the evening, telling the truth simply wasn't part of his debate strategy.

Much of the post-event analysis has focused on the fact that the young senator appeared polished, smooth, and well-prepared for much of the debate, while Walz, who missed some opportunities, seemed nervous and at times unsteady. Those assessments are largely fair. But more important than the GOP candidate's presentation and style was the fact that he spent much of the evening peddling an alternate reality with little resemblance to the real world.

I recently wrote a book about Republican efforts to rewrite recent history, and even I was amazed at Vance's brazenness when it came to waging war against the recent past.

The GOP nominee lied about Trump and the Affordable Care Act. He lied about the ""peaceful"" transfer of power after Trump's 2020 defeat. He lied about his earlier support for a national abortion ban. He lied about his party's regressive 2017 tax breaks. This is a small sampling from a much longer list of obvious falsehoods.

A separate New York Times analysis said Vance showed ""a knack for revising history,"" which was a polite way of saying the senator spent the evening lying to the electorate about matters large and small. A Washington Post report added that Vance ""dominated on the falsehood meter.""

No wonder he seemed quite agitated about moderators telling the truth: The Republican was busy trying to pull a con on the American electorate, and the CBS News anchors were interfering with his scam.

A couple of weeks ago, Vance conceded that he's willing to ""create stories"" to advance his goals. It was hard not to think of this line during this year's only vice presidential debate."
Opinion | Who won the first (and only) VP debate? It came down to one of the last questions.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/who-won-vp-debate-tonight-vance-lied-walz-polls-rcna173558,2024-10-02T05:15:46Z,"JD Vance is clearly a smooth talker, but eventually his lies caught up with him.

Despite a somewhat slow start and an occasionally halting style, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz produced strong answers on health care, gun violence and reproductive rights. But his standout win -- and indeed one of the most compelling moments of the whole night -- came at the end of the debate, when the issue of election integrity took center stage. Vice presidents are tasked with a final ceremonial role in the process of certifying state electors. Former President Donald Trump tried to exploit this role in 2020 and pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to try to stop the certification. Pence refused. Just as concerning, though, is Trump's reluctance to even admit that he lost the 2020 election.

Tuesday night, Walz asked Sen. JD Vance point-blank whether Trump lost to Joe Biden. It was an easy question, which Vance nonetheless whiffed. Instead of answering with a yes or a no, Vance equivocated, deflected and eventually tried to turn the issue into a confusing and nebulous referendum on ""censorship."" Only then did it become clear that Vance, for all his smooth talking points, is still in many ways just a vessel for Trumpism.

During an extended exchange about the consequences of illegal immigration, CBS News co-moderator Margaret Brennan offered a mild fact-check of Vance, who claimed that in ""Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you've got housing that is totally unaffordable, because we've brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.""

Brennan noted that many of the Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, are in fact there legally. This caused Vance to lose his cool. ""Margaret, the rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" he complained. Then, as Brennan's colleague Norah O'Donnell attempted to move on, Vance pushed back again, trying to tie Haitian migrants in Ohio to illegal immigration. Finally, CBS cut his mic.

Putting aside Vance's snarky treatment of the moderators, his seemingly righteous anger here is misplaced. Vance and Trump have repeatedly claimed that Springfield is overrun with Haitian migrants who are causing all sorts of problems, including, incredibly, stealing and eating pets. But according to the city's Republican mayor, Vance's own office called officials in Springfield to check this pet rumor and was told they were baseless.

It was a strikingly emotional reaction from Vance, who attempted to maintain a mostly collegial demeanor throughout the ""Midwestern nice"" debate. And it came off as both overly defensive and disproportionally condescending.

Vance says he ""never supported a national ban"" on abortion. This is, right off the top, not fully accurate. In 2022, Vance said he ""would like abortion to be illegal nationally.""

But in the same breath, Vance admitted he has supported a ""national minimum standard"" for abortion procedures. A ""national minimum standard"" of six or eight or even 15 weeks, however, would restrict abortion access to such an extent that it would become a form of abortion ban. This is a slick rhetorical trick, but it shouldn't fool people who are listening closely."
Vance's Republican Party sounds pretty nice. Too bad it's fantasy.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jd-vance-republican-party-fantasy-vp-debate-rcna173573,2024-10-02T03:53:04Z,"Like most of the most promising words that come out of his and Trump's mouths, it's absolutely too good to be true.

I can't say I recognize the Republican Party that Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, advocated for on stage during Tuesday night's vice presidential debate. In answer after answer, Vance talked about policies that sounded nothing like anything that any Republican has advocated during this election cycle. It certainly doesn't sound like an administration that his running mate, former President Donald Trump, is likely to put into place should he win in November.

Let's start with abortion, an issue that has been a drag on the GOP since the conservative Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Vance waved off the idea that a national abortion ban is something that many Republicans support. Instead, he tried to humanize the issue, talking about a friend of his who felt she had to terminate a pregnancy and pushing for a string of ""pro-family"" policies that could help American families afford to raise kids. Later on, he added that the federal government should be investing in helping families pay for child care, using funding to help entice more child care workers into the field.

Vance further explained that, of course, the GOP wants to save the Affordable Care Act's ban on insurance companies using pre-existing conditions against people. He said there needs to be more housing made available for people to bring down the amount people are spending to have a roof over their heads. And he implied that Trump facilitated the peaceful transfer of power, downplaying the former president's plot to try to overturn the 2020 election.

On the one hand, this could be what the campaign would have looked like if Trump wasn't the nominee. He's kept the most far-right plank of MAGA extremism, falsely blaming the majority of America's problems on immigration. But he's tried to sand off many of the edges, doing what Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis failed to achieve in his primary campaign, presenting a version of Trumpism that could extend beyond Trump.

But recall Vance's nomination acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in July. None of the sort of ""compassionate conservatism"" redux that he pitched on Tuesday night was present in that speech. And when you hold up his statements to what the GOP has done and proposed in the real world, there's no way to make the two versions align. There is no support among Republicans in Congress for a new federal child care program, nor was there any desire to save the ACA among them. Vance was saying whatever he thought Americans wanted to hear -- same as he will do if ever in a position to challenge Trump as his vice president.

Likewise, Vance worked to assure the audience that there was actually a lot that he and his Democratic opponent, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, agreed on and implied that Trump would look for bipartisan solutions if returned to the White House. It honestly sounded nice, a throwback to a semi-mythological era where things got done in Washington as both sides compromised for the good of the country.

But like most of the most promising words that come out of his and Trump's mouths, it's absolutely too good to be true. I'd love it if the Republican Party that Vance promoted was real. But there is no world in which a second Trump administration leads to a new era of common sense solutions. Vance's claim otherwise may be the biggest, most disturbing lie that he told on stage."
Opinion | This is the rare vice presidential debate that actually matters,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-tim-walz-vp-debate-vice-presidential-rcna172750,2024-10-01T23:15:15Z,"""Ain't nobody coming to see you, Otis"" is an iconic line from ""The Temptations,"" a 1998 NBC miniseries. Delivered by the actor playing David Ruffin, it's a boast that the audience was not paying to see anyone else in the group, just Ruffin. Conventional wisdom says one could apply this logic to Tuesday's vice presidential debate between Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. JD Vance of Ohio.

In a ""normal election,"" a debate between the No. 2s on the ticket would be interesting but not statistically significant. The rule for a vice presidential debate is generally the same election to election: Stick to the top of the ticket's message, draw a contrast with the challenger anchored in that message and, crucially, do no harm. Conventional wisdom says people do not cast ballots because of whom the Democratic or Republican nominee chose as an eventual governing partner. It's the name on the top of the ticket that matters.

However, this is not a normal election, and I disagree with the conventional wisdom. Running mates matter, and tonight's debate is quite significant!

If the nominees' choice for potential governing partner did not matter, then there would no reason to put them on the stage together before the election. Choosing a running mate is the first presidential-level decision a major party nominee makes. It is a statement about who they are and what their agenda and legacy will be if elected president. In selecting the millennial Vance, former President Donald Trump tripled down on Trumpism, cementing it as a key pillar of the Republican Party apparatus and the bedrock of the GOP's next generation.

In selecting Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris signaled that the Democratic tent is big and that she is serious about making her bold plans on child care, reproductive freedom and the economy a reality. Just look at what her running mate has done in Minnesota when it comes to those issues.

Tonight's debate could be the last time voters hear from the campaigns in a forum at which they are mandated to stand next to each other and defend their plans. A literal split screen where the comments of both participants will take center stage. That alone raises the stakes.

Vance will have to answer for his treasure trove of soundbites on everything from likening Trump to Hitler and the racist conspiratorial lies about Haitian people in his home state, to name just two. Walz will be asked to defend his record in Minnesota (because apparently feeding children is too progressive) and his military service record. Regardless of what the moderators ask, a candidate who is well prepared will answer the question then quickly pivot out of the conversation about themselves and back to the issues and their No. 1. This is not always easy to do, but it is critical.

When we first sat down for debate prep in 2020 with then-Sen. Harris, we initially focused on ensuring she knew what then-candidate Joe Biden had said publicly about each issue. It was important she was well versed in his thoughts, so she knew the contours of where and how far to go in discussing any particular topic.

The last thing a campaign wants is the running mate making unauthorized news.

When Vance sat down with my colleague Kristen Welker on ""Meet the Press,"" he emphatically stated Trump would not sign a national abortion ban into law. And yet, during Trump's second debate this cycle, he walked back Vance's answer on national television. Vance will want to avoid making the same mistake tonight, but a large part of being vice president is speaking for the president. If Vance cannot do that in a debate, why would he be able to do it at the White House?

For Walz, he will have to walk the tightrope of part attack dog and part explainer. This is an area where many voters still say they want to know more about Harris' plans, so Walz will have to use his time wisely, find moments to speak directly to the people at home and explain how a prospective Harris-Walz administration would make a difference for families across the country. Much has been said about Walz not being a seasoned debater, but remember he was a high school teacher and a football coach! One could say he honed his oratory skills in the lion's den.

In 2020, during Harris' debate prep, we had many internal discussions about how to handle the question of age if it came up. Tonight, Walz won't have that problem. Harris will turn 60 this month; however, Vance will have to speak to why Americans should trust 78-year-old Donald Trump to sit behind the resolute desk again and if he himself -- a freshman senator with no legislative accomplishments and no other political or government experience -- would actually be ready to lead the country if duty called.

Tonight, while no one will be looking for Otis, all political eyes will be on Tim Walz and JD Vance."

The vice presidential debate Tuesday between Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will likely be your last chance to see the two campaigns square off before the election.

With the two running mates not as well-known as the tops of the tickets, many people will be watching just to get to know them. Others will be looking for how they represent the tickets.

So what should you watch for?

We asked some MSNBC analysts to weigh in on what they will be watching for during the debate. Here's what they said.

Follow live updates covering the 2024 vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz.

There's an underappreciated point of distinction between Walz and Vance: At their debate, one will find it vastly easier to defend his running mate.

When the vice presidential nominees share the stage, I'll be watching to see just how much the Republican senator struggles, not only to defend Donald Trump's latest scandals, lies and missteps, but also to distance himself from his own condemnations of the former president -- some of which he reportedly voiced as recently as 2020.

It's a challenge the Minnesota governor won't have to worry about: He and Kamala Harris were, are and almost certainly will remain on the same page.

Walz has lived a charmed existence since being tapped for VP, but we're about to learn whether he can take a punch. It will be very interesting to see how he handles real scrutiny and tough questions, which he's so far been able to avoid.

Walz's superpower is his relatability. Vance's biggest liability is his inability to connect with human beings. I'll be looking out for Walz to exploit that difference, especially by highlighting some of Vance's more extreme positions on abortion, marriage, reproductive rights and more. We'll see if Vance is suddenly going to run away from all of those Christofascist views that he was so quick to espouse on the right-wing podcast circuit before he became the Republican vice presidential nominee. My guess is that he'll certainly try.

Vance has a hard choice to make: try to show balance and get his historically low favorability numbers up or please Trump. This means he will have to attack but not cough up a hairball. Gov., aka ""Coach,"" Walz must show that he is more than just a nice guy. He must show command of the issues and not fumble the ball.

Quite simply: Will CBS fact-check the candidates, or will it outsource that to the candidates themselves? This seems like an especially important question given JD Vance's serial lies about Haitian immigrants, but it also goes to the question of whether the media has been browbeaten into eschewing its most important function: the dissemination of truth."
"Judge strikes down Georgia's abortion ban, but not quickly enough for some",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/judge-strikes-georgias-abortion-ban-not-quickly-enough-rcna173419,2024-10-01T14:31:15Z,"A court ruling striking down a Republican-imposed abortion ban in Georgia comes too late for Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller.

It's not every day when a judge references ""The Handmaid's Tale"" in a high-profile court ruling, but that's precisely what happened when a judge struck down Georgia's six-week abortion ban. NBC News reported:

As my colleague Lisa Rubin explained in a social media thread that's worth your time, it was quite a ruling from Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who concluded that the meaning of ""liberty"" in Georgia includes ""the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.""

McBurney added that the Republican-imposed ban was ""extreme"" in its ""narrowing of the window of time within which women have the legal ability to end a pregnancy from roughly twenty weeks (i.e., viability) down to a mere six weeks, a point at which many -- if not most -- women are completely unaware or at best unsure if they are pregnant.""

He went on to write that ""for many women, their pregnancy was unintended, unexpected, and often unknown until well after the embryonic heartbeat began. Yet that's too late under the LIFE Act's strictures: these women are now forbidden from undoing that life-altering change of circumstances -- before they even knew the change had occurred.""

""For these women, the liberty of privacy means that they alone should choose whether they serve as human incubators for the five months leading up to viability. It is not for a legislator, a judge, or a Commander from The Handmaid's Tale to tell these women what to do with their bodies during this period when the fetus cannot survive outside the womb any more so than society could -- or should -- force them to serve as a human tissue bank or to give up a kidney for the benefit of another,"" McBurney concluded.

With this in mind, women in Georgia can, for now, terminate unwanted and/or dangerous pregnancies up to 22 weeks.

But in the meantime, it's also worth emphasizing that McBurney's ruling, while heartening and progressive, comes too late for some -- because there's ample evidence to suggest that Georgia's poorly named LIFE Act was responsible for the deaths of at least two local women.

As my MSNBC colleague Sarah Posner recently explained, Amber Nicole Thurman died in 2022 after she failed to receive the medical care she needed -- because her physicians ""were terrified of committing a felony under the state's abortion ban.""

Soon after the public learned of the Thurman tragedy, we were confronted by a related story: Candi Miller also died in Georgia, and as ProPublica reported, maternal health experts have blamed Georgia Republicans' abortion ban.

GOP officials in the state have already vowed to appeal the latest ruling. Watch this space."
Opinion | Trump's brand of masculinity puts his own followers' health at risk,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-masculinity-gun-violence-suicide-prevention-rcna173360,2024-10-01T10:34:37Z,"Trump leads a movement of men who are indifferent to suffering, averse to health guidance and overly agitated. And it's putting America's men in danger.

This post is the second in ""MAGA and Masculinity in 2024,"" an ongoing series examining the societal fallout from right-wing hypermasculinity -- and the people fighting its toxic messaging by positively redefining what it means to be a man. You can read the first post here.

Former President Donald Trump's MAGA movement is a hypermasculine cult of personality, in which men are encouraged to remain stoic, inflict harm on others and ignore experts in favor of the advice of tough-talking podcasters. We've seen the ways this kind of machismo has hurt the movement's perceived nemeses.

Women have suffered -- even died -- while being denied abortion care. And a recent study from the Trevor Project links state-level anti-trans laws to a spike in attempted suicides by trans teenagers. In the name of upholding arcane gender roles, the male-dominated MAGA movement has relentlessly infringed on other people's health and well-being.

But MAGA masculinity poses health risks to its hosts, too, particularly with regard to mental health and susceptibility to gun violence. The MAGA movement's toxic mix of ignorance, vitriol and bravado poses a threat to the men most likely to be drawn to it.

The Covid-19 pandemic was a clear example. Trump and his supporters portrayed defiance of public health measures, like wearing masks and practicing social distancing, as matters of manhood and toughness. Studies have shown that this kind of toxic masculinity was a major driver of vaccine hesitancy in men, which in turn was a contributing factor to the disproportionately high excess death rate for Republicans after the Covid vaccines became available.

Trump has only leaned in to his hypermasculine anti-science agenda by promoting his ""Make America Healthy Again"" slogan with anti-vax conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an archetype for toxic masculinity in his own right, who has reportedly been promised a role in Trump's administration if Trump wins the election and has promoted the idea of banning U.S. agencies from studying infectious diseases.

In 2022, NBC News reported on a study that linked conservative policies to higher mortality rates among working-age people.

According to the NBC News report:

The overwhelming majority of gun violence in the U.S. is committed by men, and activists and researchers have long pointed to hypermasculinity as key to gun culture and a driver of gun violence -- both self-harm and violence committed against others.

And the MAGA movement has done a great deal to discourage men from receiving the mental health care and attention they need to thrive. We see this in the right-wing attack on suicide prevention programs and ""social and emotional learning"" programs in school, which experts have used to help boys better process their emotions. Evidence shows that fear and stigmatization make men less likely to receive the mental health care they need. And yet it even found a way to stigmatize mental health and demonize immigrants at the same time by falsely claiming the Biden administration is welcoming them from ""insane asylums"" and ""mental institutions.""

MAGA men get the message, and it's just one of many ways they've endangered their own health -- and others' -- thanks to their allegiance to Trump."

* I'm planning to have more on this in the morning: ""A judge in Georgia's Fulton County struck down the state's six-week abortion ban Monday, allowing the procedure to resume and making it legal up to 22 weeks of pregnancy. The state law was signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 but didn't take effect until July 2022 after it faced a legal challenge and the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade.""

* To match Trump's total, Senate Democrats have to confirm 21 judicial nominees during the lame-duck session: ""With the 213th federal judge of the Biden era confirmed by the Senate this week, Democrats are now hoping to take advantage of a post-election lame duck session to finish putting their own stamp on the judiciary and match the number of judges appointed during the Trump administration.""

* Readers probably won't remember this, but back in 2021, I had an item about Republican congressional candidate in Florida who threatened to kill a primary rival with a hit squad. I'm mentioning this because that former candidate has now been indicted: ""A former Republican candidate for Congress in Florida has been charged with threatening to send a hit squad to kill an opponent in the race, federal authorities said Friday. William Braddock claimed in a recorded call with a local activist that he would send a Russian and Ukrainian hit squad to kill Anna Paulina Luna during the 2022 primary for a seat in the Clearwater area, the Department of Justice said."""

Opinion | This new law is likely to make Louisiana's maternal mortality problem worse,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/louisiana-abortion-pill-law-misoprostol-obgyn-rcna172561,2024-09-29T14:11:25Z,"By Dr. Veronica Gillispie-Bell, board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist

Imagine a mother on the brink of a fatal hemorrhage after childbirth. The medicine that could save her life is delayed -- not because it isn't available but because of new bureaucratic hurdles that make that medicine more difficult to quickly obtain. Beginning Tuesday, Oct. 1, doctors and nurses in Louisiana will be expected to navigate those unnecessary hurdles, and as an OB-GYN whose patients expect me to give the best care to them (and their babies), I'm convinced that this new law endangers them.

Starting Tuesday, misoprostol and mifepristone will be categorized in Louisiana as Schedule IV medications, that is, categorized as drugs with a potential for abuse and risk of dependence. The new law was drafted by a lawmaker whose brother-in-law was convicted and sentenced to jail after secretly putting misoprostol in his wife's (the lawmaker's sister's) water in a failed attempt to induce an abortion. As horrible as that crime was, it doesn't warrant a law that will make it more likely that women in Louisiana will bleed out after childbirth.

But that's what this new law will do. Health care providers and hospitals will be required to secure misoprostol and mifepristone the same way we secure opioids. On the surface, it might seem like a good idea to put such restrictions on medications used to induce abortions. However, misoprostol plays a crucial role in treating complications during childbirth, when every second counts. Though it's not the first-line treatment, misoprostol is used to treat postpartum hemorrhage, one of the leading causes of maternal mortality.

The U.S. has the highest maternal mortality rate of all high-income countries, and those maternal mortality rates are highest in the Gulf South, a region that includes Louisiana. And, according to data on maternal deaths in the U.S. in 2020, hemorrhage was a leading cause of such deaths. Through state perinatal quality collaboratives, we have made strides in improving severe maternal outcomes, including maternal hemorrhage. We've achieved this by implementing Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM) Patient Safety Bundles that ensure readiness, recognition, response and prevention for every patient, every unit, every time.

The law that goes into effect Tuesday threatens to derail that progress. I'm one of nearly 300 doctors and medical students in Louisiana who expressed this concern to lawmakers during the legislative process and asked them not to pass this bill.

Because misoprostol will now be classified as a Schedule IV medication requiring multiple layers of security to access, the state health department, hospital administrators, attorneys and physicians are left to figure out how to comply with regulations for controlled substances and still keep their patients safe.

This new law is another example of a dangerous trend affecting the medical community -- the creation of laws that impede physicians' and other providers' ability to provide medical care based on their own expertise, using evidence-based guidelines. Across the country, such laws are interrupting the provider-patient relationship -- in ways that are potentially deadly. For example, 15 states have laws that require physicians to tell their patients they can reverse their induced abortion. Not only is there no science to support this claim, a clinical trial to determine the chances of reversal had to be stopped prematurely because so many patients were hemorrhaging.

Not only do laws like the one about to go into effect in Louisiana make childbirth more dangerous, they also accelerate doctor shortages. Public policies that affect physicians' ability to practice medicine are leading to moral distress, fear of imprisonment and plans to stop practicing in specific states. Laws that make criminals of physicians who provide health care consistent with evidence-based practices further contribute to the stressors we physicians already feel. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, the number of medical students applying for residency programs of any specialty has decreased in the states with the strictest abortion laws. Fewer doctors, particularly fewer OB-GYNS, will further worsen the dismal maternal outcomes in states -- and create more maternity care deserts.

In improving maternal and infant outcomes, there is a role for lawmakers to play. Specifically, we need legislative support for the processes and programs we know are reducing maternal mortality and infant mortality. We need lawmakers to expand perinatal quality collaboratives and encourage more hospitals to implement AIM Patient Safety Bundles. We need lawmakers to address the social factors -- access to education, economic stability, child care and transportation -- that are responsible for 80% of poor maternal outcomes for our patients.

The U.S. is the only high-income country that does not guarantee paid parental leave and the only one that does not provide home visits during the postpartum phase.

I believe that all of us -- including physicians and lawmakers -- want to improve the health of women and children. We will only get there if we work together. But if laws that undermine medical practice aren't changed, and urgently, then the progress we've made reducing maternal mortality will be reversed. Lawmakers must engage with physicians to craft evidence-based policies that protect our patients, not increase their risk of death.

I have spent my career ensuring women have options for their care -- obstetric and gynecologic -- and guiding the implementation of evidence-based best practices. I care about the women of Louisiana and beyond who need doctors to treat them, care for them and speak up for them. I urge our legislators to listen to our expertise."

"Opinion | American women don't need a ""protector""  --  especially not one like Trump",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-speech-protect-women-gaslighting-101-rcna172883,2024-09-26T21:05:05Z,"Activists rally during a protest against Donald Trump for his 'treatment of women' in front of Trump Tower in 2016 in New York.Drew Angerer / Getty Images file

Donald Trump is a well-documented liar. From crowd sizes and the outcome of the 2020 presidential election to the estimated 30,573 false or misleading claims the former president told while in office, trying to convince the American public that he has a plan to help them is Trump's political bread and butter.

His falsehoods have been dangerous, inciting riots, bomb threats and foiled kidnapping plots. Others have felt more like performance art, like Trump's comments about the alleged increase in the number of toilet flushes or assertion that windmills cause cancer.

Yet somehow, none of those lies and absurd statements have been as outlandish as Trump's latest attempt to gaslight American women.

On Monday, at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, Trump spoke directly to them, claiming that if elected president he will be their ""protector:""

The man accused of sexual misconduct by at least 26 women and found liable for sexual abuse in a court of law went on to claim that if he is elected president, women ""will no longer have anxiety from all the problems our country has today."" (Trump has denied all such claims of sexual misconduct.)

""You will be protected, and I will be your protector,"" he reiterated. ""Women will be happy, healthy, confident and free. You will no longer be thinking about abortion -- that's all they talk about, abortion -- because we have done something nobody else could have done.""

This pronounced if perhaps ill-advised attempt to appeal to women is intentional. A recent 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll suggests female voters are the reason Vice President Kamala Harris holds a slight 3-point lead over Trump nationwide.

""I always thought that women liked me,"" Trump told the Pennsylvania crowd. ""I never thought I had a problem, but the fake news keeps saying women don't like me. I don't believe it."" (The lady doth protest too much, methinks.)

Another New York Times/Siena College poll conducted in August found that a growing number of voters in swing states consider abortion to be their key voting issue in November. Since June 2022, when Roe was overturned, abortion has been on the ballot in seven states -- and people have voted to protect abortion access every single time.

Of course, as is often the case, Trump's recent comments were also rooted in some truth. For example, Trump claimed that ""women are less healthy"" than they were four years ago. And in a post-Roe world, that is in some ways true. An estimated 25 million women live in a state without access to abortion care, thanks to our would-be ""protector,"" leaving women to bleed out in hospital parking lots, slip into comas due to preventable infections, and in the cases of Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, die, all as a direct result of their states' near-total abortion bans.

Trump claimed that women are ""more stressed and depressed and unhappy, and are less optimistic and confident about their future than they were four years ago."" There is also some truth there. While Trump was busy pontificating on the effectiveness of injecting disinfectant to ""clean the lungs"" during the onset of the pandemic, women were experiencing an increase in depression, anxiety and burnout as they tried to work from home while facilitating virtual learning for their children.

Over 170,000 of us have endured the stress of traveling out-of-state for abortion care. An estimated 5.6 million of us are living in a county with limited or no access to prenatal care. Many of us are choosing to travel significant distances so we can safely give birth in a state that will not force a physician to deny us a life-saving abortion if we experience a devastating pregnancy complication, trying to navigate a world where we have less reproductive rights than our mothers.

So yes, many women are scared and tired and worried about their futures -- at least in part because of Donald Trump, his party and their wildly unpopular policies. And while Trump is seemingly hellbent on trying to cast a spell over women voters, conjuring up lie after lie about how his policies will somehow make us healthier, safer and more free, he is not as powerful as the women past generations of sexist patriarchs burned at the stake.

It's not surprising that a man who chose the president of the He-Man Woman-Haters club as a running mate would cling to the misogynistic belief that women are innately helpless. It's not a shock that instead of listening to women voters when they say, in overwhelming numbers, that they want access to abortion care, Trump continues to misdiagnose both the symptoms and the cure to our post-Roe health crises.

What is shocking is that in spite of all of this, some women -- predominantly white women -- will continue to believe they need a ""protector"" to save them. What they really need is the freedom to protect and save themselves."
Undecided voters could sway the election. Here are the issues that matter to them.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/alex-wagner-michigan-union-workers-swing-state-undecided-voters-rcna172727,2024-09-26T17:33:46Z,"Alex Wagner sat down with union workers in battleground Michigan to find out what's really going on in the minds of undecided voters.

On Tuesday, MSNBC host Alex Wagner hosted a live show from the critical battleground state of Michigan. With less than six weeks to go until Election Day, both Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have made the state a top priority.

Victory in the Great Lakes State is still within reach for both campaigns: A USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll published this week found Harris narrowly leads Trump there, 48% to 45%, well within the poll's 4.4% margin of error.

Wagner sat down with voters from a key constituency being courted by Harris and Trump: union members. According to NBC News exit polls, 21% of people who cast a ballot in Michigan in 2020 came from a household with one or more union members.

Wagner described her conversations with the group as a ""fascinating, complicated snapshot from the frontlines of the 2024 election,"" and said their thoughts were ""critical at understanding why this race remains so very close.""

While some union members Wagner spoke with had already made up their minds on the candidates, many remained undecided. That same USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found 4% of voters in Michigan were still unsure whom they would vote for in November.

""I'm undecided because I haven't seen enough of it yet. I need to pay closer attention and kind of do more independent research before I make my judgment,"" one voter told Wagner.

Immigration was a top concern listed by several undecided voters, especially among those casting their ballot for the first time. Those voters told Wagner they were concerned about the southern border and believed immigrants were taking jobs away from U.S. citizens. (Studies have shown immigrants to the U.S. create more jobs than they take.) Housing and wages were also top issues among first-time, undecided voters.

But, as Wagner noted, perhaps what was just as interesting was what was not on the minds of these voters. The union workers expressed little interest in stories that have dominated media coverage of the campaign, like abortion or Trump's legal troubles.

""I'm not familiar with the charges that are being brought against him"" in connection to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, one voter told Wagner. ""I'm not following that.""

Only one voter in the crowd of nearly 60 raised their hand when asked if they were familiar with the Dobbs decision, the Supreme Court ruling that eliminated the constitutional right to abortion.

""What matters most and what may ultimately determine their votes this year are the conversations they have in their community,"" Wagner observed.

There was also a stark generational divide among the union members, with several older, veteran members throwing their support behind Harris. Younger members tended to be undecided or leaning toward Trump.

""We have to move our country forward,"" one Harris supporter told Wagner, adding: ""Donald Trump is pulling us backwards.""

Another Harris voter referred to his fellow union member's concern over the economy but argued that preserving democracy was a more important issue. ""I'm not going to lose my democracy over the price of a gallon of gas or the price of a loaf of bread,"" he said. ""Democracy is too fragile, and it's too important."""
Opinion | 5 takeaways from Kamala Harris' first solo interview as the Democratic nominee,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/5-takeaways-kamala-harris-msnbc-interview-stephanie-ruhle-rcna172740,2024-09-25T23:49:19Z,"The vice president made a convincing case for why voters should trust her more than Donald Trump to care more about their economic worries.

MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle spoke with Vice President Kamala Harris following the Democratic presidential nominee's speech at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, where she laid out an economic vision for her administration if elected.

If there was an overarching theme to the interview, it was the disconnect between the two parties' records on the economy, the public's perception of those records and the irony that some middle-class people -- including some union members -- believe former President Donald Trump has a greater understanding of their struggles than the vice president.

Here are five takeaways from this exclusive interview, her first solo sit-down since she became the Democratic nominee.

Ruhle pointed out during the interview that ""most likely voters still think Donald Trump is better to handle the economy."" But Harris articulated how she comes from a background that's far more relatable to the struggles of most Americans.

""Part of the reason I even talk about working at McDonald's is that there are people who work at McDonald's in our country there who are trying to raise a family. I worked there as a student. I was a kid who worked there."" Harris added that some families are ""trying to raise families and pay rent"" based on that income. ""I think part of the difference between me and my opponent includes our perspective on the needs of the American people and what our responsibility is to meet those needs.""

As Helaine Olen noted in an MSNBC column in April, after California's $20-an-hour minimum wage for fast-food workers became law, the era of mostly teenagers working fast-food jobs after high school was rendered obsolete, and ""well over half of California's fast-food workers are people of color and over 25.""

In an interview in which Harris often stuck to well-rehearsed talking points, her answer about her time at McDonald's came off as the most genuine, and it was the best evidence that she sees struggling people not as abstractions but as real human beings.

Harris won her debate against Trump by triggering him into a rambling rage after she characterized his ""big, beautiful"" rallies as small, boring affairs that have many attendees seeking the exit. It was amusing, then, to see her sandwich that same point in an answer about how she's going to keep reminding people that Trump is lying about his economic record and lying when he says he stands with workers.

Harris described the ""challenge"" she faces to ""earn the vote of everybody."" She argued that ""regardless of what somebody says in a small rally somewhere ... part of what I'm doing in this campaign is to remind people, just like here in Pittsburgh, of the reality of who has stood with union labor, who stands for American manufacturing, who stands for American jobs.""

The only two words Trump is likely to hear are ""small rally.""

When the vice president said Trump had ""left us with the worst unemploy,et rate since the Great Depression,"" Ruhle pointed out that that dramatic downturn happened during the height of the pandemic.

""Even before the pandemic, he lost manufacturing jobs,"" Harris countered. His raison d'√™tre as president, Harris essentially argued, was to provide ""tax cuts for the billionaires and the top corporations in our country.""

When Ruhle asked Harris about the most recent time she'd made a gut decision, she answered, ""Probably the biggest gut decision I've made most recently is to choose my running mate. There were lots of good, incredible candidates, and ultimately that came down to the gut decision.""

Though Republicans tried to make hay with the preposterous claim that antisemitism made Harris (who is married to a Jewish man) pick Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, picking Walz has proven to be a smart political choice, and it demonstrated she can make wise decisions in a limited amount of time.

Trump has recently boasted that he'll be women's protector. Harris, who has made abortion rights a centerpiece of her campaign, said that's rich coming from a man who once said women who get abortions should be prosecuted and whose Supreme Court appointees helped dismantle Roe v. Wade.

But Ruhle's question about Trump's statement prompted what was perhaps Harris' best line of the interview: ""I don't think the women of America need him to say he's going to protect them. The women of America need him to trust them."""
Trump has adopted the creepy rhetoric of pickup artists to woo women voters,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-protector-women-pickup-artists-rhetoric-rcna172681,2024-09-25T19:38:48Z,"It's a big red flag that Donald Trump's ""protector"" line sounds like the misogynistic ""pickup artists"" who are popular in the MAGA movement.

Former President Donald Trump's paternalistic remark about his intention to be a ""protector"" for women -- who he claimed are lonely, stressed, depressed and unhappy -- has garnered predictable backlash since the weekend.

""You will no longer be abandoned, lonely or scared. You will no longer be in danger. ... You will no longer have anxiety from all of the problems our country has today,"" Trump said. ""You will be protected, and I will be your protector.""

Trump made the context for those assurances crystal clear when he added that women will ""no longer be thinking about abortion"" if he's elected. New York magazine's Jonathan Chait had an insightful analogy when he compared the comment to ""creepy abuser logic.""

Chait is spot-on, and when I heard Trump's comments, they reminded me of the pickup artists who've become popular in the MAGA movement. These characters are men who market themselves as tutors for men who want to learn how to attract women. Their tactics usually rely on infantilizing women and their desires, promoting the idea that men need to police women's behavior, and, oddly enough, using insults (known as negging) to manipulate women's affection. It's misogynistic stuff.

And Trump's well-documented spiritual alignment with this community has been ongoing for years, most notably when Esquire asked in 2016 if Trump was ""the World's Greatest Pickup Artist."" But more links between Trump and pickup artists have become apparent in recent years.

Zak Folkman, a business partner in Trump's latest cryptocurrency scheme, is a controversial pickup artist whose courses purportedly teach men how to ""Become the Ultimate Alpha Male."" Wired recently reported on the ways in which Trump's rhetoric mirrors notorious pickup artist Andrew Tate's. Another pickup artist, Tariq Nasheed, is known for peddling pro-Trump propaganda and leads the MAGA-friendly group Foundational Black Americans, which works to pit Black Americans against immigrants. Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, also has plenty of ties to the ""manosphere,"" a group of misogynistic content creators that includes several self-styled pickup artists. And back in 2021, Jezebel noted a pair of pickup artists who appeared at the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection.

Indeed, Trump's portrayal of himself as some kind of superhero who can solve every single American woman's problems is emblematic of a broader movement of misogynistic men who see women as meek targets for their manipulation.

It's a topic the ReidOut Blog will explore in more depth over the next few weeks. Stay tuned."
Opinion | Joe Manchin has refused to endorse Kamala Harris for the most preposterous reason,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/joe-manchin-endorse-kamala-harris-filibuster-rcna172529,2024-09-25T14:38:57Z,"Joe Manchin said he can't endorse Kamala Harris. The reason is terrible.

Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.V., has announced he won't be endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris for president. Unfortunately, he's refraining from backing her for one of the most empty-headed reasons imaginable.

While earlier this month Manchin seemed to hint that he'd considering endorsing Harris, he said on Tuesday that he had decided against it because of her call for ending the filibuster to pass federal legislation protecting abortion rights.

""Shame on her,"" he told CNN. ""She knows the filibuster is the Holy Grail of democracy. It's the only thing that keeps us talking and working together. If she gets rid of that, then this would be the House on steroids.""

He continued: ""I think that basically can destroy our country, and my country is more important to me than any one person or any one person's ideology. ... I think it's the most horrible thing.""

Manchin's announcement was peculiar in that Harris has called for modifying the filibuster in order to pass abortion rights (and voting rights legislation) for years. Why is he focusing on this now? Manchin told CNN that he had hoped that as a Democratic presidential candidate she might reverse course on that position, but when she called for eliminating ""the filibuster for Roe"" during a recent interview with Wisconsin Public Radio he decided that he could no longer consider endorsing her.

But on a more substantive level, Manchin's conception of the filibuster as ""the Holy Grail"" of democracy is, well, perplexing.

The bedrock principles of democracy are popular representation and majority rule. The filibuster, however, has effectively become a way for the minority party in the Senate to thwart simple majority rule. It is an idiosyncratic procedural tool designed to delay or block a vote on a bill. While, theoretically, the filibuster could be used to encourage broader consensus on particularly big and thorny issues, in modern times it has effectively become a burdensome 60-vote supermajority threshold for passing all legislation, and a bottleneck that kills most significant bills and makes major reforms virtually impossible.

What makes the filibuster even worse is that it is used in a legislative body that already shuns the principle of popular representation and disenfranchises millions of Americans because it overrepresents certain communities (people in small states and rural areas), while essentially making the votes of people in more populated states and areas count less. In other words, Manchin's democratic ""Holy Grail"" is in fact a way for minority parties in a minoritarian institution to hold the governing party hostage.

Manchin and many other advocates for the filibuster use language that can imply that the filibuster was part of the foundational vision for American democratic life.

It was not. The filibuster is not in the Constitution, and it was not some key part of the Founding Fathers' vision for America. (Some scholars have even argued that it is unconstitutional.) As the political scientist Sarah Binder has pointed out, the filibuster was an accidental byproduct of an attempt to simplify rules about cutting off debate in the Senate in the early 19th century. One indicator that it wasn't deliberate is that the first live filibusters didn't take place until decades after the rule change that allowed them to even emerge as a legislative strategy; it was discovered as a way to block legislation by creative lawmakers.

Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., piled onto Harris with a post on X saying that eliminating the filibuster to pass abortion rights was a ""an absolutely terrible"" idea because ""eliminating the filibuster to codify Roe v. Wade also enables a future Congress to ban all abortion nationwide.""

Sinema is right that the elimination of the filibuster could cut both ways. But most Republicans -- including former President Donald Trump -- know that seeking a federal elimination of abortion rights could be an extinction-level event for Republicans in federal office. Moreover, if Democrats succeed at enshrining abortion protections in the law, it will become far more politically toxic for Republicans to seek their removal, since it is easier politically to defend widely used rights and services than it is to dismantle them. (Consider, for example, the resilience of Obamacare; as flawed as it is, Democrats have succeeded in mobilizing voters against the GOP based on the argument that Republicans want to eliminate it.)

But Manchin shouldn't have to agree with all my points about the filibuster to see how he's lost sight of the bigger picture about drawing lines in the sand over American democracy.

There are only two candidates with a chance of winning on Election Day. One of them has committed to abiding by the results of the election, the other has not. We can debate the trade-offs of filibuster reform, and filibuster reform can itself be rolled back. But there is no debate to be had about accepting vote counts, and it's a lot harder for America to come back from a potential second coup attempt in two elections. Manchin's rhetoric about Harris undermining American democracy looks mighty short-sighted in light of the clear and present danger that Trump poses to it."
Jen Psaki: Donald Trump wants to control the narrative. We shouldn't let him.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/harris-trump-distraction-haitian-immigrants-lies-abortion-rcna172285,2024-09-25T10:45:41Z,"I think it's safe to say that right now Donald Trump would desperately like us -- and all of you -- to be talking about certain things, like the crazy conspiracies about the Haitian community in Springfield, Ohio, or his blatantly antisemitic remarks about Jewish voters.

Trump wants all of us to focus on the circus, and on Saturday, both the ringmaster and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, brought that circus to their rallies.

At an event in North Carolina, Trump accused migrants of ""attacking villages"" throughout the Midwest. In Pennsylvania, Vance doubled down on those conspiracy theories. ""I challenge you to go to Springfield, Ohio, which has been overwhelmed by 20,000 Haitians. Go to any community that has been overwhelmed by Kamala Harris' illegal alien policies and tell me that these are stories made up by politicians,"" Vance told supporters.

To set the record straight, no, ""villages"" aren't being attacked by migrants and yes, politicians, like them, are making things up about Springfield, but that's because Trump wants that to be the focus right now. It's what he wants everyone talking about.

I know that may bend the mind; I mean, why on earth would a presidential candidate want to draw attention to his xenophobia, racism, antisemitism and misogyny? Well, of course, Trump is not a normal candidate. To him, all press is good press. All attention is good attention. To Trump, the only way to win is to own the spotlight no matter how harsh it is.

His theory goes a little like this: If we are all talking about his crazy and offensive comments, if we are talking about the circus, then we're not talking about everything else.

Because there is a whole lot that he doesn't want us to be talking about right now. He doesn't want us to talk about Harris inching ahead in the polls after beating him like a drum on the debate stage. Like the new national poll from NBC News that shows Harris leading Trump 49% to 44% -- while that result is within the margin of error, it shows a clear shift in Harris' favor. Or the number in that same poll that shows her favorability rising more quickly than any politician since George W. Bush after 9/11. Or the one that shows voters increasingly see her as the candidate of change.

And he doesn't want us to talk about how he's too chicken to debate Harris again after she accepted an invitation for a rematch from CNN on Saturday.

He certainly doesn't want us to talk about his dangerous and unpopular opposition to abortion rights and the preventable deaths we are learning about in Georgia. I mean, he literally posted this weekend, in all caps, telling women that if he wins, ""YOU WILL NO LONGER BE THINKING ABOUT ABORTION."" Trump was apparently so pleased with that ridiculous statement that he repeated it verbatim on Saturday in North Carolina.

Trump also doesn't want us to talk about the overt effort from his supporters to tamper with the election if they don't like the outcome. And that's exactly what the Trump-friendly election board in Georgia did on Friday when they ordered the hand-counting of ballots -- a move that is likely to cause chaos and delay the reporting of results in a critical state.

And Trump definitely doesn't want us to talk about his handpicked guy running for governor in North Carolina, Mark Robinson. You know, the guy who, according to CNN, called himself a ""Black Nazi"" on a porn site and who, according to The Washington Post, praised Mein Kampf on that same site.

So yes, Trump wants attention but he wants it on his rhetoric, not his record. On his words, but not their consequences. Because the consequences are a town like Springfield getting torn apart, a Republican Party represented by guys like Robinson and a country where women die waiting for medical care.

That's what Trump really does not want us talking about. But as voters begin voting and Election Day gets closer and closer, that is where our focus should be."
GOP's Moreno: Women's focus on abortion rights is 'a little crazy',MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gops-moreno-womens-focus-abortion-rights-little-crazy-rcna172405,2024-09-24T14:08:09Z,"Just when it seemed Republicans' rhetoric on abortion rights couldn't get much worse, Donald Trump and Ohio's Bernie Moreno weighed in with new comments.

By all accounts, Republicans' optimism about taking control of the U.S. Senate is reaching new heights. Axios reported this week, for example, that GOP senators are privately telling major donors that the party will flip a seat in West Virginia; the Montana race is nearly in the bag; and the contest in Ohio against Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is looking increasingly good for the GOP.

The party might want to hesitate, however, before getting too excited about that last one. WCMH, the NBC affiliate in Columbus, Ohio, reported:

""You know, the left has a lot of single-issue voters,"" Moreno said late last week at a town hall-style event. ""Sadly, by the way, there's a lot of suburban women, a lot of suburban women that are like, 'Listen, abortion is it. If I can't have an abortion in this country whenever I want, I will vote for anybody else.' ... OK. It's a little crazy by the way, but -- especially for women that are like past 50 -- I'm thinking to myself, 'I don't think that's an issue for you.'""

The Republican candidate's campaign spokesperson later clarified that Moreno was making ""a tongue-in-cheek joke.""

Yes, how hilarious. A far-right Senate candidate described women's interest in abortion rights as ""a little crazy"" and suggested post-menopausal women should probably be indifferent to the future of reproductive rights in the United States -- because, you know, they can't get pregnant.

What a cut-up.

In case this isn't obvious, it was just last year when voters in the Buckeye State voted on a statewide measure on abortion, and reproductive rights advocates scored a big victory, despite Ohio's shift to ""red state"" status. Those are, of course, many of the same voters Moreno is appealing to now.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump, who spent much of the weekend telling women they'll soon ""no longer be thinking about abortion,"" kept the rhetorical push going at his latest rally in Pennsylvania, assuring women voters, ""You will be protected, and I will be your protector,"" apparently unaware of how creepy that sounded. It was also a curious message, given that a jury last year found the former president liable for sexual abuse.

In the same remarks, the Republican candidate added, in reference to Democrats, ""All they can talk about is abortion. That's all they talk about. And it really no longer pertains.""

Ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, Republicans were heavily invested in the idea that abortion rights simply didn't matter that much to the American public. Ahead of the 2024 elections, prominent GOP voices are pushing a slightly different line, arguing that women shouldn't care that much about abortion rights.

Two years ago, the party's assumptions proved faulty. We'll learn in six weeks whether Republicans have made effectively the same mistake twice."
Opinion | Kamala Harris knows how to talk about guns  --  she should do it more often,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-guns-second-amendment-oprah-interview-rcna172298,2024-09-24T11:19:37Z,"Here's one I didn't have on my bingo card for 2024: Vice President Kamala Harris teaching liberals how to talk about guns. For a politician with a reputation for word salads and evasions, her recent comments on the Second Amendment have been refreshingly clear and straightforward, even if they were also relatively brief.

The first of those came during the debate with former President Donald Trump earlier this month, following his charges that she ""wants to confiscate your guns."" A few minutes later, she answered the hyperbolic accusation, though it was easy to miss in the midst of a chaotic exchange. ""Tim Walz and I are both gun owners,"" Harris said. ""We're not taking anybody's guns away.""

Nobody could be surprised that Walz, a quintessential Minnesota Guy, owns guns. Harris, though, is supposed to be a California communist -- at least in the minds of a lot of her MAGA haters. In fact, Harris has spoken about gun ownership before. She just wasn't the Democratic presidential nominee at the time.

A few days after the debate with Trump, Harris appeared at an event with Oprah Winfrey, where she went into a little more detail about what her gun was for.

""I'm a gun owner, too. If somebody breaks in my house, they're getting shot,"" she said. Laughing along with Winfrey, Harris seemed to recognize how her comment could be construed. ""I probably should not have said that. My staff will deal with that later,"" she went on to say dismissively, convulsing with genuine, unrehearsed laughter.

Actually, Madame Vice President, and with all due respect, you should have said that much earlier. And you should say it again.

Democrats have struggled to talk about the Second Amendment for ages. In one highly controversial moment during the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama mused that people in the Midwest ""cling to guns or religion"" as a salve for the ruined economy of their region. It was an arrogant, dismissive remark that suggested a lack of intellectual curiosity.

I'm not a gun owner, but I've shot for sport in eastern Montana, western Virginia and elsewhere. I've spent enough time in the Mountain West to know that guns are as commonplace there as Ford F-150s. Friends and family in the New York area own guns, too. None of them are simplistic rubes of the kind Obama seemed to imagine. Neither is Harris, for that matter.

It's worth noting that even as she has touted her own gun ownership, Harris has made clear that she supports a ban on assault weapons, a Clinton-era policy that massively reduced mass shootings. Reinstating a ban would do nothing about the thousands of handgun deaths, including suicides, but it would still help. So would background checks, which Harris also supports.

The American people support these measures, too. In fact, we are much closer to a consensus on guns than partisans on either side would have you believe. And that consensus resides where Harris appears to already be: Let's keep guns legal, but let's also do what we can to keep guns out of the hands of people who are demonstrably dangerous, abusive or mentally ill.

After every mass shooting, conservatives say that the last of these is the root cause. It's better than ""thoughts and prayers"" but still insufficient. After all, our incidence of gun deaths are so much higher than that of other developed nations that no disparity in psychiatric diagnoses could account for them. And many experts say that access to guns, not mental health, is the key determinant in gun violence rates.

Yet if conservatives are committed to this approach, Harris should acknowledge as much, making more thorough psychiatric treatment -- and record-keeping -- part of her gun control policy package. That package will go nowhere without Republicans, many of whom know perfectly well that we need stricter gun laws but are afraid to say so because they fear that the National Rifle Association will run a primary challenger against them. The more she can do to soften these reasonable conservatives' fears, the further she will get.

Gun control is one of many issues -- abortion, taxation, etc. -- where Americans are far less divided than you might believe if you spent an evening imbibing politics-related social media, rife with furious takes and outrageous clips, everyone dunking on everyone else with the latest memes. That isn't real life, though. In many ways, we remain a centrist nation, moving cautiously to the left on social and economic issues while retaining a fundamentally conservative temperament that makes us allergic to rapid change.

The carefree way Harris discussed her own relationship to the Second Amendment made clear that she grasps this essential quality of the American mainstream -- certainly more than Trump does. MAGA understudies like Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis are especially out of the norm, representing a creepy authoritarian nationalism that plays a lot better on 4chan than it does in Peoria.

Harris, on the other hand, is the suburban normie, the soccer mom in Philadelphia or Milwaukee -- in other words, an ordinary American."
Trump to women: You'll soon 'no longer be thinking about abortion',MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-women-ll-soon-no-longer-thinking-abortion-rcna172219,2024-09-23T15:13:26Z,"Exit polls from the 2016 elections suggest Donald Trump lost women voters to Hillary Clinton by roughly 12 points. Four years later, exit polls found the Republican lost women voters to Joe Biden by roughly 15 points. Could the trend become even worse for the former president?

It's a distinct possibility. Election Day is still six weeks away, but the latest national NBC News poll showed Trump trailing Kamala Harris by 21 points among women voters.

The good news for Republicans is that their party's candidate appears to be aware of the problem is taking steps to address the gender gap. The bad news for the GOP is that Trump's solution is a cringeworthy mess. The Wall Street Journal reported:

Former President Donald Trump claimed women won't think about abortion anymore if he wins the election, a day after Vice President Kamala Harris argued he was the ""architect"" of a reproductive healthcare crisis. ... The comments underscored Trump's anxiety over the issue, which has proven to be a powerful motivator for women and could play a major role in the suburban areas that may decide the election.

Shortly before midnight on Friday, Trump published a 183-word screed to his social media platform, published entirely in capital letters, which is worth reading just to fully appreciate his hysterics.

To briefly summarize the Republican's pitch, however, Trump apparently wants women voters to know a few things:

In case that was too subtle, a day later, the GOP nominee held a rally in North Carolina, where he echoed the missive he published online the night before, reading it nearly word for word.

The Wall Street Journal's report noted that the Harris campaign ""quickly circulated his remarks"" -- and when a rival candidate wants everyone to know what you've said, it's probably not because you've said something smart.

To be sure, Trump covered a lot of nonsensical ground with his message. He began by telling women how awful their lives are, prompting a Harris campaign spokeswoman to say, ""After ripping away our reproductive freedom, now he's trying to tell us how to think.""

His brazen lie about Democrats and infanticide was obviously no better.

What's more, the idea that women will simply stop thinking about abortion, because it will be a state-based issue, doesn't make any sense at all, since it's currently a state-based issue, and millions of American women continue to make clear that they're still thinking about reproductive rights.

But one of the most striking parts of the Republican's pitch was his insistence that he'll make their lives ""happy, beautiful, and great.""

In case anyone has forgotten, Trump was actually president in the recent past, and to the extent that he tried to make women's lives happy, beautiful, and great, he failed spectacularly. In fact, polls suggest he remained unpopular with most women throughout his White House tenure, and it was women who helped show him the door in the 2020 elections.

Trump appears to be under the impression that women have forgotten all about this. His 21-point deficit against Harris suggests they have not."
Opinion | JD Vance just gave Kamala Harris another huge opportunity,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-harris-vance-health-care-rcna171735,2024-09-23T12:34:49Z,"Donald Trump's running mate is reviving health care as an issue -- and it's a huge opportunity for Democrats.

When Donald Trump stammered at the recent presidential debate that he had ""concepts of a plan"" for Americans' health care, he came across like a child who had forgotten his homework. But thanks to his campaign and his running mate JD Vance, we know now the Republican ticket really does have some ""concepts."" Those concepts are bringing health care into the election -- and presenting a tremendous opportunity to Vice President Kamala Harris.

Last Sunday, Vance raised the eyebrows of anyone familiar with health care policy when he told NBC's Kristen Welker about Trump's ""deregulatory agenda."" ""A young American doesn't have the same health care needs as a 65-year-old American,"" he told Welker. ""We want to make sure everybody is covered. But the best way to do that is to actually promote some more choice in our health care system and not have a 'one size fits all' approach that puts a lot of people into the same insurance pools, into the same risk pools, that actually makes it harder for people to make the right choices for their families.""

It wasn't clear in the moment whether Vance's views matched Trump's. As is often the case, the former president didn't mention any specifics in his nonanswer at the debate, and Vance has run ahead of Trump before. When asked at the debate about Vance's claim that Trump would veto a national abortion ban, the latter responded, ""Well, I didn't discuss it with JD.""

But it soon became clear that Trump and Vance are singing from the same hymnal. In a story from Semafor published Wednesday, a Trump spokesman refused to provide specific details but ""did tell Semafor that the president and Vance were broadly aligned on health care policy."" That afternoon at a campaign stop in North Carolina, Vance reiterated the proposed overhaul. ""If you only go to the doctor once a year, you're going to need a different health care plan than somebody who goes to the doctor 14 times a year,"" he argued, ""because they've got chronic pain, or they've got some other chronic condition. That's the biggest and most important thing that we have to change.""

In other words, Vance confirmed that Trump wants to revive one of the worst aspects of American health care before the Affordable Care Act.

Unlike the U.S., other developed countries' health care systems run the gamut from government-run single-payer programs to private, heavily regulated insurers. As journalist Jonathan Cohn notes in his book chronicling the ACA's conception and passage, these varied systems share several features: ""Most importantly, everybody pays into these systems, and everybody gets coverage from them, so that money from the young and healthy effectively covers bills for the old and sick.""

The American system developed differently. Beginning in the 1930s, employers offered their workers insurance plans, which allowed some pooling of risk. But for individuals who had to buy coverage directly, insurers could charge them based on so-called pre-existing medical conditions and risk factors like their age, where they worked and their family history. ""By the late 1950s, in large swaths of the country,"" Cohn writes, ""people at high risk of medical expenses had no realistic way to get comprehensive insurance."" When Democrats, notably President Harry Truman, sought to establish a national insurance program, it was blocked by an alliance of Republicans, conservative Southern Democrats and business lobbies.

Lyndon Johnson's presidency chipped away at this state of affairs via the establishment of Medicaid and Medicare. (To oppose the latter program, the American Medical Association enlisted actor Ronald Reagan, who predicted that Medicare's passage would herald the end of an America ""when men were free."") But by the time Barack Obama became president, millions of Americans again could not afford insurance. Millions more were stuck with plans that were either incredibly expensive or provided little actual coverage -- or both.

The ACA addressed these issues by prohibiting discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions. It required all plans to offer certain ""essential benefits"" and limited premium increases based on age.

The Trump-Vance proposal would undo all of this. If you're old or sick, you'd pay more, likely much more. If you're young and healthy, you'd pay less in the short term -- until you inevitably become old and/or sick. The only way to keep the high-risk pools from falling apart would be massive government subsidies, which Republicans oppose.

Few voters want to return to the pre-ACA system. More than 60% of Americans now hold a favorable view of the law. The protections for pre-existing conditions are its most popular aspect, with majority support even among Republicans. No wonder then that for nearly a decade, Trump has promised to replace the Affordable Care Act with ""something terrific"" -- without having articulated a single program in all that time.

""The Harris campaign had already scheduled a week of events focused on Trump's debate comments and past record on health care"" before Vance's comments, reports The Washington Post. So this proposal to go back to the days before the ACA is a gift to the vice president, who has made ""not going back"" a mantra of her campaign. Obamacare is more popular than ever, voters trust Harris more on health care, and most voters still remember the many deficiencies of the pre-ACA system. She can even point out its echoes of a Project 2025 proposal, which would ""separate the subsidized ACA exchange market from the nonsubsidized insurance market.""

And health care's salience as an issue goes beyond the electioneering of the campaign's final six weeks. Health care may not be voters' top concern anymore, but the cost of living is. The ACA, for all its positives, did not change the fact that Americans still pay more than citizens of peer nations for health care, only to have worse outcomes to show for it. Harris herself knows much remains to be done, having proposed a universal coverage plan when she ran for president in 2020.

The groundwork for the next great, overdue reform of American health care starts now."
"Opinion | In Mark Robinson's fall, Republicans are getting what they asked for",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/mark-robinson-republicans-north-carolina-porn-forum-rcna171979,2024-09-20T21:09:46Z,"The latest scandal for the fundamentalist Christian running for governor in North Carolina could have a dramatic impact on the GOP's chances in the battleground state.

Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, Republican candidate for governor of North Carolina, can no longer win a political race in the state -- or anywhere in America, for that matter.

Not after CNN uncovered sexually explicit and inflammatory posts he reportedly wrote in the comments of a pornographic website. According to the report, Robinson -- who's campaigned as a fundamentalist, Christian conservative -- commented frequently between 2008 and 2012 on a site called ""Nude Africa.""

Robinson has denied he is the author of the posts, saying ""these are not the words of Mark Robinson"" and dismissing the report as ""salacious tabloid trash."" But CNN's reporters documented several connections between the candidate, the email he used to register with the sites and biographical details posted to the various profiles.

The porn chatroom posts identified as Robinson's are graphic, sexually menacing and demeaning to women. If you track them down, you can't unsee them.

He commented on his love for transgender pornography, called himself a ""Black Nazi,"" made profane comments about a woman's alleged rape, referred to Martin Luther King Jr. by a racial slur (note that this article later quotes some of that language, which readers may find offensive), and even reminisced graphically about a teenage experience peeping on a women's locker room at a local college.

These are just the tip of a nasty iceberg. CNN acknowledged many of the things Robinson is accused of writing were so lurid, they couldn't be published.

If these statements offend you, congratulations: You are a thinking, feeling person. You're holding your elected leaders to a higher standard than the North Carolina Republican Party, which doubled down on its support for Robinson on Thursday night after the report was published. Most folks wouldn't let the guy in this story watch their dog, much less lead their state.

North Carolina Republicans had few realistic options for replacing Robinson, with the state deadline for candidates to withdraw just hours away when the story dropped. But there's no reason to think they would have pushed him out anyway. They've stuck with him through every disturbing scandal so far, and there have been a lot.

His candidacy was damaged and unhinged from the start, fetishizing violence, demonizing gay people and talking about women like they're trash. The party has had literally dozens of opportunities to disavow Robinson: when he said some folks out there ""need killing,"" when he fantasized about murdering people in the government with his AR-15, when he called LGBTQ people ""maggots,"" when he said women getting abortions just need to keep their ""skirt down.""

The party routinely looked past Robinson's breathtaking hypocrisy. A 2022 story revealed that Robinson, who has referred to abortion as ""murder"" and abortion doctors as ""butchers,"" once paid for a girlfriend's abortion. He's implied gender-neutral restrooms are a breeding ground for perverts. He's said women need protection from those perverts, but boasted online about spying on college girls in a locker room, according to CNN. He described LGBTQ+ people as ""maggots"" but according to that same CNN report, he once wrote about his enjoyment of pornography that features trans people, enthusiastically describing himself as a ""perv.""

Many of Robinson's Republican peers have held him up as a champion, though, an example of America at its finest. At one stump speech in North Carolina, Donald Trump said Robinson was ""like a fine wine.""

""You have to cherish him,"" Trump said. ""He's an outstanding person. I've gotten to know him so well.""

Like Trump, Robinson cast himself as an uncensored outsider who traded put-downs for policy; a conservative, chest-thumping warrior who seemed to be the beneficiary of limitless forgiveness for his transgressions.

North Carolina Republicans have shown that the MAGA movement doesn't believe in such limits. But voters will, which is why Republicans and Robinson will stay this way, locked in a doomed embrace, through Election Day. This is what rigor mortis looks like in a campaign.

The only question is whether Republicans up and down the ticket, including Trump, will get dragged down with him. Trump is virtually tied with Kamala Harris in this battleground state and some conservatives are worried Robinson's troubles will keep Trump voters at home. On Thursday night, GOP candidates running for office in North Carolina were trying to scrub their social media profiles of references to Robinson, like rats fleeing a sinking ship.

A candidate who talks about the historic nature of his candidacy -- if he wins, he would be the first Black governor in the state's history -- once allegedly wrote, ""Slavery is not bad. Some people need to be slaves. I wish they would bring it (slavery) back. I would certainly buy a few."" The man whom Trump praised as ""MLK on steroids"" once referred to Martin Luther King Jr. as ""Martin Lucifer Koon.""

Coincidentally, I interviewed Martin Luther King III on Thursday about a trip he's making to North Carolina this weekend to speak to rural communities of color about the election. The CNN story hadn't broken yet but the word was out that it contained hateful descriptions of his late father.

When I asked him about it, he was tactful, which isn't easy when someone says something awful about your dad.

""Clearly, it feels like this rejection is emerging for this candidacy,"" King said. ""And at some point, it will be looked at as a disaster."""
New allegations add to Mark Robinson's troubles in North Carolina,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/mark-robinson-drops-out-north-carolina-governor-election-rcna171856,2024-09-19T20:59:57Z,"As North Carolina's Mark Robinson confronts brutal new allegations, the future of his Republican gubernatorial campaign is in doubt.

Mark Robinson's Republican gubernatorial campaign in North Carolina was already struggling. In fact, while the Tar Heel State appears to be highly competitive at the presidential level this year, every recent poll has shown Robinson trailing Democratic state Attorney General Josh Stein -- in some surveys, by double-digit margins.

But the right-wing candidate's difficulties are far from over. The latest reporting from CNN has made matters even worse for Robinson.

Robinson denied the accuracy of the reporting, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, though CNN added that the network was able to verify the username belonged to Robinson ""by matching a litany of biographical details and a shared email address between the two.""

Complicating matters, Politico also published a new report, which has also not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, alleging that an email address belonging to Robinson ""was registered on Ashley Madison, a website designed for married people seeking affairs.""

The report added that an adviser to the gubernatorial candidate confirmed to Politico that ""the email address in question belongs to Robinson.""

To be sure, the extremist candidate was a scandalous figure before these revelations reached the public. What's more, the GOP candidate has been forced to confront a variety of controversies in recent weeks, related to everything from pornography to abortion, bankruptcies to contraception.

But by any fair measure, the newest allegations, if accurate, are the most brutal. Republicans tend to do well in North Carolina, but when a struggling candidate is credibly accused of describing himself as a ""black NAZI!"" who doesn't think slavery was necessarily a ""bad"" thing, it's a tough sell to the state's electorate.

Shortly before CNN published its report, the right-wing candidate filmed a brief online statement in which he insisted he was ""staying in this race.""

The video was released just hours before North Carolina's deadline for Robinson to withdraw from the race, which would allow party officials to choose a new candidate. It also coincided with multiple published reports that the gubernatorial hopeful was facing pressure to end his campaign -- and by some accounts, that pressure included calls from some working on behalf of Donald Trump's campaign.

As things stand, Robinson is still a candidate who hopes to become the chief executive of a large state. That said, he and his party have some questions to answer.

Will Robinson ignore the pressure to quit? Will Trump, who has repeatedly and publicly praised Robinson, cut him loose? Will the gubernatorial candidate's scandals hurt other GOP candidates in North Carolina? Will his party redirect resources to other contests?

Will other Republican officials and candidates, many of whom have cozied up to Robinson for years, start pretending not to know him? Will conservative media outlets and personalities start walking back their years' worth of praise for the radical candidate?"
"Ari Melber: From GOP heavyweights to celebrities, Harris is expanding her coalition by the day",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-gop-endorsements-celebrities-economy-rcna171861,2024-09-19T19:08:54Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris' coalition seems to be growing by the day and with less than 50 days to go until the election, she's working to expand that coalition even further -- highlighting the contrast between her and her opponent, Donald Trump. On Wednesday, she issued a new warning about Project 2025 and the dangers of a Trump second-term immigration crackdown, urging people to imagine and reckon with his plans for immigration policy.

And while Americans may want to forget what immigration policy was like under Trump's first term, it's important to see the facts. In 2016, Trump ran on a religious ban and then, once in office, he implemented a related Muslim-majority country ban while using policies to split up families on the southern border.

There was significant backlash to these policies at the time. Trump's travel ban sparked confusion, chaos and protests at U.S. airports. It was then paused by courts and later narrowed. The Trump child separation policy, meant to be used as a crackdown to punish and dissuade migration, only elevated cruelty against children.

While addressing the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Wednesday, Harris urged people to remember the past and consider how it would shape the future in a Trump second term, warning about the former president's mass deportation plan:

It's not just immigration, Harris is broadening out her message, sharing her policies on abortion rights, health care and taxes. Contrast that with Trump's ""concepts of a plan.""

In the home stretch of this race, the Harris campaign is seeking out ways to highlight those key contrasts between her and Trump. Harris did just that in a new interview with the National Association of Black Journalists. In July, Trump had a meltdown during his sit-down with the NABJ.

During her interview, Harris remarked about the ""profound responsibility"" that comes along with a public platform. Responsibility is different than ideology and on that score, Harris continues to draw support -- even from the other side. More top Republicans are backing Harris and calling Trump unfit to serve -- precisely because they view him as irresponsible with the nation's national security.

In recent days, there have been over 100 new endorsements from former members of Congress, defense secretaries and CIA directors.

They now join one of the GOP's top hawks, Dick Cheney, who recently endorsed Harris. It's an embrace that comes despite, not because, of policy.

The Harris coalition now spans from the right edge of the GOP to the center and left of the Democratic Party to cultural figures who fill stadiums, such as Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish. Seriously, who else or what else could bring these people together ... on anything?

They don't agree on foreign policy, abortion policy, music policy. You won't see them backstage together at the earning presentation for the oil company Haliburton, which Cheney ran. Or backstage at the Coachella music festival, which Eilish headlined. The one thing that brings them together is the conviction that Harris should be the next president, not Trump.

And they are taking these positions at the risk of upsetting their base. Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney spent their whole lives in GOP circles and plenty of Republicans buy music and go to concerts. So it's more than unusual, in fact, it's striking to see this organic, broad groundswell for Harris. And as Trump allies attack singers or lie and pretend they don't want these endorsements, let's be clear, they do.

That may be what's happening in the zeitgeist but when it comes to the issues, Harris got some of the best economic news possible this week. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced it was lowering its key interest rate by half a percentage point. If this rate cut can impact the economic vibe just as early voting kicks off, that could be the difference in this election."
Opinion | What the right and left both get wrong about comparing speech with violence,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-assassination-attempt-ben-shapiro-stochastic-terrorism-rcna171406,2024-09-18T10:55:38Z,"Former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Las Vegas on Friday.Justin Sullivan / Getty Images

On Sunday, there was another apparent attempt on the life of former President Donald Trump. Though the suspect was never close enough to Trump to have him in rifle range and his motive is unclear, Trump said on Fox News that the man ""believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it."" In a fundraising email, the Trump campaign repeated this line and illustrated it with a screenshot of a social media post from the ""Kamala HQ"" account that included a video of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., calling Trump ""extremely dangerous"" and ""a threat to democracy.""

Similarly, his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, posted, ""Kamala Harris has said that 'Democracy is on the line' in her race against President Trump"" and ""[t]he gunman agreed."" Numerous prominent right-wing media figures, such as Ben Shapiro, Tim Pool and Chaya Raichik (of Libs of TikTok fame) have taken up the same talking point. Shapiro, for example, blamed those who claim Trump ""is Hitler without the mustache"" for inspiring the suspect. And Trump himself doubled down on the point in a long X post, writing, ""Because of this Communist Left Rhetoric, the bullets are flying, and it will only get worse!""

What no one seems to notice is that, in effect, Trump, Vance and their media surrogates are echoing the claims previously made by many on the left about ""stochastic terrorism"" and the relationship between speech and violence.

The theory of ""stochastic terrorism"" holds that people who engage in overheated or irresponsible rhetoric are, in effect, inciting violence -- even if they never actually advocate violence. Even though it's ""stochastic"" (i.e., random, insofar as any particular act of violence can't be predicted), it's still supposed to count as a form of de facto ""terrorism"" because it increases the general likelihood of such acts' taking place.

David Corn, for example, called Trump a ""stochastic terrorist"" in Mother Jones magazine. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., alleged during an appearance on ""The Breakfast Club"" radio show that death threats against her increased when Tucker Carlson talked about her on his show, and she said that ""this is what stochastic terrorism is.""

Certainly, it's wildly hypocritical for the right to suddenly embrace this equation of overheated speech with violence the moment it becomes convenient for it, after years of dismissing such charges out of hand. None of the figures I just listed have ever considered themselves responsible for hate crimes against trans people or immigrants, for example, despite their many years of harsh rhetoric about these groups.

A host and columnist for the conservative media empire The Blaze challenged his readers to ""[t]ry to imagine a world in which Barack Obama survived two assassination attempts and the media didn't publicly destroy the reputation of everyone who issued even the most mild criticism of the man."" In reality, while no assassin ever came close enough to fire a shot at Obama, there were numerous foiled attempts on Obama's life comparable to the incident on Sunday. And if we're going to play this game, it's worth pointing out that plenty of right-wingers essentially called Obama ""Hitler without the mustache"" while he was president. Obama-as-Hitler signs were a common sight at early tea party rallies and protests outside town halls to discuss health care reform.

That having been said, it's also inconsistent for many of my fellow leftists and progressives to suddenly dismiss the same ideas about speech and violence that far too many of them have themselves been eager to promote in the past.

Part of my problem with the theory of ""stochastic terrorism"" has always been that no one anywhere seems to apply it consistently. Those who blame the other team's ""overheated"" rhetoric for political violence tend to turn around and defend equally white-hot rhetoric with which they are sympathetic and become appropriately skeptical about the cause-and-effect connections between that rhetoric and violence.

Much of the debate about whether a given piece of rhetoric is ""overheated"" boils down to whether the underlying facts merit the heat. For example, if Trump really is a threat to democracy, it seems absurd to say that Bernie Sanders shouldn't say so because some people who agree with him might act on that belief in ways he himself would never condone.

Or, for example, I wrote numerous articles during the life of late Secretary of State Henry Kissinger calling him a war criminal and a ""monster"" responsible for the deaths of vast numbers of innocent people from Vietnam and Cambodia (where he and Richard Nixon orchestrated brutal bombing campaigns) to Chile (where they backed the overthrow of democratically elected socialist president Salvador Allende). At the time I was writing these articles, Kissinger was still given fawning treatment by many mainstream media outlets. Well, if someone who'd read my articles had shot up a television studio where Kissinger was being interviewed, would I therefore have been responsible?

How you answer that question will probably boil down to whether you think my condemnation of Kissinger was correct on the merits of the case. I've never heard anyone say, ""What you're saying right now is completely true, but it would be stochastic terrorism to say it out loud.""

In general, the problem with focusing too much on the hypocrisy of your ideological enemies is that it can be an excuse to never have to clarify your own principles. It's much easier to point out other people's inconsistencies than to spell out what you yourself believe.

So here's what I believe: I'm a democratic socialist. That means the core of my politics is about seeking to overcome the domination of society by wealthy interests. I want to empower the working class. Well, you can't believe that ordinary working-class people are capable of governing themselves while also believing that it's too dangerous to expose them to the ""wrong"" kinds of speech lest they draw conclusions with which even the speaker would disagree. As such, I care very deeply about free speech.

I'm also ""conservative"" enough to believe in individual moral responsibility.

If Bernie says Trump is a threat to democracy but he also frequently condemns political violence of all kinds, he isn't therefore responsible for people who agree with him on the first part but disagree on the second. In fact, he could well argue any threat to democracy posed by Trump's movement would be increased if he were killed, which his followers would certainly blame on a vast shadowy ""them.""

And, for that matter, if right-wingers say abortion is murder but disapprove of individual citizens' engaging in ""vigilantism"" against abortion doctors, I passionately disagree with the first part, but I don't blame them for the actions of anyone who disagrees with them about the second.

In both cases, arguing about whether the position is inflammatory is mostly just a distraction from arguing about whether it's true. If we make it easier to censor people engaging in ""stochastic terrorism,"" then the determination about what counts will simply be made by whichever faction happens to hold power at any given time. If you aren't confident that your faction will eternally hold power, that should give you pause.

We're far better off making a robust distinction between speech and violence. The more we blur that line, the harder it will be to defend robust norms about free speech. Let's not go down that road."
Opinion | Georgia's 'pro-life' abortion ban literally killed a woman  --  and she won't be the last,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/amber-thurman-death-georgia-abortion-ban-rcna171301,2024-09-18T10:55:34Z,"If the Christian right had not had its way at the Supreme Court, Amber Nicole Thurman would be alive today. She would have been able to get the medical care she needed in 2022. She would have lived to pursue her career ambitions and see her little boy grow up. Instead, the 28-year-old died a completely avoidable death in a Georgia hospital because the doctors treating her were terrified of committing a felony under the state's abortion ban.

The true crime is that Thurman's life was cut short because of ideologues who for 50 years trumpeted ""biblical"" values as they sought to make women pay for unwanted pregnancies, even with their lives.

A new report in ProPublica reveals the details of Thurman's excruciating final days and death, which a state medical committee recently deemed ""preventable."" Thurman learned she was pregnant with twins in the summer of 2022. Mother to a young son, she was hoping to attend nursing school and ""quickly decided she needed to preserve her newfound stability,"" her best friend, Ricaria Baker, told ProPublica.

But three years earlier, Georgia's Republican-controlled state Legislature passed a law prohibiting abortion at six weeks. After the Supreme Court's overturned Roe v. Wade's constitutional right to abortion in June 2022, the ban went into effect. Georgia became one of the first places to close the door on virtually all abortions, and many other GOP-run states soon followed. The law -- with the dystopian title of Living Infants and Fairness Equality Act, or ""LIFE Act"" -- does has a vague exception to protect the life of the mother. But most exceptions in these laws, reports the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization supporting reproductive rights, ""are designed to be unworkable, containing vague and contradictory language and imposing cumbersome requirements.""

When Georgia's ban went into effect, Thurman's pregnancy had just passed six weeks. According to ProPublica, Thurman scheduled a dilation and curettage in North Carolina, which still permitted abortion. But when traffic delayed her travel, the clinic -- ""inundated with women from other states where bans had taken effect"" -- could not keep her appointment slot. A clinic employee gave her legally obtained abortion pills to use instead. (""Her pregnancy was well within the standard of care for that treatment,"" ProPublica reports.)

Unfortunately, upon her return home, Thurman suffered a highly unusual complication, with increasing pain and heavy bleeding. The North Carolina clinic would have performed a D&C as a free follow-up, but it was too far away. Instead, Thurman went to a nearby hospital. Citing medical records, ProPublica says that ""doctors noted a foul odor during a pelvic exam, and an ultrasound showed possible tissue in her uterus.""

Usually, these signs of sepsis would be addressed with a D&C to remove the fetal tissue. But the LIFE Act prohibits ""administering any instrument ... with the purpose of terminating a pregnancy."" That made performing this normally commonplace and safe procedure a possible felony for the doctors. Hospital staff delayed the procedure for nearly a day, as Thurman's condition worsened. Finally, hours after her organs began failing, she was taken in for surgery -- during which she died. Her mother recalled her last words: ""Promise me you'll take care of my son.""

It was not Thurman's legal use of abortion pills that caused her to die. Deaths stemming from the use of abortion pills are exceedingly rare. ""Out of nearly 6 million women who've taken mifepristone in the U.S. since 2000, 32 deaths were reported to the FDA through 2022, regardless of whether the drug played a role,"" ProPublica reports. ""Of those, 11 patients developed sepsis."" The cause of Amber Thurman's death was the Republican-led criminalization of healthcare when she developed a condition that demanded immediate lifesaving attention. The LIFE Act killed Amber Thurman.

The LIFE Act is what happens when single-minded religious zealots seize political power. Anti-abortion activists, claiming to have a more pure and literal interpretation of Christianity than everyone else, and claiming to have a divine directive to make American law conform to it, insisted on this. They insisted on ending Roe v. Wade, chipping away at it for five decades until former President Donald Trump made their dream come true. He delivered on his promise of a right-wing Supreme Court majority. That majority, in turn, unleashed the sadistic laws that endanger the lives of women in dozens of states, restricting their rights to make their own decisions and get lifesaving care.

When Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed the bill into law, he said, ""Georgia is a state that values life."" He added, ""We stand up for those who are unable to speak for themselves."" But when Amber Thurman lay in a hospital bed, none of these ""pro-life"" heroes were there to treat her as a person with even a shred of dignity, much less any rights.

Trump knows that these kinds of stories -- and Thurman's is far from the only one -- are bad news for his campaign. So now he's gaslighting the public once again about the fallout from the Dobbs decision, his critical role in the criminalization of abortion, and his Project 2025 allies' plans for another term. At last week's presidential debate, he brazenly lied that all sides ""wanted this issue to be brought back to the states, where the people could vote.""

But Americans didn't ask for the ""issue to be brought back to the states"" so that Christian nationalist legislators could dictate the most intimate decisions of their lives. Amber Thurman didn't ask for a lecture on life from her governor. She only wanted to live."
"Claire McCaskill: This time around, it's Trump who has the enthusiasm problem",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-kamala-harris-enthusiasm-gap-poll-abortion-rcna171495,2024-09-17T19:32:35Z,"Since Donald Trump entered the political scene, he's owned the enthusiasm gap. But, according to a new survey from renowned pollster Ann Selzer, that's no longer the case. The Des Moines Register poll found that in Iowa, a state Trump won comfortably in both 2016 and 2020, 80% of Vice President Kamala Harris' supporters say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about her as their choice for president. That's compared to 74% of Trump's supporters.

In 2016 and 2020, I don't think it was that there was a lack of enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden. But you had Trump burst onto the scene, giving the finger to the man, to the government, to the system, to the ""swamp"" -- to whatever you want to call it. That kind of negative messaging created such a burst of enthusiasm among a bunch of folks who felt like nobody got them, that nobody was taking care of them. They wanted to give the finger to everybody in power, too.

But this time around, the burst of enthusiasm is on the Democratic side. People see Harris as positive and uplifting. She's talking about the problems that matter to the American people.

One of the issues driving up enthusiasm for Harris is abortion. Many women feel that Trump has diminished their pain. But it's not just women who find this issue motivating, it's women and the men who love them, the men who care about their daughters and their nieces and their grandchildren.

Nobody is making up that women are bleeding out in bathrooms and hospital parking lots. Nobody is making up that women are not able to get the medical care they need when a pregnancy has gone terribly wrong through no fault of their own.

All of that creates a kind of visceral pain that makes women and men want to rise up together and say enough is enough. That's where a lot of this enthusiasm for Harris is coming from."
Ali Velshi: The danger behind Donald Trump and the GOP's abortion lies,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-fact-check-late-term-abortion-rcna171352,2024-09-17T13:08:14Z,"For decades, the anti-abortion movement has been inviting the violence of extremists among their ranks by equating abortion to murder.

This is an adapted excerpt from the Sept. 14 episode of ""Velshi.""

Before Donald Trump took office, he promised to deliver a Supreme Court that would overturn Roe v. Wade -- and that's exactly what he did. Now he's running for president against the dystopian backdrop of forced birth and denial of care he helped create.

The difficulty of running with that record is evident in the increasing desperation of the lies he tells about abortion and women's health care. By now, you have probably heard Trump and his acolytes talk about what they're calling ""post-birth abortion."" They claim that Vice President Kamala Harris and other Democrats want to allow, as Trump puts it, the execution of babies.

This lie, which sounds so insane and fringe that it's hard to imagine anyone could believe it, was repeated by Trump at last week's debate:

""Under Roe v. Wade, you could do abortions in the seventh month, the eighth month, the ninth month, and probably after birth. ... The governor of Virginia said, 'We put the baby aside, and then we determine what we want to do with the baby. ... In other words, we'll execute the baby.'""

What Trump described there is murder, not abortion. The post-birth abortion lie is a deliberate attempt to equate actual abortion -- which is health care -- to murder, as a means to stigmatize women who need abortions and doctors who provide them.

But because you might encounter someone in your own life who believes this dangerous lie, let's get into the details. Though he did not say his name, Trump was referencing Ralph Northam, the former Democratic governor of Virginia. In 2019, then-Gov. Northam did a radio interview in which he was asked a question about proposed legislation that would have loosened restrictions on late-term abortions. Northam gave a long and somewhat circuitous answer that touched on the tragic circumstances surrounding the very rare cases of late-term abortions:

""When we talk about third-trimester abortions, that decision is made with the mother and with the consent of the physician, more than one physician. And it's done in cases where there may be severe deformities, there may be a fetus that's nonviable.""

Then, in the same answer, Northam also talked about what would happen if a baby was born with a fatal diagnosis:

""In this particular example, if the mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen: The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired. And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.""

As Northam's office explained at the time, he was speaking of two different circumstances, one in which a catastrophic diagnosis or circumstance would cause a patient to need a late-term abortion -- which is extremely rare and done, as Northam notes, only with approval from more than one physician.

The other hypothetical case he addressed was if a patient goes into labor and delivers a baby with a fatal diagnosis. In that case, Northam explained the heartbreaking circumstances such families would face, including the very difficult decisions around keeping their baby comfortable in their final moments or taking extraordinary measures to prolong their life.

The anti-abortion movement took the interview, twisted it and ran -- using it to claim that Democrats were promoting abortion after birth, aka the murder of newborns, and now, five years later, the same lie is cropping up on the Republican campaign trail.

But let's look at the facts: A full-term pregnancy lasts between 39 and 40 weeks. By definition, a late-term or late-in-pregnancy abortion occurs at or after 21 weeks of pregnancy, and they are extremely rare. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2021, fewer than 1% of all abortions occurred at or after 21 weeks, 80.8% occurred at or before 9 weeks of pregnancy, and just 5.7% occurred between 14 and 20 weeks of pregnancy, which is during the second trimester. Zero abortions are happening after birth.

It sounds bizarre to even have to say that, but in fact we have been building to this moment for a long time. The anti-abortion movement has been painting women who have abortions and physicians who perform them as murderers for decades.

According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a ""common harassment tactic was to find and publicize personal information about doctors in the form of 'Wanted' posters. Other times, they would send letters to a doctor's neighbors, telling them, 'There is a killer in your neighborhood.'""

For the last four decades, anti-abortion activists have been performing what they call ""rescues."" This has involved everything from blocking entrances to abortion clinics and medical centers to harassing patients, doctors and workers, and even invading the clinics. It has often involved carrying signs and calling patients and staff who enter clinics murderers.

The 1980s saw a huge wave of clinic bombings. In 1984, attackers set fire or bombed 29 clinics across the country. According to the National Abortion Federation, since 1977, there have been 42 bombings and 200 cases of arson at clinics across the U.S. And, yes, over the years the anti-abortion movement did cross the threshold into straight-up murder. At least 11 people have been killed by the militant wing of the anti-abortion movement since 1977, according to the group.

Two of the most well-known cases are the murders of Dr. George Tiller and Dr. David Gunn. In the '90s and early 2000s, Tiller was a frequent target of violence because he was one of a few physicians at the time who were performing late-in-pregnancy abortions. His clinic was bombed in 1986. In 1993, he was shot but survived. In 2009, a man named Scott Roeder walked into Tiller's church, during service, where Tiller was serving as an usher and shot him in the head, killing him. Roeder said he did it to protect babies from being murdered.

The first known abortion provider to be assassinated was Dr. David Gunn in 1993. The gunman was a member of the anti-abortion group Rescue America. He shot Gunn in the back three times as he entered his clinic in Pensacola, Florida. In response, Rescue America released a statement saying while Gunn's murder was ""unfortunate, the fact is that a number of mothers would have been put at risk today and over a dozen babies would have died at his hands.""

For decades, the anti-abortion movement has been inviting the violence of extremists among their ranks by equating abortion to murder. The rhetoric that Trump and others on the right are now spewing fits seamlessly into this tired, yet dangerous, strategy.

The post-birth abortion lie was designed to justify the brutal regime of forced birth under which millions of American women are now suffering. It's being used as a lazy but dangerous strategy to turn our attention away from the tragedies that have sprung up in the wake of the end of Roe: the rush of stories of women being denied care, left to bleed and suffer, forced to flee their states and saddled with wholly preventable life-altering medical conditions. Tragedies all because of the anti-abortion crackdown ushered in by Trump."
Opinion | Trump and Vance think anti-immigrant hate is good politics. They're mistaken.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-trump-haitian-immigrants-springfield-rcna171292,2024-09-16T23:51:16Z,"Over the weekend, Ohio senator and vice presidential nominee JD Vance made a stunning and unintentional admission: He's a liar.

For more than a week, Vance, former President Donald Trump and many of their allies have spread falsehoods about the town of Springfield, Ohio, and its Haitian immigrant community. Most infamously, Trump last week repeated the now oft-debunked claim that Haitian migrants in the town are stealing and eating pet dogs and cats.

But on CNN, Vance gave away the GOP's game. ""If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do."" He claimed that the ""American media"" ignored the ""problems in Springfield"" associated with the impact of Haitian migration on public services in the town until ""Donald Trump and I started talking about cat memes."" Vance tried to explain away his verbal slip, but he couldn't avoid the truth: ""creating stories"" is another way to say ""making stuff up.""

The consequences for such lies are both obvious and frightening. A steady stream of bomb threats has forced Springfield officials to temporarily shutter government offices, hospitals, elementary and middle schools, and two local colleges. On Monday, a local festival celebrating ""diversity, arts and culture,"" was also canceled -- a fitting monument to Trump and Vance's racist attacks.

Most insidious is the effect on the local Haitian community, which is increasingly under siege. As Vance's rhetoric has made clear, his concern is not the Haitians' immigration status: They are in America legally. Rather, the issue is their skin color and background of those moving to Springfield. As the vice presidential nominee argued on X this weekend, the real question about Springfield is, ""Should we drop 20,000 people from a radically different culture in a small Ohio town in a matter of a few years?""

Never mind that, like so many immigrant communities before them, the Haitian community in Springfield has more than acclimated itself to their new homes. Their ""positive influences"" on the town have been noted by everyone from Springfield's Republican mayor and local business leaders to Ohio's Republican governor, who has decried the Trump/Vance-led attacks as ""garbage.""

But would Vance make such proclamations if the 20,000 people were, say, from Norway? Would he make the same argument about urban gentrification and thousands of white yuppies moving into a predominately Black or Hispanic community?

When Vance claims that ""what is happening in Springfield is coming to every town and city in this country if Kamala Harris' open border policies are allowed to continue,"" his intent is not difficult to discern. His incessant focus on ""illegal immigration"" and problems ""at the border"" is nothing more than a racist dog whistle to MAGA voters. And it's one that minority communities have seen play out in America for centuries.

It's also quite purposeful. As Marc Caputo reported Sunday for the Bulwark, ""Privately, Trump aides think it's a net plus,"" writes Caputo. ""The longer the discussion is about migrants, the less it is about tougher topics for them. 'We talk about abortion; we lose. We talk about immigration, we win,' said one Trump adviser.""

""But what about the blowback from spreading an incendiary story for which there is no evidence?"" Caputo asks. ""'We'll take the hit to prove the bigger point,'"" the adviser responds. NBC News reports that Trump is planning to visit Springfield ""soon,"" which surely will fan the flames even more.

Immigration is indeed an effective policy issue for Trump. In the most recent ABC/Ipsos poll, he polled 10 points better on it than Harris. But he also polls seven points better than his Democratic rival on the economy and inflation. Not only are those issues the top concerns for undecided voters, but they have the added benefit of not utilizing unabashedly racist sentiments. To side with Trump and Vance because of concerns over the economy is asking a heckuva lot less of voters than siding with them over naked immigrant bashing. The former doesn't require a cleansing shower after wading in the political sewer.

The last nine years of American politics have shown us that Trump and his minions only sing from one anti-immigrant hymnal. Since 2016, immigrant-bashing has been the issue that most consistently unites GOP candidates -- and it's one that has taken on an even darker hue this cycle, with routine talk of immigrant ""invasions"" into the U.S.

There is, however, less evidence that it's an effective political strategy. In 2018, Trump-supported candidates regularly used xenophobic attack lines in their campaigns. This was the election of ""migrant caravans"" and ""bad hombres."" It didn't work. Trump trotted out the usual dog whistles in 2020. So did Republican candidates in 2022. Neither led to political success. Maybe 2024 will be different, but the evidence is against xenophobic broadsides against immigrants as a route to political success.

In fact, the constant attacks on immigrants and the rising tensions in Springfield and around the country could be a net negative for Trump. The unending negativity that now defines the Trump campaign, the constant feeling of chaos and fatigue around the former president has a profound effect. The demagoguing over Springfield may energize MAGA world but, for the anti-Trump wing of the electorate, it's a reminder of everything loathsome about the former president. Unfortunately, for Trump and now Vance, shame has always been an emotion in short supply, so there's little reason to expect the racist, immigration bashing to stop. There's also not much reason to think it'll work."
Opinion | A Kamala Harris win could save conservatism,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-win-save-conservatism-rcna170533,2024-09-15T12:42:49Z,"The vice president and her policies are terrible. But I want her to win, so that a post-Trump conservative party can be reborn.

To MAGA-era conservatives, there is no crime more unforgivable than for a traditional, Reagan-era Republican to endorse voting for Vice President Kamala Harris. You won't find any such endorsement here: I care less about whom you're voting for than you should care about for whom I'm casting my ballot.

Of course Harris can't keep the price of food and clothing down by setting up a ridiculous ""price gouging"" law (and if she could, why hasn't the Biden/Harris administration done so yet?). Obviously giving $25,000 to first-time homebuyers would increase demand and drive up housing prices. And taxing unrealized gains would be economically catastrophic, bureaucratically unworkable and almost certainly unconstitutional.

But it's not like Republicans have spent the past nine years defending the bedrock principles of free-market conservatism. Slowly but surely, most of them have contorted themselves into endorsing whatever former President Donald Trump thinks ""economic populism"" is.

That's why, with less than two months until the election, there should be an honest discussion of whether a Trump loss would be best in the long term for ""conservatism"" as traditionally understood. In a sense, a Harris presidency could serve as a type of political chemotherapy: a poisonous injection meant to eradicate a tumor in order to keep a major political party alive.

What happens to traditional free-market, low-tax conservatism if Trump were to win in November? One could argue the classical liberalism horse has already jumped the fence, never to return. But if America gives up and returns Trump to the presidency, ""conservatism"" as many of us understood it for the past half-century would simply become a museum piece, gathering dust on library shelves.

A second Trump term would mean that for the next four years, conservatism would continue its descent into whatever Trump decides it is based on the last person to whom he spoke. He would continue to insist tariffs are paid by other countries, when in fact economists are nearly unanimous in their belief those costs are borne by American consumers. Trump would continue to fumble the abortion issue, dragging Republicans into becoming the maybe-pro-life-sometimes-when-it's-politically-convenient party. And he would destroy faith in American elections, but conveniently only in states in which he loses.

Further, if Trump were to win, the right would have permanently ceded any moral ground to the left.

Over the past four decades, the GOP's defense of morality, family values and patriotism was the sinew that held the party together. These were fundamental ties that held together religious conservatives, libertarian-leaning Americans worried about taxes and the economy and national defense hawks.

But Trump believes in none of these things. On the personal side, his amoral predilections are well-known and have been for 40 years (and have cost him dearly in courts around America).

Publicly, his idea of strength is to demean the presidency by cozying up with dictators and strongmen around the world. He mocks great American cities for their crime problems while he himself is carrying dozens of felonies on his ledger. Exactly what limited government principle was Trump ""conserving"" when he called for the ""termination"" of certain parts of the Constitution in order to return himself to the presidency?

Granted, it is rarely beneficial for a political party to occupy the minority in American politics, but the GOP's best chance at regaining its conservative heritage may be to mold itself in opposition to Harris' positions. This would allow those truly interested in liberty to oppose taxes, regulations, court-packing and ""green"" mandates instead of obsessing over whether Harris is Black or Indian, whether photos of her crowds have been doctored with artificial intelligence or whether America is overrun by single women who enjoy the companionship of felines.

America has had good presidents and bad presidents. It has survived Democrats and Republicans, conservatives and progressives. Each time it has come out on the other side, electing a new administration that corrects the course of the previous one.

But Donald Trump isn't a true member of a party, nor does he clutter his mind with any ideological knowledge or allegiances. He is simply a political movement unto himself who responds with ridicule and scorn to any attempts to undergird his mercurial instincts with a cogent philosophy. He doesn't recognize the rules that have kept America a functioning republic for nearly 250 years, which has left the nation in the inconceivable position of either electing a man to the presidency or potentially sending him to prison for most of the remainder of his life.

Conversely, Kamala Harris is a standard, run-of-the-mill Democrat with bad ideas. Her administration would prompt groans and eye-rolls among conscious conservatives while sending the deranged fringes of the Republican Party into full conspiracy mode.

A Harris administration would be a painful four years for Republicans in the way America muddled through terms by Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden. But pain is also the way the body teaches you a lesson. And the lesson in this case is that the sooner Republicans cut out the Trump tumor, the quicker they can once again become a healthy political party."
Nebraska Supreme Court green-lights competing pro- and anti-abortion ballot measures,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/nebraska-abortion-ballot-measures-rcna171144,2024-09-14T18:59:06Z,"Nebraska is the only state since the fall of Roe v. Wade to put opposing abortion measures on the ballot.

Nebraska's Supreme Court ruled Friday that competing abortion rights measures can be on the ballot in November, allowing voters to choose between expanding the right to abortion or codifying a 12-week ban into the state constitution.

The former would enshrine ""a fundamental right to abortion until fetal viability, or when needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient"" in Nebraska's constitution. The other would ban abortions after the first trimester with exceptions for a medical emergency, rape or incest -- essentially codifying the state's current abortion ban into its constitution.

Anti-abortion supporters sued over the abortion rights initiative, arguing that it violated a state rule that requires a ballot proposal to address only one subject. The state's high court ultimately ruled that measure does not violate the single-subject rule, thus allowing both measures to appear alongside each other on the ballot.

Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, voters have resoundingly sided with abortion rights in states when the issue has been on the ballot. This year, at least 10 states, including Nebraska, are slated to vote on abortion rights measures. In response, Republican officials in those states have resorted to a slew of tactics to undermine those initiatives ahead of the election.

Nebraska is the only state since the fall of Roe to put opposing abortion measures together on the ballot. It's unclear which way voters are leaning: Organizers for both initiatives said last month that they had each submitted a roughly similar number of signatures to get ballot access. In the event that voters approve both measures, the one that gets the most votes in favor will be the one that's enshrined in the state constitution, The Associated Press reported."
Jen Psaki: Why this was Kamala Harris' most important debate answer,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/kamala-harris-trump-debate-answer-abortion-rcna171078,2024-09-14T12:50:46Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris wiped the floor with former President Donald Trump at Tuesday night's debate. It started with her aggressive pursuit of a handshake and continued with the trap she set by talking about his obsession with crowd sizes. He never regained control.

All that being said, debate performances alone don't win elections. Just ask John Kerry or Hillary Clinton, who both won all of their debates and did not win their elections. But debates can help differentiate candidates and motivate voters.

On Tuesday night, the key exchange, at least in my opinion, centered around abortion rights.

After Trump boldly claimed he ""did a great service"" in overturning Roe v. Wade, Harris had this to say:

She was direct, passionate and made the impact of abortion bans specific and personal.

Trump, meanwhile, failed to commit to vetoing an abortion ban.

There were a lot of spicy moments in this debate. But that exchange showed where Harris and Trump stand on an issue that could be a key motivator of turnout, if not voter behavior.

If I were Team Harris, I would make sure Trump doesn't forget it.

This summer, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz warned Trump and JD Vance: ""See what cat people do when you go after 'em."" And Tuesday night, they found out.

Taylor Swift's endorsement was one of the most highly anticipated this election. Why? Swift's social media call to action drove over 400,000 visits to the federal voter registration website Vote.gov within 24 hours of her post. And for context, this website typically only receives about 40,000 visits per day. So far, the pop star's original Instagram post has been shared by over 1.5 million users on Instagram.

Trump claimed that Swift will ""probably pay a price for it in the marketplace."" But Swift's influence, to say nothing about her business, did just fine after she endorsed Joe Biden for president in October 2020. If anything, she's only grown more powerful.

Vance, whose ""childless cat lady"" insults got a callout in Swift's post, attempted to shrug off the development, saying he doesn't think many Americans ""are going to be influenced by a billionaire celebrity who I think is disconnected from the interests and the problems of most Americans.""

To quote Rep. Adam Schiff: ""Has JD Vance met his own running mate?""

Meet Karen Dunn, the powerhouse attorney leading Harris' debate prep team. The New York Times reports she is described by people close to her as a ""skilled handler of high-ego politicians."" And Dunn also knows how to give candidates ""tough love"" when they need it, according to Hillary Clinton.

Dunn got her start in politics on Clinton's 2000 Senate campaign. She rose to become Clinton's communications director and joined Clinton's presidential campaign after attending Yale Law School. After clerking for then-Judge Merrick Garland and Justice Stephen Breyer, Dunn returned to politics to work on debate prep teams for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, Clinton in 2016, and Harris (for her vice presidential debate with Mike Pence) in 2020.

In 2021, Dunn also won a landmark case holding the organizers of the Charlottesville rally accountable for injuries suffered by counterprotesters, securing over $25 million in damages.

After Obama won re-election in 2012, Dunn took a job in the White House counsel's office. We don't know where she'll land next, but she's absolutely a player to watch in a potential Harris administration."
Opinion | My former friend JD Vance has aligned with something far worse than MAGA,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/sofia-nelson-jd-vance-trump-maga-post-liberal-right-rcna171095,2024-09-14T12:50:42Z,"Unlike the MAGA movement, which is led by a candidate who is defiantly amoral, post-liberalism is steeped in a revolutionary religiosity.

Most Americans haven't heard of the post-liberal right, the small but influential group of conservative, mostly Catholic men who have declared that liberal democracy, the animating principle of America's founding, has failed and want to bring about a new social order where there is no separation of church and state and men and a hyperconservative Catholicism reign supreme. They are disdainful of secularism and individual liberty. Just like Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump illustrated during Tuesday night's debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, these men idolize the authoritarian Viktor Orb√°n, the prime minister of Hungary.

They're also nostalgic for Spain as it was run by the dictator Franco and see Orb√°n's government and Franco's as potential models for the kind of regime they wish to install in the United States. The group's political priorities -- which include restricting access to contraception and divorce and banning marriage equality and pornography -- are wildly unpopular. And yet the Republican nominee for vice president, my former friend JD Vance, is a prominent voice of this fringe movement, as so many of his regrettable podcast interviews have demonstrated.

To repeat, I once considered Vance a friend. We were in the same class at Yale Law School, he knew me as an openly trans person, and we remained in communication until 2021. That's the year that he announced he would be running in the U.S. Senate race in Ohio the next year. Before running in post-liberal and neoreactionary circles, Vance was far less angry and extreme. He was also, as everybody will remember, riding the attention from his memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy"" and was a vocal and unambiguous critic of Trump, using words like ""idiot"" to describe Trump and ""reprehensible"" to describe his views on ""Immigrants, Muslims, etc.""

Despite the time we spent as friends, I have no real insights (other than political expediency) into what drew him to post-liberal men like the academic Patrick Deneen, columnist Sohrab Ahmari, legal scholar Adrian Vermeule and expat journalist and author Rod Dreher, who was present for Vance's baptism into the Catholic Church in 2019. What I do know is that Vance used to condemn Trump's racism and be empathetic to how such rhetoric made Americans feel unwelcome in their own country. But these men have had an obvious and heartbreaking effect on Vance's worldview.

The leaders in the post-liberal movement are elites steeped in classical and Catholic philosophy who fancy themselves warriors for the average man. Vermeule, for example, is explicitly against the separation of church and state, and believes the Catholic Church should have ultimate control over all moral questions. (Well, maybe not the church as it's run by Pope Francis.)

Vance and his intellectual mentors like Deneen are benefiting from the conflation of MAGA and post-liberalism, because if Americans truly understood post-liberalism, they'd realize it seeks to strip them of individual freedom.

There is some policy overlap between MAGA and post-liberalism in their shared opposition, for example, to immigration and transgender rights. But the ideological overlap between the groups is a shared affinity for authoritarianism. The post-liberal right, which has goals that even MAGA Republicans would find extreme, is attempting to hijack the MAGA movement to push its own agenda.

Consider: Trump, who has been married three times and divorced two times, proudly appeared on the cover of Playboy magazine. He was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records in a case that prosecutors successfully argued was about him trying to cover up an adulterous affair he had with an adult film star. He is not exactly an exemplar of Christian morality.

More importantly, Trump's positions change with the tides of public opinion. They aren't rooted in any religious or ideological convictions. ABC News' Linsey Davis, a moderator at Tuesday night's presidential debate, pointed out that, according to Vance, Trump ""explicitly"" said he'd veto a national abortion ban. That's after Trump suggested in March that he'd support such a ban. But not only did Trump not state a clear position at the debate, he said, ""I didn't discuss it with JD."" This comes on the heels of him first indicating he would vote in favor of an abortion rights ballot initiative in Florida, only to say he would vote against it the next day.

Unlike the MAGA movement, which is led by a candidate who is defiantly amoral, post-liberalism is steeped in a revolutionary religiosity. Its goals include replacing our social and political power structures with a new social order rooted in a misogynist understanding of gender, sexuality, marriage and reproduction closely tethered to Catholic social teachings. This is reflected in Vance's obsession with birth rates and the way he belittles women without children.

Some of the post-liberal right's priorities are reflected in Project 2025, but not even the Heritage Foundation, which is behind that project, has set its sights on trapping people in violent marriages by repealing no-fault divorce, as Vance and the post-liberal right seek to do.

Post-liberalism, unlike MAGA, has no grassroots following. Most Americans aren't Catholic, and most Catholics support the separation of church and state. But post-liberalism, despite its ideological and moral disdain for Trump, needs MAGA. To accomplish any of its goals, it must leech off of a populist movement. The movement needs to exploit Trump's popularity for its own unpopular aims. This may explain why Vance, who had more integrity when I knew him, abruptly flipped from calling Trump ""cultural heroin"" to the greatest president of his lifetime.

Prior to MAGA gaining control of the Republican Party, the leaders of this movement, most notably Vance, were staunchly anti-Trump. And while the post-liberal right is excited one of its own has quickly risen through MAGA's ranks -- most leaders of post-liberalism still aren't Trump fans.

But they understand that it's more feasible for them to co-opt the MAGA base than to organically organize a political base of their own. MAGA is far from a majority of the country, 42% of self-identified Republicans or roughly 14% of the county, but it's a larger political force than post-liberalism could ever hope to build on its own given the unpopularity of its policy priorities.

Post-liberalism further seeks to confuse the American people through its rhetorical support for labor unions, a definite break from mainstream Republican orthodoxy. However, Vance was booed by a group of union firefighters when he stated he sought to be part of the ""most pro-worker Republican ticket in history."" Nobody who's pro-worker, as Vance claims to be, would team up with Trump, the candidate who laughed with Elon Musk about union busting. Nor would he oppose the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would expand the right to organize. Hardworking union firefighters recognize Vance's support for organized labor for what it is: hollow political rhetoric.

A post-liberal devotee like Vance knows how to talk a populist game, but, like Trump, he has no interest in delivering for working people. His real devotion is to the culture wars.

Instead of persuading Americans to support their ideas, leaders of the post-liberal right are covertly positioning themselves within MAGA to be the heirs of Trump's political base when he's off the scene. They seek to transform the GOP into a pro-theocracy party willing to ignore the Constitution and democratic norms.

Those of us who don't want to live in a theocracy must look beyond just defeating Trump and must also seek to vanquish a post-liberal right. That also means defeating the ambitions of a classmate whom I once considered a friend."
Gen Z women will be critical in this year's election. Here's what they care most about.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/out-of-office/gen-z-women-will-critical-years-election-s-care-rcna170820,2024-09-13T17:00:43Z,"Attendees at the YWCA GenZ voters town hall.Courtesy YWCA USA

Young women voters played a critical role in the 2020 elections. And they're expected to be a deciding factor once again in November.

Over 40 million Gen Zers -- between the ages of 18 and 27 -- will be eligible to vote this year. That includes 20 million women and four million newly eligible new women voters who aged into the electorate since the 2022 midterm elections. And according to new data, there has been a surge of new voter registration for young people in key battleground states.

So, what issues matter most to them?

According to a new national survey by YWCA, Gen Z women voters consider issues like cost of living, healthcare and gun violence as the top issues of importance, which is true for those in other generations. But compared to other issues, they've rated them lower and instead spread their priorities out over multiple issues.

Researchers said the fact that Gen Z voters are ranking the importance of so many issues speaks to their high anxiety about the future.

""There's so many issues, it feels very overwhelming,"" said UCLA student Genevive Chin at a recent Gen Z voter townhall put together by the YWCA on September 7 in Philadelphia. ""Especially with everyone being very connected online, you can see all these issues on your phone, on your daily news. They're right in your face, even if they're not directly in your community.""

I had a chance to moderate a discussion with a group of seven Gen Z leaders from across the country, who shared their priorities on some most of the most pressing topics ahead of the 2024 election. The provided solutions they'd like to see from elected officials and their vision for the future.

A key message to elected officials? ""This is a job interview,"" said graduate student Lalitha Pamidigantam. ""You better come prepared to answer my questions and tell me exactly how you're going to earn my vote. There is no free ride. Not in a red state, not in a swing state, not in a blue state. You have to earn my vote.""

Nearly half of Gen Z voters in the U.S. are young people of color, and race was an important issue among Gen Zers on the panel.

Alicia Wicks, a student at Clark Atlanta University, said racial justice is extremely important to her generation, especially as diversity, equity and inclusion efforts are being rolled back across the country.

""African-American children are being stripped of their identities,"" said Wicks. ""We're seeing in different states legislation being passed... banning books, and curriculum. These children are growing up going to predominantly white institutions and losing a piece of themselves that is very fundamental to them as an individual...We need to elect officials who are going to protect our rights, protect who we are as a people.""

Jasmine Lopez, an Indian-American student from Tucson, Arizona spoke about the role of racial justice for tribal communities.

""We have lost our language. We have lost culture, we have lost an important way of life. And we cannot let that happen again,"" said Lopez. ""...We have to protect our population. And we see it in our education, we see it on our border, in our land.""

On abortion access

Caroline Vanchiere, who is from Houston, Texas and studies at the London School of Economics, emphasized that reproductive rights is healthcare. She explained that in the aftermath of Roe v. Wade being overturned ""There's this concern that if you're not politically aligned with your OB/GYN, they may share information that you told them in confidence. The situation in Texas makes people fearful to get or even ask about the care that they need which is really heartbreaking, especially in a country that already has the worst performance in maternal mortality of any developed country.""

Pamidigantam said abortion access is among her top three most pressing matters heading into the election. ""I am from Ohio, where our incredible organizers did an amazing job of putting abortion on the ballot and won last year... It is a sacred right to our own bodies, to our autonomy. And it's not just for women. It's for all people who need access to reproductive health care. All people need it. All people deserve it. And we will not lose it.""

On mental health

According to the survey, 47 percent of Gen Z said mental health was central to their identity, and 75 percent said it's a very important issue policymakers need to address. The vast majority -- 94 percent -- said it was crucial to expand access to affordable mental health care.

Ollie Henry, a recent graduate from Georgetown University who is disabled, noted that while the Covid-19 lockdown was a particularly tough time for many young people with intersecting identities.

""That isolation for so many of my friends, that meant being in home environments that were not safe, where they could not be queer, where they could not be trans, where they did not have access to therapy services that were culturally competent, where they did not have access to the basic things that they really needed in terms of social engagement,"" they said. ""That takes a huge toll on someone's mental health ... And now we know that mental health is actually integral for us to do anything else in life. Mental health is just as important as physical health as spiritual health or any other form of health.""

On social media and online harassment

The YWCA survey showed that women experience twice as much online harassment than older generations.

""As a woman, you may receive messages or certain things online that you're like, you know, I did not ask for this... And you don't really know what to do with it,"" shared Vanchiere. ""You maybe will joke about it to a friend and like, what are your options? You report them on Instagram and that just doesn't really feel like much of a solution. And so, I think there's still a lot that needs to be developed in terms of how do we better moderate and educate individuals on how to handle the situation?""

Leilani Nti, a student at Emory University in Georgia, says that education on social media, and education on online harassment should be taught in school. ""If we really want students to learn and children to learn how to be in community with one another, we need to meet them where they are at and where we're at is online. [We need to be] teaching students what sexual assault is ... what sexual assault can mean in various contexts...It's the responsibility of our education system and ultimately the responsibility of our politicians.""

Henry said he wants politicians to create safer online communities.

""Speaking for myself specifically, online spaces are sometimes the only space I can access,"" said Henry. ""If I can't get out of bed, I still want to be social. I still want to talk to friends. I still want to be invested and involved in community and online spaces are the way to do that. But when people are using that as a space to spew hate and to genuinely like genuine only cause harm to others, that keeps me from being able to participate. That keeps me from being able to be in community. So really, those online spaces we do, we need better legislation around what internet safety looks like, while also still preserving the free thought and beautiful connections that are able to develop on social media.""

Their message to politicians

The Gen Z panel also wanted to set the record straight on stereotypes around their generation (they are anything but ""uneducated"") as well as their conviction to hold leaders accountable. ""I want politicians to be afraid to lose their position. I want you guys to know that Gen Z is not afraid to come for your positions. Gen Z is not afraid to kick you out,"" said Lopez.

""My message to politicians is we are watching, looking at your track record,"" added Wicks. ""I'm looking at what you want to do to benefit not only African-American women, but women of color, women, nationally, globally, locally, in our communities. What are you doing to impact those day to day? And that's very crucial. And that's something that I'm going to stay on top of."""
"JD Vance flubs economic basics, adding to his list of troubles",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vance-economy-immigration-republican-basics-election-2024-rcna171001,2024-09-13T13:50:20Z,"JD Vance was already suffering through a humiliating week. Then he started flubbing the basics of economic and immigration policy on national television.

Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance was struggling long before last week, but an eight-day stretch helped capture why the Ohio senator wasn't a great choice for the GOP's national ticket.

On Wednesday, Sept. 4, delivered a ridiculous and widely mocked answer what can be done to address the cost of child care. A day later, he lamented that deadly mass shootings in schools are a ""fact of life"" -- a comment that sparked fierce and immediate pushback.

On Monday, Vance threw his support behind a ridiculous and racist conspiracy theory about immigrants abducting and eating pets, and on Tuesday, he endorsed a brazenly illegal response to Donald Trump's 2020 election defeat. That evening, the former president distanced himself from Vance's rhetoric about abortion policy during a nationally televised debate.

Two days later, the senator sat down with CNBC hosts to discuss the economy, and he managed to top off a brutal eight-day stretch with an interview in which he didn't appear to have any idea what he was talking about.

After badly flubbing the basics on the inflationary effects of tariffs, Vance tried to argue that immigration is bad for the economy:

So, a few things.

First, the ""25 million illegal aliens"" figure is ridiculously wrong. Given Vance's apparent interest in immigration policy, it's weird to see him struggle with such a basic detail.

Second, the vice president is not chiefly responsible for federal immigration laws -- though she did endorse a bipartisan solution that Vance's running mate killed, despite the legislation's merits, because he was afraid helping the country might hurt his 2024 candidacy.

Third, while it's true that housing costs in Springfield, Ohio, have gone up, it's because the local economy is improving -- despite Trump's insane claims that the community has been destroyed by pet-eating immigrants.

Fourth, the idea that Springfield has suffered economically as a result of immigration is the exact opposite of what has actually happened in reality. As Vance really ought to know -- he ostensibly represents Ohio -- we're talking about a community on the rise, not decline.

But perhaps most notable of all was the hapless senator's insistence that if immigration benefited the economy, the United States ""would be the most prosperous country in the world.""

Whether Vance understands this or not, the United States is already the most prosperous country in the world. In fact, we're the most prosperous country by a wide margin.

To be sure, such confusion is expected from Trump, who's relationship with reality has long been fractured, but Vance is supposed to be the more knowledgeable one. It leads to an unavoidable question:

Is the Republican senator really this confused about issues he claims to care about, or is the vice presidential hopeful assuming that voters are foolish enough to believe demonstrable nonsense?"
Opinion | Trump's sexism backfired spectacularly at the debate,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/harris-trump-debate-sexism-women-rcna170890,2024-09-12T21:48:11Z,"By Molly Jong-Fast, special correspondent for Vanity Fair and host of the podcast ""Fast Politics with Molly Jong-Fast.""

It was the slightest bit disarming when it happened -- ""I'm talking now, if you don't mind, please,"" former President Donald Trump said during Tuesday's presidential debate. He was trying to use the ""I'm speaking"" line on Vice President Kamala Harris, the same way Harris used it on Mike Pence during their 2020 vice presidential debate. ""Does that sound familiar?"" Trump quipped with a little smirk, as if to make it completely obvious he was being cute, performing a hostile homage.

I'd say this was one of the very few times being a powerful, white man did not benefit Trump. Women are used to being interrupted. That's why when Harris said it to Pence in 2020 it was such a powerful encapsulation of the experience of female life. Trump tried to make the line his, but he flailed and failed, and that quickly became a theme of the debate. And somehow, Harris used the power imbalance to be powerful. She was able to bait Trump by mentioning the crowd size at his rallies. She was able to use the optics of a woman standing up for herself to her advantage.

That moment when Trump told Harris he was ""talking now"" reminded a lot of us of what it's still like to be a woman in the world. That line, coming from Trump, somehow served as a brutal reminder of what his administration took from our gender -- the right to bodily autonomy.

One of the sometimes subtle, sometimes not-so-subtle threads running through this entire truncated Harris-Trump campaign cycle has been misogyny. The thrice-married adulterer Trump, who paid off not one but two women during the 2016 campaign cycle, is someone who behaves in a deeply misogynistic way. Not that that's enough to disqualify him in the minds of many American voters.

Most of the time, that misogyny and sexism is focused on Harris, like when Trump posted a crude sexist meme about her on his social media platform. And Trump is not the only one to delight in this sexist commentary. You could say his running mate, JD Vance, sometimes almost makes Trump look like a feminist: Whereas Trump has flip-flopped on the matter, Vance vocally supports a national abortion ban, as he told a podcast in 2022: ""I certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally."" Vance has somehow managed to double down on some of Trump's worst instincts, from his comments about childless cat ladies to his belief that post-menopausal women exist to care for their grandchildren.

""Quiet, please,"" Trump said at another point during the debate, as Harris tried to interject with an answer. Once again, it didn't work, landing with a patronizing thud. During the debate, it became clear to me that Harris has more available to her than female politicians historically have. So she was able to take the high road, to ignore his pettiness. And by not overly focusing on her own identity, she's been able to allow Trump to bait himself into obsessing about it.

A number of Republicans showed us who they were that debate night. The sexism was largely focused on details that somehow mattered a lot when it came to Harris, but not at all when it came to her male opponent. GOP pollster Frank Luntz posted, ""If she wants to win, Harris needs to train her face not to respond. It feeds into a female stereotype and, more importantly, risks offending undecided voters."" The sexism here rests in the notion that women's faces must always be pleasing to the viewer, part of an old, tired notion that many of us are very weary of.

But for a lot of people, the impact of Harris' debate performance has landed very differently. One Georgia swing-state voter told Sarah Longwell for a piece she wrote in The Atlantic, ""I was actually pleasantly surprised at Harris. She addressed most of the issues pretty well, and she gave Donald Trump what other candidates couldn't. She was a little bit sarcastic, talking back with him, which I appreciated."" It turns out there's more available to women politicians than there used to be in the 1980s, when Luntz was in his prime.

The world has changed since Geraldine Ferraro was the first woman to run for vice president. It's even changed since Hilary Clinton's 2016 campaign, when a confident, pantsuited former secretary of state failed to break the glass celling by only a few thousand voters in a few swing states.

Roe is no longer the law of the land. Women know what it's like to lose. Harris showed us there's more available to women politicians than ever before. Can she translate that to an electoral victory? No one knows. But she's making space for herself and showing others that they can, too."
"At the debate, JD Vance's many troubles went from bad to worse",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/debate-jd-vances-many-troubles-went-bad-worse-rcna170613,2024-09-11T18:00:35Z,"In 2016, Trump became the first presidential candidate to distance himself from his own running mate during a debate. In 2024, he did it again.

Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance was already struggling as a candidate for national office, but the past week or so has been especially brutal.

It was six days ago, for example, when the Ohio senator sat down with a prominent conservative pundit, who asked what can be done to address the cost of child care. Vance's answer was, by any fair measure, ridiculous. A day later, the GOP candidate lamented that deadly mass shootings in schools are a ""fact of life"" -- a comment that sparked fierce and immediate pushback.

On Monday, Vance threw his support behind a ridiculous and racist conspiracy theory about immigrants abducting and eating pets, and on Tuesday, he endorsed a brazenly illegal response to Trump's 2020 election defeat

Hours later, the Ohioan's week managed to get even worse during the presidential debate, as his running mate distanced himself from Vance's recent rhetoric.

The trouble began when ABC News' Linsey Davis asked Donald Trump whether he would veto a national abortion ban if it got to his desk during a possible second term. The former president largely dodged the question, saying he wouldn't have to veto such a measure.

So, Davis tried again, reminding the GOP nominee that his running mate, just last month, told NBC News that Trump would, in fact, veto a federal abortion ban. At that point, the former president replied:

He quickly added, ""We don't have to discuss it,"" dodging the underlying question again.

The exchange suggested that, as far as Trump is concerned, Vance isn't an entirely reliable source for information about the former president's position and plans.

If this sounded at all familiar, it wasn't your imagination. As longtime readers might recall, something similar happened eight years ago.

During the second presidential debate in 2016, ABC News' Martha Raddatz reminded Trump that his own running mate had said, in the context of a discussion about U.S. policy in Syria, that ""provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength."" In an unusual display, Trump denounced the position.

In fact, the then-Republican candidate said of Pence, ""He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree. I disagree.""

In other words, in 2016, Trump became the first presidential candidate to ever distance himself from his own running mate during a general-election debate. Eight years later, he did it again."
Trump's abortion lies on Roe v. Wade at the debate flunked the legal test on multiple counts,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-debate-abortion-lies-roe-v-wade-supreme-court-rcna170596,2024-09-11T16:20:10Z,"Among other false statements, the Republican nominee said that everyone wanted the abortion rights precedent overturned and that six justices made it happen.

You think Chief Justice John Roberts watched the presidential debate Tuesday night? If so, he could've taken issue in real time with Donald Trump giving ""tremendous credit to those six justices"" who overturned Roe v. Wade.

The factual problem with Trump's statement is that it's not true.

Five justices voted to ditch Roe. Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett joined Justice Samuel Alito's 2022 opinion in the Dobbs case that overturned federal abortion rights.

To be sure, Roberts didn't dissent like the three Democratic appointees did. He wrote a separate concurring opinion saying, essentially, that overturning Roe went too far. Roberts wanted to further erode abortion rights but not eliminate them.

Indeed, the former president twice botched the number of justices in the Dobbs majority on Tuesday.

""And through the genius and heart and strength of six Supreme Court justices we were able to do that,"" he said at the debate against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, referring to Dobbs. Trump later said: ""And I give tremendous credit to those six justices.""

So, Trump gave Roberts ""credit"" where it wasn't due.

And unlike some of Trump's other lies, the political benefit to him mischaracterizing the vote count in Dobbs is not readily apparent. In fact, he might even benefit from an accurate rendering. After all, his three high court appointees -- Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett -- accounted for a majority of those five justices. So if overturning Roe was a good thing, as Trump claims, then a vote for Trump in November is a vote for a president who will appoint more justices who will do more of the same on abortion.

Of course, the Dobbs vote count wasn't Trump's only lie during the debate. It wasn't even the only abortion-related lie. One of the ABC moderators had to explain to the former president that ""there is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born.""

And in somehow trying to cast Dobbs as both uncontroversial and heroic, Trump falsely claimed that ""every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, liberal, conservative, they all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote.""

Polling shows that the majority of reproductive age women in the U.S. oppose leaving the legality of abortion up to the states. And to note the obvious, a case reaches the Supreme Court because there's disagreement over an issue. Dobbs was no exception. The 5-4 -- not 6-3 -- vote count on overturning Roe further underscores that reality."
Opinion | Harris understood the assignment. Trump did not. Does it matter?,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-kamala-harris-debate-might-not-have-mattered-rcna170553,2024-09-11T13:00:51Z,"The choice has now been laid out, and it is stark. Tuesday's presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump likely won't be among history's most remembered, but it delivered what we needed in 2024, showcasing the very real differences between the two candidates.

And yet, I'm left to wonder whether it was enough to dramatically change the race. After nearly a decade of this same Trump in our politics, it's difficult to have real confidence that an objectively poor performance will cost him the White House. As disorienting as his comments can be, it feels exactly like what we've seen from him for years.

The question remains: How many voters are willing to overlook his obvious flaws and bizarre rhetoric out of gauzy nostalgia for pre-pandemic days or a frustration with the current administration's handling of the economy?

In style and substance, Harris looked the part of a president, the awkwardness of her early stumbles on the national stage gone. She spoke to her plans but more so to the values, principles and priorities that motivate her. She was firm and forward-looking. Harris was speaking directly to the American people.

Trump, by contrast, reprised his familiar role as America's dark and self-obsessed loudmouth. He did little to appeal to swing voters, diving immediately into conservative culture issues and conspiracy theories. The Trump campaign had hoped to present Harris as a lightweight and a radical. But once again it was undermined by its candidate. The former president leveled many attacks, to be sure, but he got so lost in his own rambles that Harris was rarely put on the defensive.

At times she was able to toy with him, tossing out bait on topics like crowd sizes, Trump's criminal conviction and his role on Jan. 6. He eagerly took it each time, wasting precious time on self-indulgent rants that serve only to highlight his narcissism. Perhaps the worst moment for the former president was an extended argument that he, in fact, did not lose the 2020 election. None of this does him any good with the undecided voters who will determine this election.

Harris, meanwhile, understood the assignment. She pressed her advantage on issues like abortion while presenting herself as a mainstream Democrat, saying she would be tough on illegal border crossers, promoting the need for a mighty military force and even announcing herself as a gun owner. She had no knockout blows, but in contrast to the brooding, unfocused performance of her opponent she was the clear better candidate onstage.

Tuesday's debate was much bigger than the differences in their policy proposals. It was a contrast in the character, ideals and seriousness that we should expect from a president.

It's confounding that the race is so close, making this debate supposedly so crucial, because the choice should not be hard. There is a serious candidate working to earn your vote, running in the traditions of American democracy and offering a vision for moving America forward. And there is another who remains deeply unstable and wants to scare people into going backward."
Opinion | Trump's spectacular meltdown on the debate stage,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/donald-trump-debate-meltdown-kamala-harris-rcna170551,2024-09-11T10:37:06Z,"Even by his standards, the former president was shockingly incoherent and quick to rage.

There's a long-standing theory in politics that whoever controls the first 15 minutes of a debate will go on to control the entire evening. That was certainly the case back on June 28, when former President Donald Trump dominated the first presidential debate so completely that President Joe Biden faced immediate calls to drop out of the race.

What a difference a few months can make. In his first outing against new Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, Trump spent almost the entire evening on the defensive against both Harris and moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis. Faced with a real-time fact-checking of some of his outlandish statements, Trump inadvertently conceded what millions of Americans have known for years: His policy positions are mostly based on whatever he's seen on far-right television networks.

After less than an hour it was clear that Trump had discarded any attempt to challenge Harris on policy, reverting instead to a nonstop stream of name-calling, self-pity and directionless fury. Even by Trumpian standards, the former president's performance stood out as shockingly incoherent. It was certainly not the night an already nervous Trump campaign was hoping for.

What Americans saw on Tuesday was a Trump who appeared convinced that his second presidential debate would go much like his first -- with Trump controlling the floor while his Democratic opponent struggled to mount any defense. Instead, Trump went toe-to-toe with a career prosecutor who clearly understood how to derail her opponent while repeatedly urging Americans to ""turn the page"" on his political circus.

Trump's breakdown started early in the evening, when he repeated the debunked claim that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, had been stealing and eating local pets. That conspiracy theory caught fire online this week after right-wing social media accounts ran with the unsourced story -- even though there is no actual evidence that it happened.

Muir was quick to correct Trump by noting that Springfield officials, including the city manager, have reported no such incidents of cat-eating in their town. A further ABC News investigation also failed to turn up any examples of missing or injured pets. That inconvenient correction led Trump's strangest meltdown yet.

""Well, I've seen people on television!"" Trump shouted in a failed effort to interrupt Muir's fact-check. ""The people on television saying, 'My dog has been taken and used for food!' But maybe [the city manager] said that, and maybe that's a good thing for a city manager to say.""

What?

Despite multiple efforts to name-call Harris into a direct conflict, Trump never managed to regain his momentum after his cat-eating meltdown. At one point Trump seemed to even confuse himself, first accusing Harris of stealing his economic plan and then calling her a ""Marxist"" for advocating those economic policies. His economic confusion seemed even stranger given the former president's refusal to outline his second-term economic policy despite multiple direct questions from the moderators.

At one point, Davis asked Trump if, after years of empty promises, he had finally produced an actual policy to reform health care. ""I have the concepts of a plan,"" Trump admitted. When asked for even bare-bones details about his alleged plan, Trump argued that he shouldn't have to come up with any ideas because he's ""not the president right now.""

In a change of pace that will most likely have Democrats breathing a sigh of relief, Tuesday's debate proved to be Harris' to control. In a series of back-and-forths, Harris succeeded in cornering Trump on Republicans' proposed national abortion ban, with the former president twice refusing to say whether he would veto the bill. When asked why vice presidential nominee JD Vance recently reassured voters that Trump would veto any effort to federally ban abortion, Trump claimed to have no idea what Vance was talking about. It was hardly a picture of party unity.

Harris' needling about Trump's inaction on Jan. 6 also yielded an explosive and contradictory response, with Trump claiming he had ""nothing to do with"" the attack on the Capitol and, for good measure, once again defending his controversial 2017 remark that white supremacist marchers in Charlottesville, Virginia, included some ""very fine people.""

Despite repeated claims by Trump's handlers that the former president would exercise discipline in his matchup with Harris, what viewers saw was an angry and scattered former president repeatedly scolded for pushing falsehoods. Worse for Trump's fragile ego, his flurry of attacks against Harris seemed to fall flat. Not only did Harris appear unrattled; Trump's attacks seemed to tee up her most effective comebacks.

If Trump wanted to telegraph to Americans that his campaign is thriving, Tuesday's debate wasn't the way to do it. The former president looked frazzled, frustrated and ready to be done with a grueling 90 minutes. Don't expect a rematch after that sorry display."
Opinion | Who won the debate? Why Trump never even came close,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/who-won-debate-tonight-harris-trump-taylor-swift-rcna170550,2024-09-11T04:19:38Z,"Kamala Harris. Throughout Tuesday's debate, the vice president looked poised, qualified and presidential -- and that's without comparing herself to the clearly frustrated former president with whom she shared a stage. Harris baited Donald Trump repeatedly, and mostly easily. She needled and poked him on crowd size, his rallies, his racist and easily debunked lies about Haitian immigrants and his flip-flops on abortion.

In the process, she exposed both moments of incompetence and the reality that her opponent is concerningly easy to manipulate. If she can do that in front of the entire country -- and, indeed, people around the world -- it's not a stretch to imagine how he might get rolled by the world's autocrats and dictators.

She pushed hard to lay out her policy highlights and pushed back on Trump's various anti-immigrant rants and obfuscations. She humanized issues like abortion and spoke clearly and calmly about the ongoing war in Ukraine, the American withdrawal from Afghanistan and the need for a cease-fire in Gaza.

Harris' performance, with its forceful eloquence and emotional resonance, spotlighted the stark difference between the candidates. And it also contrasted dramatically with the first presidential debate, just a few months ago in June, when Trump was able to overpower a seemingly tired and confused President Joe Biden.

Donald Trump. Let's put it this way: When you find yourself onstage ranting about people ""eating"" dogs and cats, you're not winning this debate. That's a literal quote, by the way: ""They're eating the pets of the people that live there!"" As moderator David Muir noted, there is no evidence that any migrants are eating pets. Obviously. But that didn't stop Trump.

Even in today's ""unconventional"" political environment, the man insisting that migrants are eating domesticated animals in middle America isn't winning over those key undecided voters.

And that's what Trump was supposed to be doing tonight: making the case that he is presidential. That his cognitive health isn't an issue. That he has a plan to improve the economy and make the lives of individual Americans demonstrably better. This performance, with its grumpy asides and meandering monologues, won't quiet the growing criticism of his age -- at 78, he's now the oldest presidential nominee in history. And it won't make him seem presidential. When asked about his plans to replace Obamacare, he said he has ""a concept of a plan."" Whatever that means.

It's easy to mock Trump's embrace of the conspiracy theory that Haitian immigrants are eating pets, but it's also critical to point out this well-documented lie is intended to demonize a subset of the population for political gain. Trump clearly hopes that promoting racist myths about Black and brown people will appeal to the Republican base. It's disingenuous, disgusting and completely baseless.

And to be fair to these ABC moderators, they did a very good job pushing back on Trump in real time, including a strong debunking of the pet-eating myth. ""We checked with the city manager"" of Springfield, Ohio, Muir told the candidate, even as Trump doubled down with an odd point about seeing ""people on television talking about it.""

This will most likely be one of the most viral moments of the debate -- Taylor Swift's endorsement notwithstanding. And that's not going to make Trump's night much better."
Black men have been a focus for Harris and her allies long before Obama's recent challenge,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-black-men-obama-harris-misogyny-c468d83d73c52406648c9bd5e7b9a33d,2024-10-12T15:12:34Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Barack Obama had frank words for Black men who may be considering sitting out the election.

""Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that,"" he said Thursday to Harris-Walz campaign volunteers and officials at a field office in Pittsburgh.

The nation's first Black American president touched a nerve among Democrats worried about Vice President Kamala Harris' chances of becoming the second.

Harris is counting on Black turnout in battleground states such as Pennsylvania in her tight race with Republican Donald Trump, who has focused on energizing men of all races and tried to make inroads with Black men in particular.

Obama's comments belie that Black men still overwhelmingly back Harris. But her campaign and allies have worked hard trying to shore up support with this critical group of voters -- and addressing questions about potential misogyny.

Black Americans are the most Democratic-leaning racial demographic in the country, with Black men being outpaced only by Black women in their support for Democrats.

A recent poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about 7 in 10 Black voters had a favorable view of Harris and preferred her leadership to that of Trump on several major policy issues including the economy, health care, abortion, immigration and the war between Israel and Hamas.

There was little difference in support for Harris between Black men and Black women.

But Khalil Thompson, co-founder and executive director of Win With Black Men, said he agreed with what he saw as Obama's larger point.

""I believe President Obama is speaking to a tangible, visceral understanding of what it means for all men to relate to women in America. Calling out misogyny is not wrong,"" said Thompson, whose group raised more than $1.3 million for Harris from 20,000 Black men in the 24 hours after President Joe Biden bowed out of the race in July and made way for Harris.

Win With Black Men has organized weekly calls and events meant to bolster Harris' standing with Black men. The flurry of activism has focused on combating misinformation in Black communities about Harris, as well as an emphasis on the policy priorities of Black men, which the group found are often centered on greater economic opportunities, safe communities, social justice policies and health care, particularly for the partners and children of Black men.

""We're not a monolith,"" Thompson said. ""However, we are just like every other American in this country who wants a good paying job, that we can provide for our children and participate in their lives and the lives of our partner, that we can get them home safely, afford to go to the grocery store, save a little for retirement and have a vacation.""

Harris said she believes the votes of Black men must be earned, like with any group of voters.

Black men ""are not in our back pocket,"" she told a panel hosted by the National Association of Black Journalists in September.

Harris recently sat down with the ""All The Smoke"" podcast hosted by former NBA players Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson to discuss her racial identity and policy issues of interest to Black men. On Tuesday, Harris will appear in Detroit for a live conversation with Charlamagne tha God, a prominent Black media personality.

The Harris campaign is conducting a number of outreach efforts to Black voters, including an tour of homecomings at historically Black colleges and universities, a number of radio and TV ads targeting Black voters in key states, and a get-out-the-vote operation engaging Black communities that complements the work of allied groups such as Win With Black Men.

It has also tapped high-profile surrogates, including politicians, business leaders, professional athletes and musical artists, to court Black men.

""Our Black men, we've got to get them out to vote,"" said former NBA star Magic Johnson during a recent Harris rally in Flint, Michigan. ""Kamala's opponent promised a lot of things to the Black community that he did not deliver on. And we've got to make sure we help Black men understand that.""

The Trump campaign and its allies have held roundtables for Black men and conducted a bus tour through swing states that featured cookouts in cities like Baltimore, Chicago and Philadelphia. The campaign believes the former president's appeals on issues such as the economy, immigration and traditional gender roles resonate with some Black men.

Trump earlier this year mused that the criminal charges against him in four separate indictments, one of which led to a conviction with another dismissed, made him more relatable to Black people.

""A lot of people said that's why the Black people like me, because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against, and they actually viewed me as I'm being discriminated against,"" he told a Black conservative audience in South Carolina.

Trump's support among Black, white, and Hispanic male voters worries senior Harris campaign officials as the election increasingly shapes up as divided along gender lines, with Harris stronger with women and Trump stronger with men.

But the debate over to what degree misogyny plays a role in some Black men not supporting Harris sidesteps a broader conversation on how Black men are engaged as full citizens in politics, argues Philip Agnew, founder of the grassroots political organization Black Men Build.

""To be a Black man in the United States is to be invisible and hypervisible at the same time, and neither one of those is a humanizing viewpoint,"" Agnew said.

Agnew's group traveled to 10 cities across the summer, hosting roundtables with Black men and making the case for civic engagement and a progressive politics. Agnew said many Black men throughout those conversations expressed exasperation toward politics, a sentiment shared by many Americans, in addition to a feeling that their political perspectives were often misunderstood or unappreciated.

""The Black men I know are incredibly concerned with the lives of our families and our communities,"" Agnew said. ""It's because of an abundance of love for our sisters that we ask questions, not a lack of love."""
Fight for House raging in districts ringing NYC where Trump struggled but other Republicans thrived,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/congress-election-new-york-house-67b4dd98abe707d221ff857e0787c2c6,2024-10-12T12:41:52Z,"NELSONVILLE, N.Y. (AP) -- Voters in a ring of congressional districts encircling New York City where Republican candidates often do well but Donald Trump struggled in 2020 could decide which party controls the U.S. House for the next two years.

Eleven districts within a 90-mile drive of Manhattan are expected to be among the country's most closely contested House races on Election Day.

Republicans hold a slim 6-5 edge now in the nearly contiguous circle that starts in the Long Island suburbs, cuts through western Connecticut and New York's Hudson River Valley and Catskills regions, then carves through northeast Pennsylvania before curling back into New Jersey.

Both parties have a shot at picking up seats across the broad territory of dense suburbs, leafy exurbs and former mill towns. Democrats have made the region an important part of their strategy to reclaim a House majority, but voters in the districts have been far from uniform in their thinking in recent elections.

They have been united in two key ways: Most have been open to Republican candidates, but they also have shown an aversion to Trump. That means having the former president at the top of the GOP ballot this year could be decisive in congressional races unless opposition to him has softened or voters in the region are willing to split their tickets.

Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden in all but two of the 11 districts in 2020. Two years later, voters in seven of them sent Republicans to Congress. In three of those districts where Republicans won in 2022, and two more where Democrats prevailed by razor-thin margins, Trump lost to Biden by at least 10 percentage points, according to voting data tabulated by The Associated Press.

It isn't clear whether the political dynamics that helped Republicans do well outside New York City in the 2022 midterms exist today. In that election, many suburban voters were worried about a spike in violent crime after the COVID-19 pandemic. But crime rates since then have dropped.

""The message environment in 2022 made the battlefields very uphill for Democrats,"" said former U.S. Rep. Steve Israel, a Long Island Democrat who once served as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

But in a presidential election year, with Trump in a fierce campaign against Vice President Kamala Harris, ""the message environment is defined by the top of the ticket."" Israel said. ""In these districts, this tends to become a referendum on Donald.""

The ability of Republican candidates to outperform Trump two years ago was illustrated in New York's 17th Congressional District, a suburban area north of the city that is home to the Village of Sleepy Hollow, Sing Sing Prison and such luminaries as Bill and Hillary Clinton and the billionaire George Soros.

Trump owns a golf club and a private estate in the district, but still lost to Biden there by 10 percentage points. In 2022, Republican Mike Lawler narrowly defeated U.S. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat who had been in office for a decade.

Now, Lawler is in a tough campaign against Mondaire Jones, a former Democratic congressman who was one of the first two openly gay Black men to serve in the House when he was elected in 2020. Jones lost his seat when the boundaries of his district were redrawn.

Both candidates have geared their strategies toward attracting moderate voters, while criticizing each other as being in league with radicals.

""People are waking up to the fact that even if they don't believe Mike Lawler is as bad as Marjorie Taylor Greene, they can't afford to vote for him because he empowers the chaos and the extremism that we are seeing down in Washington,"" Jones told The Associated Press, referring to the far-right congresswoman from Georgia.

Democrats have also claimed that Lawler wants to ban abortion, which the Republican denies. Lawler said Democrats are trying to mislead voters on an issue that has proved to be a winner for many Democrats since the Supreme Court in 2022 ended constitutional protections for abortion rights.

""It speaks to the fact that they have nothing else to discuss or talk about, from the economy to the border to the international crises around the globe,"" Lawler told the AP.

Lawler's approach has worked with constituents such as Michelle Patterson, 71, who lives in a small home adorned with Trump flags and Republican lawn signs in the village of Nelsonville.

She described Lawler as ""common sense"" and Jones as a ""radical"" and said Democrats are trying to distract voters with their warnings about abortion access.

""He's not advocating to ban abortion!"" she said of Lawler.

For other voters, it's a harder sell.

""I don't believe him,"" said Jill Ferson, 77, a social worker who lives in the village of Croton-on-Hudson, when asked about Lawler saying he will not support a federal abortion ban.

Ferson said her biggest concerns this election were keeping Trump out of office and preserving abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.

Similar dynamics surface in the other ring districts.

On Long Island, Republican Rep. Anthony D'Esposito is trying to hold onto a congressional district right outside New York City that Biden won by 15 percentage points. D'Esposito is trying to cast Democrat Laura Gillen as soft on crime while criticizing Democrats over immigration policies he blames for an influx of migrants.

Gillen, a former town supervisor, has rejected those criticisms and said that if elected, she would push for more law enforcement and border security.

Northwest of the city, Democrat Josh Riley is trying to unseat U.S. Rep. Marc Molinaro, a Republican, in a rematch of their close contest in 2022. The district runs from the Hudson River Valley to the Finger Lakes.

In some New York districts, Democrats could face questions about the indictment of New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who has pleaded not guilty to charges that he accepted bribes and illegal campaign contributions. But Adams is not on the ballot, so that may not matter to voters. While some Republicans have used the scandal to assert that there's rampant corruption in the Democratic Party, Trump has spoken sympathetically about Adams, portraying his prosecution as politically motivated.

In northeast Pennsylvania, a presidential battleground, three perennially contested congressional districts feature incumbents with a knack for survival. They include Republican U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, who is chasing a fifth term in a district that favored Biden by 5 percentage points in 2020. His opponent is Ashley Ehasz, a former Army helicopter pilot whom he two years ago by almost 10 percentage points.

Solidly blue New Jersey and Connecticut also have at least one competitive race apiece.

In a New Jersey district that includes Trump's Bedminster golf club, Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Kean Jr. is seeking a second term against Democrat Sue Altman, a former leader of the state's progressive Working Families Alliance.

In Connecticut, Democratic U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes is matched up again with former Republican state Sen. George Logan, whom she defeated by less than 1 percent two years ago in a district Biden won by 11 percentage points.

At a recent debate, Hayes accused Logan of hiding his support for Trump. Logan denied that, but did not say Trump's name once."
Ted Cruz and Colin Allred wage another big US Senate fight in Texas,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/texas-allred-cruz-senate-election-2024-ebf06d66ff07a94704fac0acec7d30b5,2024-10-12T04:07:47Z,"FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Attack ads on every TV break. Campaign money pouring in. And on a sunny Saturday, a crowd stretching out the door for a campaign rally at Tulip's, a popular Fort Worth nightclub -- this time for Democratic U.S. Rep. Colin Allred, a former NFL linebacker trying to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.

Texas is having one of those Octobers again.

With Democrats defending twice as many Senate seats as Republicans, Allred's bid could be their best chance to flip a seat next month and preserve their thin Senate majority. Cruz is imploring Republican supporters to take the challenge seriously, six years after his narrow victory over Beto O'Rourke revealed fault lines for Republicans after decades of dominance in Texas.

But Allred, who would become Texas' first Black senator, is doing things his own way. Out for more than the moral victories Texas Democrats have settled for since 1994 -- the last time they won a statewide election -- Allred has run to the center and away from O'Rourke's barnstorming and break-the-rules blueprint. The different look has frustrated some Democrats, but amid signs of a competitive race with less than a month to go, Allred is sticking to the script.

""Beto didn't win, but he was successful,"" said Ryan Armstrong, 21, who was registering voters outside Tulip's on a clipboard still adorned with a ""Beto for Texas"" sticker. ""I have a lot of hope that (Allred) will win, but I honestly don't know if he's done enough.""

Allred, a three-term congressman from Dallas, is by nature a far different candidate than O'Rourke, an electrifying orator who was quick to hop up on a table to fire up a crowd and road-tripped across all 254 counties. Allred describes himself as someone who ""keeps a cool head"" and presents himself as a bipartisan problem-solver. To win with that low-key approach, he'll need enthusiasm generated by Vice President Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket even as he sets himself apart from her in a state former President Donald Trump is expected to win handily.

""Colin has to outperform Harris, so that's a little more delicate for him than it was for us,"" said David Wysong, a top O'Rourke adviser during his 2018 run against Cruz.

Allred boosts his moderate credentials by touting endorsements from prominent Republicans, including former U.S. Reps. Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney.

Other factors also could work in Allred's favor. Most notably, there's the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in 2022 to strip away constitutional protections for abortion, a ruling that paved the way for Texas to outlaw nearly all abortions. That has been a winning issue for Democrats ever since, even in red states like Kentucky and Kansas.

Allred has featured abortion rights in his campaign, highlighting the personal story of Kate Cox, a Texas woman forced to flee the state to get an abortion after doctors determined her fetus had a fatal condition for which there are no exceptions under Texas law.

He has also not let up on Cruz's family vacation to Mexico during a deadly winter storm that crippled the state's power grid and is likely to remind voters again when the candidates debate on Oct. 15.

Cruz, meanwhile, has transformed from selling himself as an unapologetic partisan who showed little interest in governing when he arrived in Washington to a get-things-done Republican holding the line against Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democrats. He remains just as combative, attacking Allred as a ""radical leftist"" and linking the congressman to immigration problems and transgender rights.

""Let me tell you, Chuck Schumer and the communists have set their targets on Tarrant County,"" Cruz told a packed house of supporters at Outpost 36, a barbecue restaurant in the Fort Worth suburb of Keller.

""They can't have it,"" he said, prompting cheers from people waving Cruz signs that read ""Keep Texas Texas.""

Tarrant County, which includes Fort Worth and the fast-growing suburbs surrounding it, is the kind of place Allred needs to win big in. Races here have been close in recent cycles, with O'Rourke topping Cruz by less than 1 percentage point in 2018 and President Joe Biden winning the county by a similar margin four years ago.

""Six years ago it was a real battle, and this year it's a real battle,"" Cruz said. ""It's not complicated. If you are a hardcore partisan Democrat, after Donald Trump there's nobody in the country you want to beat more than me.""

And while O'Rourke's Senate campaign in 2018 may have provided some kind of statewide roadmap for Democrats, he lost in his attempt to unseat Gov. Greg Abbott two years ago by more than 10 percentage points.

The amount of money being spent by both sides hints at the race's national significance.

According to AdImpact, which tracks spending on advertising, the $120 million both parties are spending on the Texas U.S. Senate race is set to exceed the roughly $40 million either paid for or reserved in the Florida Senate race, another top target for Democrats. But it pales in comparison with races in Montana and Ohio, where total spending exceeds $700 million on races in which Democrats are defending seats in red-leaning states.

Part of the heavy spending in Texas is attributable to its size, with 20 separate television markets, including two of the largest and most expensive in the country in Dallas and Houston.

""I think part of it also reflects the fact that Allred has been very successful raising money, and he's been spending quite a bit of that on TV advertising,"" said Mark Jones, a Rice University political science professor. ""National Democrats have not yet demonstrated the same level of enthusiasm and optimism as the Allred campaign. Part of that may be that they're still trying to figure out the difficult calculus of combining defense, which they're far more focused on, and offense.""

Allred's resume seems perfect for the Lone Star State. A star high school athlete from Dallas, he played linebacker and was captain of the football team at Baylor University in Waco. After his NFL career, he worked as a civil rights attorney.

He also has knocked off a high-profile Republican, having defeated Rep. Pete Sessions after he'd spent more than two decades in Congress in 2018. That campaign drew considerable energy from O'Rourke's bid to unseat Cruz, who beat the former El Paso congressman by less than 3 percentage points.

Still, running a successful statewide campaign comes with a higher degree of difficulty, and Allred's approach has left some Democrats scratching their heads. In Laredo, for example, a fast-growing county along the U.S.-Mexican border, some Democrats wonder where he's been.

""He's done absolutely nothing, nothing to appeal to our voters,"" said Sylvia Bruni, chair of the Webb County Democratic Party. ""As far as he's concerned, apparently we're not worth the time.""

Allred defends his strategy, saying the political landscape has shifted.

""I'm a different candidate and this is a very different year,"" he said. ""We have different issues that have happened since 2018.""

'The View' abortion ad signals wider effort to use an FCC regulation to spread a message,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/view-television-advertising-abortion-fcc-0d8c5944405d13bdccf9cd17a4891e8b,2024-10-11T21:39:51Z,"An anti-abortion ad that aired during "" The View "" this past week and criticized the show's personalities was the most visible manifestation of a campaign that is making use of a federal law that forbids broadcasters from turning it down.

In the ad, a narrator says, ""I am so sick of stupid celebrities and lying journalists,"" while the screen shows pictures of ""The View"" host Whoopi Goldberg, her colleagues and other celebrities, including Taylor Swift, Oprah Winfrey, Robert DeNiro, Billie Eilish, Wolf Blitzer, Rachel Maddow and Dana Bash.

The ad compares the celebrities to Nazi leaders Joseph Goebbels and Leni Riefenstahl, criticizes the Americans for their so-called support of abortion rights and includes graphic pictures of aborted fetuses.

In a disclaimer that posted onscreen, ABC made clear it was holding the message at arm's length: ""The following is a paid political advertisement, and the ABC television network is required to carry it by federal law. The advertisement contains scenes that may be disturbing to children. Viewer discretion is advised.""

Longtime anti-abortion activist Randall Terry is behind the ads. Terry is a fringe candidate for president who has qualified for the ballot in a dozen states as the standardbearer of the Constitution Party, a status that has enabled him to get airtime for his commercials.

Under Federal Communications Commission regulations, broadcast stations ""are prohibited from censoring or rejecting political ads that are paid for and sponsored by legally qualified candidates,"" a standard that Terry has met.

""This is the last bastion of free speech,"" Terry said in an interview. ""The only place that you can still have free speech is on a licensed station as a federal candidate.""

The FCC rule applies only to candidates, not political organizations, meet its criteria and doesn't apply to cable networks or web-based properties like podcasts. CNN, which is not required to show the ad and said it wouldn't meet its standards anyway, issued a statement calling it ""outrageous, antisemitic and dangerous.""

Terry already has another ad -- featured on his website but not yet on television -- that specifically targets CNN's Jake Tapper.

""I'm not going to be the president,"" Terry said. ""I'm not delusional. The whole point of this is to cause Kamala's defeat.""

To that end, many of his ads are anti-Harris and, except for a brief printed message on the screen, don't even mention his candidacy. He has been running advertisements on a local level throughout the campaign, in each of the states where an abortion measure is on the ballot. A total of 40 local ads have been completed, along with a series of national advertisements, Terry said.

His target audience is people aged 50 to 80, an age group that would be most likely to watch broadcast television, who are likely Democratic voters, Catholics and Black.

Christian F. Nunes, president of the National Organization for Women, said she worries that the ads represent a manipulation of FCC regulations and are promoting hateful rhetoric.

""It's definitely concerning,"" Nunes said. ""No one should be able to use running for office as a free pass in order to spew hate speech.""

Terry is probably more attuned than any activist to the use of FCC rules to help spread his message, said Jack Goodman, a Washington lawyer and former general counsel of the National Association of Broadcasters. He's not aware of any efforts to change the regulations through the years.

The rules don't permit broadcasters to edit the advertisements for use of what may be considered shocking images or language; whether or not an ad can contain an obscenity, for instance, has not been tested in court, Goodman said. On his website, Terry's so-far unaired Tapper ad includes an obscenity, although he said he will likely use a cleaner version for television.

He doesn't object to the warnings that some stations have shown before his ads.

""They're doing what they feel is in the best interest of the station,"" Terry said. ""That's up to them. I can't fault them for that. Look, these are hard images to see.""

Nunes said she suspects the advertisements will backfire for Terry among many women, driving them to the polls to vote against what he's advocating.

Texas man settles lawsuit with women who helped his wife get abortion pills,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/texas-abortion-bans-settlement-4be6bdee1520292d675f678f7053a6ce,2024-10-11T21:30:36Z,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A Texas man who sued his ex-wife's friends for helping her obtain an abortion informed the court that the two sides reached a settlement, forgoing the need for a trial that would have tested his argument that their actions amounted to assisting in a wrongful death.

Attorneys for Marcus Silva and the three women he sued last year filed court papers this week stating they had reached an agreement. As of Friday, the judge hadn't yet signed off on the settlement. Court records didn't include its terms, but a spokesperson for the defendants said the settlement didn't involve any financial terms.

""While we are grateful that this fraudulent case is finally over, we are angry for ourselves and others who have been terrorized for the simple act of supporting a friend who is facing abuse,"" Jackie Noyola, one of the women, said in a statement. ""No one should ever have to fear punishment, criminalization, or a lengthy court battle for helping someone they care about.""

Abortion rights advocates worried that the case could establish new avenues for recourse against people who help women obtain abortions and create a chilling effect in Texas and across the country.

Silva filed a petition last year to sue the friends of his ex-wife, Brittni Silva, for providing her with abortion pills. He claimed that their assistance was tantamount to aiding a murder and was seeking $1 million in damages, according to court documents.

Two of the defendants, Noyola and Amy Carpenter, countersued Silva for invasion of privacy. They dropped their counterclaims Thursday night after the settlement was reached.

""This case was about using the legal system to harass us for helping our friend, and scare others out of doing the same,"" Carpenter said. ""But the claims were dropped because they had nothing. We did nothing wrong, and we would do it all again.""

Brittni and Marcus Silva divorced in February 2023, a few weeks before Silva filed his lawsuit. The defendants alleged in their countersuit that Silva was a ""serial emotional abuser"" in pursuit of revenge and that he illegally searched Brittni's phone without her consent.

Silva was represented by Jonathan Mitchell, a former Texas solicitor general who helped draft a strict Texas abortion law known as Senate Bill 8 before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.

Mitchell declined to comment Friday.

Brittni Silva took the medication in July of 2022 according to court filings. It was a few weeks after the Supreme Court allowed states to impose abortion bans. The lawsuit claimed that text messages were shared between the defendants discussing how to obtain the abortion medication.

Earlier this year, an appeals court blocked an attempt by Silva's attorney to collect information from his ex-wife for the wrongful death lawsuit against her friends. The decision was upheld by the Texas Supreme Court, which criticized Silva in the footnotes of a concurring opinion signed by two of its conservative justices, Jimmy Blacklock and Phillip Devine.

""He has engaged in disgracefully vicious harassment and intimidation of his ex-wife,"" the opinion read. ""I can imagine no legitimate excuse for Marcus's behavior as reflected in this record, many of the details of which are not fit for reproduction in a judicial opinion.""

Abortion is a key issue this campaign season and is the number one priority for women younger than 30, according to survey results from KFF.

Thirteen states ban abortions at all stages of pregnancy, including Texas, which has some of the tightest restrictions in the country. Nine states have ballot measures to protect the right to an abortion this election.

El aborto es el tema electoral que m√°s preocupa a mujeres estadounidenses menores de 30 a√±os,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/politics/elecciones-en-eeuu-bc2e0fc70518c59e4f44097b6c66928f,2024-10-11T21:25:18Z,"El aborto ha superado a la inflaci√≥n y se ha convertido en el tema electoral que m√°s preocupa a las mujeres menores de 30 a√±os desde que la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris sustituy√≥ al presidente Joe Biden en la candidatura presidencial dem√≥crata, de acuerdo con una encuesta entre votantes estadounidenses realizada por la organizaci√≥n sin fines de lucro The Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) y publicada el viernes.

Alrededor de 2 de cada 5 mujeres encuestadas dijeron que el aborto era su principal preocupaci√≥n, mientras que a principios de a√±o s√≥lo 1 de cada 5 catalogaron el aborto de esa manera.

En la encuesta anterior, la inflaci√≥n era la principal preocupaci√≥n para las votantes m√°s j√≥venes, al igual que para las votantes de todas las edades. La inflaci√≥n segu√≠a siendo la principal preocupaci√≥n de las mujeres mayores de 30 a√±os y de las mujeres en general. Las mujeres en general ranqueaban el aborto como su tercera mayor preocupaci√≥n, despu√©s de la inflaci√≥n y las amenazas a la democracia, pero por encima de la inmigraci√≥n.

KFF, un centro de investigaci√≥n, encuestas y noticias sobre pol√≠ticas de salud, encuest√≥ a 678 mujeres entre el 12 de septiembre y el 1 de octubre. La mayor√≠a de ellas hab√≠an participado en una encuesta anterior, realizada en mayo y junio. En la encuesta de seguimiento se agregaron 29 mujeres de raza negra a la muestra para garantizar que ese grupo estuviera representado adecuadamente. El error de muestreo fue de m√°s/menos 5 puntos, con m√°rgenes mayores para los subgrupos de votantes.

Durante mucho tiempo, el aborto ha sido un tema electoral importante, pero el panorama cambi√≥ en 2022 cuando la Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos, con tres jueces nominados por el actual oponente de Harris: el expresidente Donald Trump, anul√≥ el fallo del caso Roe vs. Wade, lo cual permiti√≥ que se impusieran prohibiciones al aborto a nivel estatal.

La mayor√≠a de los estados con gobiernos republicanos est√°n aplicando ahora esas prohibiciones, lo cual incluye 13 estados que proh√≠ben el aborto en todas las etapas del embarazo, con algunas excepciones, y cuatro que proh√≠ben el aborto despu√©s de las primeras seis semanas de gestaci√≥n, es decir, antes de que muchas mujeres se den cuenta de que est√°n embarazadas.

Harris ha convertido el acceso al aborto uno de los ejes de su campa√±a.

Las votantes m√°s j√≥venes que respondieron a la encuesta y hablaron con The Associated Press el viernes se han dado cuenta de ello.

Ally Zobel, de 19 a√±os, quien se describe a s√≠ misma como una izquierdista independiente y vive en Woodbridge, Virginia, se prepara para votar por primera vez y asegur√≥ que la salud reproductiva es el tema m√°s importante para ella. Agreg√≥ que valora los esfuerzos de Harris para restablecer el derecho al aborto a nivel nacional."

A medida que se acercan las elecciones, el grado en que Trump puede erosionar el apoyo a Harris entre los votantes hispanos podr√≠a ser un factor importante en estados clave que no tienen una tendencia pol√≠tica definida, como Arizona. Los votantes hispanos apoyan m√°s a los dem√≥cratas en general: Seg√∫n la encuesta, casi la mitad se identifica como dem√≥crata, aproximadamente un tercio como republicano y alrededor de 2 de cada 10 como independientes. Pero la encuesta indica que los hombres hispanos, aunque no est√°n abrumadoramente a favor de Trump, est√°n m√°s abiertos a su candidatura que las mujeres hispanas -- y menos abiertos a la de Harris.

Antonio Melcon, un republicano de Florida de 65 a√±os, dijo que Trump tiene su voto porque es la mejor opci√≥n para el pa√≠s. En opini√≥n de Melcon, el gobierno del presidente Joe Biden ha llevado a la naci√≥n por un mal camino y Harris no ha hecho nada para detenerlo.

""Ella no fue la que implement√≥ la ruta que ha tomado este pa√≠s, pero estuvo all√≠ y no hizo nada que amerite que yo vote por ella"", se√±al√≥ Melcon. ""Definitivamente, nunca votar√≠a por ella"".

En general, los votantes hispanos -- hombres y mujeres -- tienen aproximadamente la misma probabilidad de decir que tienen una opini√≥n favorable de Trump y de Harris. Pero existe una divisi√≥n de g√©nero entre los votantes hispanos sobre Harris: aproximadamente 6 de cada 10 mujeres hispanas tienen una opini√≥n algo o muy favorable de Harris, en comparaci√≥n con el 45% de los hombres hispanos.

De manera similar, aproximadamente la mitad de las votantes hispanas piensan que Harris ser√≠a una buena presidenta, en comparaci√≥n con solo un tercio de los votantes hispanos.

Para algunos votantes, un candidato puede parecer mejor simplemente porque no les gusta la alternativa. Sonia Montoya, una dem√≥crata de 68 a√±os de Chicago, dijo que, si bien est√° de acuerdo con muchas de las pol√≠ticas de Harris, todav√≠a la considera como el menor de dos males. Montoya agreg√≥ que Harris es m√°s humana y tiene una mejor comprensi√≥n de la sociedad, mientras que ve a Trump como ""un arrogante, un mentiroso, un tramposo"".

Adem√°s de tener sentimientos m√°s favorables hacia Harris, aproximadamente 6 de cada 10 votantes hispanas dicen que Trump no ser√≠a un buen presidente, en comparaci√≥n con aproximadamente la mitad de los votantes hispanos.

Pero los hombres hispanos son m√°s propensos que las mujeres hispanas a pensar que Trump tiene la dureza -- la severidad y firmeza -- que requiere la presidencia. Aproximadamente la mitad de los hombres hispanos dicen que ""lo suficientemente duro para ser presidente"" describe a Trump extremadamente o muy bien, en comparaci√≥n con aproximadamente un tercio de las mujeres hispanas. Los hombres hispanos tambi√©n son m√°s propensos que las mujeres hispanas a decir que Trump es el candidato que representa sus puntos de vista sobre pol√≠ticas importantes.

No obstante, muchos hombres hispanos a√∫n apoyan a Harris y son esc√©pticos respecto a Trump. Sebastian Diaz, de 51 a√±os, un independiente de Massachusetts, considera a Harris ""de manera algo favorable"" porque est√° de acuerdo con la ideolog√≠a de ella. Dijo que tiene una opini√≥n ""muy desfavorable"" de Trump porque es ""un racista prejuicioso"".

A pesar de algunas divisiones en las opiniones sobre los candidatos, los votantes hispanos est√°n en gran medida de acuerdo en que la econom√≠a es un factor importante al considerar sus opciones para la presidencia. Alrededor de 8 de cada 10 votantes hispanos dicen que la econom√≠a es ""uno de los temas m√°s importantes"" durante esta temporada electoral.

Daysi Garc√≠a, de 44 a√±os, republicana de Pensilvania, mencion√≥ que los alimentos se han vuelto tan caros que los planes econ√≥micos de los candidatos gu√≠an su voto. Autoproclamada dem√≥crata hasta el a√±o pasado, Garc√≠a dijo que, si bien no est√° de acuerdo con todas las pol√≠ticas de Trump, est√° descontenta con los dem√≥cratas y cree que Trump ser√≠a una mejor opci√≥n para gobernar al pa√≠s.

""Est√° muy mal en este momento"", agreg√≥ Garc√≠a. ""Es muy dif√≠cil hacer compras de v√≠veres porque todo est√° por las nubes. No recuerdo haber visto nunca que todo se disparara como sucede ahora"".

Melcon coincide en que el costo de la vida es demasiado alto. ""La econom√≠a es lo m√°s importante para m√≠"", recalc√≥. ""El medio ambiente, la inmigraci√≥n -- que tambi√©n son un problema -- , son algo secundario"".

Aproximadamente 6 de cada 10 votantes hispanos tambi√©n dicen que la atenci√≥n a la salud y el crimen est√°n entre los temas m√°s importantes al considerar su voto, mientras que aproximadamente la mitad expresa lo mismo sobre la pol√≠tica de posesi√≥n de armas. Un poco menos de la mitad dice que el aborto o la inmigraci√≥n est√°n entre los m√°s importantes.

Los votantes hispanos son m√°s propensos que los votantes a nivel nacional a considerar la atenci√≥n m√©dica como una prioridad para decidir su voto.

D√≠az dijo que la atenci√≥n m√©dica, al igual que la comida y el agua, es una necesidad b√°sica para los humanos.

""Creo que el acceso universal a la atenci√≥n m√©dica es incre√≠blemente importante para el desarrollo social de un pa√≠s"", a√±adi√≥ D√≠az.

Harris tiene una ventaja potencial sobre Trump entre los votantes hispanos: aproximadamente 4 de cada 10 opinan que ella es la candidata que mejor representa su origen y cultura, mientras que aproximadamente una cuarta parte dice esto sobre Trump. No obstante, una parte considerable no est√° convencida de que alguno de los candidatos encaje en este papel: aproximadamente 3 de cada 10 dicen que ninguno de los candidatos representa su origen y cultura.

El hecho de que Harris sea hija de inmigrantes puede dar a algunos votantes hispanos una sensaci√≥n de representaci√≥n, dicen los defensores del compromiso c√≠vico, aunque ella no sea hispana.

Montoya agreg√≥ que Harris, como persona birracial, representa mejor su identidad. ""Ella sabe lo que se siente ser insultada o dejada de lado o sentir que no vales nada debido a los prejuicios en este mundo"", dijo Montoya. ""Creo que ella luchar√° m√°s duro por nosotros de lo que (Trump) jam√°s lo har√≠a"".

"Abortion has passed inflation as the top election issue for women under 30, survey finds",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/younger-women-abortion-survey-c8c504a7b9b5a92b4c101a57a3e3a4dc,2024-10-11T15:05:59Z,"Abortion has passed inflation to become the top issue in the presidential election for women younger than 30 since Vice President Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket, according to results released Friday of a survey of female voters by KFF.

About 2 in 5 in the group of young voters said abortion was their top concern in the recent survey, compared with 1 in 5 who ranked it most important in the same survey in the spring.

In the earlier edition, inflation was the top concern for younger voters, as it was for women voters of all ages. Inflation remained the top concern for women in each age group over 30 and women overall. Women overall ranked abortion as their No. 3 concern, after inflation and threats to democracy, but ahead of immigration.

KFF, a health policy research, polling and news organization, surveyed 678 female voters from Sept. 12 through Oct. 1. Most of them were participants in an earlier wave of the same poll, conducted in May and June. The follow-up survey group was supplemented with 29 Black women to ensure an adequate sample size of that group. The sampling error was plus or minus 5 points, with larger ranges for subgroups of voters.

Abortion has long been a major issue, but the landscape shifted in 2022 when the U.S. Supreme Court, powered by three justices nominated by Harris' current opponent, former President Donald Trump, overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door for states to impose abortion bans.

Most Republican-controlled states are now enforcing such bans, including 13 that bar abortions at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and four with bans that kick in after about the first six weeks of pregnancy -- before women often realize they're pregnant.

Harris has been making abortion access a centerpiece of her campaign.

In addition to the presidential race, a number of other elections this year could impact the abortion landscape, including in nine states where there are ballot measures that would protect the right to abortion in the state constitution.

Races for Congress -- as well as state offices such as governor, legislators, state supreme court justices and attorneys general -- could also help determine abortion policy moving ahead.

Overall, about two-thirds of women said the election will have a major impact on abortion access, up from just over half in the initial survey.

Most women said it is likely Trump would sign a federal law banning abortions after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy if Congress were to pass such a measure. Just as the survey period ended, Trump said he would veto an abortion ban if one reached his desk.

The majority said they believe Harris would sign a law protecting access to abortion nationwide if Congress were to pass that.

There's a deep partisan split over which candidate would be better on abortion access. Most women said they preferred Harris, including 90% of Democrats and fewer than one-fifth of Republicans. The survey found similar dividing lines around which candidate would be better for birth control access and in vitro fertilization.

The survey found that Republican women are slightly less hopeful and enthusiastic, and more anxious and frustrated, about the presidential election than they were earlier this year. By contrast, Democratic women are far more hopeful and enthusiastic, though their anxiousness has also risen.

Like in the spring, a little over half of GOP women are satisfied with their presidential choices. But satisfaction among Democratic women shot up from just over one-third to three-quarters."
Alaska US Rep. Peltola and Republican opponent Begich face off in wide-ranging debate,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/alaska-house-peltola-begich-7c856133135cb00f4752d8768fda4d46,2024-10-11T06:18:25Z,"JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Democratic U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola of Alaska and her main rival for the state's only House seat, Republican Nick Begich, faced off in a wide-ranging debate late Thursday, touching on topics including support for Ukraine, abortion and guns.

The briskly paced debate in Anchorage saw both candidates make their pitch to voters with just weeks until the Nov. 5 election. Peltola is seeking to stave off GOP efforts to reclaim the seat that Republican Rep. Don Young held for 49 years before his death in 2022.

Peltola, who is Yup'ik, won special and regular elections for the seat that year and became the first Alaska Native in Congress. Begich, who has been endorsed in this race by former President Donald Trump, was among the opponents Peltola defeated in 2022.

Peltola has tried to distance herself from presidential politics, declining to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris, while also saying she is not voting for Trump. During the debate, she said she doesn't see the world through a partisan lens and is focusing on her own race. She declined to say if she'd vote for Harris.

""It's a secret ballot,"" Peltola said, adding that she thinks both Harris and Trump have flaws. ""I think that much of the concern that we have will be around who are they choosing as their senior advisers?""

On a foreign policy issue, Peltola said it's important the U.S. support Ukraine in its fight against Russia.

""I think that they're fighting our war in many ways, and I do support the efforts that they're making,"" she said.

Begich said the needs of Americans should be prioritized.

""I want to make sure that we're putting the needs of Americans first, that we're not putting other people's wars on our national credit card expecting future generations to pay for them,"" he said.

The candidates were asked if they'd support a federal ban on abortion or a federal right to abortion. Begich said he would not support either. He said the matter should be left to the states.

Peltola, who has made reproductive rights a key issue in her campaign, said politicians have no business being part of the discussion.

Abortion ""should be safe, legal and rare,"" she said. ""We should be doing everything we can to prevent unwanted pregnancies. And meantime, we should be protecting the lives of women who have complicated medical situations.""

In Alaska, the state Supreme Court has interpreted the state constitution's right to privacy as encompassing abortion rights.

On the issue of guns -- protecting schools and gun rights -- both talked about the importance of gun safety and responsible ownership. Guns are common in Alaska, where hunting is part of the way of life.

Peltola said school shootings often involve someone ""who is isolated, who doesn't feel seen or heard.""

""We need to make sure that every child, every child in our community, every child in our school feels seen and heard,"" she said. ""We need to make sure that we don't have people in isolation, and we need to do as much as we can as gun owners to protect and safeguard guns and ammunition from getting in the wrong hands.""

Begich said competitive youth shooting leagues help train young people about gun safety and responsible ownership and is something that should continue to be invested in.

One of the debate questions came from the president and CEO of the Alaska Black Caucus, who wanted the candidates to identify initiatives they'd propose to address economic disparities and create opportunities for underrepresented communities.

Peltola said she wants to work for all Alaskans and that the best way to do that is to look at collective challenges, such as high heating and energy costs.

""I think that it's important that we are really intentional about making sure that everybody benefits from the programs that we work on,"" she said.

Begich said it's important that everyone ""have a seat at the table.""

""No matter where you started in life, no matter who you are, what community you're a part of, what ethnic group you're part of, what religion you have, it's important because that's the promise of America,"" he said.

He said there is disparity in the state's K-12 education system and more must be done to ensure that students have access to a high-quality education, including at the university level.

Peltola and Begich are the most prominent candidates in the race, which also includes Alaskan Independence Party candidate John Wayne Howe and Eric Hafner, a Democrat with no apparent ties to the state who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for threatening authorities and others in New Jersey.

The debate audience was told that only candidates who got at least 5% of the vote in the primary were invited to Thursday's debate. Neither Howe nor Hafner met that threshold."
Harris viewed more positively by Hispanic women than by Hispanic men: AP-NORC poll,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hispanic-latino-voters-harris-trump-toughness-economy-d42696a973e0988aed41bab2a46bb4cc,2024-10-11T04:07:11Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A solid majority of Hispanic women have a positive opinion of Vice President Kamala Harris and a negative view of former President Donald Trump, but Hispanic men are more divided on both candidates, according to a recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Hispanic men are also more likely than Hispanic women to say Trump is the candidate who represents their views on key issues, underscoring the potential importance of this group, which both candidates have courted aggressively.

As the election approaches, the extent to which Trump can erode Harris' support among Hispanic voters could be an important factor in swing states like Arizona. Hispanic voters are more supportive of the Democrats overall: According to the poll, nearly half identify as Democrats, about one-third as Republicans, and around 2 in 10 as independents. But the poll signals that Hispanic men, while not overwhelmingly in favor of Trump, are more open to his candidacy than Hispanic women -- and less open to Harris'.

Antonio Melcon, 65, a Republican from Florida, said Trump has his vote because he is the best option for the country. In Melcon's view, the Biden administration has taken the nation down a bad path, and Harris has done nothing to stop it.

""She wasn't the one that implemented the route this country has taken, but she's been there and done nothing that merits I vote for her,"" Melcon said. ""I would definitely never vote for her.""

Overall, Hispanic voters are about equally likely to say they have a favorable view of Trump and Harris. But there is a gender divide among Hispanic voters on Harris: About 6 in 10 Hispanic women have a somewhat or very favorable opinion of Harris, compared to 45% of Hispanic men.

Similarly, about half of Hispanic women voters think Harris would make a good president, compared to only about one-third of Hispanic men.

For some voters, one candidate may appear in a better light simply because they dislike the alternative. Sonia Montoya, a 68-year-old Democrat from Chicago, said while she agrees with many of Harris' policies, she still sees Harris as the lesser of two evils. Montoya said Harris is more human and has a better understanding of society, while she views Trump as ""arrogant, a liar, a cheater.""

In addition to having warmer feelings toward Harris, about 6 in 10 Hispanic female voters say Trump would not make a good president, compared to about half of Hispanic male voters.

And Hispanic men are likelier than Hispanic women to think Trump has the toughness the presidency requires. About half of Hispanic men say ""tough enough to be president"" describes Trump extremely or very well, compared to about one-third of Hispanic women. Hispanic men are also more likely than Hispanic women to say Trump is the candidate who represents their views on important policies.

Plenty of Hispanic men, though, remain supportive of Harris and skeptical about Trump. Sebastian Diaz, 51 and an independent from Massachusetts, views Harris ""somewhat favorably"" because he agrees with her ideology. He said he has a ""very unfavorable"" view of Trump because he is ""a racist bigot.""

Despite some divisions in views of the candidates, though, Hispanic voters are largely in agreement that the economy is a major factor as they consider their options for president. Around 8 in 10 Hispanic voters say the economy is ""one of the most important issues"" during this election season.

Daysi Garcia, 44, a Republican from Pennsylvania, said groceries have gotten so expensive that the candidates' economic plans are guiding her vote. A self-proclaimed Democrat until last year, Garcia said while she does not agree with all of Trump's policies, she is unhappy with the Democrats and thinks Trump would be a better choice to run the country.

""It is so bad right now,"" Garcia said. ""It is so hard to do grocery shopping because everything is through the roof. I don't remember ever seeing everything skyrocket the way it is now.""

Melcon agrees that the cost of living is too high. ""The economy is the main thing for me,"" he said. ""The environment, immigration -- which is also a problem -- that's second fiddle.""

About 6 in 10 Hispanic voters also say that health care or crime are among the most important issues for their vote, while about half say that about gun policy. Slightly less than half say abortion or immigration are among the most important. Hispanic voters are more likely than voters nationwide to see health care as a top voting priority.

Diaz said health care, like food and water, is a basic need for humans.

""I think universal access to healthcare is incredibly important for the social development of a country,"" Diaz said.

Harris has one potential advantage over Trump among Hispanic voters: About 4 in 10 say she is the candidate who better represents their background and culture, while about one-quarter say this about Trump. A sizable share are unconvinced that either candidate fits into this role, though: About 3 in 10 say neither candidate represents their background and culture.

The fact that Harris is the daughter of immigrants may give some Hispanic voters a sense of representation, civic engagement advocates say, even though she's not Hispanic herself.

Montoya said as someone who is biracial, Harris represents her identity best. ""She knows what it feels like to be insulted or put to the side or feel worthless because of prejudice in this world,"" Montoya said. ""I think she'll fight harder for us than (Trump) ever would.""

Figueroa reported from Austin.

The poll of 1,771 registered voters was conducted Sept. 12-16, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for registered voters is plus or minus 3.4 percentage points."
US House control teeters on the unlikely battleground of heavily Democratic California,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/california-house-democrats-republicans-majority-3dbc01320adc71a7eeb7d7f025032550,2024-10-11T04:07:00Z,"LOS ANGELES (AP) -- California's reputation as a hothouse of progressive politics is being tested in a string of U.S. House contests that are again expected to play into which party controls the chamber next year.

Despite its distinction as a liberal protectorate, both parties see races in the nation's most populous state as crucial battlegrounds and are pumping millions of dollars into campaigns that stretch from the beaches of San Diego and Orange County to the almond groves and vineyards of the Central Valley farm belt.

Two years ago the state played a pivotal role in securing the gavel for Republicans. Now only a handful of votes separate the rival parties in the House, with 220 Republicans, 212 Democrats and three vacancies.

California has 52 House seats -- more than any other state -- and 10 are considered in play. About half of those are viewed as toss-ups. Democrats dominate California, holding every statewide office and outnumbering registered Republicans by a nearly 2-to-1 margin statewide. But Republicans retain pockets of strength and picked up four House seats in 2020.

The most competitive contests are concentrated in Republican-held districts that were carried by Joe Biden in 2020. Overall, Republicans hold just 12 of the state's House seats.

At least on paper, Democrats have more than enough registered voters to seize a cluster of Republican-held districts. The lingering question, as in the past, is will they vote?

Democrats are likely to benefit from an elevated turnout in a presidential election year, with Vice President Kamala Harris, a former California U.S. senator and attorney general, leading the ticket. But how that will play out in closely divided swing districts is less clear.

Democrats are warning about former President Donald Trump's possible return to Washington, threats to abortion rights and gun violence. Republicans fault Democrats on crime, a porous southern border, high taxes and inflation that is squeezing household budgets.

Rep. Pete Aguilar, the third-ranking House Democrat, who lives in Redlands, east of Los Angeles, has predicted the decisive fight for the chamber ""will run through California.""

Democrats keep coming for Rep. Mike Garcia.

The last Republican congressman anchored in heavily Democratic Los Angeles County, Garcia, a former Navy pilot who flew more than 30 combat missions during Operation Iraqi Freedom, has displayed a surprising ability to beat the odds in a district with an 11-point Democratic registration edge. He is being challenged by Democrat George Whitesides, a former NASA chief of staff.

The once-conservative 27th District runs through suburbs and high desert north of Los Angeles. Garcia, a supporter of former President Donald Trump with a conservative voting record, was first elected running against California's liberal-leaning government. ""I don't want my country to turn into what my state has become,"" he said at the time.

Whitesides, who also is a former CEO of Virgin Galactic, says he would use his business experience to solve problems. He has spotlighted Garcia's opposition to abortion rights, labeling him an extremist.

Garcia put out a statement to clarify his stance on the issue, saying, ""I oppose a national abortion ban -- California's law on abortion stays the law -- and I support exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother.""

National Republicans have run ads depicting Whitesides as soft on crime. Garcia, like other GOP candidates, has been attacking his rival and other Democrats on inflation and taxes.

Garcia's military service is an asset in a district that is home to defense industries and popular with veterans, Los Angeles police officers and firefighters. The son of a Mexican immigrant father, his Hispanic surname also is beneficial in a district with a significant Latino population.

Orange County once was considered a conservative holy ground, where white, suburban homeowners delivered winning margins for Republicans year after year. It's considered a foundation block in the Reagan revolution. But the county, which lies southeast of Los Angeles, has become more demographically diverse and Democratic over time, like much of the state.

The seat from the 47th District, which includes Huntington Beach and other famous surf breaks, is occupied by Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, a progressive favorite who in 2022 narrowly defeated former Republican legislator Scott Baugh. Porter, known for grilling CEOs during Capitol Hill hearings, stepped aside to run for U.S. Senate but lost in the primary. Baugh is making another run for the seat, this time against Democratic legislator Dave Min.

National Republicans have called the seat a top target.

Given the stakes in the closely divided district, the contest has been especially rancorous. Min ads call Baugh a ""MAGA extremist"" who would endanger abortion rights. Baugh says Min's ""extreme liberal views"" are out of step with the district.

Rep. Ken Calvert is the longest-serving Republican in California's congressional delegation, having been first elected in 1992. Two years ago he held off Democrat and former federal prosecutor Will Rollins by about 5 percentage points, and Rollins is back for another try.

The 41st District is about equally divided between Republicans and Democrats. The race is a priority for both parties: Porter and former U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer have been among the recognized Democrats fundraising for Rollins.

National Republicans have called Rollins an ""extreme liberal."" Calvert brings the advantages of incumbency, but his conservative credentials and support from Trump could be liabilities in a district that includes many transplanted Los Angeles residents and the city of Palm Springs, which has a large concentration of LGBTQ+ voters. Rollins is gay.

Rollins says it's time for new leadership and has called Calvert an extremist whose views don't match the district.

By the numbers, the Central Valley's 22nd District should be a Democratic stronghold. The party holds a 14-point registration edge over Republicans. But GOP Rep. David Valadao has kept a grip on the seat nonetheless.

He held the district from 2013 until January 2019, lost the seat for a term, then won it back in a 2020 rematch with Democrat T.J. Cox. Democrat Rudy Salas is trying to claim the seat this year after losing to Valadao in 2022.

In a region sometimes called America's salad bowl for its vast agricultural production, Valadao has stressed his efforts to secure more water for farmers and willingness to work across the aisle, while depicting Salas as a tax-and-spend Democrat. ""David has ignored partisan bickering and demonstrated his commitment to local priorities,"" the Valadao campaign said in a fundraising pitch.

Salas, considered a moderate, has depicted Valadao as a Trump follower posing as a centrist. In Congress, he says, he will fight for lower drug prices, expanded health care and clean drinking water, which remains a chronic problem in some rural communities.

In the 13th District, Republican Rep. John Duarte is facing Adam Gray, the Democrat he defeated two years ago by one of the closest margins in the country, 564 votes. Duarte often is listed among the House's most vulnerable Republicans, given that narrow victory.

Another factor is the 13th's Democratic tilt, which is about 11 points over registered Republicans. There also is a large Latino population, similar to other Central Valley districts, but the most likely voters statewide tend to be white, older, more affluent homeowners. Working-class voters, including many Latinos, are less consistent in getting to the polls.

Both candidates have been stressing bipartisan credentials.

Duarte, a businessman and major grape and almond farmer, says his priorities include curbing inflation and crime and securing adequate supplies water for farmers, a perennial issue in the valley.

Gray, a former legislator, has criticized state water management and puts water and agriculture at the top of his issues list. He also says he wants improvements in infrastructure, renewable energy and education.

Republican Rep. Michelle Steel, a South Korean immigrant, is seeking a third term in the 45th District, which was specifically drawn to give Asian Americans a stronger voice on Capitol Hill.

The largest demographic in the district, which is anchored in Orange County, is Asian Americans, and includes the nation's biggest Vietnamese community. Democrats hold a 4-point registration edge.

Steel first won the seat in 2020 and then again 2022 with a 5-point win. This year she faces lawyer and worker rights advocate Derek Tran, the son of Vietnamese refugees.

Steel has been outspoken in resisting tax increases and says she stands strongly with Israel in its war with Hamas. ""As our greatest ally in the Middle East, the United States must always stand with Israel,"" she said in a recent email. She advocates for more police funding and has spotlighted her efforts on domestic violence and sexual abuse.

Tran has warned of Republican threats to abortion rights. Steel opposes abortion with exceptions for rape, incest or to save the life of the pregnant woman, while not going so far as to support a federal ban. Tran also says a Trump return to the White House would put democracy at risk.

The race will be watched nationally for hints about the preferences of Asian American voters."
"In Pacific Northwest, 2 toss-up US House races could determine control of narrowly divided Congress",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/oregon-washington-house-congress-election-2024-4b0c35b5c2ed1d55eb037a1d1c0d3cdd,2024-10-11T03:43:30Z,"PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- In their battle for Congress, national Republicans and Democrats are keenly eyeing the Pacific Northwest, where two of the most competitive U.S. House races in the country are playing out.

Oregon's GOP-held 5th Congressional District and Washington state's Democratic-held 3rd Congressional District are considered toss-ups, meaning either party has a good chance of winning.

Both districts are purple -- meaning a blend of Republican red and Democratic blue -- and feature freshman incumbents who narrowly flipped their seats in the 2022 midterms. And with turnout typically higher in presidential elections than in midterms, political experts say they'll be watching to see which candidates are able to mobilize more voters -- especially moderates and independents.

""These races could determine who controls the House of Representatives in the next Congress,"" said Chandler James, associate professor of political science at the University of Oregon. ""The Pacific Northwest is kind of where the center of a lot of action is.""

An intense rematch is playing out in southwest Washington, where first-term Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez is defending her seat against Donald Trump-backed Republican Joe Kent. Both candidates are trying to frame the other as the extreme choice.

The Republican-leaning district featuring sprawling farmlands as well as the suburbs of Portland, Oregon, narrowly went for Trump in 2020, making it a crucial target for the GOP this year.

Gluesenkamp Perez has sought to showcase herself as an independent-minded moderate. Her actions during her tenure have ranged from co-sponsoring a bill to protect medication abortion to voting in favor of a resolution rebuking Vice President Kamala Harris's role in the handling of the U.S.-Mexico border. She was also ranked by the Lugar Center and the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy as having one of the most bipartisan voting records in the U.S. House.

She has outraised Kent, bringing in $6.7 million compared to his $1.4 million, according to the most recent quarterly federal campaign finance records.

Kent, a former Green Beret who has promoted Trump's lie that the 2020 election was stolen, has blamed his opponent for things he sees as bad policy by the Biden administration, including its border policy. He has cited inflation and illegal immigration as top concerns while seeming to dull down some of his more extreme positions. In the past on social media he has called abortion an ""evil stain on our humanity,"" but in a debate on Monday, he said he doesn't support a federal ban.

""He is saying exactly what the pollsters tell him to, but we know what he believes,"" Gluesenkamp Perez said in response.

Both have honed in on the economic issues plaguing parts of the region, especially the rural areas, according to Mark Stephan, associate professor of political science at Washington State University Vancouver.

""They're both trying to claim that they care more than the other one about small communities, rural areas, the economic vitality of Southwest Washington,"" he said.

Gluesenkamp Perez came out of nowhere to narrowly win the seat two years ago against Kent in a district that hadn't been in Democratic hands for over a decade. She replaced Jaime Herrera Beutler, a more moderate Republican who lost the 2022 primary in part because she voted to impeach Donald Trump after the Jan. 6 insurrection.

There is no registration by party in the state, but for presidential primaries, Washingtonians must declare a party. In the primary this March, Republican voters outnumbered Democrats by nearly 30,000 in the district. However, a spokesperson from the Secretary of State's office cautioned that this doesn't indicate who will win.

The boundaries of Oregon's 5th District were significantly redrawn following the 2020 census. It encompasses disparate regions spanning part of Portland and its wealthy and working-class suburbs, as well as rural agricultural and mountain communities and the fast-growing central Oregon city of Bend on the other side of the Cascade Range.

In the 2022 midterms, the first elections to be held in the 5th after redistricting, GOP U.S. Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer flipped a seat that had been held by Democrats for roughly 25 years. But this November, she's facing a different opponent -- Janelle Bynum, a state representative who previously beat her in legislative elections in the district and has the backing and funding of national Democrats.

Bynum was elected to the Oregon House in 2016, representing the suburbs southeast of Portland. She says she would seek to codify the abortion protections of now-overturned Roe v. Wade into federal law if elected.

Before her election to Congress, Chavez-DeRemer was a former mayor of the Portland suburb of Happy Valley and small business owner. She has endorsed Trump and highlighted her endorsements from law enforcement groups. She says she doesn't support a national abortion ban, despite previously expressing support for the U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade and its federal abortion protections.

If Bynum wins in November, she'll be Oregon's first Black member of Congress. Chavez-DeRemer became the first Latina member of Congress to represent Oregon, along with Democratic U.S. Rep. Andrea Salinas in the state's 6th Congressional District, when both were elected in the 2022 midterms.

Democrats hold a slight advantage in voter registration in the 5th, but roughly a third of voters are unaffiliated, and the two candidates have sought to appeal to the district's purple hue. Bynum describes herself on her campaign website as a ""common-sense, pragmatic leader,"" while Chavez-DeRemer has highlighted her work on bipartisan bills. They've both tried to paint their opponent as extreme or radical.

In terms of campaign fundraising, Chavez-DeRemer has outpaced Bynum, raking in about $4 million compared to her opponent's $2.4 million, the most recent quarterly federal campaign finance records show.

The separate fundraising arms for both parties in the U.S. House have each reserved over $6 million in ads in the Portland media market, which includes parts of Oregon's 5th and Washington's 3rd districts."
"Figures and Dobson trade jabs in testy debate, Here are the key takeaways",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/alabama-2nd-congressional-district-candidates-debate-6f648731c3f287e40937f99b9c6a11c0,2024-10-10T23:42:50Z,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Congressional hopefuls Shomari Figures and Caroleene Dobson clashed in a contentious debate Thursday, exchanging verbal jabs over each other's background and sparring over abortion, immigration and the economy.

Figures, a Democrat, and Dobson, a Republican, are running to represent Alabama's 2nd Congressional District. The open seat has drawn a heated November contest after it was reshaped following a lengthy redistricting battle. The two exchanged jabs as they attempted to portray the other as out of touch with Alabama voters and questioned their opponent's ability to tackle the issues facing the district. The debate was sponsored by AARP Alabama and hosted by Al.com.

Here are some key takeaways from the debate.

Dobson repeatedly called Figures a ""Washington insider."" Figures served as deputy chief of staff and counselor to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland and also as an an aide in the Obama administration.

""My opponent argues that that he should be elected because he understands how Washington works. Well, the truth is, Washington hasn't been working for Alabama families,"" Dobson said.

Figures responded that he was born and raised in Alabama, but he has the experience to ""leverage Washington for the benefit of the people of this district.""

Figures in turn tried to portray Dobson, who is a real estate attorney for a large firm, as someone who is out of touch with the struggles of working families. He said Dobson ""was born wealthy, raised wealthy and married even more wealth.""

Both candidates accused the other of being the political status quo and said they represented an opportunity for change.

Dobson said Figures, who also served on the Biden-Harris transition team, wants to ""continue the policies of the last four years.""

""He was part of an administration that has hurt Alabama families,"" Dobson said.

Figures said the ""status quo here in the state of Alabama has been Republican leadership"" before noting the state lags the nation in rankings for education, income and life expectancy.

""As much as my opponent wants to just blame everything on the nearest Democrat she can find, the realities of it are the state of Alabama has been under Republican leadership at almost every single level for the last two decades,"" Figures said.

Both discussed the need for immigration reform but laid the blame on the opposing political party for a lack of progress.

Figures said some Republicans would rather run on the issue of immigration instead of addressing it. He said policy has to prioritize protecting the border but cannot be rooted in ""fearmongering."" He invoked the personal, telling the story of his wife's parents who immigrated from Haiti.

""They immigrated here from Haiti, and they didn't come to this country and eat dogs and cats,"" Figures said in reference to debunked claims, amplified by former President Donald Trump and others, that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating pets.

""What they came and ate was public service, Ivy League degrees, education and positive contributions to America,"" Figures said.

Dobson said Figures was part of an administration that has ""flung open our southern border.""

""There is no question that our border crisis -- and it is a national crisis -- is negatively impacting Alabama families,"" Dobson said.

Dobson said she would not have voted for a bipartisan Senate deal to tighten border security and boost the processing system for immigrants and asylum seekers because she had concerns it did not go far enough.

The debate continued to highlight their stark differences over legalized abortion. Thirteen states, including Alabama, ban abortion at any stage of pregnancy while another four ban abortion at about six weeks of pregnancy.

""I don't believe it's the government's role to tell a woman what she should and should not do with her own body,"" Figures said.

Dobson said she is ""pro-life,"" but she added the issue is best left for the states to address with ""compassion, common sense and consensus.""

""We don't need to federalize this issue,"" Dobson said.

Dobson said she supports exceptions in abortion bans for pregnancies arising from rape and incest and when needed to save the life of the pregnant woman. Alabama's abortion ban does not have exceptions for rape and incest.

Much like in the presidential debate, both candidates tried to address the fact that most Americans remain unhappy with the economy.

Dobson said ""reckless spending"" from the Biden administration was making the price of goods ""rise and rise."" Dobson also said that the Biden administration's energy policies -- and specifically his policy on oil drilling on federal lands -- have made prices higher for average consumers.

Figures said that economic ""struggle is not new for people"" in cities across the district and said that Republican elected officials at the state level in Alabama were to blame.

Figures also defended the Biden administration's economic record, and blamed ""supply chain shortages, worker shortages and job losses"" coming out of the COVID pandemic. He said that recent jobs report and the stock market indicate that the Biden administration's policies are working.

Both candidates spoke of the need to address the closure of rural hospitals. But they differed on the importance of Medicaid expansion.

Alabama is one of 10 states that did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Figures urged Alabama to expand its Medicaid program to cover more low-income people. He said he would support legislation that would renew financial incentives to holdout states to expand their programs.

Dobson said she would encourage state officials to ""examine"" the issue of Medicaid expansion but said that is an issue of state funding. She said creating more ""economic opportunities in these communities"" is needed."
North Dakota's abortion ban will remain on hold during court appeal,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/north-dakota-abortion-4e4edcc24dc4fab55e9d6044ff7bb107,2024-10-10T20:50:06Z,"BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- North Dakota won't be allowed to enforce its near total abortion ban while the state appeals a judge's ruling that struck down the law.

The latest decision by District Judge Bruce Romanick means that, for now, his September ruling stands while the state appeals it to the North Dakota Supreme Court.

No abortion clinics have operated in North Dakota since the Red River Women's Clinic moved from Fargo to nearby Moorhead, Minnesota, in 2022. The move came after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, triggering a North Dakota law that would have automatically banned most abortions. The statute was about to take effect when the clinic sued to stop it.

""The Court has found the law unconstitutional under the state constitution,"" Romanick said. ""It would be non-sensical for this Court to keep a law it has found to be unconstitutional in effect pending appeal.""

Last month, the judge found North Dakota's abortion ban unconstitutionally vague, and ruled that pregnant women in the state have a fundamental right to abortion before a fetus is viable outside the womb.

The state plans to appeal that September ruling.

A text message was sent to North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley Thursday seeking comment about whether the state would also appeal Romanick's most recent decision.

The judge heard arguments Thursday morning from attorneys representing the state and the abortion rights plaintiffs, including the women's clinic and several physicians.

In court, Special Assistant Attorney General Dan Gaustad said the September ruling raises questions and creates confusion about what it means for dozens of state's attorneys not named in the lawsuit and for other district court judges.

""Let's let the North Dakota Supreme Court decide this issue and let the law remain in place like it has been,"" Gaustad said.

Melissa Rutman, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said the state hadn't met the requirements to stay the ruling that struck down the abortion ban.

""The court already concluded that there is confusion if the law is in effect because as a matter of law, the law is too vague on its face to afford doctors due process rights, and physicians are forced to guess whether their medical decisions will subject them to criminal liability,"" she said.

The judge also said his previous order and judgment ""are not confusing.""

North Dakota's abortion ban made performing the procedure a felony. The only exceptions were to prevent the mother's death or a ""serious health risk"" to her. In cases of rape or incest, a patient could secure an abortion up to six weeks of gestation, which is before some people realize they are pregnant."
Maryland candidates debate abortion rights in widely watched US Senate race,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/us-senate-maryland-debate-hogan-alsobrooks-14175c732963790723287786f7757bed,2024-10-10T18:13:26Z,"OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) -- Democrat Angela Alsobrooks highlighted former Gov. Larry Hogan's actions in office as evidence he isn't as supportive of abortion rights as he now claims to be, while Hogan challenged the criticism during a debate in a widely watched Senate race in Maryland.

Alsobrooks, in the hourlong debate on Maryland Public Television, criticized Hogan's veto of a bill in 2022 to expand abortion rights by ending a restriction that only physicians can provide abortions in the state. The Legislature overrode the veto, and the law enables nurse practitioners, nurse midwives and physician assistants to provide care.

""The Republican Party has declared war on women's reproductive freedoms,"" Alsobrooks said. ""We recognize that this party of chaos and division that is led by (former President) Donald Trump is one that cannot lead our country and also has severe consequences for Marylanders.""

Hogan emphasized that he supports abortion rights, and said Alsobrooks' criticism of him didn't reflect his position. He said he would cosponsor legislation to codify Roe v. Wade, which was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2022. The former governor said his veto was due to concern about allowing health care providers who aren't doctors perform abortions.

""It was allowing non-medical professionals, and for you to lie about something as important as this issue, it really is insulting,"" Hogan said.

The former governor also said he would be an independent voice who will stand up to partisanship in the Senate and do what he believes is best for the nation.

""You're going to hear nothing but red vs. blue,"" Hogan said. ""I care more -- a lot more -- about the red, white and blue.""

The race is getting national attention because it is unusually competitive this year in a deeply blue state where its outcome could determine whether Democrats or Republicans get control of the Senate.

Democrats currently hold a 51-49 Senate advantage, including independent senators who caucus with Democrats. And Democrats have to defend 23 seats out of the 33 Senate seats on the ballot around the country this November.

If elected, Alsobrooks would be Maryland's first Black U.S. senator.

While a Republican has not won a Senate race in Maryland in more than 40 years, Hogan has wide name recognition. In the last two U.S. Senate races in Maryland, the Democratic candidate won by more than 30 percentage points against candidates who were not well-known. But Hogan, who once considered running for president and has often appeared on national news programs, is the most formidable Republican candidate in years.

In a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by 2-1, the popular two-term former governor won over enough Democratic voters to win two statewide races in 2014 and 2018.

Still, Hogan has a difficult needle to thread. This election was the first time Hogan is running on the same ballot as Trump, who is deeply unpopular in Maryland. Hogan has been one of the GOP's fiercest Trump critics, which has helped him win support from some Democrats, but also risked turning off some Republican voters.

After the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in 2022, abortion rights have become a major campaign issue around the country. Maryland voters will be deciding whether to pass a constitutional amendment in November to enshrine the right to abortion in the state's constitution. Maryland is one of nine states where abortion rights on the ballot this year.

Since 2018, Alsobrooks has served as the county executive of Prince George's County, Maryland's second most populous jurisdiction in the suburbs of the nation's capital. Before that, she served as the county's top prosecutor since 2011."
"En EEUU, no todos los Estados votan igual. √âstas son algunas de las diferencias",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/politics/general-news-6915bd1045a1300365a9d3d280417dfe,2024-10-10T17:17:44Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Las elecciones generales estadounidenses del 5 de noviembre decidir√°n el rumbo de la naci√≥n, pero distan mucho de ser una contienda administrada a escala nacional. Los 50 estados y el Distrito de Columbia administran sus propias elecciones, y cada uno hace las cosas de manera un poco diferente.

A continuaci√≥n presentamos algunas diferencias notables en las elecciones de 2024:

Para ganar la presidencia, un candidato debe recibir al menos 270 de los 538 votos del Colegio Electoral. En 48 estados, el ganador del estado obtiene todos los votos colegiados de ese estado, y lo mismo ocurre en la capital del pa√≠s.

En Maine y Nebraska, el candidato que obtiene m√°s votos en cada distrito congresional gana un voto colegiado de ese distrito. El candidato que gana la votaci√≥n en todo el estado recibe otros dos.

En 2020, el dem√≥crata Joe Biden recibi√≥ tres de los cuatro votos colegiados de Maine porque gan√≥ el voto popular en el estado -- la cifra absoluta de sufragios estatales -- y en su 1er distrito del Congreso. El republicano Donald Trump recibi√≥ un voto colegiado del 2¬∫ distrito del Congreso. Trump obtuvo cuatro de los cinco votos de Nebraska por haber ganado el voto popular en el estado, as√≠ como en su 1er y 3er distrito del Congreso; Biden recibi√≥ un voto colegiado por haber ganado el 2¬∫ distrito del Congreso.

En la votaci√≥n por orden de preferencia, los votantes clasifican a los candidatos por orden de preferencia en la papeleta. Si ning√∫n candidato es la primera opci√≥n para m√°s del 50% de los votantes, el candidato con menos votos es eliminado. Los votantes que eligieron a ese candidato como primera opci√≥n redistribuyen sus votos a su siguiente opci√≥n. As√≠ se contin√∫a, eliminando al candidato con menos votos, hasta que surge alguien con la mayor√≠a de votos.

Maine utiliza el voto por orden de preferencia en las primarias estatales y para los cargos federales en las elecciones generales. Esto significa que los votantes de Maine pueden clasificar a los candidatos presidenciales, al Senado y a la C√°mara de Representantes en papeletas que incluyen al dem√≥crata y al republicano que superaron las primarias de sus respectivos partidos, adem√°s de los candidatos de terceros partidos e independientes que cumplan los requisitos.

La papeleta presidencial incluir√° a Trump y a la dem√≥crata Kamala Harris, adem√°s de otros tres candidatos. En los seis a√±os transcurridos desde la implantaci√≥n de la votaci√≥n por orden de preferencia, el estado la ha utilizado dos veces en las elecciones al Congreso en su 2¬∫ distrito legislativo. La contienda presidencial de 2020 no pas√≥ a la votaci√≥n por orden de preferencia, ya que los ganadores del estado y de cada distrito legislativo superaron el 52% de los votos.

Alaska celebra primarias abiertas para los cargos estatales y env√≠a a los cuatro candidatos m√°s votados, independientemente del partido, a las elecciones generales, en las que el ganador se decide mediante votaci√≥n por orden de preferencia. En todos los cargos legislativos y ejecutivos estatales, los ciudadanos de Alaska pueden elegir hasta cuatro nombres, entre los que pueden figurar varios candidatos del mismo partido.

En Alaska, la excepci√≥n es la presidencia, en la que por primera vez se puede votar por orden de preferencia. Este a√±o, habr√° ocho candidaturas presidenciales en la papeleta, y los ciudadanos de este estado pueden clasificar a todos los candidatos si as√≠ lo desean. La √∫ltima vez que el ganador de la contienda presidencial en Alaska no super√≥ el 50% de los votos fue en 1992, cuando el candidato de un tercer partido, Ross Perot, obtuvo casi el 20% del voto popular nacional.

Pero en 2022, tanto la representante dem√≥crata Mary Peltola como la senadora republicana Lisa Murkowski ganaron sus elecciones despu√©s de que ambas optaran por el voto por orden de preferencia.

¬øOtro escollo presente este a√±o? En Alaska, donde la votaci√≥n por orden de preferencia se implement√≥ mediante una medida electoral en 2020, hay una iniciativa de los electores en la votaci√≥n de este oto√±o para derogarla.

California y Washington celebran primarias abiertas en las que todos los candidatos se presentan en la misma papeleta y los dos m√°s votados pasan a las elecciones generales, independientemente del partido. Este a√±o, hay dos elecciones a la C√°mara de Representantes en Washington que incluyen candidatos del mismo partido, una con dos republicanos y otra con dos dem√≥cratas. En California hay cuatro: tres con s√≥lo dem√≥cratas y una con s√≥lo republicanos.

El partido ganador en esos seis distritos se reflejar√° en el gr√°fico en l√≠nea de The Associated Press que muestra el equilibrio de poder en la C√°mara de Representantes al cierre de las urnas, y no una vez que se haya declarado un ganador, porque el partido del ganador es una conclusi√≥n inevitable.

Luisiana celebra lo que denomina ""primarias abiertas"" el mismo d√≠a que el resto del pa√≠s celebra sus elecciones generales. En Luisiana, todos los candidatos se presentan en la misma papeleta de las primarias abiertas. Cualquier candidato que obtenga m√°s del 50% de los votos en las primarias gana directamente el cargo.

Si ning√∫n candidato supera el 50% de los votos, los dos m√°s votados pasan a una segunda vuelta, que puede acabar enfrentando a dos republicanos o dos dem√≥cratas. Luisiana denomina a estas contiendas ""elecciones generales"".

Esto cambiar√° en las elecciones a la C√°mara de Representantes de Estados Unidos a partir de 2026, cuando las primarias para las elecciones al Congreso se celebren antes y est√©n abiertas s√≥lo a los miembros inscritos de un partido. Algunos estados seguir√°n celebrando primarias abiertas en noviembre, pero el cambio evitar√° que los futuros miembros del Congreso tengan que esperar hasta diciembre -un mes m√°s tarde que el resto del pa√≠s- para saber si van a Washington.

En Nebraska, cualquier medida que reciba aproximadamente 123.000 firmas v√°lidas puede presentarse a las elecciones. Este a√±o, dos medidas relacionadas con el aborto alcanzaron este umbral.

Una consagrar√≠a en la Constituci√≥n de Nebraska el derecho a abortar hasta la viabilidad fetal o despu√©s, para proteger la salud de la mujer embarazada. La otra incluir√≠a en la Constituci√≥n la actual prohibici√≥n del aborto despu√©s de 12 semanas de embarazo, con excepciones en caso de violaci√≥n, incesto o para salvar la vida de la mujer embarazada.

Es la primera vez, desde la decisi√≥n de la Corte Suprema de 2022 que anul√≥ el fallo del caso Roe vs. Wade, que un estado tiene en la boleta electoral medidas que buscan hacer retroceder el derecho al aborto y protegerlo al mismo tiempo.

Es posible que los votantes acaben aprobando ambas medidas. Pero dado que compiten entre s√≠ y, por tanto, no pueden consagrarse ambas en la Constituci√≥n, la medida con m√°s votos a favor ser√° la que se apruebe, seg√∫n el secretario de gobierno de Nebraska.

En las elecciones primarias, un pu√±ado de estados, la mayor√≠a del sur, celebran segundas vueltas si ning√∫n candidato obtiene al menos el 50% de los votos. En las elecciones con m√°s de dos candidatos, las segundas vueltas son habituales. Este a√±o se han celebrado elecciones primarias en varios estados.

Georgia utiliza las mismas reglas en las elecciones generales. Las tres √∫ltimas elecciones al Senado se celebraron porque un candidato de un tercer partido obtuvo suficientes votos para impedir que el candidato republicano o dem√≥crata superara el 50% de los sufragios.

Pero este a√±o, las posibilidades de segunda vuelta pueden limitarse a las elecciones de menor importancia, como las legislativas estatales. Este a√±o en Georgia no se celebra ninguna elecci√≥n al Senado, y en las elecciones a la C√°mara de Representantes s√≥lo hay dos candidatos en liza.

Esto es habitual en los estados que abarcan varias zonas horarias. En la mayor√≠a de los estados, las urnas cierran a la misma hora en cada zona horaria.

AP no anunciar√° el ganador de una contienda antes de que se cierren todas las urnas de una jurisdicci√≥n, incluso si los votos ya anunciados antes de esa hora dejan claro qui√©n ganar√° la contienda. Por lo tanto, si hay una contienda estatal en un estado donde las urnas cierran a las 8 p.m. hora local, pero parte del estado est√° en la zona horaria del Este y parte del estado est√° en la zona horaria del Centro, lo m√°s temprano que AP puede dar al ganador es a las 8 p.m. CST/9 p.m. EST.

La AP seguir√° mostrando los resultados a medida que lleguen de los condados con encuestas cerradas.

Algunos de los estados m√°s grandes con horarios de cierre de urnas diferenciados son Florida, Michigan, Texas y Oregon. Tennessee es una excepci√≥n, ya que aunque el estado se encuentra tanto en la zona horaria del este como en la del centro, todos los condados coordinan sus votaciones para que concluyan a la misma hora.

Former MLB star Garvey makes play for Latino votes in longshot bid for California US Senate seat,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/california-senate-feinstein-adam-schiff-steve-garvey-d70c70586162df1f3e1b7a683e9d0c98,2024-10-10T03:47:20Z,"LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Republican former baseball star Steve Garvey is making a late-hour push for Latino support in his longshot U.S. Senate campaign against Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff for the California seat long held by the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein.

The low-key contest has been largely overlooked nationally in a year when control of the Senate will turn on a handful of competitive races, including in Ohio, Michigan and Nevada. Republicans are outnumbered by Democrats in California by a staggering margin - nearly 2-to-1 statewide - and a GOP candidate hasn't won a Senate race in the state since 1988.

Voting is already underway -- mail-in ballots went out to each of the state's 22 million voters no later than Oct. 7.

Schiff, 64, has recently displayed outward confidence, traveling to Pennsylvania and Ohio to campaign on behalf of other Democratic Senate candidates. With California considered a secure seat for Democrats, he has plans to campaign for Democratic candidates in battleground states in the next month and also has raised money for national Democrats.

If the race has lacked drama, it nonetheless represents a turning point in California politics, which was long dominated by Feinstein, former U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer, former Gov. Jerry Brown and a handful of other veteran Democratic politicians. The matchup also means that California won't have a woman in the Senate for the first time in more than three decades.

Garvey announced last week he planned to spend $5 million on advertising in the run-up to Election Day aimed at the Latino community, including a TV spot in Spanish, the campaign's first statewide ad. It hits on familiar themes for Garvey, including inflation and gas prices, crime and the state's notoriously high taxes.

It's not clear how much good it will do to change the trajectory of a lopsided race in which Schiff has held an edge in polling and campaign finances. The last time a Republican candidate won a statewide race in California was in 2006, nearly two decades ago, underscoring the Democratic advantage.

The race has loosely followed the contours of the national fight for Congress.

Schiff has warned of GOP threats to abortion rights, after the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 stripped away women's constitutional protections for abortion, and the potential return of former President Donald Trump to the White House. Schiff, a longtime Trump foil, calls the former president a threat to democracy.

Garvey, who played for the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres and was National League MVP in 1974, has hammered Schiff and Democratic leadership for soaring grocery and housing prices, a long-running homeless crisis and other qualify of life concerns in a state that has seen its once-booming population drop in recent years.

Trump figured prominently at a prickly and probably little-watched debate this week, in which Schiff depicted Garvey as a Trump acolyte cloaked in a baseball uniform, while Garvey suggested Schiff was obsessed with Washington partisan politics while ignoring pressing California problems back home.

One Schiff ad recalls the Jan. 6, 2021 mob attack on the U.S. Capitol and the Trump impeachment. ""When our democracy was in danger, he stood up,"" a narrator says.

Claremont McKenna College political scientist Jack Pitney said Democrats are likely to benefit from an elevated turnout in a presidential election year, with Vice President Kamala Harris, a former California U.S. senator and attorney general, leading the party's ticket. He noted that state Republicans have struggled for years to enlist viable candidates for marquee offices -- voters could choose from only two Democrats for U.S. Senate in the 2016 and 2018 general elections. Garvey, while known to an older generation of baseball fans, would probably be a cypher to many younger voters.

Given California's political tilt, Garvey's chances of pulling off a surprise on Election Day ""are about equal to my chances of becoming Pope,"" Pitney said."
Whether to publicly say Trump's name becomes issue in Connecticut congressional debate,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/connecticut-house-hayes-logan-072869a6d179939b3bbbd08d23116a74,2024-10-10T02:06:58Z,"WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's name was mentioned multiple times during a debate held Wednesday night in Connecticut's closely watched 5th Congressional District race.

But it was only the Democrat, U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, who uttered it.

Her Republican opponent, former state Sen. George Logan, who has tried to portray himself as a moderate, independent candidate in this rematch election from 2022, would only say he supported the top of the GOP ticket and was focused more on helping the residents of what is considered the most politically diverse district in blue Connecticut.

""I've said over and over again, I'm going to work with whomever is going to win the White House after Nov. 5th, and I stand by that,"" he told reporters after the televised matchup. ""They're playing games, I think. They want to do this whole gotcha political thing, and I'm just not giving it to them. I made it clear who I'm voting for.""

But Hayes accused Logan, who she defeated by 2,000 votes two years ago, of trying to thread the needle in a purple district and not tell voters how he really feels on issues.

""I think the non-answer says more than the answer,"" Hayes said during the debate.

""When he's in a room with MAGA supporters, he tells them to turn off your phones. This is who I'm going to vote for. I support Donald Trump. When he's in a more moderate part of the district or a Democratic part of the district, he refuses to say it,"" she told reporters afterward. ""So, I guess the Logan that you get is dependent on the room that he's in.""

If Logan wins, he would be the first Republican member of Connecticut's current all-Democratic congressional delegation since former GOP Rep. Chris Shays, a moderate Republican who lost the state's 4th Congressional District seat in 2008 to Democratic Rep. Jim Himes, who is now running for a ninth term.

The 5th District race is considered the most competitive of the state's five congressional contests.

Hayes, a former national teacher of the year, first assumed office in 2019.

During the debate, she touted her efforts to help everyone from farmers to people struggling to find affordable housing and noted her votes to increase the minimum wage and lower prescription drug prices.

While she acknowledged that pocketbook issues are still important to voters in this year's election, Hayes noted the nation's low unemployment rate and how the U.S. has rebounded from the pandemic better than other countries.

Logan blamed Hayes for not doing enough to help people struggling to pay for groceries, gas and rent, and he repeatedly accused Hayes of being a rubber stamp for the White House.

He said she votes with the national Democrats nearly all the time -- a claim she later denied -- while he promised to support legislation that is best for the district, no matter which party proposed it.

""My opponent cannot fathom an independent voice in Washington,"" Logan said.

This year's race for the 5th District, which includes a large swath of northwestern Connecticut, is reminiscent of 2022, when Logan repeatedly linked Hayes with President Joe Biden and then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and accused her for being tone deaf about the impact of inflation on voters.

The race attracted millions of dollars in outside money, with national Republicans seeing an opportunity to crack Democrats' lock on the state's congressional delegation.

This year, both campaign committees for the national parties have focused on the race once again, running ads on statewide television.

Like in 2022, Hayes has accused Logan as someone who can't be trusted when it comes to abortion, despite Logan's claims that he supports abortion rights.

The war in the Gaza Strip, however, was not an issue two years ago. During Wednesday's debate, which was televised live on statewide TV, a pro-Palestinian protester suddenly bound on stage midway through and shouted ""Free Palestine"" before being taken away by security."
C√≥mo funciona AP VoteCast y en qu√© se diferencia de una encuesta a boca de urna,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/us-news/general-news-7f32b1298d0dbc442dd5430850411b0c,2024-10-09T22:18:07Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cuando se trata de entender las elecciones, no se trata s√≥lo de qui√©n gan√≥ y qui√©n perdi√≥. Para explicar lo que realmente ocurri√≥, es importante entender qui√©n vot√≥ y c√≥mo, qu√© les importaba y c√≥mo se sent√≠an respecto a los temas importantes a los que se enfrenta el pa√≠s.

En The Associated Press, AP VoteCast es una herramienta clave para responder a esas preguntas, ya que explica las coaliciones de votantes que eligieron al presidente, determinaron el control del Congreso y decidieron las iniciativas electorales a nivel estatal.

Lanzada en 2018, AP VoteCast es una amplia encuesta de votantes y no votantes que pretende contar la historia detr√°s de los resultados electorales. Realizada para AP y Fox News por el AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, es una instant√°nea detallada del electorado estadounidense que ayuda a explicar qui√©n vot√≥, qui√©n no vot√≥, qu√© temas les preocupan, qu√© opinan de los candidatos y por qu√© votaron como lo hicieron, o por qu√© no votaron.

Aunque tiene un prop√≥sito similar, AP VoteCast no es una encuesta a boca de urna.

Las encuestas a boca de urna tradicionales, incluida la que lleva a cabo un consorcio de cadenas de noticias en Estados Unidos, se basan en gran medida en entrevistas en persona con los votantes realizadas fuera de centros de votaci√≥n seleccionados despu√©s de que hayan votado, complementadas con una encuesta telef√≥nica para llegar a los que votaron por correo. Antes de AP VoteCast, la AP trabajaba con otras importantes organizaciones de noticias para realizar encuestas a boca de urna el d√≠a de las elecciones.

AP VoteCast se cre√≥ en parte para reflejar los importantes cambios que se han producido a lo largo de los a√±os en la forma de votar de la gente, que ha pasado de un mundo en el que la mayor√≠a de la gente votaba present√°ndose en las urnas el d√≠a de las elecciones a otro en el que un n√∫mero cada vez mayor vota antes del d√≠a de las elecciones.

En 1972, por ejemplo, alrededor del 95% de los votantes del pa√≠s votaron en persona el d√≠a de las elecciones. Desde entonces, el n√∫mero de los que votan antes del d√≠a de las elecciones ha crecido constantemente, especialmente en las √∫ltimas elecciones. En 2018, aproximadamente 4 de cada 10 votantes emitieron su voto antes de las elecciones generales de noviembre. En 2020, durante la pandemia de coronavirus, la cifra se dispar√≥ a aproximadamente 7 de cada 10. En las elecciones de mitad de mandato de 2022, cerca de la mitad de los votantes emitieron su voto antes del d√≠a de las elecciones.

AP VoteCast capta las opiniones de los votantes -- tanto si votan en persona el d√≠a de las elecciones como con semanas de antelaci√≥n -- empezando a entrevistar a los votantes registrados varios d√≠as antes de la jornada electoral. Estas entrevistas concluyen al cierre de las urnas en cada estado. Las entrevistas se realizan en ingl√©s y espa√±ol, seg√∫n sea necesario.

Este enfoque permiti√≥ a AP VoteCast encuestar de forma fiable a m√°s de 130.000 votantes registrados en los 50 estados durante las elecciones presidenciales de 2020, y explicar exhaustivamente c√≥mo el dem√≥crata Joe Biden gan√≥ las elecciones presidenciales.

AP VoteCast utiliza una combinaci√≥n de m√©todos -- entrevistas por correo, por tel√©fono y en l√≠nea -- para conectarse con los votantes registrados y captar sus opiniones sobre los candidatos y las elecciones, independientemente de si votan en persona el d√≠a de las elecciones o de manera anticipada, o por correo.

El primer paso del proceso es encontrar personas que participen en la encuesta. Se contacta por correo con una muestra aleatoria de votantes registrados, extra√≠da de los archivos estatales, y se les invita a realizar la encuesta en l√≠nea o por tel√©fono. Algunos votantes tambi√©n son contactados por tel√©fono si no responden a la invitaci√≥n inicial a participar en la encuesta.

Adem√°s del grupo de votantes registrados elegibles que son seleccionados aleatoriamente, AP VoteCast recopila datos mediante entrevistas con votantes adicionales reclutados a trav√©s de paneles en l√≠nea ""opt-in"", en los que los participantes no se seleccionan al azar, sino que se reclutan a trav√©s de publicidad en internet. Esto ayuda a dar a AP VoteCast un alcance m√°s amplio y una profundidad adicional.

Para garantizar que estas entrevistas adicionales no representen en exceso o en defecto a grupos demogr√°ficos e ideol√≥gicos importantes, la composici√≥n del panel se calibra cuidadosamente para que coincida con la encuesta de muestra aleatoria en aspectos clave, adem√°s de coincidir con las caracter√≠sticas demogr√°ficas de todos los votantes registrados.

A los votantes se les hace un conjunto est√°ndar de preguntas demogr√°ficas, como su edad, sexo, raza y etnia, nivel educativo y tipo de barrio en el que viven. Se les pide que compartan sus opiniones sobre lo que buscan en un candidato, lo que piensan de los candidatos y cu√°les creen que son los temas clave a los que se enfrenta el pa√≠s, como el aborto, la delincuencia, la econom√≠a, el sistema de salud y la inmigraci√≥n.

Aunque se pregunta a los votantes por qui√©n van a votar, la AP no utiliza esta informaci√≥n para dar un resultado global de la contienda ni para sustituir los totales de votos. Pero los resultados de la encuesta s√≠ proporcionan informaci√≥n valiosa sobre c√≥mo votaron grupos espec√≠ficos. Por ejemplo, en las elecciones presidenciales de 2020, los resultados de AP VoteCast mostraron que los hombres blancos favorec√≠an al republicano Donald Trump, mientras que las mujeres con estudios universitarios favorec√≠an a Biden. Ese a√±o, los votantes que pensaban que la econom√≠a era el tema principal prefer√≠an a Trump, mientras que los que pensaban que el sector salud era el tema principal apoyaban a Biden.

En las primarias republicanas de 2024, las encuestas de AP VoteCast en Iowa, Nueva Hampshire y Carolina del Sur mostraron que, aunque Trump obtuvo victorias dominantes en los estados en los que se inici√≥ la campa√±a, tuvo dificultades para ampliar su apoyo m√°s all√° de los grupos que generalmente le han apoyado en el pasado. Harris no se convirti√≥ en la candidata dem√≥crata a trav√©s del proceso de primarias, por lo que su apoyo entre los votantes de las primarias del partido no fue captado en las encuestas de AP VoteCast.

Montana's attorney general faces a hearing on 41 counts of professional misconduct,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/montana-attorney-general-professional-misconduct-51f0b75080f7defa9eba4b3a7837c53d,2024-10-09T17:23:38Z,"HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- A succession of controversies marks Republican Austin Knudsen's nearly four years as Montana attorney general.

His office sided with a man who made an armed threat over a pandemic mask mandate and was accused of pressuring a Helena hospital over its refusal to administer a parasite drug to a COVID-19 patient. He tried to block three constitutional initiatives from the November ballot, recruited a token opponent for the June primary so he could raise more money, and got sued after forcing the head of the Montana Highway Patrol to resign.

Knudsen is facing a hearing Wednesday that could bring a reckoning in yet another dispute: allegations of professional misconduct over his aggressive defense of a law that allows Montana's Republican governor to directly fill judicial vacancies. That law was part of a nationwide GOP effort to forge a more conservative judiciary.

A judicial disciplinary office concluded in 2023 that Knudsen's office tried to evade the state Supreme Court's authority by rejecting the validity of court orders.

His hearing before a state judicial panel on 41 counts of professional misconduc t could last up to three days, officials said.

Knudsen, who could lose his law license, argues he and his staff were ""zealously representing"" the Legislature in a separation-of-powers case. He also pressed allegations of judicial misconduct, saying the court was interfering in the Legislature's investigation of the conduct of the judiciary.

Chase Scheuer, Knudsen's spokesperson, said Tuesday that the case should have been dismissed months ago.

""The allegations are meritless and nothing more than an attack on him orchestrated by those who disagree with him politically,"" Scheuer said.

Republicans have long accused Montana judges of legislating from the bench when the courts find Republican-passed laws regulating abortion or gun rights to be unconstitutional.

The alleged misconduct by Knudsen occurred in 2021. At the time, Montana lawmakers were working on a bill to eliminate a commission that reviewed potential judges.

Lawmakers learned a Supreme Court administrator used state computers to survey judges about the legislation on behalf of the Montana Judges Association. After the court administrator said she had deleted emails related to the survey, the Legislature subpoenaed the Department of Administration, which includes the state's IT department, and received 5,000 of the administrator's emails by the next day.

The Montana Supreme Court later quashed the subpoena, but not until after some of the emails had been released to the news media.

Then-Chief Deputy Attorney General Kristin Hansen, now deceased, responded to the Supreme Court writing the ""legislature does not recognize this Court's order as binding"" and added that lawmakers wouldn't allow the court to interfere in its investigation of ""the serious and troubling conduct of members of the judiciary.""

The Legislature also moved for the Supreme Court justices to recuse themselves from hearing the case, arguing that justices had a conflict of interest because the subpoena involved the court administrator. The justices denied that motion and suggested that the Legislature had tried to create a conflict by sending each justice a subpoena for their emails.

In a May 2021 letter to the court, Knudsen said the justices' writings ""appear to be nothing more than thinly veiled threats and attacks on the professional integrity of attorneys in my office."" He added that ""lawyers also have affirmative obligations to report judicial misconduct.""

The complaint against Knudsen found the statements in his letter were contemptuous, undignified, discourteous and/or disrespectful and violated rules on practice. It also noted that complaints against the judiciary should be filed with the Montana Judicial Standards Commission.

Knudsen's office in late 2021 asked the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the case, claiming judicial self-dealing on a possibly unprecedented scale. The justices declined."
"Former Sen. Tim Johnson, the last Democrat to hold statewide office in South Dakota, dies at 77",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/tim-johnson-senator-south-dakota-obituary-09b5a6b825784f56b5388efe1b1a31f4,2024-10-09T15:01:13Z,"SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) -- Former Sen. Tim Johnson, a centrist who was the last Democrat to hold statewide office in South Dakota and who was adept at securing federal funding for projects back home during his three decades in Washington, has died. He was 77.

Johnson, who was first elected to Congress in 1986 and retired from the Senate in 2015, died Tuesday night of complications from a recent stroke, family friend Steve Hildebrand said in a news release. He was surrounded by family.

South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem ordered flags be flown at half-staff to honor Johnson.

Just a month after Democrats reclaimed the Senate by a one-vote margin in 2006, Johnson became disoriented during a media conference call and underwent emergency brain surgery. He'd suffered a life-threatening brain hemorrhage, sparking what many called an unseemly round of speculation in Washington about which party would control the next Senate.

But he returned to Washington nine months later, physically weaker yet mentally sharp. He later joked by opening his first post-surgery media conference call with: ""As I was saying... .""

A fourth-generation South Dakotan, Johnson was known for his steady manner, his unpredictable votes and his ability to secure federal funding for his state, including money that helped pay for the University of South Dakota medical science complex.

Democrats never could take his votes for granted. Johnson bucked his party with votes for bans on abortions later in pregnancies and flag desecration. He also voted to confirm U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, who was nominated by Republican President George W. Bush.

And in one of the defining votes of his career, Johnson voted in 2002 to authorize the use of force in Iraq, even though he had a deeply personal reason to vote no. His son, Brooks, was a 32-year-old staff sergeant with the Army's 101st Airborne Division and would be among the first sent to the region.

""I talked to Brooks prior to this vote and his response was, 'Dad, you do what is right for the country and I'll do what is right as a soldier,'"" Johnson recalled. ""I said on the (Senate) floor that it's very likely I would be sending my own son into combat.""

Brooks, who also served in Bosnia, Kosovo and South Korea, returned safely after serving in the Middle East.

The former senator wasn't one to seek fame, and joked about his reputation of being quiet and reserved.

""I know I get a rap as this sort of dour Scandinavian, but I think that we Scandinavians have a sense of humor, too,"" told The Associated Press in 2002. ""I enjoy life. I think there are a lot of things in life that are fun and we can joke about. It would be a sad life for anybody who can't laugh, and laugh at himself as well.""

In December 2006, Johnson suffered bleeding in his brain caused by a congenital malformation. His ailment raised the possibility that, were he to be incapacitated, South Dakota's Republican governor would appoint a Republican successor and return the Senate, then controlled by Democrats 51-49, to GOP control.

Johnson returned to his Senate office in September 2007, using a scooter and with his speaking slow and slurred. Cameras crowded around as he scooted through the door alongside South Dakota Sen. John Thune, a Republican, and Rep. Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, a Democrat. Staffers cheered as he entered the office. He said he felt, ""good.""

He continued to recover and went on to win reelection. But in 2013, as South Dakota turned sharply Republican, he announced he planned to retire.

At the time, he said it had become harder and harder over his 28 years in the House and Senate to strike bipartisan compromise, as winning elections came to overshadow everything else.

""We have lost our way,"" Johnson lamented in his parting speech on Dec. 11, 2014.

Born in Canton, South Dakota, Johnson earned a bachelor's degree from the University of South Dakota, where he also met his wife, Barbara Brooks of Sioux Falls. Johnson went on to earn a master's degree in public administration and a law degree from the university.

Johnson started a law practice in Vermillion in 1975, and ran for statewide office in 1978. He served for four years in the South Dakota House and another four years in the state Senate before setting his sights on Washington.

He was elected to South Dakota's lone U.S. House seat in 1986, and served five terms before moving to the U.S. Senate in 1996.

Johnson was reelected to the Senate in 2002, narrowly defeating then-Rep. John Thune. During the 2006 term, he served on the Senate's Appropriations Committee, Budget Committee, Banking Committee, Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee.

Aside from the national notoriety he got for his razor-thin reelection win, political observers said the South Dakota senator didn't go for show.

Ted Muenster, president of the University of South Dakota Foundation, described Johnson as pragmatic and a centrist.

""He's always been a voice of calm reason in discussing public issues,"" Muenster, a fellow Democrat from Vermillion, said at the time.

Johnson brought home millions of dollars for such water projects as Lewis & Clark, Mni Wiconi and Mid-Dakota -- and assisted his alma mater. When the University of South Dakota's medical science complex was being built, Muenster said the construction was being done ""with a good amount of federal funds in it which are directly attributable to (Johnson's) efforts in Congress.""

The Johnsons had two sons and a daughter: Brooks, Brendan, a Sioux Falls lawyer, and Kelsey, who works in public service in Washington.

Johnson and his wife fought cancer. The former senator underwent treatment for prostate cancer in 2004, and Barb Johnson survived breast cancer."
Ruben Gallego and Kari Lake to face off in debate for Arizona Senate,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/arizona-senate-debate-ruben-gallego-kari-lake-047fb4bd183c54b28d34ec9644731d4b,2024-10-09T13:06:59Z,"PHOENIX (AP) -- Ruben Gallego and Kari Lake meet Wednesday for the only debate of the Arizona Senate race, a matchup that comes as voters begin casting ballots in a contest that will help determine control of the U.S. Senate.

Lake, a well-known former television news anchor and a darling of the populist right, has tried but struggled to redefine herself since losing the 2022 race for governor.

Gallego, a Democratic congressman representing largely Latino areas of Phoenix, has used his financial advantage over Lake to run ads playing up his military service and up-by-the-bootstraps personal story rather than his progressive record in Congress.

The debate, which will air live on most television stations across the state at 9 p.m. EDT, presents Lake with a chance to reset a race where polls and observers suggest she's modestly trailing. For Gallego, it's an opportunity to introduce himself to voters who still don't know him.

Both candidates are working to win over a small share of Republicans and conservative independents who are open to splitting their vote between the parties. This group has been instrumental in the rise of Democrats in Arizona, which has transitioned from a Republican stronghold to a battleground state over the past decade.

They've fought to focus voters on the territory most favorable to them.

For Gallego, that's abortion rights after a state Supreme Court ruling outlawed virtually all abortions until the Legislature rolled it back to 15 weeks. Lake has spoken favorably of stricter limits.

Lake prefers to talk about the U.S.-Mexico border. She paints a dire picture of drug and human trafficking, and she links Gallego to record border crossings and scenes of disorder during President Joe Biden's administration. She highlights his prior comments critical of a border wall.

Lake is an unflinching supporter of former President Donald Trump and his lie that he lost the 2020 election because of fraud. She has never conceded she lost her own 2022 race for governor, and continued to fight the outcome in court even after launching her Senate campaign. Separately, she's tried and failed to convince courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year, to outlaw the use of electronic voting machines.

She's also highlighted Ruben Gallego's 2016 divorce from Kate Gallego, who is now the mayor of Phoenix. Noting the marriage ended weeks before the couple's son was born, Lake says Gallego abandoned his wife while she was pregnant. Kate Gallego has endorsed her ex-husband and campaigned with him as recently as last week.

Gallego is a military veteran who has served in Congress for a decade.

The son of immigrants from Mexico and Colombia, he was raised in Chicago by a single mother and eventually accepted to Harvard University. He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve while he was on a break from Harvard. He fought in Iraq in 2005 in a unit that sustained heavy casualties, including the death of his best friend."
What presidential campaign? The Electoral College puts most American voters on the sidelines,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/electoral-college-2024-wisconsin-illinois-trump-harris-cdb4141205034c830924cb94457b7be1,2024-10-09T04:15:31Z,"WAUKEGAN, Ill. (AP) -- On a table at the office of the Waukegan Township Democrats sits a box of postcards with Wisconsin addresses that were collected during a postcard-writing pizza party to help turn out voters there. Leaning against the table are homemade Harris-Walz signs.

""We know they're handing these out everywhere in Wisconsin,"" said Matt Muchowski, chair of the Democratic club. ""Here in Waukegan, it's been harder to get a hold of Harris yard signs, so we're printing out our own.""

One reason they've been in short supply: Waukegan is in Illinois, which is not a presidential swing state. It just sits across the border from one.

Muchowski said this is emblematic of the limited attention cities outside of swing states receive from presidential campaigns. The United States' unique Electoral College system, which replaces the popular vote, puts disproportionate voting power in the hands of a relative few states that are evenly divided politically and ensures that the majority of campaign dollars -- and attention from the presidential candidates -- goes to those states.

The lack of attention leaves voters in much of the country feeling as if they and the issues they care about have been sidelined. It's a dividing line that is felt acutely in places such as Waukegan, one of Chicago's farthest-flung suburbs.

The last time a presidential candidate set foot in the working class, majority Latino city was when former President Donald Trump landed at its airport in 2020. Trump walked off Air Force One, gave a single wave, and then immediately climbed into an SUV headed across the border to Kenosha, Wisconsin.

In Racine, a Wisconsin city of a similar size just 50 miles north of Waukegan, Trump hosted a rally in June near a harbor overlooking Lake Michigan, where he gushed about the development along the lakeshore, spoke about revitalization efforts in Racine and the Milwaukee metropolitan area, and emphasized their voters' importance in his attempt to return to the White House.

Just a month earlier, before he dropped out of the race, President Joe Biden lauded a new Microsoft center in Racine County during a campaign stop in the city. The city just south of Milwaukee has become a common stomping ground for presidential hopefuls as Wisconsin, one of just seven battleground states likely to determine this year's presidential race, remains heavily targeted by the campaigns of Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

Cities such as Waukegan become ""lost in the national conversation"" during presidential elections, said Muchowski, who has lived in the area most of his life.

""It's not so much the candidates as it is the anti-democratic Electoral College,"" he said. ""... It's frustrating that certain voters' votes count for more, and they discount and discredit the votes of more urban, more people of color voters.""

Illinois is a reliably Democratic state -- it hasn't voted for a Republican presidential candidate since George H.W. Bush in 1988. That predictability is reflected in the presidential campaigns every four years.

Except for fundraisers, the Republican and Democratic presidential tickets have been to Illinois just twice this year -- once for an appearance by Trump before a group representing Black journalists and once by Harris when she came to Chicago for her party's national convention. By comparison, they had visited Wisconsin 27 times through Tuesday, including when Biden was the presumptive nominee.

This year's presidential battleground states -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- represent 18% of the country's population but have dominated the attention of the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates and their running mates.

Through Tuesday, they have had just over 200 total campaign stops -- three-quarters of which have been to those seven states, according to a database of campaign events that is based on Associated Press reporting. Pennsylvania alone has been visited 41 times, the most of any state.

But it's not just the state visits: The presidential campaigns are tailoring their appearances to specific counties they believe are crucial to their success. The AP's database shows their campaign events in the seven battleground states have been concentrated in counties with 22.7 million registered voters -- just 10% of all voters registered nationally for this year's presidential election.

Many residents of Waukegan wish it also could get on the candidates' radar. They said they're proud of how multiculturalism has shaped their city, a place where almost 60% of residents are Latino and more than 16% are Black, according to 2020 U.S. Census data.

The working class community was largely built on factory jobs that once offered residents a comfortable, middle class life. But after companies abandoned the city's lakefront, starting in the 1960s, tens of thousands of jobs disappeared.

Waukegan never fully recovered.

Its poverty and unemployment rates rise well above the state and national averages. Its school district is one of the worst-funded in the county, struggles with understaffing and has dismal graduation rates. And its lakeshore is a sagging reminder of the city's heyday: An asbestos manufacturing plant, a coal plant and a gypsum factory all sit silent beside public beaches. Beside them are a crisscrossed network of abandoned railroad tracks.

The industries brought with them another problem -- a legacy of environmental damage. The city of around 86,000 residents has five federal Superfund sites. In 2019, the state's pollution control board ruled that Waukegan's coal plant violated environmental regulations and contaminated groundwater, and it was shuttered three years later.

The scene in Waukegan contrasts with Racine's pristine lakefront marina, where luxury condos flank coffee shops, restaurants and hotels.

Thomas Maillard, the Democratic State Central Committeeman for Illinois' 10th Congressional District and a lifelong Lake County resident, said the contrast between the two cities is clear. In Waukegan, he said he worries about gun violence and access to well-paying jobs, affordable housing, child care and health care.

""The history of Waukegan, unfortunately, is the history of this country's neglect of those Rust Belt communities, especially along the Great Lakes,"" he said. ""... People are struggling.""

Maillard pointed to the Electoral College system as a culprit, calling it ""a system of potential neglect.""

Sam Cunningham, a former mayor of Waukegan, said people feel forgotten in the city that he's called home since elementary school. It's clear, he said, that the national agenda prioritizes some states over others.

""They're probably thinking, 'Why should we put money over here when we need it in these battleground states?'"" he said. ""I understand the logic, but understand how we feel. Do we feel slighted? Of course we do. It doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.""

Margaret Padilla Carrasco, who has lived in the Waukegan area her entire life, drove to Milwaukee in August to see Harris speak. If Harris were to visit Waukegan, Carrasco said she would take her to the deteriorating houses on the south side of the city, to assisted living facilities where senior citizens are struggling to pay their bills and to a homeless shelter near her home.

Her message to Harris, she said, is to not count on their votes. Saddled with job losses and a rising cost of living, people in Waukegan are frustrated, she said. While she still plans to vote for Harris, Carrasco hears of more and more Waukegan voters pulling away from the Democratic Party, which has long won the lion's share of the city's votes.

""If you don't spend the time with us, then don't expect us to vote for you,"" said Carrasco, 65, who trains young Latinas in Waukegan to ride horses in traditional Mexican Charro style. ""You need to hear us. You need to talk to us.""

James Richard Wynn, a 35-year-old father of nine, said he feels doubly forgotten in Waukegan as a conservative in the predominantly Democratic city. He said he and the issues he cares most about -- homeschooling, abortion restrictions, Second Amendment rights and government spending -- often go ignored by presidential candidates.

""There is probably a mindset amongst a lot of conservatives, especially in Illinois, who think there's no point in saying anything,"" he said.

Despite limited political attention, several residents praised what they described as Waukegan's do-it-yourself spirit, which often translates into grassroots political organizing around issues such as housing and environmental justice.

On a sunny Tuesday recently, Pastor Julie Contreras, who helps support recent immigrants in the city, had a long to-do list. She was gathering community members to rebuild the roof for an undocumented couple whose house was damaged in a storm. Then she had to collect diaper donations for a woman who had just given birth.

This is the Waukegan most people don't see, said Contreras, an advocate with the local nonprofit United Giving Hope. She chastised candidates for just dropping in to the city's airport before they head to Wisconsin without engaging with the voters there about their struggles.

""They're missing out on a wonderful community right here,"" she said.

Muchowski, of the Waukegan Township Democrats, said when the city feels ignored, its residents take care of each other. It's something they've gotten used to, he said.

""Waukegan, for a lot of people, is a city of grit and imagination,"" Muchowski said. ""I don't know a lot of people who are like, 'I want to move across the country to Waukegan.' But the people that come here really see the potential.""

If only, he said, candidates would see the potential, too.

Democrats hope the latest court rulings restricting abortion energize voters as election nears,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-rulings-election-trump-harris-texas-georgia-b17211cd0fe92a6454878169b1730207,2024-10-08T21:13:59Z,"CHICAGO (AP) -- Two court rulings this week have delivered major blows to reproductive rights in Texas and Georgia but, during a crucial time in the election cycle, Democrats are seizing on them in an attempt to energize voters who support abortion access.

Advocates hope the rulings will serve as reminders about what's at stake in a post-Roe America just weeks before a presidential election that has been partly defined by competing visions of abortion rights and the sometimes harrowing consequences for women living in states with abortion bans.

""Every time our opponents say the policies we have in place are fine and not as extreme as you think, this continual drumbeat of headlines illustrates the reality and galvanizes voters,"" said Kelly Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project, which is providing money and other support for several ballot measure campaigns hoping to preserve or strengthen abortion rights.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday left in place a lower court decision that bans emergency abortions that violate Texas law. The same day, the Georgia Supreme Court halted a ruling that had struck down the state's near-total abortion ban.

Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, took the opportunity to remind voters of the threats her campaign says a second Trump presidency poses to reproductive rights and his role in overturning Roe v. Wade, which once granted a federal right to abortion. Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing the three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the constitutional right to abortion that had stood for 50 years.

""Because of extreme Trump Abortion Bans in states across the country, including Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia, women are facing horrific consequences to their health and lives -- even death,"" Harris posted on X. ""Let me be clear: Donald Trump is the architect of this health care crisis.""

Monday's rulings are just the latest court decisions around reproductive rights to ripple through this year's races for president and Congress. In February, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that embryos can be considered children, a decision that temporarily halted in vitro fertilization treatments and threw the lives of couples seeking fertility treatments into chaos.

In April, the Arizona Supreme Court upheld a near total abortion ban from 1864 -- when the state was only a U.S. territory. The Legislature repealed it months later, but not until after the issue had galvanized abortion rights supporters in a state that will help determine the presidency and control of the Senate.

Kristi Hamrick, spokesperson for the national anti-abortion group Students for Life Action, accused Democrats of ""latching onto anything and blaming losses on anyone but themselves in a desperate attempt to get votes."" She celebrated the two rulings Monday and expressed hopes the anti-abortion wins will instead energize voters against abortion.

""We're grateful for these wins and hopeful they may add some wind in our sails,"" she said.

In Texas, the state's abortion ban - one of the strictest in the country - is playing a role in the Senate race between the Republican incumbent, Sen. Ted Cuz, and Democratic U.S. Rep. Colin Allred. The weekend before Monday's ruling, Allred vowed to restore Roe v. Wade at a campaign event in Fort Worth.

Other Democrats in the statehouse, including Texas Rep. Donna Howard, also expressed outrage at the rulings. She accused the courts of ""willfully ignoring the dangerous reality many pregnant Texans are forced to endure if they experience severe pregnancy complications.""

In Georgia, one of the seven presidential battleground states, the state supreme court's ruling comes on the heels of outrage over the deaths of Georgia women Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, who died after being denied immediate care that was attributed to the state's restrictive laws.

Georgia voters are watching these stories about the impact of the state's abortion restrictions and ""they will bring that to the polls"" during the presidential election, said Jessica Arons, a director of policy and government affairs at the ACLU. But these headlines might also energize voters in contests up and down the ballot, including citizen-led ballot measures in nine states aiming to protect abortion rights, she said.

Support for legal abortion has risen since the Supreme Court eliminated protections two years ago, according to a July poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Around 6 in 10 Americans think their state should generally allow a person to obtain a legal abortion for any reason if they don't want to be pregnant. That represents an increase from June 2021, a year before the Supreme Court decision, when about half of Americans thought legal abortion should be possible under these circumstances.

Many experts and advocates have credited this shift to Americans' reactions to the abortion restrictions affecting a wide swath of the country since Roe was overturned. Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy while another four ban it after six weeks -- before many women know they're pregnant.

""It's hard to say how much voters are following each development, but it's clear abortion is still an incredibly salient issue, and these are reminders of why as we head closer to November,"" Arons said. ""As courts and politicians continue to play ping-pong with women's lives, ballot measures will be especially important.""

Only about half the states allow citizen-led ballot initiatives. Georgia and Texas, states where Republicans control the Legislature and governor's office, are not among them.

Lauren Brenzel, campaign director for a coalition aiming to enshrine abortion rights into the Florida Constitution, said the Georgia Supreme Court ruling only adds to a ""public health crisis in the Southeast.""

Florida is the only state in the Southeast that allows citizen-led ballot initiatives, Brenzel said. If Floridians vote in favor of abortion rights, the state may become a major access point for Georgians seeking abortions. The Florida amendment needs at least 60% support to pass.

""It raises the stakes for us here in Florida,"" Brenzel said.

After the Arizona Supreme Court revived the Civil War-era ban on nearly all abortions, a coalition organizing around a statewide ballot measure to protect abortion rights reported a surge in donations, volunteers and interest. Laura Dent, the coalition's political director, said it's evidence that voters are paying attention and taking action.

""Arizonans are seeing these headlines,"" she said. ""This and all the whiplash we've seen since the Dobbs decision really brought into focus for Arizona voters how we need to protect this right, and I think that will be reflected in November.""

Not all elections look the same. Here are some of the different ways states run their voting,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/ranked-choice-voting-nebraska-california-615e9fbdf7b086dce4227dff01c0df68,2024-10-08T19:44:46Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. general election on Nov. 5 will decide the country's direction, but it is far from a nationally administered contest. The 50 states and the District of Columbia run their own elections, and each does things a little differently.

Here's a look at some notable variations in the 2024 election:

To win the presidency outright, a candidate must receive at least 270 of the 538 votes in the Electoral College. In 48 states, the statewide winner gets all of that state's electoral votes, and that's also the case in the nation's capital.

In Maine and Nebraska, the candidate who receives the most votes in each congressional district wins one electoral vote from that district. The candidate who wins the statewide vote receives another two.

In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden received three of Maine's four electoral votes because he won the popular vote in the state and its 1st Congressional District. Republican Donald Trump received one electoral vote from the 2nd Congressional District. Trump won four of Nebraska's five votes for winning the popular vote in the state as well as its 1st and 3rd Congressional Districts; Biden received one electoral vote for winning the 2nd Congressional District.

In ranked choice voting, voters rank candidates for an office in order of preference on the ballot. If no candidate is the first choice for more than 50% of voters, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. Voters who chose that candidate as their top pick have their votes redistributed to their next choice. This continues, with the candidate with the fewest votes getting eliminated, until someone emerges with a majority of votes.

Maine uses ranked choice voting in state-level primaries and for federal offices in the general election. That means Maine voters can rank presidential, Senate and House candidates on ballots that include the Democrat and the Republican who advanced out of their respective party primaries, plus third-party and independent candidates who qualify.

The presidential ballot will include Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris, plus three other candidates. In the six years since implementing ranked choice voting, the state has used it twice in races for Congress in its 2nd Congressional District. The 2020 presidential race did not advance to ranked choice voting, with the winners of the state and in each congressional district exceeding 52% of the vote.

Alaska holds open primaries for statewide offices and sends the top four vote-getters, regardless of party, to the general election, where the winner is decided using ranked choice voting. In all legislative and statewide executive offices, Alaskans can rank up to four names that can include multiple candidates from the same party.

The exception is the presidency, which is eligible for ranked choice voting in Alaska for the first time. This year, there will be eight presidential tickets on the ballot, and Alaskans can rank all candidates if they choose to. The last time the winner of the presidential contest in Alaska failed to surpass 50% of the vote was in 1992, when third-party candidate Ross Perot won almost 20% of the national popular vote.

But in 2022, both Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski won their elections after both went to ranked choice voting.

Another wrinkle this year? In Alaska, where ranked choice voting was implemented by ballot measure in 2020, there's a voter initiative on the ballot this fall to repeal it.

California and Washington hold open primaries in which all candidates run on the same ballot and the two top vote-getters advance to the general election, regardless of party. This year, there are two House races in Washington that include candidates of the same party, one with two Republicans and one with two Democrats. There are four in California: three with only Democrats and one with only Republicans.

The winning party in those six districts will be reflected in The Associated Press' online graphic showing the balance of power in the House at poll close, rather than once a winner is declared because the party of the winner is a foregone conclusion.

Louisiana holds what it refers to as its ""open primaries"" on the same day the rest of the country holds its general election. In Louisiana, all candidates run on the same open primary ballot. Any candidate who earns more than 50% of the vote in the primary wins the seat outright.

If no candidate exceeds 50% of the vote, the top two vote-getters advance to a head-to-head runoff, which can end up pitting two Republicans or two Democrats against each other. Louisiana refers to these contests as its ""general election.""

That will change for elections for the U.S. House starting in 2026 when congressional races will have earlier primaries that are open only to registered members of a party. Certain state races will continue to hold open primaries in November, but the change will prevent future members of Congress from waiting until December -- a month later than the rest of the country -- to know whether they are headed to Washington.

In Nebraska, any measure that receives approximately 123,000 valid signatures qualifies for the ballot. This year, two measures relating to abortion met this threshold.

One would enshrine in the Nebraska Constitution the right to have an abortion until fetal viability or later, to protect the health of the pregnant woman. The other would write into the constitution the current 12-week ban, with exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the pregnant woman.

This marks the first time since the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade that a state has measures that seek to roll back abortion rights and protect abortion rights on the ballot at the same time.

It's possible voters could end up approving both measures. But because they're competing and therefore cannot both be enshrined in the constitution, the measure with the most ""for"" votes will be the one adopted, according to the Nebraska secretary of state.

In primary elections, a handful of states, mostly in the South, go to runoffs if no candidate receives at least 50% of the vote. In races with more than two candidates, runoffs in those states are common. Several states held primary runoffs this year.

Georgia uses the same rules in general elections. The last three Senate races there went to runoffs because a third-party candidate won enough of the vote to prevent the Republican or Democratic nominee from exceeding 50% of the vote.

But this year, runoff possibilities may be confined to downballot races such as state legislature. There's no Senate race there this year, and the U.S. House races have only two candidates on the ballot.

This is common in states that span multiple time zones. In most states, polls close at the same time in each time zone.

The AP will not call the winner of a race before all the polls in a jurisdiction are scheduled to close, even if votes already reported before that time make clear who will win the race. So if there is a statewide race in a state where polls close at 8 p.m. local time, but some of the state is in the Eastern time zone and some of the state is in Central time zone, the earliest the AP can call the winner is 8 p.m. CST/9 p.m. EST.

The AP will still show the results as they arrive from counties with closed polls.

Some of the biggest states with split poll close times are Florida, Michigan, Texas and Oregon. Tennessee is an exception, as even though the state is in both the Eastern and the Central time zones, all counties coordinate their voting to conclude at the same time.

"AP Elections Top 25: The people, places, races, dates and things to know about Election Day",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/associated-press-elections-top-25-people-places-races-dates-f323fe3dd459c54860a3ad39657e1fca,2024-10-08T19:26:14Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans will cast roughly 160 million ballots by the time Election Day comes to a close -- in several different ways, including many submitted a few weeks before polls even open.

They will choose a president, members of Congress and thousands of state lawmakers, city council members, attorneys general, secretaries of state -- and in Texas, a railroad commissioner who has nothing to do with the trains.

This year's election also comes at a moment in the nation's history when the very basics of how America votes are being challenged as never before by disinformation and distrust.

It can be tough to make sense of it all. To help better understand the way America picks its president and its leaders -- all the way down the ballot -- The Associated Press offers the following thoughts on the Top 25 people, places, races, dates and things to know about Election Day. A guidebook, of sorts, to American democracy as it nears its 250th birthday.

It's said that every presidential election makes history. Perhaps. But while some are destined to be included in the history books, others become the subject of books all of their own. Put 2024 down to get a whole shelf at the library. Will Americans choose to return Donald Trump to the White House, electing a former president to a new term for only the second time -- and picking for the first time a convicted felon to sit behind the Resolute Desk? Or will voters decide Kamala Harris ought to be the nation's first woman to take up office in the Oval Office, a candidate who didn't win a single primary yet landed at the top of her party's ticket by acclamation. No list of the Top 25 things to know about this year's general election can begin without an acknowledgment that no matter who America chooses, Trump and Harris will make history this Election Day. (Or a few days later.)

There might not be anyone as all-in on returning Trump to the White House as Elon Musk, the world's richest person. ""President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution. He must win to preserve democracy in America,"" the founder of SpaceX and Tesla told a rally crowd in early October when Trump returned to the site of his first attempted assassination in Pennsylvania. Along with his unfathomable personal wealth, Musk's ownership of X, formally known as Twitter, gives him an unprecedented ability to try and convince voters of his belief that electing Trump is a ""must-win situation."" Musk is spending heavily on get-out-the-vote efforts and using his perch as X's CEO to amplify misinformation and push into millions of timelines his argument that the country will not survive should Kamala Harris win the White House. It's a foreboding message that seems to get bleaker by the day - and Musk knows it. ""As you can see, I am not just MAGA,"" he told Trump's backers from the rally stage. ""I am Dark MAGA.""

The founder of Win With Black Women, Jotaka Eaddy has for the past four years hosted Sunday evening video conferences on Zoom to chat politics. On July 21, she couldn't get into her own meeting. Earlier that day, Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Kamala Harris as his replacement to be the Democratic nominee, and once Zoom changed some settings, 44,000 people were online and ready to talk about it. It was a pep talk and a telethon. People prayed and sang. About an hour after the Zoom started, Star Jones shared a donation link and by early the next morning they had raised more than $1 million. The meeting spawned a domino effect as Eaddy turned a tool made essential by the coronavirus pandemic into an essential place for Harris' supporters to gather. Soon, Black men and white women and white dudes and Taylor Swift fans were logging on. ""It has allowed us to organize in a way to bring people together that otherwise would not connect,"" Eaddy said.

Now that how a ballot is cast is as much of a red/blue choice as the candidate getting the vote, figuring out who will win a close election often depends on knowing the kind of ballots left to be counted. Garrett Archer, a former analyst at the Arizona Secretary of State's office who is now a data journalist, was one of the first of Twitter's election seers to understand how nit-picky those details can be. Were the advance votes still to be counted cast in person, mailed or left at a drop box? How soon before Election Day did those mail ballots arrive? Or might those mail votes actually be ""late earlies"" dropped off at a polling place? Archer goes deep into those details in his job with ABC's Phoenix affiliate, but most of us will get his analysis of Arizona's election results online, as we wait every afternoon after Election Day for his trademark Tweet that begins: ""Maricopa incoming...""

About a week after Election Day, Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows is likely to star in a livestream via laptop webcam to announce results of ranked choice voting. The instant-runoff system, used when no candidate initially wins an outright majority, might be a downballot novelty if not for the state's 2nd Congressional District. Behind by about 2,000 votes in 2018, Democrat Jared Golden emerged the winner and ousted the GOP incumbent once the ranked choice process awarded him the votes of two trailing independents. Maine also awards two of its Electoral College votes by congressional district, and while it may be unlikely, the road to 270 electoral votes could theoretically end with ranked choice results in Maine's 2nd District. In that case, should Golden's come-from-behind win of 2018 repeat itself, it would fall to Bellows to announce that ranked choice voting had put a second place finisher into the White House.

On an Aleutian island closer to the Russian border than mainland Alaska and more than 4,000 miles from the White House, the question isn't who wins on Election Day. It's who will be the very last American to vote. ""People have a little bit of fun on that day, because, I mean, realistically everybody knows the election's decided way before we're closed,"" said Layton Lockett, the city manager in Adak, Alaska. The country's last polling place to close is the only one still open from midnight ET to 1 a.m., when things wrap up on the island and former World War II military base. The honor of being the last voter was Mary Nelson's in 2012, when the community of a few hundred people did away with early voting in favor of casting ballots in person. She was a poll worker that Election Day, too, meaning her historic moment was short lived. ""When I opened the curtain to come back out, the city manager took my picture ... and they were waiting for us in Nome to call with our vote count,"" she said.

Out of more than 500 counties in the seven battleground states in this year's election, only 10 voted for Trump in 2016 before flipping to Biden in 2020. The first to complete its count this Election Day ought to be North Carolina's Nash County, which by 10 p.m. ET could provide an early indication of which candidate is performing best among the swing voters likely to decide a closely contested White House. That's especially true should there be a decisive winner in the community northeast of Raleigh, unaffected by Hurricane Helene. Two decades have passed since any presidential candidate won Nash by more than a point. Confirmation won't come for hours (or days), but more intelligence will arrive about a half hour later when North Carolina's other Trump-Biden county -- New Hanover on the state's Atlantic Coast -- should wrap up its count. The other eight counties to watch: Erie and Northhampton in Pennsylvania; Maricopa in Arizona; Kent, Saginaw and Leelanau in Michigan and Sauk and Door in Wisconsin.

There's more to Arizona than Maricopa County. Seriously! Yes, it's true that Biden eked out a win in 2020 among the more than 60% of Arizona voters who live in the sprawling home of Phoenix and its suburbs. But Biden may not have won Arizona and its 11 electoral votes without his win in Apache County, where he beat Trump by 11,851 votes out of roughly 35,000 cast. His statewide margin? Just 10,457. Apache County is far from the typical Democratic urban stronghold. Much of the rural county is part of the Navajo Nation, and it also includes lands belonging to the Apache people who gave the county its name. In all, more than 70% of people living there are Native American. America's indigenous population is often overlooked in presidential elections: the states with the largest percentages of Native people - Alaska, New Mexico, Oklahoma and South Dakota - are not often competitive. Arizona's emergence as a battleground makes the voters in Apache County -- and the roughly 5% of Arizonans who are Native American -- a potential factor in this year's election.

Trump won Wisconsin by about 20,000 votes in 2016 - and he and the country had to wait on Milwaukee County to know which way that margin would fall. The state's largest county and Democratic stronghold is one of a handful in Wisconsin that releases results of mail ballots all at once, rather than combining them with other ballots counted at precinct polling places. In 2016, confirmation there weren't enough mail votes left to count in the City of Milwaukee to flip the race from Trump to Hillary Clinton allowed AP to declare the Republican the winner of the state - and the White House. In the 2022 midterms, it was only when AP confirmed there were no ballots remaining to be counted in Milwaukee and Dane County, Wisconsin's other largest source of Democratic votes, that it was able to say incumbent Republican Ron Johnson would return to the Senate. Milwaukee might not be among the final counties in Wisconsin to report its results this year, but don't count out its chances to be the decisive county once it does in this crucial battleground state.

Election officials nationwide found no cases of fraud, vandalism or theft related to the use of drop boxes that that could have affected the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. And yet no place in this year's election may face more scrutiny than the drop box - a tool designed to make voting easier that's become the source of conspiracy theories that they played a role ( they didn't ) in stealing the election from Trump ( it wasn't ). Several states have enacted laws restricting their use since 2020, while in others they remain the subject of fascination. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed itself in July and dumped a ruling that limited drop boxes to only election clerks' offices. Prosecutors are currently investigating allegations that the mayor of Wausau removed the city's drop box last month without consulting with the city clerk. Election officials typically have detailed processes to ensure the security of ballots left in drop boxes, which are often monitored remotely by camera. Still, drop boxes remain a place where opponents wrongly believe their vote is neither safe nor secure.

There are 538 electoral votes to win from the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but the Trump and Harris campaigns are seriously contesting only seven states this year as battlegrounds: Arizona and Nevada out West, North Carolina and Georgia in the South, Michigan and Wisconsin amid the Great Lakes and Pennsylvania as the final boss. Eight years ago, Pennsylvania was the last state called for Trump before he won election by winning in Wisconsin in the early morning hours after Election Day. Four years ago, Biden's win there four days after polls close -- by roughly 80,000 votes out of more than 6.8 million cast -- was the difference. Both presidential hopefuls can get to the 270 electoral votes need to win White House without the Keystone State, but their path to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue gets a whole lot easier if they grab Pennsylvania's 19 electoral votes along the way.

Supporters of abortion rights are 7-for-7 in statewide votes since the U.S. Supreme Court "" returned to the people and their elected representatives "" the ability to decide on the legality of abortion. Come Election Day, voters in nine more states will get the chance via ballot measure to do the same. The states range from the reliably blue (Colorado, Maryland) to the resolutely red (South Dakota, Missouri, Nebraska), with a few presidential battlegrounds and/or states with key races for U.S. Senate - Arizona, Nevada and Montana - in between. And then there's Florida, a state Hillary Clinton hoped would provide her with a powerful push into the White House. Instead, the Sunshine State was in 2016 (and again in 2020) a cornerstone of Trump's Electoral College count. A Trump loss in Florida would undoubtedly sink his bid to return to the White House, but it's hardly clear that the chance to vote on social issues - even one as potent as abortion - can sway enough voters to truly affect an outcome at the top of the ticket.

Republicans can likely hold the U.S. House of Representatives even if they lose a couple of seats in New York, where a messy redistricting process two years ago helped the GOP win six districts carried by Biden. But if those losses include freshman Rep. Marc Molinaro in the state's 19th District, it will make for an uncomfortable election night for House Speaker Mike Johnson. Molinaro has styled himself as a pragmatist as he seeks reelection for the first time, avoiding the circus of former GOP Rep. George Santos in New York's 3rd District - a seat his party has already lost - and the inconveniently timed headlines of rising party star and 17th District Rep. Mike Lawler. Democrat Josh Riley, who nearly won the district in 2022, has raised more money than Molinaro ahead of their November rematch, as Democrats run candidates nationwide who came up just short in the 2022 midterms. If that's a winning strategy in New York's 19th District and elsewhere, the celebrations might be the most raucous in Brooklyn at the election night party of New York 8th District Rep. Hakeem Jefferies: the Democratic leader and House Speaker-in-waiting.

Pay enough attention to politics and you'll have heard the bit about Democrats being one election away from winning in Texas. Then Election Day arrives and Republicans have the cattle while Democrats are once again holding their hat. Is this the year that changes? Democrats say they're investing serious cash into the state with the hope that an unpopular incumbent (Sen. Ted Cruz) is at risk to a rising star (former NFL player and current Rep. Colin Allred). Sound familiar? Six years ago, Cruz was an unpopular incumbent running against a rising Democratic star from the U.S. House named Beto O'Rourke. Some say O'Rourke ran the perfect campaign...and Cruz won by a comfortable 2.6 points. It's been 30 years since a Democrat won statewide in Texas, so maybe the odds are better for Democrats in Florida? They're spending money there, too, to try and take down incumbent Sen. Rick Scott. Ask the GOP what to make of these moves and they'll tell you Democrats need that kind of dramatic upset to keep control of the Senate.

John Duarte might be in one of the closest races of the cycle - and possibly faces the longest waiting time to find out if he's returning to Congress. The California Republican won his 2022 race by 564 votes in a race that was so close that the AP needed until the first week of December to declare Duarte the winner. Now he has to do it all again: He faces a rematch in the state's 13th Congressional District against former state Assemblyman Adam Gray. California's count takes so long in large part because the state conducts its elections entirely by mail. In the 13th, there are also no major cities - no L.A., no Bakersfield, not even Fresno - that would provide enough votes at the beginning of the night to make clear who has won. If the House majority comes down to Duarte's race, the nation's attention will focus on a long count in five counties of California's agricultural Central Valley.

The first Tuesday after the first Monday in November is Election Day, established in 1875 under 2 U.S. Code ¬ß 7 for the election ""in each of the States and Territories of the United States, of Representatives and Delegates to the Congress."" In modern U.S. elections, Election Day is perhaps best thought of as the LAST day of the general election: it's the final chance for voters to cast ballots in person, for mail ballots to arrive and be counted, or, in some states, the day by which mail ballots must be postmarked.

Three weeks later comes the last day a mail ballot can arrive in Washington state and still be counted -- Nov. 25 is the latest deadline of any state that accepts votes cast by mail to arrive with an Election Day postmark. In all, 17 states and the District of Columbia allow mail ballots to arrive after Election Day, while 32 others require they be in the ballot box on Election Day. Only Louisiana requires mail ballots to arrive early in order to be counted -- the deadline there for mail ballots is the day before Election Day.

After supporters of Trump stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in an insurrection that aimed to overturn his loss to then-President-elect Joe Biden, Congress updated the Electoral Count Act to, among other things, establish the date by which every state's governor must certify the results of the presidential election and submit their slate of electors. Any legal challenges should then be completed by Dec. 16, because those members of the Electoral College will vote the next day.

Wait, there's another election day? Indeed! The Constitution says it's not the people who pick a president, but rather a group of ""electors"" as selected by each state for the job. But the founders also wrote that states get to decide how to pick their members of the Electoral College, and almost all require they vote for the winner of their state's popular vote (Maine and Nebraska do it just a little differently). This ritual takes place about a week before Christmas, the deadline for the electors' cast ballots to arrive in Washington.

More ceremony in early January as the members of the 119th Congress, having taken office a few days earlier, count those Electoral College ballots under the rules of the updated Electoral Count Act. Objections are still possible, but much harder to raise, and the revised law makes plain the vice president is there only to announce the results as president of the Senate. Once the electoral votes are officially cast and counted, the final step of the election comes at the new president's inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025.

Almost all of the roughly 160 million ballots that will be cast in this year's election will be made of paper. And almost all will be counted by machine. Election officials say without such machines, counting those ballots by hand would take much longer, cost taxpayers far more and result in errors that would then take even more time and money to fix. ""Human beings are really bad at tedious things, and counting ballots is among the most tedious things we could do,"" said Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Charles Stewart. ""Computers are very good at tedious things. They can count very quickly and very accurately."" Still, the desire to have humans involved in the process lingers. Officials in Georgia remain at odds over a recent directive from the state's election board requiring poll workers to count the total number of ballots by hand.

At The Associated Press, a race is ""too early to call"" if election officials are still tabulating votes and there is no clear winner. Regardless of how tight the margin may be between the leading candidates, AP won't say a race is ""too close to call"" unless election officials have tallied all outstanding ballots -- save for provisional ballots and late-arriving mail and absentee votes -- and the winner still remains unclear. In those cases, it's likely AP won't be able to say who has won until election officials certify the results -- a process that may take up to several weeks after Election Day. By the way, elections headed to a recount aren't automatically ""too close to call."" In fact, depending on how many votes separate the trailing candidates from the leader, AP may declare a winner even if a recount is possible.

Here's the thing about recounts: They might be required by law, they might be requested by a candidate, they might be ordered by a court. But they're not very likely to do anything but drag out the inevitable. ""Recounts are shifting a very small number of votes,"" said Deb Otis of the nonpartisan organization Fair Vote. ""We're going to see recounts in 2024 that are not going to change the outcome."" They almost never do. In the 36 recounts of a statewide general election since America's most famous recount in 2000, none moved the margin by more than a few hundred votes. The average change? Just 0.03 percentage points. The biggest? A move of 0.11 points in the 2006 race for Vermont state auditor - a rare race that did flip as a 137-vote lead in the initial count for Republican Randy Brock became a 102-vote recount win by Democrat Thomas Salmon. ""The count is pretty accurate because the machines work,"" said former Arizona election official Tammy Patrick. ""We have recounts ... to make sure we got it right."" As hopeful trailing candidates will soon learn, the first count almost always is.

Looking for ""precincts reporting"" when watching as results are reported in this year's election? Chances are, you'll find an estimate of ""expected vote"" instead. The Associated Press and other news organizations have moved away from precincts reporting as a measure of election turnout for several reasons - the fact that well more than half of voters no longer cast their ballot in person at a neighborhood ""precinct"" on Election Day chief among them. Instead, AP will estimate how much of the vote election officials have counted - and how many ballots they have left to count - based on a number of data points, including details on advance ballots cast, registration statistics and turnout in recent elections. Those estimates will change as votes are counted and more information about the exact number of ballots cast becomes available. AP's estimates of ballots cast won't reach 100% until election results are certified as final and complete.

More often than not, in a nation as evenly divided as the United States, not on Election Day -- or, at the least, not on Election Day on the East Coast. Since it took 36 days for George W. Bush's win in the 2000 presidential race to play out in Florida and before the Supreme Court, only in Barack Obama's two victories has AP declared a White House winner before midnight Eastern Time. Trump didn't win until 2:29 a.m. ET in 2016 and he didn't lose in 2020 until the Saturday morning after Election Day -- that's how long it took for Biden to claim 270 electoral votes by emerging as the clear winner in Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the sheer number of U.S. Representatives from California -- a state where officials will be counting mail ballots for weeks -- could make for a long wait to know which party will control the House.

"How AP VoteCast works, and how it's different from an exit poll",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/how-ap-votecast-works-exit-poll-48c02b728cecb06c26a896b049fe1096,2024-10-08T19:18:40Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- When it comes to understanding elections, it's not just about who won and lost. To explain what really happened, it's important to understand who voted and how, what they cared about and how they felt about important issues facing the country.

At The Associated Press, AP VoteCast is a key part of answering those questions, explaining the voting coalitions that elected the president, determined congressional control and decided state-level ballot measures.

Launched in 2018, AP VoteCast is an extensive survey of both voters and nonvoters that aims to tell the story behind election results. Conducted for the AP and Fox News by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, it's a detailed snapshot of the American electorate that helps explain who voted, who didn't vote, what issues they care about, how they feel about the candidates and why they voted the way they did -- or didn't vote at all.

Although it serves a similar purpose, AP VoteCast is not an exit poll.

Traditional exit polls, including the one conducted by a consortium of news networks in the United States, rely largely on in-person interviews with voters conducted outside of select polling places after they've voted, supplemented with a phone survey to reach mail-in voters. Before AP VoteCast the AP worked with other major news organizations to conduct Election Day exit polls.

AP VoteCast was created in part to reflect significant changes over the years in how people vote, from a world where most people vote by showing up at the polls on Election Day to one where a growing number vote before Election Day.

In 1972, for example, about 95% of voters nationwide cast a ballot in-person on the day of the election. Since then, the number of those voting before Election Day has grown steadily, especially in the past few elections. In 2018, roughly 4 in 10 voters cast their ballots before the November general election. In 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, the number shot up to about 7 in 10. In the 2022 midterms, about half of voters cast pre-Election Day ballots.

AP VoteCast captures the views of voters -- whether they vote in person on Election Day or weeks ahead of time -- by beginning to interview registered voters several days before Election Day. Those interviews conclude as polls close in each state. Interviews are offered in English and Spanish, as needed.

This approach allowed AP VoteCast to reliably survey more than 130,000 registered voters in all 50 states during the 2020 presidential election, and comprehensively explain how Democrat Joe Biden won the presidential election.

AP VoteCast uses a combination of methods -- mail, phone and online interviews -- to reach registered voters and capture their opinions about the candidates and the election, regardless of whether they vote in-person on or before Election Day or by mail-in ballot.

The first step in the process is to find people to participate in the survey. A random sample of registered voters drawn from state voter files is contacted through the mail and invited to take the survey online or by phone. Some voters are also contacted by phone if they do not respond to the initial invitation to take part in the survey.

Besides the randomly selected group of eligible registered voters, AP VoteCast collects data by conducting interviews with additional voters recruited through ""opt-in"" online panels where the participants are not selected randomly but instead recruited through internet advertising. This helps give AP VoteCast a broader reach and additional depth.

To make sure these additional interviews don't overrepresent or underrepresent important demographic and ideological groups, the panel's composition is carefully calibrated to match the random sample survey on key attitudes, along with matching the demographic characteristics of all registered voters.

Voters are asked a standard set of demographic questions, such as their age, sex, race and ethnicity, education level and the type of neighborhood they live in. They're asked to share their views on what they look for in a candidate, what they think about the candidates on the ballot and what they believe are the key issues facing the country, such as abortion, crime, the economy, health care and immigration.

While voters are asked for whom they're voting, the AP doesn't use this information to report an overall horse race result or to replace vote totals. But the survey results do provide valuable insight into how specific groups voted. For example, in the 2020 presidential election, AP VoteCast results showed that white men favored Republican Donald Trump, while women with college degrees favored Biden. That year, voters who thought the economy was the top issue preferred Trump, while those who thought health care was the top issue supported Biden.

In the 2024 Republican primary, AP VoteCast surveys in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina showed that while Trump won commanding victories in the early states, he struggled to broaden his support beyond those groups that have generally supported him in the past. Harris didn't become the Democratic nominee through the primary process, so her support among the party's primary voters wasn't captured in AP VoteCast surveys.

Courts keep weighing in on abortion. Next month's elections could mean even bigger changes,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-ruling-texas-georgia-5c5d73c45274f90d40f7a4a07f00a27a,2024-10-08T16:18:22Z,"Two court rulings Monday bolstered abortion opponents, with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that Texas could ban emergency abortions if they violate state law and Georgia's top court allowing enforcement of the abortion ban in that state.

The rulings are the latest in a legal saga that's been playing out a few rulings at a time across the U.S. for the past two years -- since the nation's top court overturned Roe v. Wade, ended the nationwide right to abortion, and opened the door to bans and restrictions, as well as the new legal fights that followed.

Meanwhile, abortion is also a top concern for voters ahead of next month's elections, including in nine states where it's on the ballot directly in the form of state constitutional amendments.

Here are five key things to know about the latest abortion developments across the country.

In the fallout of the 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, President Joe Biden's administration told hospitals that federal law required them to provide abortion services when the life of the pregnant person was at risk.

Texas sued over the policy, saying the federal government could not mandate the right to abortions that would violate the state's ban at all stages of pregnancy, with exceptions to protect the health and life of the woman.

On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court let that ruling stand. The justices did not detail their reasoning.

A weeks after a Georgia judge blocked the state's ban on abortion after the first six weeks or so of pregnancy, the state Supreme Court on Monday put it back into place -- at least for now.

The state's top court said the ban on abortion once cardiac activity can be detected, generally about six weeks into pregnancy and often before women realize they're pregnant, can be enforced while it considers the state's appeal of the September ruling.

It's not clear how many abortions were provided in the state that could not have been under the ban during the week the rules were relaxed. Some clinics said they were willing to provide abortions after six weeks, though.

The ruling meant that four states again bar abortion in most cases after about six weeks of pregnancy.

In another late-September development, a North Dakota ruling from earlier in the month striking down that state's abortion ban became official.

That means that 13 states are now enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, instead of 14.

But the impact of the ruling in North Dakota is limited to hospitals in the nation's second-least populous state.

The only clinic that provided abortions in the state moved from Fargo to nearby Moorhead, Minnesota, after the Dobbs ruling was made and North Dakota's ban took effect.

Court rulings are not the only place where abortion policy decisions are being made.

Voters in nine states are determining whether to add the right to abortion to their state constitutions.

In Missouri and South Dakota, the measures would undo current bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy. In Florida, it would lift a ban that kicks in after six weeks.

Nebraska has competing measures on the ballot. One would create the right to abortion until fetal viability, generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks into pregnancy. The other would enshrine the current ban that kicks in after 12 weeks.

In Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana, it would enshrine, and in some cases expand, abortion rights. Nevada's vote would, too, but to take effect, the measure would have to pass a second time, in 2026.

Additionally, New York voters will decide on an amendment that would bar discrimination on the basis of pregnancy status, though it does not mention abortion by name.

Abortion is a major issue in elections for office, too -- including the presidential race.

Vice President Kamala Harris has been focusing on abortion rights in her presidential campaign. She says she wants to ""reinstate the protections of Roe"". She talked about it on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast this week and in a speech last month in Georgia.

Former President Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has taken credit for nominating Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe. He says that the issue should be up to the states and, recently, that he would veto a nationwide abortion ban if Congress passed one. He has also said he would vote against the Florida ballot measure, though he has also criticized it as too restrictive."
"Encuesta: Votantes negros apoyan m√°s a Harris, pero no est√°n seguros de que cambiar√° las cosas",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/politics/encuesta-votantes-negros-apoyan-mas-a-harris-pero-no-estan-seguros-de-que-cambiara-las-cosas-b8e6e2f00c41d9e00df2a6b5503abc4b,2024-10-08T16:01:14Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Los votantes registrados negros tienen un punto de vista abrumadoramente positivo de la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris, pero no est√°n seguros de que ella cambiar√° al pa√≠s para bien, seg√∫n una encuesta de AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

La encuesta, realizada a mediados de septiembre, hall√≥ que alrededor de un 70% de los votantes negros tienen una opini√≥n muy o algo favorable de Harris, con escasa diferencia entre hombres y mujeres. Los votantes m√°s j√≥venes y los de edad m√°s avanzada tambi√©n ten√≠an opiniones similares de la vicepresidenta.

Las opiniones entre los votantes negros hacia el expresidente y candidato presidencial republicano Donald Trump, en cambio, son abrumadoramente negativas, lo que subraya la dificultad que enfrenta en sus intentos por quitarle a Harris apoyo entre las personas de raza negra. Los votantes negros son un importante baluarte para los dem√≥cratas y pocos est√°n alineados con el Partido Republicano. Seg√∫n la encuesta, dos tercios de los votantes negros se identifican como dem√≥cratas, un 20% se identifica como independiente y solo un 10% se identifica como republicano.

Pero el sondeo tambi√©n hall√≥ que, a pesar de la profunda discrepancia en los puntos de vista hacia los candidatos, los votantes negros tienen menos certeza en cuanto a que Harris pueda colocar al pa√≠s en una mejor trayectoria o cambiar sus vidas de manera significativa. Preguntados si la frase ""Cambiar√≠a al pa√≠s para bien"" describe bien a Harris, solo la mitad dijo que la describir√≠a muy o extremadamente bien, un 30% dijo que la describir√≠a ""m√°s o menos bien"" y un 20% dijo que la describe ""no muy bien"" o ""para nada bien"". Y solo alrededor de la mitad opinan que el resultado de estas elecciones tendr√° ""mucho"" o ""algo"" de impacto en sus vidas, una proporci√≥n similar a la hallada en la poblaci√≥n general.

""El Partido Dem√≥crata no es lo suficiente fuerte para m√≠"", expres√≥ Raina Johnson, una habitante de Chicago de 53 a√±os de edad. Vaticin√≥ que Harris ""tratar√° de hacer algo a favor de la gente"" pero se ver√° limitada ""como ocurri√≥ con (Barack) Obama, porque el Partido Republicano le tranc√≥ el camino"".

Si bien Johnson opina que las elecciones ser√°n muy importantes, no cree que le afectar√° mucho en su vida ""porque yo seguir√© viviendo mi vida, seguir√© adapt√°ndome a los problemas que surjan"".

Preguntados sobre cu√°l candidato har√≠a un mejor trabajo en encarar los temas que enfrentan al pa√≠s -- como la econom√≠a, la atenci√≥n m√©dica y la delincuencia - la mayor√≠a de los votantes negros coincidieron: Harris.

Al igual que en la poblaci√≥n general, un 80% de los votantes negros dijeron que la econom√≠a es uno de los temas principales en esta campa√±a. Pero un 75% de los votantes negros dijeron que la atenci√≥n m√©dica es uno de los temas m√°s importantes, comparado con poco m√°s de la mitad de la poblaci√≥n general. Adem√°s, los votantes negros son m√°s propensos a opinar que las normas sobre tenencia de armas y la delincuencia son problemas importantes, que en la poblaci√≥n general.

En todos esos temas, as√≠ como en otros como el aborto y el cambio clim√°tico, Harris supera c√≥modamente a Trump entre los votantes negros. Pero el tama√±o de esa ventaja es mayor en algunos temas que en otros. Un 60% de los votantes negros opinan que Harris est√° mejor posicionada para manejar la econom√≠a, mientras que un 20% dice lo mismo de Trump, lo que le da a Harris una ventaja de alrededor de 40 puntos. En cuanto al aborto, ella tiene una ventaja de alrededor de 60 puntos.

La campa√±a de Trump ha estado aumentando sus intentos por ganarse el apoyo de las comunidades negras, creyendo que su mensaje en cuanto a la econom√≠a, la inmigraci√≥n y los valores tradicionales puede quitarle votos a los dem√≥cratas, particularmente entre los hombres negros m√°s j√≥venes.

Rod Wettlin, un jubilado y veterano de la Fuerza A√©rea en Surprise, Arizona que desea m√°s acci√≥n en cuanto a la atenci√≥n m√©dica y la inmigraci√≥n, dice que se opone fuertemente a Trump y que teme que la democracia estadounidense est√° en peligro.

""Lo que est√° pasando ahora es la culminaci√≥n de algo a lo que nos hemos enfrentado desde hace a√±os"", dijo Wettlin. ""Ojal√° despu√©s de las elecciones volveremos a un discurso m√°s civil, pero esta gente desde ya est√° clamando por un caos. Y eso es su derecho, yo luch√© para que ellos tengan ese derecho. Pero que no vengan a pisarme mis derechos"".

Hay indicios de que algunos votantes negros consideran a Harris una figura m√°s fuerte. Las mujeres negras y los votantes negros de mayor edad especialmente son m√°s propensos a describir a Harris como alguien que ""luchar√° a favor de gente como t√∫"", comparado con los hombres negros y los votantes negros m√°s j√≥venes.

Son relativamente pocos los votantes negros que tienen una opini√≥n positiva de Trump, o que lo consideran un candidato poseedor de las cualidades necesarias para ser presidente. La encuesta hall√≥ que alrededor del 80% de los votantes negros tienen una opini√≥n algo o muy desfavorable de Trump, mientras que apenas un 15% tienen una opini√≥n algo o muy favorable. Apenas alrededor de un 10% dicen que frases como ""Cambiar√≠a al pa√≠s para bien"" o ""Luchar√≠a por gente como t√∫"" describen bien a Trump, y una proporci√≥n igualmente baja de votantes negros dijeron que Trump ser√≠a un buen presidente.

""Creo que iremos por la direcci√≥n correcta si Kamala Harris gana"", opin√≥ Roslyn Coble, una residente de Oakboro, Carolina del Norte, de 63 a√±os de edad. ""Pero si Donald Trump gana, las cosas ir√°n mal. √âl ya dej√≥ claro lo que va a hacer, va a ser un dictador"".

Alrededor del 70% de los votantes negros dicen que la frase ""Dir√° cualquier cosa para ganar las elecciones"" describe a Trump por lo menos muy bien.

En un indicio de c√≥mo la decisi√≥n del presidente Joe Biden de retirarse como candidato dem√≥crata en julio podr√≠a haber afectado la contienda, solo un 55% de los hombres negros tienen una opini√≥n favorable de Biden, comparado con 70% entre las mujeres negras.

Biden ""hizo lo mejor que pudo"", declar√≥ Wettlin. A√±adi√≥ que Biden debi√≥ haberse retirado mucho antes, y se mostr√≥ esc√©ptico ante los logros del mandatario.

Grupos de activismo negro dicen que han detectado un aumento en energ√≠a y entusiasmo desde que Harris se convirti√≥ en la candidata dem√≥crata, y tanto la campa√±a de Harris como la de Trump siguen centrando esfuerzos en ese sector demogr√°fico.

La campa√±a de Trump ha estado organizando eventos en vecindarios negros de ciudades como Filadelfia, Detroit y Milwaukee y organiz√≥ una gira en autob√∫s con el lema ""Voces Negras A Favor De Trump"" en septiembre. Por su parte, la campa√±a de Harris ha realizado varios eventos orientados hacia los votantes negros, especialmente los hombres, y ha despachado a varios partidarios prominentes - como legisladores, celebridades y l√≠deres de derechos civiles - en comunidades negras en semanas recientes.

La encuesta abarc√≥ 1.771 votantes registrados y se realiz√≥ entre el 12 y 16 de septiembre usando una muestra AmeriSpeak, dise√±ada para ser representativa de toda la poblaci√≥n estadounidense. Tiene un margen de error de +/- 3,4 puntos porcentuales."
What polling shows about Black voters' views of Harris and Trump,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-election-black-voters-biden-78e344ddea4886dd23582f4a51eb0da6,2024-10-08T04:06:13Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Black registered voters have an‚ÄØoverwhelmingly positive‚ÄØview of Vice President Kamala Harris, but they're less sure that she would change the country for the better, according to a recent poll from the‚ÄØ AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

The poll, which was conducted in mid-September, found‚ÄØabout 7 in 10‚ÄØBlack voters have a‚ÄØsomewhat or very favorable‚ÄØview of Harris, with‚ÄØfew differences‚ÄØbetween Black men and women voters on how they view the Democratic candidate. Younger and older Black voters also had‚ÄØsimilar views‚ÄØof the vice president.

Black voters' opinions of former President Donald Trump, by contrast, were‚ÄØoverwhelmingly negative, underscoring the challenges that the Republican candidate faces as he seeks to erode Harris' support among Black men. Black voters are an important Democratic constituency, and few are aligned with the Republican Party. According to the survey, two-thirds‚ÄØof Black voters identify as Democrats,‚ÄØabout 2 in 10‚ÄØidentify as independents and‚ÄØabout 1 in 10‚ÄØidentify as Republicans.

But the poll also found that despite this dramatic gap in views of the candidates, Black voters are less certain of whether Harris would set the country on a better trajectory, or make a substantial difference in their own lives. Only‚ÄØabout half‚ÄØof Black voters say ""would change the country for the better"" describes Harris‚ÄØvery or extremely well, while about 3 in 10 say it describes her ""somewhat well"" and about 2 in 10 say it describes her ""not very well"" or ""not well at all."" And only‚ÄØabout half‚ÄØbelieve the outcome of this presidential election will have ""a great deal"" or ""quite a bit"" of impact on them personally, an assessment that's‚ÄØin line with Americans overall.

""The Democratic Party is not strong enough for me,"" said Raina Johnson, 53, a safety case manager in Chicago. Johnson predicted that Harris would ""try to do something for the people"" but she felt that Harris would be limited as it was ""with (Barack) Obama, because the Republican Party shut him down.""

While Johnson felt that the stakes of the election were extremely high, she did not think it would have a large personal impact on her.

""Because I'll still live my life. I'll just have to roll with the punches,"" she said.

When asked which candidate would do a better job handling their top issues, including the‚ÄØeconomy,‚ÄØhealth care and‚ÄØcrime, Black voters had the same answer:‚ÄØHarris.

Like voters overall,‚ÄØabout 8 in 10‚ÄØBlack voters said the economy is‚ÄØone of the most important issues‚ÄØto their vote. But‚ÄØabout three-quarters‚ÄØof Black voters said health care was one of their most important issues, compared to‚ÄØslightly more than half‚ÄØof registered voters, and they were also‚ÄØmore likely‚ÄØthan the electorate as a whole to say‚ÄØgun policy‚ÄØand‚ÄØcrime‚ÄØwere top issues.

In all of those areas, as well as on other topics like abortion and climate change, Harris held a commanding advantage over Trump among Black voters. But the size of that edge was bigger on some issues than others. About 6 in 10‚ÄØBlack voters said Harris was better positioned to handle the economy, while‚ÄØabout 2 in 10‚ÄØsaid this about Trump, giving Harris‚ÄØabout a 40-point advantage. On‚ÄØabortion‚ÄØpolicy, she had‚ÄØaround a 60-point advantage‚ÄØover Trump.

The Trump campaign has stepped up with some outreach to Black communities this year. The former president's campaign believes that‚ÄØhis‚ÄØmessage on the economy, immigration and traditional values can make notable inroads into the Democrats' traditional base of support among Black voters, especially younger Black men.

Rod Wettlin, a retired Air Force veteran in Surprise, Arizona, who wants greater action on issues like‚ÄØhealth care‚ÄØand immigration, said he was deeply opposed to Trump and was concerned about the implications of the election for American democracy.

""What's going on now is the culmination of a lot of stuff that's been in our face for years,"" said Wettlin. ""Hopefully after the election it is civil, but these cats out here are already calling for bedlam. And that's their right, I fought for them to have that right. But don't infringe on mine.""

There are signs that some groups of Black voters see Harris as a stronger figure, though. Black women voters and older Black voters were‚ÄØespecially likely‚ÄØto describe Harris as someone who would ""fight for people like you,"" compared to Black men and younger Black voters.

Relatively few‚ÄØBlack voters have a positive view of Trump, or see him as a candidate who has important qualities for the presidency. The poll found that‚ÄØabout‚ÄØ8 in 10 Black voters‚ÄØhave a‚ÄØsomewhat or very‚ÄØunfavorable view of Trump, while‚ÄØjust 15% ‚ÄØhave a‚ÄØsomewhat or very‚ÄØfavorable view.‚ÄØAbout 1 in 10‚ÄØsaid ""would change the country for the better"" or ""would fight for people like you"" describes Trump‚ÄØat least very well, and a similarly low share‚ÄØof Black voters said that Trump would make a good president.

""I think we're headed in the right direction if Kamala Harris gets it,"" said‚ÄØRoslyn Coble, 63, and‚ÄØa resident of‚ÄØOakboro, North Carolina. ""But if Donald Trump gets it,‚ÄØit's going to be bad. He already told us what he's going to do. He's going to be a dictator.""

About 7 in 10‚ÄØBlack voters say the phrase ""will say anything to win the election"" describes Trump at least very well.

In a sign of how former President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw as the Democratic candidate in July may have altered the race, only‚ÄØ55%‚ÄØof Black men‚ÄØvoters‚ÄØhave a favorable view of Biden, compared to‚ÄØ7 in 10‚ÄØBlack women‚ÄØvoters.

""He did his best,"" said Wettlin. He said that Biden should have bowed out of the presidential race far sooner and was skeptical of some of his achievements.

Black voter engagement organizations‚ÄØsay they‚ÄØhave also seen a burst of energy from voters and advocates since Harris' entrance into the race, and both the Harris and Trump campaigns are continuing to focus on this group.

The Trump campaign has been conducting listening sessions and community events in Black neighborhoods in cities like Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee. The campaign has also coordinated a ""Black Voices for Trump"" bus tour across cities in September. Meanwhile, the Harris campaign has held a number of events geared toward Black voters, especially Black men, and has deployed a number of high-profile surrogates, including lawmakers, celebrities and civil rights leaders, to Black communities in recent weeks.

The poll of 1,771 registered voters was conducted Sept. 12-16, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for registered voters is plus or minus 3.4 percentage points."

Georgia Supreme Court halts ruling striking down state's near-ban on abortions as the state appeals,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/georgia-abortion-ban-967ed4f8efe64d07e22213c47749df9a,2024-10-07T17:15:01Z,"SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) -- The Georgia Supreme Court on Monday halted a ruling striking down the state's near-ban on abortions while it considers the state's appeal.

The high court's order came a week after a judge found that Georgia unconstitutionally prohibits abortions beyond about six weeks of pregnancy, often before women realize they're pregnant. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled Sept. 30 that privacy rights under Georgia's state constitution include the right to make personal healthcare decisions.

It was one of a wave of restrictive abortion laws passed in Republican-controlled states after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a national right to abortion. It prohibited most abortions once a ""detectable human heartbeat"" was present. At around six weeks into a pregnancy, cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in an embryo's cells that will eventually become the heart.

Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed it in 2019, but it didn't take effect until Roe v. Wade fell.

McBurney wrote in his ruling that ""liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.""

""When a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then -- and only then -- may society intervene,"" McBurney wrote.

The judge's decision rolled back abortion limits in Georgia to a prior law allowing abortions until viability, roughly 22 to 24 weeks into a pregnancy.

""Once again, the will of Georgians and their representatives has been overruled by the personal beliefs of one judge,"" Kemp said in a statement in response to McBurney's decision. ""Protecting the lives of the most vulnerable among us is one of our most sacred responsibilities, and Georgia will continue to be a place where we fight for the lives of the unborn.""

Abortion providers and advocates in Georgia had applauded McBurney's ruling, but expressed concern that it would soon be overturned."
"Corte Suprema deja vigente prohibici√≥n a abortos en Texas, incluso los de emergencia",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/us-news/general-news-27f7423fbdba39336b74954c504584bc,2024-10-07T16:17:52Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- La Corte Suprema dej√≥ vigente el lunes una decisi√≥n que proh√≠be los abortos de emergencia que violen la ley en Texas, que tiene una de las prohibiciones al aborto m√°s estrictas del pa√≠s.

Sin dar explicaciones, el m√°ximo tribunal dej√≥ vigente el fallo de un tribunal inferior seg√∫n el cual los hospitales no pueden ser obligados a practicar terminaciones de emergencia de embarazos que violen la ley de Texas. No hubo ning√∫n disenso p√∫blico.

El gobierno del presidente Joe Biden le hab√≠a pedido a la Corte Suprema que desestimara el fallo del tribunal menor, argumentando que los hospitales est√°n obligados a practicar abortos en situaciones de emergencia bajo las leyes federales. El gobierno se√±al√≥ una decisi√≥n previa de la Corte Suprema en un caso similar registrado de Idaho, en que los magistrados por estrecha mayor√≠a permitieron los abortos de emergencia mientras contin√∫a una demanda.

El gobierno federal tambi√©n mencion√≥ un fallo de la Corte Suprema de Texas seg√∫n el cual los m√©dicos no tienen que esperar a que la vida de una mujer est√© en peligro inmediato para poder practicar legalmente un aborto. De acuerdo con el gobierno estadounidense, ello ajusta a Texas a las leyes federales e implica que el fallo de la corte menor no es necesario.

Texas le pidi√≥ a la Corte Suprema federal mantener vigente la orden, argumentando que el fallo del tribunal estatal significa que la ley de Texas, a diferencia de la de Idaho, s√≠ tiene una excepci√≥n para proteger la salud de la mujer y que no hay conflicto entre las leyes federal y estatal.

Los m√©dicos han dicho que la ley sigue siendo peligrosamente vaga luego que una junta m√©dica se neg√≥ a especificar exactamente qu√© condiciones califican como excepci√≥n.

Han aumentado recientemente las denuncias de que mujeres embarazadas con problemas m√©dicos han sido rechazadas en salas de emergencia en Texas y otros estados, mientras los hospitales debaten si el cuidado est√°ndar podr√≠a violar las estrictas leyes contra el aborto.

La terminaci√≥n de un embarazo siempre ha sido parte del tratamiento m√©dico para personas con complicaciones serias como manera de evitar la sepsis, la atrofia de √≥rganos u otros problemas. Pero en Texas y otros estados, m√©dicos y hospitales han dicho que no queda claro si esas terminaciones violan las prohibiciones al aborto que acarrean penas de prisi√≥n.

El caso de Texas empez√≥ luego que la Corte Suprema derog√≥ el fallo Roe vs. Wade en 2022, lo que llev√≥ a prohibiciones al aborto en varios estados gobernados por republicanos. El gobierno de Biden emiti√≥ una directriz diciendo que los hospitales todav√≠a deb√≠an practicar abortos en casos de emergencia, bajo una ley de salud que requiere a la mayor√≠a de los hospitales atender a cualquier paciente enfermo.

Texas demand√≥ en contra de esa directriz, argumentando que no se puede obligar a los hospitales a violar la prohibici√≥n al aborto vigente en el estado. La Corte Federal de Apelaciones del Quinto Distrito le dio la raz√≥n a Texas, diciendo en enero que el gobierno estadounidense hab√≠a excedido su autoridad."
Supreme Court lets stand a decision barring emergency abortions that violate Texas ban,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-emergency-abortion-texas-bf79fafceba4ab9df9df2489e5d43e72,2024-10-07T13:47:42Z,"Without detailing their reasoning, the justices kept in place a lower court order that said hospitals cannot be required to provide pregnancy terminations that would violate Texas law.

The Biden administration had asked the justices to throw out the lower court order, arguing that hospitals have to perform abortions in emergency situations under federal law. The administration pointed to the Supreme Court's action in a similar case from Idaho earlier this year in which the justices narrowly allowed emergency abortions to resume while a lawsuit continues.

The administration also cited a Texas Supreme Court ruling that said doctors do not have to wait until a woman's life is in immediate danger to provide an abortion legally. The administration said it brings Texas in line with federal law and means the lower court ruling is not necessary.

Texas asked the justices to leave the order in place, saying the state Supreme Court ruling meant Texas law, unlike Idaho's, does have an exception for the health of a pregnant patient and there's no conflict between federal and state law."
Andy Kim and Curtis Bashaw clash over abortion and immigration in New Jersey Senate debate,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/new-jersey-senate-debate-kim-bashaw-57659eff4ca62c7e581978f0d91561cb,2024-10-07T02:57:18Z,"NUTLEY, N.J. (AP) -- Democratic Rep. Andy Kim and Republican Curtis Bashaw clashed over abortion and immigration Sunday in their first debate for New Jersey's Senate seat, open this year after Bob Menendez's conviction on bribery charges and resignation.

Kim, a three-term representative from the 3rd District, hammered Bashaw for his support of former President Donald Trump and expressed skepticism about Bashaw's position as an abortion rights supporter. Bashaw, a hotel developer from southern New Jersey and first-time candidate, sought to cast himself as a moderate and Kim as a Washington insider.

The debate was briefly derailed at the start when Bashaw stopped speaking mid-sentence and stared ahead, nonresponsive. He was helped from the stage and left the room for roughly 10 minutes.

""I got so worked up about this affordability issue that I realized I hadn't eaten so much food today,"" Bashaw said when he returned. ""So I appreciate your indulgence.""

Among the most pointed exchanges was over abortion. Both candidates support abortion rights, but Bashaw has said he supported the U.S. Supreme Court's decision that ended Roe v. Wade. New Jersey has enshrined abortion protections in state law.

""I just fundamentally have a problem with using the term 'pro-choice' to describe yourself when you have talked about the important of the Dobbs decision being correctly decided,"" Kim said.

He also hammered Bashaw for his support of Trump, who has twice lost New Jersey's electoral votes.

""The one endorsement that he has made is for Donald Trump to be president of the United States,"" Kim said. ""And I guess we get a sense of his judgment from that.""

Bashaw, who defeated a Trump-endorsed rival in the primary, didn't defend the former president explicitly.

""Elections are binary choices, and we all have to make a decision,"" he said.

He touted his own candidacy based on his credentials as a businessperson and resisted being typecast as a traditional Republican, pointing out that he backs abortion rights and is a married gay man.

""I am pro-choice, congressman. I am for freedom in the home,"" Bashaw said. ""I don't think government should tell me who I can marry. I don't think it should tell a woman what she can do with her reproductive health choices.""

Bashaw hammered on immigration repeatedly throughout, saying it's ""a crisis in New Jersey"" and is costing the state.

In a reflection of how Democratic-leaning New Jersey has been in Senate races, which Republicans haven't won in more than five decades, Bashaw addressed his closing statements to women and moms of New Jersey.

""I am a moderate, common-sense person that will work to be a voice for New Jersey,"" he said.

Kim declared his candidacy a day after Menendez's indictment last year, saying it was time for the state to turn the page on the longtime legislator. It looked as if the Democratic primary in a must-win state for the party would be contentious when first lady Tammy Murphy entered the race, winning support from influential party leaders.

But Kim challenged the state's unique ballot-drawing system widely viewed as favoring the candidates backed by party leaders. A federal judge sided with Kim in his legal challenge, putting the system on hold for this election. Murphy dropped out of the race, saying she wanted to avoid a divisive primary, leaving a clear path to Kim's nomination.

Kim first won office to the House in 2018, defeating Republican Rep. Tom MacArthur. He got national attention after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection when he was photographed picking up trash in the building.

Bashaw won a contested primary in June, defeating a Trump-backed opponent. The hotel developer from Cape May is running for office for the first time.

Menendez was convicted this summer on federal charges of accepting bribes of gold and cash from three New Jersey businesspeople and acting as an agent for the Egyptian government. He has vowed to appeal the conviction.

He resigned in August, capping a career in politics that spanned roughly five decades. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy appointed George Helmy as interim senator. Helmy said he'll resign after the election is certified so Murphy can appoint whoever wins the election to the seat for the remainder of Menendez's term, which expires in January."
Walz says he'll 'own up' when he misspeaks as the Democratic ticket steps up media interviews,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/walz-harris-media-interview-presidential-campaign-83325184cd7f93ca505df590f7a27ede,2024-10-06T16:08:51Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly a week after verbal stumbles in the only vice presidential debate, Democrat Tim Walz used his debut campaign appearance on a Sunday news show to try to fend off criticism of his stand on abortion rights and ""own up"" to past misstatements.

The interview on ""Fox News Sunday"" reflected a broader media blitz by presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her running mate as the Democrats seek to garner public attention in the final 30 days of the campaign against Republicans Donald Trump and JD Vance.

Harris has taped an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that will air Monday night. She is booked Tuesday on Howard Stern's satellite radio show, ABC's ""The View"" and ""The Late Show"" with Stephen Colbert on CBS. Her interview on the podcast ""Call Her Daddy"" is scheduled to be released later Sunday. Walz will be on Jimmy Kimmel's ABC show on Monday.

Walz's Fox appearance also touched on the turmoil in the Middle East, with anchor Shannon Bream pressing the Minnesota governor on whether Israel has a right to preemptively attack Iran's nuclear and oil facilities in response to Tehran's firing of missiles against Israel. It was a question that Walz did not fully answer during his debate this past week with Vance, an Ohio senator.

Walz said Sunday that ""specific operations will be dealt with at the time."" He said Israel has a right to defend itself and that Harris worked with Israel this past week to repel the Iranian attack. President Joe Biden said last week he would not support an Israeli strike on sites related to Tehran's nuclear program.

Walz defended a law that he signed as governor to ensure abortion protections, saying it ""puts this puts the decision with the woman and her health care providers."" He questioned the statement by Trump that he would not sign a national abortion ban into law.

On the economy, Walz said Harris' proposals would make life more affordable for the middle class by helping with the construction of 3 million new homes and expanding tax credits for parents. He said tariffs floated by Trump could increase costs by an estimated $4,000 a year on a typical family.

Walz also faced questions in the interview about misstatements pertaining to his military service, drunken driving arrest, infertility treatment for his family and claims to have been in Hong Kong before the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in China.

""I will own up when I misspeak,"" Walz said.

He said he believes voters are more concerned by the fact that Vance could not acknowledge during their debate that Trump lost the 2020 election to Biden and that there could restrictions on the infertility treatment of intrauterine insemination that his wife, Gwen, received.

""I think they're probably far more concerned with that than my wife and I used IUI to have our child and that Donald Trump would restrict that,"" Walz said. ""So I think folks know who I am.""

Bream noted that Trump has come out in support of fertility treatments, even as he has said that abortion questions should be decided by states."
Mormon church leaders encourage civility as Trump and Harris rally religious voters,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mormon-voters-trump-harris-abortion-4b7d1b3fca00d341ba988d3390cfc3d5,2024-10-05T22:51:31Z,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- As both presidential campaigns have stepped up efforts to win over voters in western swing states who belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a top church official urged members on Saturday to ""avoid what is harsh and hateful"" in the heat of election season.

Dallin H. Oaks, the top adviser and likely successor to 100-year-old church president Russell M. Nelson, encouraged congregants at the faith's twice-annual general conference to steer clear of contention and be peacemakers in their communities one month out from the Nov. 5 election.

The devil is the father of contention, which can stir up anger and stall important policy changes, he told a room of 18,000 church members in Salt Lake City and thousands more watching on a livestream.

""As we pursue our preferred policies in public actions, let us qualify for his blessings by using the language and methods of peacemakers,"" said Oaks, the second-highest-ranking leader of the faith known widely as the Mormon church.

The faith's leaders strive to remain politically neutral. But they sometimes give general advice about how members should approach key elections. About 7 million of the faith's 17 million worldwide members live in the United States, many in the battleground states of Arizona and Nevada, and in solidly red Utah and Idaho.

Latter-day Saints have been a reliably Republican voting bloc for decades, but many have half-heartedly embraced Donald Trump since his first run for the White House.

Some church members say the former president's demeaning rhetoric toward women, immigrants and refugees conflicts with their core values of humility, honesty and compassion. Others have raised concern about his felony convictions and his attempts to undermine the 2020 presidential election.

Vice President Kamala Harris is hoping to capitalize on her opponent's inability to lock down the Latter-day Saints vote. Her campaign formalized outreach efforts last month and enlisted prominent members of the faith to convince those in battleground Arizona, a state with nearly 450,000 church members, that Trump is not in alignment with the church's teachings.

Trump has also rallied influential church members at his Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida to help him convince swing voters that he will better protect their religious liberties.

Harris is unlikely to come close to winning a majority of Latter-day Saints. But by preventing Trump from running up big margins with a key demographic, she could tip the scales in Arizona and Nevada, which is home to upward of 180,000 Latter-day Saints.

One of Harris' greatest challenges is making her abortion policy palatable to members of a faith that has long opposed the procedure, with some exceptions.

It is a sticking point for Marilou Idos, a conference attendee from Herriman, Utah, who said she is not a fan of Trump's brash style but plans to vote for him because he opposes expanding abortion access. She also values Trump's support for Israel.

""He's the lesser of two evils,"" said Idos, 70. ""The basic things we believe in, Trump endorses. Abortion, that's kind of the main one, and the freedom to worship.""

The religion is also known for its belief in eternal families, tight-knit congregations and bans on alcohol, coffee, gambling and same-sex relationships.

Sammy Price, 38, of Las Vegas, said he is leaning toward voting for Harris because he thinks the nation needs her unifying rhetoric.

""Trump, he insults people, he makes people feel bad about who they are, and that's not something I think I can stand by,"" he said.

Undecided voters Jenna Winkel, 22, and her husband, Ben Winkel, 24, said just before the conference that they hoped church leaders would avoid addressing politics.

The couple from Draper, Utah, said there is room for a variety of political views under the Latter-day Saints umbrella. While Jenna said her religion doesn't really inform her politics, Ben said his does, but he wants to do more of his own research.

""The important thing about any general conference message is that it's general and then we're asked to take them and study them and apply them to our own lives, and maybe our politics,"" Jenna said. ""People will take what they need to hear from them and apply them in their lives."""
The Supreme Court opens its new term with election disputes in the air but not yet on the docket,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-election-transgender-free-speech-guns-50d7d3d0a85932efe407a80aeaea75fa,2024-10-05T12:43:12Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Transgender rights, the regulation of ""ghost guns"" and the death penalty highlight the Supreme Court's election-season term that begins Monday, with the prospect of the court's intervention in voting disputes lurking in the background.

The justices are returning to the bench at a time of waning public confidence in the court and calls to limit their terms to 18 years that have wide support, including the backing of Democratic President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the party's White House nominee.

Whether by design or happenstance, the justices are hearing fewer high-profile cases than they did in recent terms that included far-reaching decisions by the 6-3 conservative majority on presidential immunity, abortion, guns, and affirmative action.

The lighter schedule would allow them to easily add election cases, if those make their way to the high court in the run-up to the Nov. 5 election between Republican Donald Trump and Harris, or its immediate aftermath.

""I think there are legal issues that arise out of the political process. And so, the Supreme Court has to be prepared to respond if that should be necessary,"" Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson told CBS News last month in an interview to her promote new memoir, ""Lovely One.""

The court's involvement in election disputes might depend on the closeness of the outcome and whether the justices' intervention would tip the outcome, David Cole, the outgoing legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said at a recent Washington event.

""I don't think the court wants to get involved, but it may have to,"" Cole said.

The court turned away multiple challenges from Trump and his allies to the results of the 2020 election that he lost to Biden. It's been nearly a quarter-century since the Supreme Court effectively decided the 2000 presidential election, in which Republican George W. Bush edged Democrat Al Gore.

When the justices gather Monday morning on a date set by federal law, they will shake hands with each other as they always do. Just after 10 o'clock, they will emerge from behind freshly cleaned heavy red drapery and take their seats on the curved mahogany bench, Chief Justice John Roberts in the center chair and his eight colleagues seated in order of seniority.

There are likely to be smiles and shared private jokes. But the friendliness of that moment will not sweep away tensions that have barely been concealed.

During the summer, two justices, Elena Kagan and Jackson, voiced support for toughening the new ethics code that so far lacks a means of enforcement.

The leak to The New York Times of the contents of a memo Roberts wrote last winter that outlined his approach to the court's presidential immunity decision ""was nothing short of shocking,"" Supreme Court lawyer Lisa Blatt said last week at a Washington preview of the coming term.

Two years ago, Politico obtained the draft decision overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion case.

""Something does feel broken,"" Blatt said. Describing her experience arguing before the court, she said, some justices ""just seem visibly frustrated.""

Important cases dot the court's calendar, beginning Tuesday. The court will take up a challenge to a Biden administration attempt to regulate hard-to-trace ""ghost guns"" that had been turning up at crime scenes in increasing numbers. The Supreme Court jumped into the case after the conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated the regulation.

Last term, conservatives voted 6-3 to strike down a gun regulation that had banned bump stocks, an accessory that allows some weapons to fire at a rate comparable to machine guns. Bump stocks were used in the nation's deadliest modern mass shooting in Las Vegas.

A day after the guns case, the justices will take up the latest twist in Oklahoma death row inmate Richard Glossip's long quest for freedom. His case is the rare instance in which prosecutors are conceding mistakes in the trial that led to Glossip's conviction and death sentence.

The highest-profile case on the agenda so far is a fight over transgender rights that is focused on state bans on gender-affirming care. It probably will be argued in December.

Republican-led states have enacted a variety of restrictions on health care for transgender people, school sports participation, bathroom usage and drag shows. The administration and Democratic-led states have extended protections for transgender people. The Supreme Court has separately prohibited the administration from enforcing a new federal regulation that seeks to protect transgender students.

The case before the high court involves a law in Tennessee that restrict puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender minors. About half the states have enacted similar restrictions.

Also on tap for the late fall is an appeal from the adult entertainment industry to overturn a Texas law that requires pornographic websites to verify the age of their users.

Only about half the court's calendar for the term has been filled, and several big cases could be added. Among those is a push by Republican-led states and conservative legal outlets to further restrict federal agencies.

The immediate target is the method the Federal Communications Commission has used to fund telephone service for rural and low-income people and broadband services for schools and libraries.

The case, which the administration has appealed to the Supreme Court, could give the justices the opportunity to revive a legal doctrine known as nondelegation that has not been used to strike down legislation in nearly 90 years. Several conservative justices have expressed support for the idea of limiting the authority Congress can delegate to federal agencies."
"Supreme Court candidates dodge, and leverage, political rhetoric",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/us-news/montana-courts-u-s-republican-party-general-news-bd83d87893ce66f70a20b9f23453572b,2024-10-04T21:25:08Z,"Judicial forums are not typically known for their entertainment. But during an hour of questions and answers at a late September forum in Great Falls, hosted by the Montana Farmers Union, the four nonpartisan candidates for the open seats on the Montana Supreme Court successfully conveyed that their races are far from boring.

Two sitting state district court judges, Katherine Bidegaray of Sidney and Dan Wilson of Kalispell, are vying for the associate justice position currently held by Justice Dirk Sandefur. In the other race, Broadwater County Attorney Cory Swanson and former federal magistrate Jeremiah ""Jerry"" Lynch, a Missoula resident raised in Butte, are facing off to replace retiring Chief Justice Mike McGrath.

None of the candidates are allowed to run as Republicans or Democrats. But that hasn't stopped political parties and special interest groups from saturating the campaign with mailers and online advertisements, as has become a tradition in Montana judicial races.

Speaking before the audience gathered in a conference room at the Great Falls International Airport, all the candidates acknowledged the charged political environment surrounding their races but stressed their commitment to judicial independence.

""We can't control who supports us, really, or what they do,"" Bidegaray said. ""We only have the ability to control ourselves.""

But while Bidegaray and her opponent, Wilson, have often tried to dispel the heated political rhetoric surrounding the judicial races, Swanson and Lynch have used it to power attacks against one another and defend their own reputations.

""This race became partisan because the Democratic Party made it partisan,"" said Swanson, referencing a national Democratic political action group that pledged to spend millions in states with competitive Supreme Court races. ""Well, they're not spending the money for me.""

During the Great Falls event and other judicial forums, Bidegaray and Wilson have tried to appeal to voters by highlighting their respective legal experience and commitments to fair and impartial rulings.

Both candidates for associate justice have spent decades as lawyers practicing in diverse settings and, most recently, as district court judges adjudicating cases ranging from child welfare to criminal violations to constitutional conflicts.

Bidgaray has been elected to her district court seat, which adjudicates issues from Dawson, Prairie, McCone, Richland and Wibaux counties, four times. Previously, she spent a decade in private practice. Wilson has been a district court judge in Flathead County since 2017 and spent the six years prior as a justice of the peace. Wilson worked as a lawyer beginning in the 1990s, first as a prosecutor and later in private practice, where his cases included criminal defense.

Each candidate has occasionally made statewide headlines for high-profile cases. Wilson gained name recognition during the first year of the COVID pandemic after he ruled against the administration of former Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock when it tried to bring a restraining order against certain businesses over masking requirements.

More recently, Bidegaray ruled that the state Department of Environmental Quality erred in issuing a permit for a company's construction of the Black Butte Mine, a copper operation that could impact a tributary that feeds into the Smith River. The Montana Supreme Court later overturned that ruling.

Recent waves of political advertisements and mailers have tried to distill each judge into a liberal or conservative frame, in part drawing on those notable rulings. The American Civil Liberties Union and Wild Montana Voter Fund have lined up behind Bidegaray, portraying her as a candidate who will uphold Montana's longstanding protections for abortion access and public lands. Alternatively, the Montana Republican State Central Committee and many elected Republicans are backing Wilson, praising him as a restrained judicial conservative with a tough-on-crime record.

In Great Falls, Bidegaray said the groups endorsing her might be reacting to her repeated pledges to defend the individual rights outlined in the Montana Constitution. Those rights, as Bidegaray has mentioned, include the right to privacy, the well-known legal foundation for Montana's access to abortion.

""I have consistently and repeatedly said that I am willing to do my part to uphold the Montana Constitution,"" Bidegaray said. ""I have taken hard cases during my tenure as a district court judge ... and have held firm to protecting people's rights.""

Wilson, meanwhile, told the audience that he does not see the state Constitution as a liberal or conservative document but rather as a clear set of instructions for judges to follow that he has no desire to manipulate.

Both candidates insisted that the political narratives about their campaigns should not undermine their credibility as nonpartisan judicial figures. In response to a question about the support he's received from the Montana Republican State Central Committee, Wilson said, ""The voters can make of it what they will.""

""The message that I have been delivering from the time I started my campaign until the present time hasn't wavered. I am for the rule of law, for judges to follow it humbly and obediently, and don't legislate from the bench,"" Wilson said. ""To the extent I am supported by any group or party, I'm grateful for the support, but it's not going to change how I approach the campaign or is not going to cause me, one bit, to change my judicial philosophy or approach.""

The contest for chief justice between Lynch and Swanson has some parallels to the race for associate justice. Progressive interest groups are backing Lynch. The Republican Party is supporting Swanson.

Other key players include Montanans for Fair Judiciary, a group affiliated with prominent conservative strategist Jake Eaton, which is backing Swanson and Wilson. Another political committee, Montanans For Fair and Impartial Courts, linked to the Montana Trial Lawyers Association, is supporting Bidegaray and Lynch.

But compared to the mostly stoic rhetoric in the race for the associate justice position, the dynamic between Lynch and Swanson is boiling.

Part of the dynamic comes from the candidates' differing professional experiences. Lynch touts his roughly 40 years as a federal court clerk, trial attorney and federal magistrate as evidence of his passion for the law and interest in defending the judiciary. Swanson, alternatively, has a shorter and more diverse background. He started in private practice in 2006 and spent three years as a registered lobbyist for a variety of private interest groups. He spent two years as a deputy attorney general under former Republican Attorney General Tim Fox and was elected Broadwater County attorney in 2014.

Perhaps because of his long track record in federal courts, Lynch doesn't shy away from the third-party depictions of him as a staunch defender of constitutional liberties. As chief justice, he has passionately said he would protect individuals from groups -- including the government -- that seek to infringe upon their rights. Among the many spelled out in the Montana Constitution, Lynch often points to rights that are linked to ongoing policy disputes: the right to public education, the right to vote, the right to a clean and healthful environment and the right to privacy.

Lynch has also promised to fight to preserve the judiciary's autonomy, criticizing the Republican-led Legislature's efforts to change laws about the judiciary and launch pronounced investigations into the Montana Supreme Court.

""They are a fair court. They decide issues according to the law. And the attack on that court right now is a political attack. It's that simple,"" Lynch said during the Great Falls forum. ""As your chief justice ... I will stand toe-to-toe to make sure the independence of the judiciary stands.""

As he pushes his vision of a doggedly independent and defensive judiciary, Lynch has attacked Swanson with allegations that the current county attorney is too closely tied to conservative interest groups and the Republican Party. Lynch points to a 2008 case in which Swanson represented Eaton, then the director of the state GOP, after the party challenged roughly 6,000 voter registrations in several Democratic-leaning counties weeks before the November election. Lynch also publicly highlights that Swanson's judicial campaign is managed by lobbyist and former GOP official Chuck Denowh.

""I think it's fair to say he's a political partisan and a hyper-partisan,"" Lynch said about Swanson during an August podcast with Whitefish business owner Ed Docter.

At other points in the interview, Lynch justified his strong critique of his opponent by pointing to the attacks Swanson's supporters have made against him. ""I entered this race thinking I would be at a high level -- and I do want to be that because I respect the judiciary so much,"" Lynch said. ""However, I'm also from Butte. When someone punches me in the mouth, I'm going to punch back.""

Butte heritage aside, Swanson has appeared to abide by the same rule of thumb. As the two candidates appear together at forums around Montana, Swanson has accused Lynch of complimenting Democrats and aligning with progressive causes.

""My opponent recently went on a podcast and endorsed Jon Tester and Tim Walz. And I don't think we should be doing that,"" Swanson said at the Great Falls forum, referring to Lynch's podcast appearance with Docter. ""So my goal is to keep this nonpartisan. And if I get elected, I will operate as a nonpartisan justice. Period.""

Lynch wagged his finger and shook his head in disagreement. In the podcast, Lynch did not explicitly endorse either Montana's Democratic U.S. senator or the Democratic Minnesota governor currently running to be vice president alongside Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. However, the former magistrate called Tester ""a magnificent human being"" and said that he appreciated Walz's down-to-earth demeanor, opining that those types of individuals ""are the people that should be in the United States Senate."" Tester is running for reelection against Republican challenger Tim Sheehy.

The state code of judicial conduct prohibits Montana judges and judicial candidates from publicly endorsing or opposing any partisan or independent candidate for public office. Swanson has not specifically mentioned that prohibition in recent public appearances, instead opting to generally criticize Lynch's disposition and tout his own ability to navigate political tensions -- including the ongoing feud between the judiciary and Republican leadership in the Legislature.

""There is a political controversy in this state that has to be navigated with wisdom, with dexterity and with humility and with some diplomacy, and then occasionally with some firmness. That's called judicial temperament,"" Swanson said. ""A certain level of that leadership and temperament must be on display at all times.""

At a Bozeman forum hosted by the Gallatin County Bar Association in late September, the day after the Great Falls event, Lynch again sought to leverage Swanson's involvement with the GOP voter registration challenge from 2008. He accused Swanson of participating in voter suppression, an effort that Lynch suggested should be disqualifying for someone running for the Supreme Court.

Swanson reflected on the case but quickly pivoted, questioning the ethical implications of walking away from a client who did something wrong.

""I represented an entity that did something stupid. And the rules of ethics, as an attorney, tell you that when your client does something stupid, you don't just run away from them and abandon them. You say, 'Okay, I'm going to represent you despite the fact that you did something stupid and help you work your way through that.' And that's what I did,"" Swanson said.

Later, Swanson returned to the topic, criticizing Lynch for using the incident to malign his reputation. Speaking to a roomful of lawyers and pre-law students, he asked whether that type of judgment is what attorneys want from a justice when they're representing a challenging client. ""Think about that,"" Swanson said.

The county attorney has used other public comments to cast Lynch as unprofessional. Swanson has taken issue with Lynch's repeated pledges to defend the Montana Supreme Court's 25-year-old precedent in Armstrong v. State, the unanimous decision that found that the state Constitution protected abortion access through the right to privacy. Lynch has said that respecting precedent is not the same as pre-judging cases that may come before the court, but rather a display of respect for the weight of past rulings.

Swanson doesn't buy it.

""Those are dog whistles. They are intentionally crafted statements to tell liberal groups how you're going to vote,"" he told Montana Free Press shortly before the Bozeman forum. ""You can't do that.""

In Great Falls, Swanson and the other candidates were explicitly asked about abortion rights and the initiative to explicitly include those protections in the Montana Constitution, CI-128. Swanson again spoke against judges and candidates forecasting their stances on future issues. He likened his approach to the tradition among some top-ranking military officials not to vote in presidential races.

""I don't go to quite that extreme, but I intend to abstain from voting on all of these policy issues because I don't want to, even internally in my own soul, have a policy preference that then I might have to deal with as a judge,"" Swanson said. If the initiative passes and is the basis of future litigation, Swanson continued, the justices should ""take our own personal view and ideology out of it and decide that case with a methodology that is fair and impartial.""

At this point, third-party groups -- including the Montana Republican State Central Committee and the American Civil Liberties Union -- have collectively invested millions in the races for the two Supreme Court seats, mostly on direct mailers and online advertisements.

The Montana Values Action Fund, helmed by liberal powerbroker Mary Stranahan, has donated hundreds of thousands to Montanans for Fair and Impartial Courts, Montanans for Liberty and Justice and Montana Senior Vote Action Fund -- all groups advocating for Lynch and Bidegaray.

In August, the national group Fair Courts America made a $200,000 donation to Montana Judicial Accountability Initiative, another political action committee tied to Eaton, its largest received donation this cycle. Fair Courts America, a federal PAC, is primarily funded by Richard Uihlein, the shipping magnate and billionaire supporter of conservative political causes. Since that donation, Montana Judicial Accountability Initiative has transferred $35,000 to Eaton's other group, Montanans for Fair Judiciary, one of the entities backing Swanson and Wilson.

Other interest group spending is more difficult to track. The national money Swanson referenced, from the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and Planned Parenthood Votes, has not made a clear mark on Montana's elections, but could very well be circulating after transfers between other political committees.

The candidates themselves continue to eschew direct affiliation with those political undercurrents and speak to voters about their individual judicial philosophies in forums around the state.

One of the next events with all four contenders is scheduled for 6 p.m., Oct. 9 in Billings, hosted by the Montana Farm Bureau at the Billings Hotel and Convention Center.

Absentee ballots are scheduled to go out on Oct. 11. The election is Tuesday, Nov. 5.

Departures in House create crucial Republican targets in the fight for majority control,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/house-elections-michigan-virginia-california-41af911c357f2c719adbd2008bfa5cdf,2024-10-04T04:16:19Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a tumultuous and unproductive session of Congress, nearly 50 House members decided either to not seek reelection or to run for a higher office this year, leaving Democratic vacancies in several tight races that could tilt control of the House to either party.

Both Republicans and Democrats have had their fair share of turnover -- with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a Republican, the most prominent -- but Democrats are also losing prodigious fundraisers who have successfully held off GOP challengers in recent years. With fierce competition raging over just a couple dozen seats, that's left Democrats relying on fresh faces to hold their ground, while Republicans sense openings in four races in Virginia, Michigan and California.

The GOP is sending resources and trying to neutralize the issue of abortion access in those districts, hoping to go on offense to hold onto a slim majority. The party is running with candidates who have previously come up short in bids to unseat Democrats, but are now optimistic they can build on campaign experience and fare better when they don't face an incumbent.

Democrats, riding on a windfall of campaign donations and voters motivated by reproductive rights, are tapping candidates with track records in office. Most of them are state lawmakers who already have legislative accomplishments, relationships with voters and experience campaigning.

Regardless, it will be a tough task to make up the fundraising hauls and political skills of the prominent Democrats in the three states.

Democratic Reps. Katie Porter of California, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, and Elissa Slotkin and Dan Kildee, both of Michigan, raked in a combined fundraising total of over $50 million in the last election cycle. Slotkin, Spanberger and Porter all entered Congress in 2018 as part of a wave of female lawmakers who flipped seats and delivered House control to Democrats.

They all have set their sights on higher offices: Slotkin is running for Michigan's Senate seat, Spanberger is running for Virginia governor next year, while Porter fell short in a bid for Senate earlier this year.

Meanwhile, Kildee decided not to run for a sixth term after a bout with cancer last year.

Here's how the races to replace them are playing out:

Central Michigan has been represented by either Kildee or his uncle, former Rep. Dale Kildee, for almost five decades. And Kildee said it's important to him that he hands his seat off to a Democrat.

""It's a lot easier to leave knowing we have a chance to hold the seat,"" he said.

But Paul Junge, a Republican who lost to Kildee in 2022, said Kildee's retirement also made his decision to run again much easier.

""Incumbency is powerful for a reason. People know the name. They feel like they know that representative,"" said Junge, who is a former prosecutor and TV anchor. ""This time I don't face that. And in fact, for me, as a second-time candidate in this district, I was reaching out to people who already knew me.""

Junge also chalks up 2022 as a difficult year for Republicans in Michigan because voters were coming out to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution as well as reelect a popular Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer. He has self-financed his campaign, pushing him towards a cash advantage this year.

So Junge has crisscrossed the district in his Ford F-150, working to win over the union members and blue-collar workers who once made Michigan a blue wall of support for Democrats, but who have slipped towards Republicans in recent years.

Still, Democrats are pointing out that Junge has spent most of his life outside the Michigan district, calling him a ""carpetbagger."" Democrat Kristen McDonald Rivet, a state senator, is talking up her working-class roots and experience raising six children in the community.

Rivet described herself as a ""moderate"" and pointed to her time in the legislature championing tax credits for families with children.

""I believe that when we're looking at policy, we have to prioritize middle-class families, working-class families,"" she said.

Rivet is also pushing Junge on abortion, pointing in TV ads to his opposition to abortion rights. Junge has responded that he would not support a federal abortion ban.

In another central Michigan race, Democrats are also tapping a state lawmaker to try to hold what is now Slotkin's seat.

""In terms of abortion, I think it will always be an incredibly important issue because it's a matter of personal freedom. That's not going to change,"" said Curtis Hertel Jr., who served four terms as a state senator before working in Whitmer's administration.

He's facing a former statehouse colleague. Tom Barrett, who previously served in the state senate, is running for the seat again after losing to Slotkin by 5 points in 2022. Barrett was heavily outspent that year, but so far has been able to keep a closer pace to Hertel's fundraising this year.

Barrett argued that a host of problems -- illegal immigration, a cost of living crisis, crime in Lansing, the district's largest city, as well as global threats -- have only grown in the last two years.

""I feel like there's unfinished business there,"" he said.

Barrett hasn't backed away from his record of supporting abortion restrictions in the statehouse, saying he is ""pro-life,"" but he also described abortion access as a settled issue in Michigan.

The closely watched House races to replace Spanberger is playing out in northern Virginia between two Army veterans and lawyers: Democrat Eugene Vindman and Republican Derrick Anderson.

Vindman, promising to work to restore abortion rights that were in place under Roe v. Wade, has proven to be a prodigious fundraiser and is on track to surpass Spanberger's 2022 totals, giving him the advantage of early advertising. He and his twin brother, Alexander Vindman, played major roles in former President Donald Trump's first impeachment.

Anderson, whose campaign did not grant an interview, is emphasizing his background in the Army special forces and trying to present a gentler profile on abortion rights and economic issues. However, Anderson, who is engaged to be married, raised eyebrows for posing with a friend's wife and three daughters in a campaign photo shoot that could be mistaken for a family photo.

On the West Coast, Republicans are trying to go on the offensive against Dave Min, the Democratic state senator whom Porter recruited to fill her seat. The GOP's super PAC, the Congressional Leadership Fund, launched an ad this week criticizing his support for criminal justice changes in California's State Assembly.

Republican Scott Baugh, a former chair of the Orange County GOP, ticked off a list of local violent crimes, saying Democrats were to blame for an ""overall concern that we are less safe than we were four years ago.""

He was heavily outspent by Porter in 2022, but said this year the ""spending won't be quite as lopsided.""

Min pointed out that he has the endorsement of the Los Angeles police union and has a history in the State Assembly of advocating for immigrants, who make up a large portion of the district.

He also has a fundraising advantage, but said he is still campaigning with the mentality that the election ""could be decided by a few hundred votes and potentially could decide control of Congress."""
Abortion-rights groups are outraising opponents 8-to-1 on November ballot measures,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ballot-measures-fundraising-florida-arizona-39f0cac3078fffcf94196710c50865ec,2024-10-04T04:12:03Z,"Abortion-rights ballot measure supporters across the country have raised nearly eight times as much as groups campaigning against the amendments on the November ballots. But that advantage may not translate into a huge benefit down the stretch in Florida, the most expensive of the nine statewide campaigns to enshrine abortion rights into state constitutions.

So far, campaign finance data compiled by the watchdog group Open Secrets and analyzed by The Associated Press tells a similar story in most of those states: Amendment backers have raised multiple times as much money and have far more donors, bringing in nearly $108 million compared to $14 million for their opponents as of reports aggregated by Tuesday. Still, it's not a sure thing that will mean more spending to promote the measures in every state in the final weeks before the Nov. 5 elections.

""The apparent differential on campaign finance reports does nothing to reassure me that we will not see large, late spending on these campaigns,"" said Kelly Hall, executive director of The Fairness Project, which is providing money and other support for abortion rights groups in several of the campaigns.

The measures would roll back restrictions in some states and enshrine protections into the constitutions in others after the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling overturning Roe v. Wade. Most GOP-controlled states implemented bans or restrictions after the ruling. Most Democratic-controlled ones offered some protections for abortion access.

The ballot measures could also drive voter turnout in the elections.

Campaigns that raise more money have an edge reaching voters with ads on TV, radio and websites, along with mailers and yard signs and more organizing power for door-knocking and other efforts.

That's evident so far in Missouri and Montana, where big funding advantages have translated into far more ad buys, according to data collected by the media tracking firm AdImpact.

In Missouri, the Open Secrets data shows abortion rights groups have raised more than $5 million, and state filings reflect millions more in contributions, including $1 million from former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The giving has fueled over $11 million in ad spending supporting a measure that would overturn the state's ban compared with less than $50,000 opposing it.

In Montana, pro-amendment groups lead in ad spending, with more than $11 million compared to under $50,000 for opponents.

There hasn't been as much ad activity so far in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Nevada or South Dakota. In Nebraska, abortion opponents have raised slightly less money but have spent slightly more on ad buys. Contribution totals don't have to be reported in Nevada or South Dakota until later this month.

Supporters of the ballot measures also have some costs that opponents don't.

Getting most of the abortion questions on the ballots required signature drives, which are a major cost for their sponsors. And with most of the questions, there were legal battles over whether ballot requirements were met. Paying lawyers in those battles often falls to the groups behind the campaigns, reducing how much of the money they raise is available for reaching voters.

The costs of legal challenges often do not eat into their opponents' fundraising the same way.

The Thomas More Society, for instance, challenged initiatives in Missouri and Nebraska. The group is not required to file campaign finance reports.

And in Florida, the state attorney general challenged that state's measure, shifting legal expenses to taxpayers.

Florida's race has some other unique wrinkles.

For one, adopting the measure requires approval from 60% of voters, compared to lesser thresholds needed in other states.

If approved, Florida's amendment would make abortions legal until the fetus is viable, or when necessary to protect the patient's health, as determined by a health care provider. Florida currently bans most abortions after six weeks, with some exceptions.

Abortion rights groups have reported raising more than $60 million and opponents $9 million. But that does not reflect all of the spending.

The state Republican Party has aired commercials urging voters to defeat the amendment. AdImpact data shows the GOP has spent $9.6 million running TV and online ads. That's about half the $20.7 million bought by groups backing the amendment. But using an industry calculation for how many people see TV ads, it puts the ballot measure's opponents ahead.

Even that spending doesn't include another boost for the argument that the amendment goes too far. A state government website states, ""Amendment 4 threatens women's safety."" Advocates sued last month to stop the taxpayer-funded messaging. A judge ruled Monday that the website could remain up.

Peter Northcutt, director for state strategies at National Right to Life, portrays the anti-abortion movement as an underdog up against funding from those with a financial interest in abortion.

""The abortion industry and their allies bring massive funds to the table,"" he said. ""Those who are trying to fight off these extreme amendments have an uphill climb.""

Planned Parenthood Federation of America and some of its regional affiliates are among those who have kicked in more than $1 million to support the amendments. But the biggest donor so far is Marsha Zlatin Laufer, a frequent contributor to liberal causes. She's given more than $9 million in Florida.

Other abortion-rights groups that have given more than $1 million in multiple states include the Sixteen Thirty Fund, The Fairness Project and Advocacy Action Fund, which aren't required to disclose their donors, as well as the George Soros-connected Open Society Action Fund.

Nationally, the abortion rights side also has far more donors: More than 94,000 to fewer than 2,600.

On the opposing side, the big individual contributors are U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, a Nebraska Republican, and his mother, Marlene Ricketts. Each of them has given at least $1 million in Nebraska. Nebraska is the one state where campaign finance filings show the two sides have raised similar amounts of money, with both between $3 million and $4 million.

There's a reason for that: Nebraska has competing ballot measures. One would expand access to abortion and the other would enshrine the current ban on most abortions after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.

The fundraising gap is partly explained by the fact that two big national organizations that together spent about $40 million trying to defeat a similar campaign last year in Ohio have not gotten heavily involved in campaign funding this year.

One is The Concord Fund, which spent more than $25 million in Ohio last year - more than 40% of the total in opposition to the amendment. Like abortion-related ballot measures in six other states since 2022, the abortion-rights side prevailed.

The group, formerly known as the Judicial Crisis Network, is part of a network of political groups centered around Leonard Leo, a prominent conservative legal activist and driving force in securing nominations of conservative Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade.

The other is Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, which contributed nearly $15 million in Ohio last year. The group said it planned to raise $92 million for political campaigns this year, but the focus was not on abortion-related measures. Instead, it said it would prioritize helping Republicans win the presidency and Congress.

Neither organization commented for this article."
"Melania Trump says she supports abortion rights, putting her at odds with the GOP",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/melania-trump-harris-abortion-election-2024-vance-walz-a9a44cf9d3113eb55e8c4346c7e1fe59,2024-10-03T18:10:42Z,"CHICAGO (AP) -- Melania Trump revealed her support for abortion rights Thursday ahead of the release of her upcoming memoir, exposing a stark contrast with her husband, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, on the crucial election issue.

In a video posted to her X account Thursday morning, the former first lady defended women's ""individual freedoms"" to do what they want with their body -- a position at odds with much of the Republican Party and her own husband, who has struggled to find a consistent message on abortion while wedged between anti-abortion supporters within his base and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights.

""Individual freedom is a fundamental principle that I safeguard,"" she said in the video. ""Without a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth: individual freedom. What does 'my body, my choice' really mean?""

The video appears to confirm excerpts of her self-titled memoir reported by The Guardian on Wednesday.

Melania Trump has rarely publicly expressed her personal political views and has been largely absent from the campaign trail. But in her memoir, set to be released publicly next Tuesday, she argues that the decision to end a pregnancy should be left to a woman and her doctor, ""free from any intervention of pressure from the government,"" according to the published excerpts.

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?"" she wrote, according to The Guardian. ""A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.""

Melania Trump writes that she has ""carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

These views contrast sharply with the GOP's anti-abortion platform and with Donald Trump, who has repeatedly taken credit for appointing the three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade and boasted about returning the abortion question to the states. Democrats have blamed the former president for the severe deterioration of reproductive rights as abortion bans were implemented in large swaths of the country following the overturning of the landmark case, which had granted a constitutional right to abortion.

Vice President Kamala Harris ' campaign noted Trump's role in ending Roe v. Wade in a statement reacting to Melania Trump's defense of abortion rights.

""Sadly for the women across America, Mrs. Trump's husband firmly disagrees with her and is the reason that more than one in three American women live under a Trump Abortion Ban that threatens their health, their freedom, and their lives,"" Harris campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement. ""Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear: If he wins in November, he will ban abortion nationwide, punish women, and restrict women's access to reproductive health care.""

Donald Trump on Tuesday said he would veto a federal abortion ban, the first time he has explicitly said so after previously refusing to answer questions on the subject. Abortion rights advocates are skeptical, however, saying Trump cannot be trusted not to restrict reproductive rights.

Trump's campaign did not respond to a request for comment Thursday about Melania Trump's book or video.

Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said the memoir is another example of ""the Trumps playing voters like a fiddle.""

""As president, (Trump) made it his mission to get Roe v. Wade overturned,"" she said in a statement. ""Melania stood by him, never once publicly disavowing his actions until weeks before an election where our bodies are again on the ballot and they are losing voters to this issue. Read between the lines.""

Democratic strategist Brittany Crampsie called the memoir's release a ""clear attempt to appeal to more moderate voters and to moderate JD Vance's very clearly extreme views on the issue."" But she is skeptical that the move would work in favor of Trump, saying his shifting views ""have already confused voters and sowed distrust.""

Melania Trump also defends abortions later in pregnancy, asserting that ""most abortions conducted during the later stages of pregnancy were the result of severe fetal abnormalities that probably would have led to the death or stillbirth of the child. Perhaps even the death of the mother.""

""These cases were extremely rare and typically occurred after several consultations between the woman and her doctor,"" she writes.

These views appear diametrically opposed to her husband, who has often parroted misinformation about abortions later in pregnancy, falsely claiming that Democrats support abortion ""after birth,"" though infanticide is outlawed in every state.

Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law who focuses on reproductive rights law and history, said it is unclear if the memoir's release so close to the election was an attempt to help Donald Trump. But she did note that Melania Trump's split from Trump on the issue is not uncommon historically.

There is ""a pretty deep history of first ladies being more supportive of abortion rights than their husbands,"" including Betty Ford, a vocal abortion rights supporter and the wife of former President Gerald Ford, Ziegler said.

Donald Trump promoted his wife's book at a September rally in New York, calling on supporters to ""go out and get her book."" It is unclear if the former president has read the book.

""Go out and buy it,"" he told the crowd. ""It's great. And if she says bad things about me, I'll call you all up, and I'll say, 'Don't buy it.'""

Influential prophesizing pastors believe reelecting Trump is a win in the war of angels and demons,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/conservative-christians-spiritual-warfare-donald-trump-kamala-harris-9c861aa7c58907ff67bde3c3499a9365,2024-10-03T12:13:32Z,"COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) -- Thousands sang, cheered and prayed as multiple preachers declared Donald Trump to be God's favored candidate to defeat what one called the ""forces of darkness.""

Headliners denounced Democrat Kamala Harris -- Trump's campaign rival -- as influenced by demons and the spirit of the wicked biblical queen Jezebel.

Attendees stood and recited in unison a ""Watchman Decree,"" invoking a government that honors God and has ""righteous"" laws and ""biblical"" judicial rulings. They pledged to ""take back and permanently control"" positions of leadership in sectors such as government, business and culture.

""We break every curse against Donald Trump -- we break every satanic incantation against his presidency,"" declared the host preacher, Hank Kunneman, at the annual Opening the Heavens conference, held in mid-September at the Mid-America Center arena in Council Bluffs.

The conference is one of several of its type around the country this election year, featuring exuberant worship and speeches by influential preachers. It represents a highly politicized wing of charismatic Christianity, a larger movement that emphasizes spiritual gifts such as healings, prophecy and speaking in tongues.

As a sign of this movement's influence, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance appeared recently at a similar conference, called the Courage Tour, in Pennsylvania.

Goals for the conference included getting out the vote for Trump and his allies, and mobilizing believers to pray and take part in what's proclaimed to be a literal spiritual war surrounding the election.

""Get your butt out there and vote. Get your voice and raise it!"" declared Kunneman, who pastors Lord of Hosts Church in nearby Omaha, Nebraska, with his wife, Brenda. ""Let every devil fall. ... We push back any attempt to steal the executive office.""

The conference emerges from a movement that emphasizes authoritative direction from leaders considered to be modern-day apostles and prophets. It also incorporated Christian nationalism, a fusion of American and Christian identity.

Critics view the movement with alarm, seeing it as anti-democratic and supporting a candidate with authoritarian ambitions and incendiary rhetoric. Many of its leaders rallied behind Trump's claims that the 2020 election was stolen despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

""The attitude coming into 2024 is, 'The demons are probably going to try to steal this election again, and so we need to do spiritual warfare in advance to prevent that,'"" said Matthew Taylor, author of the new book on the movement, ""The Violent Take It By Force: The Christian Movement That Is Threatening Our Democracy.""

""It's very hard to have a pluralistic democracy,"" Taylor said, when many distrust the electoral system.

Several leaders in this movement were present at rallies in Washington protesting Biden's presidential victory before and on Jan. 6, 2021, said Taylor.

Leaders weren't among the Capitol rioters, but some issued decrees and prayers that the certification of Biden's win be blocked and Trump returned for a second term.

Such ideology ""is one of those golden threads"" in the social media feeds of many participants of the Jan. 6 rallies, said Taylor, Protestant scholar at the Baltimore-based Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies.

Headliners at the Council Bluffs conference repeatedly spoke of being in a true spiritual war, merging decrees of political victory and Christian revival.

The ""favor of the Lord"" is on Trump, said one preacher, Dutch Sheets. ""America is going to be saved, and I believe this election is a part of it.""

His brother and fellow preacher, Tim Sheets, recounted seeing a vision of a warrior angel firing an arrow that landed in front of the White House, claiming the territory for God.

""We must move into battle for the Lord,"" he said. ""The drums of spiritual war are beating.""

Preachers repeatedly denounced abortion -- one described it as an outpouring of blood craved by demons -- and the ""mutilation"" of children, as they depicted gender-affirming treatment for transgender youths.

The arena appeared a little more than half full, with thousands of attendees from multiple states. Many wore T-shirts with slogans like, ""Defender of Territory"" and ""We the People Trust Jesus,"" while several bundled up with American flag-themed fleece blankets amid chilly air conditioning.

Participants at the Council Bluffs conference, mostly but not exclusively white, aligned with the larger evangelical Christian support of Trump.

About 8 in 10 white evangelicals supported Trump in 2020, according to AP VoteCast. Pew Research Center's validated voter survey found similar support levels in 2016.

This year, about 7 in 10 white evangelical Protestants view the Republican nominee favorably, an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey found.

Behind that supermajority is a diverse evangelicalism. The charismatic exuberance and focus on the supernatural contrast in tone with the relatively restrained approach of groups such as Southern Baptists, though they have allied in their political conservatism and opposition to abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.

And the charismatic movement has its own diversity. This heavily politicized branch teaches that in the present day, God has re-established the ancient biblical roles of apostle -- an authoritative leader -- and prophet, someone issuing divine proclamations.

The movement isn't a denomination. Churches and ministries largely operate independently, even as its leaders speak at each others' conferences, endorse each others' books and appear on each others' broadcasts.

As one example of the overlap: The Opening the Heavens conference in Council Bluffs featured one segment called FlashPoint Live -- an in-person version of a television show that mixes charismatic Christianity and conservative politics. It's one of several such FlashPoint Live conferences this year, hosted by pastor Gene Bailey -- whose recent interview with Trump demonstrated the close ties between the movement and the former president.

The ReAwaken America tour, started by Trump's former national security advisor Michael Flynn, has similarly blended the political with revival-like rallies and featured members of Trump's family.

While a range of evangelicals served as Trump's faith-based advisors during his administration, charismatic leaders were especially prominent.

The apostles-and-prophets movement overlaps with two related, popular ideas: dominionism, which says Christians are to be in charge of society, and the ""Seven Mountain Mandate,"" which specifies seven areas where Christians are to lead -- politics, religion, media, business, family, education and the arts and entertainment.

Bailey led in the reciting of the Watchman Decree at Council Bluffs, which included a pledge to ""permanently control positions of influence and leadership in each of the seven mountains.""

Bailey and Kunneman declined interview requests through a media representative.

Taylor said that according to this strand of charismatic theology, Holy Spirit-filled Christians have the power not just to ask God for results but to speak them into being.

""It's not just spouting off or praying prayers,"" he said. ""They believe that they are changing reality with these Watchman Decrees.""

He added: ""It looks wild when you encounter it, but it is very popular, and it's very dangerous.""

Separate from the Council Bluffs conference organizers, but with an overlapping cast of speakers, is the Courage Tour. It's led by Lance Wallnau, who popularized the Seven Mountain concept and was an early booster of Trump's 2016 candidacy.

The tour has been held in crucial battleground states, mixing worship, prayers for miraculous healings and overt politics -- including a call for Christians to become election workers or poll watchers to ""fight the fraud"" in swing states.

Taylor said this appears to lay groundwork for a campaign to delegitimize the 2024 election results if Harris wins.

While movement leaders speak of spiritual warfare -- that is, angel vs. demon rather than human vs. human -- Taylor said such rhetoric can stoke some people into taking matters into their own hands.

He said it's no surprise that some rioters at the Capitol in 2021 were loudly praying and displaying Christian symbols.

""I really do worry that we could see a lot more political violence,"" he said.

Anti-abortion leaders undeterred as Trump for the first time says he'd veto a federal abortion ban,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-vance-walz-debate-2024-election-abortion-64c739e99ffa1ad51b973e420e1fe92d,2024-10-02T20:55:36Z,"CHICAGO (AP) -- Anti-abortion leaders said Wednesday that they're undeterred after Donald Trump said he would veto a federal abortion ban, the first time he has explicitly said so after previously refusing to answer questions on the subject.

During Tuesday night's vice presidential debate, the Republican presidential nominee posted on his social media platform Truth Social that ""everyone knows I would not support a federal abortion ban, under any circumstances, and would, in fact, veto it.""

He then said that abortion rights should be left up to the states -- his most common response to questions about the issue since Roe v. Wade was overturned by a conservative majority that included three of Trump's own appointees to the Supreme Court. In the two years since the ruling, abortion rights have emerged as a major vulnerability for the GOP, which has struggled to find a consistent message on the path forward, while driving turnout for Democrats.

With the election less than five weeks away, Trump has been trying to thread a divide between his own base of anti-abortion supporters and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights. The former president is trying to make up ground with women -- a group that views Democratic nominee Kamala Harris more favorably nationally -- in the handful of battleground states that will likely determine the winner.

""Trump's statement last night is just one more example of Republicans trying desperately to rebrand themselves on the issue of abortion,"" said Ryan Stitzlein, vice president of political and government relations at the national abortion rights organization Reproductive Freedom for All. ""But at the end of the day, the only thing that has actually changed is their rhetoric on the issue. It's their reaction to seeing the political consequences for this deeply unpopular policy position.""

Major anti-abortion groups, while voicing disagreement with Trump, said they weren't discouraged by his latest comments on a national abortion ban.

Kristan Hawkins, president of the national anti-abortion Students for Life of America, said, ""There are differing approaches in the pro-life movement on how best to achieve our goal.""

""Donald Trump has his own strategy to get the federal government out of the business of abortion,"" she said. ""We might disagree with him about the long-term goals of our movement, but in the short term, we can work with that direction.""

Hawkins added that there are other avenues Trump could use to restrict abortion nationally, including through defunding Planned Parenthood and appointing anti-abortion officials to lead major federal departments.

Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, said she wasn't surprised by Trump's remarks.

""But quite frankly, unless something really unusual happens in this election, neither side is going to have the votes in Congress to pass a national law,"" she said. ""So that wasn't really at the top of our list anyway.""

Angela Vasquez-Giroux, vice president of communications for Planned Parenthood Votes, meanwhile, said she doesn't believe Trump's vow to veto a national abortion ban, calling him ""a legendary flip-flopper who says whatever he thinks helps him most in that moment."" She said that even without a national abortion ban, Trump would be able to restrict abortion across the country by appointing anti-abortion judges and federal officials or reviving the Comstock Act, a 19th-century ""anti-vice"" law that abortion rights advocates say could imperil access to medication abortion.

Trump had not previously said whether he would veto a national ban. In fact, he repeatedly declined to say if he would veto such a ban during September's presidential debate with Harris, although it is extremely unlikely that either political party would be able to win enough votes in Congress to pass national abortion legislation.

In August, Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, said the former president would veto a national ban. But Trump demurred on the subject during the September debate, saying, ""I didn't discuss it with JD.""

The question has since lingered amid Trump's shifting stances on the crucial issue.

Trump senior adviser Jason Miller on Tuesday rejected the idea that Trump had changed his position on the matter.

""President Trump made clear, which he's said all along, it should be back in the states,"" he told reporters after the debate. ""Nothing changed. He's always said it should be back in the states.""

Vance falsely claimed during Tuesday's debate that he never supported a national ban himself, though he said in 2022 that he ""certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally"" and supported Sen. Lindsey Graham's proposal to impose a national ban on abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy. In 2023, he voiced support for a ""minimum national standard"" for abortion, including at 15 weeks of pregnancy.

Republicans have been accused of attempting to recast federal abortion restrictions as ""minimum national standards"" in order to distort their own stances on the issue amid the political unpopularity of the GOP's position on abortion.

""It doesn't matter what they call it,"" Vasquez-Giroux said. ""What matters is how it's going to impact everyone that we know and love and care about. If you call it a limit or a ban, it's the same thing, and everyday people will suffer.""

Around 6 in 10 Americans think their state should generally allow a person to obtain a legal abortion if they don't want to be pregnant for any reason, according to a July poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Voters in seven states, including conservative-leaning Kentucky, Montana and Ohio, have either protected abortion rights or defeated attempts to restrict them in statewide votes over the past two years.

Harris' campaign, meanwhile, has maintained that Trump would sign a national abortion ban if reelected and blamed him for the abortion restrictions in swaths of the country since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, which once granted a constitutional right to abortion.

Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing the three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade and boasted about returning the abortion question to the states. But voters don't have a direct say through citizen initiatives in about half of states, and in states that will have abortion on the ballot this year, anti-abortion groups and their Republican allies are using a wide array of strategies to counter proposed ballot initiatives.

"Figures, Dobson clash in congressional debate",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/alabama-congress-figures-dobson-election-debate-d7450f75e79ae2c3667e08d67c3dac8c,2024-10-02T20:53:24Z,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Congressional hopefuls Shomari Figures and Caroleene Dobson clashed in a debate Wednesday punctuated by policy differences and verbal swipes at each other's resume.

Figures, a Democrat, and Dobson, a Republican are running to represent Alabama's 2nd Congressional District, which was redrawn after a lengthy redistricting battle. The two faced off in Montgomery in a candidate forum hosted by the Montgomery Chamber of Commerce and broadcast online by WSFA.

Dobson attacked Figures, who worked in the Obama White House and as a former top aide to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, over his background in the nation's capital. Figures said his opponent was opting for a ""photo-op"" over meaningful solutions.

Dobson repeatedly called Figures a ""Washington D.C. insider"" and said he was ""part of an administration that for the past four years crushed American opportunity.""

""He wants to continue the policies of the last four years, but you and I should ask ourselves: Are we better off than we were four years ago?"" Dobson said.

Figures, speaking after the forum, said he does not ""run from the fact"" that most of his professional career was spent in Washington. Nonetheless, he said, Alabama is his home. ""The root of it is: This is home for me. This where I was born, where I was raised,"" Figures said.

He added that he is the son of two Alabama legislators and grew up in Mobile.

Dobson has made border security, a cornerstone of her campaign. Figures referred to a campaign trip that Dobson took to the Mexico border to highlight immigration issues as a ""photo-op"" while saying he has been at the border ""as a staffer"" to work on legislation to provide more resources to border agents.

""My opponent mentions the border, but what she fails to mention about the border is that in her early legal career, she spent time in Texas actually selling millions of acres of our border state land in Texas to shadow companies owned by Mexican investors,"" Figures said.

Dobson responded that the transaction involved a Mexican company that was buying office space in Texas as it fled the drug cartel crisis in Mexico. She said Figures was part of the transition team for the Biden administration that ""flung open our borders and has resulted in less safe communities.""

Alabama's 2nd Congressional District was redrawn after the U.S. Supreme Court agreed Alabama had likely illegally diluted the influence of Black voters when drawing congressional lines. A three-judge panel selected new lines to give Black residents¬∏ who now make up nearly 49% of the district's voting-age population, an ""opportunity"" to elect a candidate of their choice.

The open seat has sparked a heated race for the district that could help decide control of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Some of the sharpest policy contrasts were over abortion and healthcare.

""I do not believe it is the government's role to tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her body. I think it's pretty simple. If you don't believe in abortion, if you don't want an abortion, don't have one,"" Figures said.

Dobson described herself as ""pro-life"" but said the issue should be left to the states.

""This is an issue that's best left to state legislatures to decide with compassion and common sense,"" Dobson said.

Dobson said she supports exemptions to abortion bans for rape, incest and for a pregnant woman's health. Alabama's abortion ban does not have exemptions for rape and incest.

Both candidates spoke of the need to address infrastructure and healthcare challenges in the district.

Figures said four rural hospitals have closed in the district since the campaign began, and life expectancy in Alabama lags most of the nation. Figures urged Alabama to expand its Medicaid program to cover more low-income people who he said are often working jobs but don't have access to health insurance. He said he would support legislation that would renew financial incentives to holdout states to expand their programs. Alabama is one of 10 states that did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

""In the state of Alabama, you are just barely expected to live past your 60s, your 60s. That is unacceptable, and for too many people. That is because of lack of health care earlier in life,"" Figures said.

Dobson said she would encourage state officials to ""examine"" the issue of Medicaid expansion but said that inflation is helping to drive healthcare costs.

""We also have to recognize that the best insurance is the one that you get through your job. So, we need to create more jobs to allow people to have private insurance that is going to pay those reimbursements to keep our rural hospitals open,"" Dobson said.

The two candidates will meet again on Oct. 10 in an online debate hosted by al.com."
Georgia attorney general appeals a judge's rollback of abortion ban,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/georgia-abortion-ban-overturned-appeal-38c9c945ad76647223b7252806e14319,2024-10-02T14:25:07Z,"ATLANTA (AP) -- Georgia's Republican attorney general has appealed a judge's ruling that struck down the state's abortion ban.

Attorney General Chris Carr's office is asking the Georgia Supreme Court to reinstate the law banning most abortions after the first six weeks or so of pregnancy while the court considers the state's appeal.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled Monday that the ban in place since 2022 violated women's rights to liberty and privacy under Georgia's state constitution. His decision rolled back abortion limits in the state to a prior law that allowed abortions until viability, roughly 22 to 24 weeks into a pregnancy.

Some Georgia clinic officials said they would begin accepting patients whose pregnancies are past six weeks' gestation, though they're aware the ban could be reimposed quickly.

Carr's office noted in its notice of appeal filed Tuesday that the case goes straight to Georgia's highest court because it involves a challenge to the constitutionality of a state law.

The judge's ruling left 13 U.S. states with bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy and three that bar them after the first six weeks or so of pregnancy."
Fact-check fight: CBS News cuts candidates' mics after JD Vance objects to a moderator's correction,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/debate-cbs-vance-walz-fact-check-639ceab0831b4c304fb132bcf254e48a,2024-10-02T04:41:25Z,"CBS News briefly cut off the microphones of vice presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz during an exchange in their debate Tuesday when the Republican objected to an attempt by moderator Margaret Brennan to correct something he said about immigration.

It was one of the evening's more contentious moments and reminded viewers again of the difficulty that the news outlets organizing debates this political season are facing in trying to point out in real time statements that are misleading or untrue.

After Vance had talked about illegal immigrants overwhelming some American cities like Springfield, Ohio, Brennan interjected that the Haitians that had moved to that city were there legally.

""Since you're fact-checking me, it's important to say what is actually going on,"" Vance said.

After briefly letting Vance speak, Brennan interrupted him and said it was time to move on to other issues. They spoke over each other, until CBS News muted the microphones of both Vance and Walz, who were appearing at a studio in New York City.

""Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Brennan said.

Prior to the debate, CBS News had said it would be up to the two candidates -- not moderators Brennan and Norah O'Donnell -- to fact-check each other and the journalists would encourage them to do so. Vance said that it appeared CBS News was breaking the rules it had set down.

Fact-checking was an issue during last month's debate between presidential contenders Donald Trump and Kamala Harris after moderators corrected Trump at least four times, angering the former president and his supporters. When Trump debated President Joe Biden last spring, CNN moderators did not attempt any on-air corrections.

In an echo of what followed the ABC debate, Trump posted on his Truth Social site during Tuesday's debate that ""both young ladies have been extremely biased Anchors!""

At one other point Tuesday, wrapping up a discussion about climate change, O'Donnell said it was the overwhelming consensus of scientists that the planet was warming. Earlier, she had asked Vance whether or not he agreed with his running mate's comment that climate change was a hoax.

There were points at which the moderators sought to encourage the candidates to police each other. During a discussion about whether illegal migration was driving up housing costs, Brennan said to Walz, ""I do want to let you respond to the allegation that the vice president is letting in migrants.""

Yet it was a discussion about abortion that most illustrated the difficulties of that approach, and how there is no easy way during a live debate to make sure viewers are getting accurate information. Vance cited a provision in a Minnesota law, where Walz is governor.

""As I read Minnesota law, it says that a doctor that presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide life-saving care,"" Vance said.

Vance called that ""fundamentally barbaric,"" while Walz said his opponent's interpretation of the law was untrue.

What did the law actually say? That was unclear, and viewers were left to decide which candidate they wanted to believe. The CBS moderators cut to a commercial, unable or unwilling to clarify the question.

Throughout the debate, CBS News ran on its screen a message that viewers could log onto its ""CBS News Confirmed"" website to read about claims in the debate that were untrue or misleading. At some points, the network even showed a code that enabled viewers to instantly call up the information on their mobile phones. Yet those entreaties were not shown on the screens of other networks that simulcast the debate, which was produced by CBS.

The debate may have represented the last chance for viewers to see representatives of the two presidential campaigns duke it out onscreen. Harris has called for a second debate between her and Trump, but the Republican candidate has not accepted the challenge.

FACT FOCUS: A look at false and misleading claims during the vice presidential debate,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/debate-walz-vance-misinformation-fact-check-a3f67b1fdef425038dfac9267861247c,2024-10-02T04:13:45Z,"The vice presidential candidates, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, on Tuesday engaged in a fast-moving, largely civil debate on a wide range of issues. Here's a look at some false and misleading claims from the debate.

___

VANCE: ""Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration. What do they use that money for? They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching against our allies.""

THE FACTS: The Biden administration agreed last year to unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian assets as part of a deal to free five U.S. citizens being held by Iran. But administration officials say not a dollar of that has yet been given to Iran. It was part of a deal negotiated by the Obama administration, before Biden and Harris took office, that could have allowed Iran to access frozen assets in exchange for accepting limits on its nuclear program.

In 2016, Iran said it had received access to more than $100 billion worth of frozen overseas assets following the implementation of a landmark nuclear deal with world powers. The money had been held in banks in China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey since international sanctions were tightened in 2012 over Tehran's nuclear program. Then-Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew told Congress that only about $50 billion of the frozen assets would actually be accessible by Iran.

WALZ: ""They were charging $800 before this law went into effect.""

THE FACTS: Walz overstated how much Americans were paying for insulin before a new law capped prices at $35 per month for millions of older Americans on Medicare. A December 2022 study found that people who were on Medicare or enrolled in private insurance paid $452 yearly on average before the new law took effect.

VANCE: ""You've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.""

THE FACTS: Most economists blame a long-term decline in the housing supply for the steady increase in home prices. The number of new homes under construction plunged from an annual pace of 1.4 million in April 2006 to barely above 400,000 in August 2011, and didn't recover to 2006 levels until 2021.

Vance said at least one prominent economic analysis from the Federal Reserve supports his claims that immigrants are pushing up housing costs, but he didn't provide details. He was likely citing a May 2024 blog post by Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Kashkari says immigration's long-run effect on inflation is ""unclear,"" but immigrants need a place to live and their arrival has overlapped with higher prices.

There might be upward pressure on home prices in some markets because of immigrants arriving, but most economists say the issue is a lack of supply of homes on the market. Homebuilders say they need the immigrants to build the homes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a September news conference that high mortgage rates mean people aren't listing their homes for sale and there has not been enough supply.

WALZ: ""Their Project 2025 is going to have a registry of pregnancies.""

THE FACTS: That's not true. The conservative initiative calls for the collection of ""accurate and reliable statistical data about abortion, abortion survivors, and abortion-related maternal deaths,"" but not a record of every pregnancy that occurs.

More specifically, Project 2025 proposes that the Department of Health and Human Services require all states to report detailed information about abortions that are performed within their borders, including the total number of abortions, the age and state of residence of the mother, the gestational age of the fetus, the reason for the abortion and the method used to perform the abortion. It suggests that this data be separated into categories such as spontaneous miscarriages, intentional abortions, stillbirths and other medical treatments that result in the death of the fetus, like chemotherapy.

VANCE: ""We've got 20, 25 million illegal aliens who are here in the country.""

THE FACTS: That figure is highly inflated. U.S. Customs and Border Protection reports more than 10 million arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico from January 2021 through September 2024.

That's arrests, not people. Under pandemic-era asylum restrictions, many people crossed more than once until they succeeded because there were no legal consequences for getting turned back to Mexico. So the number of people is lower than the number of arrests.

According to the Department of Homeland Security's latest available estimate, there were approximately 11 million people living illegally in the U.S. as of January 2022, 79% of whom entered prior to January 2010.

VANCE: ""It says that a doctor who presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide lifesaving care to a baby who survives a botched late-term abortion.""

THE FACTS: This claim misrepresents a bill Walz signed into law in 2023, updating language about the care of newborns.

The new language uses the phrase ""an infant who is born alive"" instead of ""a born alive infant as a result of an abortion."" It states that medical personnel are required to ""care for the infant who is born alive"" rather than ""preserve the life and health of the born alive infant.""

Both the current version of the law and the 2015 version that was amended state that ""an infant who is born alive shall be fully recognized as a human person, and accorded immediate protection under the law.""

Infanticide is criminalized in every state, including Minnesota, and the bill does not change that.

VANCE: ""Remember he said that on January the 6th, the protesters ought to protest peacefully.""

THE FACTS: It's true that Trump told the crowd gathered near the White House, ""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.""

But Vance ignored the incendiary language Trump used throughout his speech, during which he urged the crowd to march to the Capitol, where Congress was meeting to certify President Joe Biden's victory. Trump told the crowd: ""If you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore."" That's after his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, declared: ""Let's have trial by combat.""

Some of the most notable quotes from the JD Vance-Tim Walz vice presidential debate,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/vance-walz-debate-cbs-quotes-94e552d1a7100225a0003db618351601,2024-10-02T04:09:09Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first and only vice presidential debate between Ohio Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz featured an often orderly, policy-focused and even civil dialogue between the two men seeking to serve as the next president's second in command.

One of the sharpest comments came from a debate moderator. Here are some of the most notable quotes from the debate:

-- CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan, who intervened after a tense back and forth between the candidates over immigration. Vance protested a clarification by a moderator about the legal status of Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. ""Since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" Vance said before both he and Walz's exchanges were muted.

-- Walz, agreeing with Vance that some regulations limit the construction of new housing units. Both candidates throughout the debate expressed agreement on some points before driving home their own messages.

-- Vance, after Walz noted his son had witnessed gun violence. ""I appreciate that,"" Walz replied.

-- Walz, when discussing discrepancies in his travel history to Hong Kong in 1989 that have been reported by multiple news organizations.

-- Vance, arguing Harris could have acted as vice president to make housing more affordable. ""If Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address middle class problems, she ought to do them now,"" Vance also said during the debate.

-- Walz, when discussing Vance's unfounded claims about immigrant communities in Springfield, Ohio. Walz said Vance ""will create stories to bring attention to this that vilified a large number of people who were here legally in the community of Springfield. The Republican governor said, it's not true. Don't do it.""

-- Walz, discussing the high rate of gun violence in the United States compared to other rich nations. Walz cautioned against using mental illness as a ""scapegoat"" for the country's high levels of gun violence rather than ""find solutions on this that protect the Second Amendment, protect our children, that settlement.""

- Walz, noting that he is a longtime gunowner and the need to address firearm deaths by suicide and violent crime.

-- Vance, responding to how Republicans should navigate potentially unpopular and dangerous realities that face women surrounding pregnancy. Vance, who opposes abortion, said Republicans ""have got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they, frankly, just don't trust us.""

-- Walz, criticizing Trump's record on abortion. Walz said Trump ""bragged"" about appointing three Supreme Court justices who would go on to join a majority ruling that overturned the abortion protections in Roe v. Wade. ""52 years of personal autonomy and then he tells us 'Oh, send it to the states,'"" Walz said of Trump.

-- Walz, discussing the riot at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Walz said Trump's rhetoric and refusal to concede defeat in the 2020 presidential election led to the riot at the U.S. Capitol and deep ensuing divisions across politics. ""All of us say there's no place for this,"" Walz said.

-- Vance, when asked whether Trump won the 2020 presidential election and if he would support efforts to contest the election which Trump carried out that have since been deemed illegal or unconstitutional. ""First of all, I think that we're focused on the future,"" Vance said. ""But what President Trump has said is that there were problems in 2020, and my own belief is that we should fight about those issues, debate those issues peacefully in the public square."""
Arkansas medical marijuana supporters sue state over decision measure won't qualify for ballot,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/medical-marijuana-arkansas-signatures-lawsuit-93297e195fcb70c8ec8cfdb99deda0e4,2024-10-01T23:01:02Z,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Organizers of an effort to expand medical marijuana i n Arkansas sued the state on Tuesday for its decision that the proposal won't qualify for the November ballot.

Arkansans for Patient Access asked the state Supreme Court to order Secretary of State John Thurston's office to certify their proposal for the ballot. Thurston on Monday said the proposal did not qualify, ruling that its petitions fell short of the valid signatures from registered voters needed.

The medical marijuana proposal was aimed at expanding a measure that the state's voters approved in 2016. It would have broadened the definition of medical professionals who can certify patients for medical cannabis, expanded qualifying conditions and made medical cannabis cards valid for three years.

The group's lawsuit challenges Thurston's decision to not count some of the signatures because the state asserted it had not followed paperwork rules regarding paid signature gatherers. The suit comes weeks after a ballot measure that would have scaled back Arkansas' abortion ban was blocked from the ballot over similar assertions it didn't comply with paperwork requirements.

The state in July determined the group had fallen short of the required signatures, but qualified for 30 additional days to circulate petitions. But the state then told the group that any additional signatures gathered by paid signature gatherers would not be counted if required information was submitted by the canvassing company rather than sponsors of the measure.

The group said the move was a change in the state's position since the same standard wasn't applied to petitions it previously submitted.

""It would be fundamentally unfair for the secretary's newly 'discovered' position to be imposed on APA at the eleventh hour of the signature collection process,"" the group said in its filing.

Thurston's office declined to comment on the lawsuit. Attorney General Tim Griffin said he would defend Thurston's office in court.

""Our laws protect the integrity of the ballot initiative process,"" Griffin said in a statement. ""I applaud Secretary of State John Thurston for his commitment to diligently follow the law, and I will vigorously defend him in court."""
Number of voters with unconfirmed citizenship documents more than doubles in battleground Arizona,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/voting-arizona-fontes-citizenship-ballot-election-f7b9aee24c58ee8a65d437c15c2d77a7,2024-10-01T21:07:19Z,"PHOENIX (AP) -- The number of voters in the battleground state of Arizona classified as having full access to the ballot without confirmation they are citizens has more than doubled to 218,000, Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said.

That number represents 5.3% of all registered voters. While the error won't change who is eligible to vote for president or Congress, that amount of voters could sway tight local and state races, and hotly contested ballot measures on abortion and immigration.

Arizona is unique in that it requires residents to prove citizenship to vote a full ballot -- a requirement dating back to 2004. If they don't do that but attest under penalty of perjury to being citizens, they can vote in federal races only.

Fontes announced Monday that the number of misclassified voters jumped from about 98,000 last month to around 218,000.

It's unclear how officials missed the additional bloc of voters after saying two weeks ago that an error between the state's voter registration database and the Motor Vehicle Division, or MVD, had been fixed.

Aaron Thacker, a spokesperson for Fontes' office Tuesday that the fix that MVD put in place didn't solve the problem.

The Arizona Department of Transportation, which oversees the MVD, said in an email that it created a coding update in its system but didn't specify when it was implemented.

Around Arizona, a relatively small number of votes could tip the scales in competitive races for the Legislature, where Republicans hold a slim majority in both chambers. This year, voters also will decide on the constitutional right to abortion and a measure to criminalize people from entering the state illegally from Mexico.

The Arizona Supreme Court ruled last month that the original batch of voters can cast a full ballot in this year's election because they registered long ago and attested under the penalty of perjury that they are citizens. The justices said the voters were not at fault for the error and shouldn't be disenfranchised so close to the Nov. 5 general election.

Fontes said that ruling should also apply to the new batch of voters, who are nearly evenly split among Democrats, Republicans and voters who aren't registered with either of those parties."
No one expects a judge's rollback of Georgia's abortion ban to be the last word,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-georgia-ban-overturned-appeal-ec732417c9c3b714ccee3b0c9e77bc7d,2024-10-01T18:23:21Z,"SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) -- When a Georgia judge overturned the state's abortion ban this week, abortion rights advocates praised the ruling and opponents denounced it -- all knowing the state's top court could put it on hold in coming days or weeks.

Any changes to abortion policy in Southern states could have an impact that resonates beyond their borders. Most states in the region have bans in place, forcing women who are seeking abortion procedures to travel to obtain them.

So as long as the ban is lifted, it could change abortion-related travel patterns. And the ruling puts another spotlight on a contested state in this year's presidential election, in which Democrats have sought to make abortion a major issue.

Here's a look at where things stand.

Georgia's abortion law violates women's rights to liberty and privacy guaranteed by the state constitution, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled Monday.

Since 2022, the law effectively prohibited abortions beyond six weeks of pregnancy, which is before women often know they're pregnant. That's the point when cardiac activity in an embryo's cells can be detected by ultrasound. The law banned abortions once a ""detectable human heartbeat"" was present -- with some exceptions.

McBurney ruled that the law infringed on the liberty ""of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices."" He also wrote that Georgia gives women a constitutional right to privacy that includes making personal health decisions.

The judge wrote that his ruling reverts Georgia's abortion law to its prior status, which allowed abortions until viability, which is generally considered to be about 22 to 24 weeks' gestational age.

It was the judge's second ruling striking down the same law. In 2022, McBurney declared the law invalid because it was enacted by state lawmakers in 2019, when Roe v. Wade still protected abortion rights nationally.

The Georgia Supreme Court overturned that earlier ruling and sent the case back to McBurney to consider the merits of other legal arguments raised by abortion providers challenging the law. That paved the way for the Monday ruling.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, blasted the ruling, saying: ""Once again, the will of Georgians and their representatives has been overruled by the personal beliefs of one judge.""

Republican state Attorney General Chris Carr planned an immediate appeal to the state Supreme Court, a spokesperson said.

Advocates on both sides of the abortion debate in Georgia noted the state's high court could keep McBurney's order from taking effect while the state's appeal is pending.

It took the Georgia Supreme Court just over a week to overrule McBurney and reinstate the law after it was struck down the first time, in November 2022.

Georgia clinic officials told The Associated Press that they would accept patients whose pregnancies are past six weeks' gestation -- and also that they know the ban could be reimposed quickly.

That could make a big difference in the state. There were about 4,400 abortions monthly in Georgia before the ban took effect, and there have been about 2,400 monthly since then, according to estimates from the Society of Family Planning.

Allowing more abortions could mean that more women who want them can obtain them. It could also ease the flow of patients to clinics in other states, particularly North Carolina, the closest place where abortion is legal further into pregnancy. The Guttmacher Institute estimated that nearly 6,000 Georgia residents traveled to North Carolina for abortions last year.

Most Southern states have abortion bans that are either similar to the one overturned in Georgia or that are in effect at all stages of pregnancy.

So when a state lifts a ban, it could become a destination for people from nearby states seeking abortion. It's not clear whether that will happen in Georgia, given the possibility the state Supreme Court could reinstate the ban.

Even before this week, Georgia, a hotly contested state in the presidential election, has been a flashpoint in the political debate over abortion.

Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris traveled there last month to highlight reporting that two women in the state died after they didn't get proper medical treatment for complications from taking abortion pills to end their pregnancies. The vice president used the occasion to blast her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, for appointing justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who cleared the way for states to impose bans.

After Monday's ruling, it leaves 13 states with bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy and three that bar them after the first six weeks or so of pregnancy."
"Catholic hospital in California illegally denied emergency abortion, state attorney general says",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/california-attorney-general-hospital-abortion-lawsuit-2df6c59133dbb5a0ccca5b0269bd1bc0,2024-10-01T18:22:59Z,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- California's attorney general is suing a Catholic hospital, saying that Providence St. Joseph Hospital illegally denied emergency abortion care to a woman whose pregnancy was no longer viable after her water broke 15 weeks into carrying twins.

Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the lawsuit Monday, which was filed that day in Humboldt County Superior Court and details the case of Anna Nusslock. In February, Nusslock was 15 weeks into her pregnancy when her water broke and she was rushed to Providence in Eureka, where she lives.

According to the complaint, Nusslock was told by the doctor at the hospital that they could not provide an abortion ""so long as one of Anna's twins had detectable heart tones, unless Anna's life was sufficiently at risk."" The doctor recommended she take a helicopter to the University of California, San Francisco for emergency services. But she doubted her insurance would cover the $40,000 cost of the ride.

She asked if she could drive to UCSF, and the doctor advised that if she drove 270 miles (435 kilometers) south, which is about five hours, to San Francisco she would ""hemorrhage and die,"" according to the complaint. Nussbaum was discharged to Mad River Community Hospital 12 miles (19 kilometers) away, where she received the abortion at a labor and delivery unit that is scheduled to close this month, according to Bonta's office.

""They broke the law, and we are taking action to make sure they never do it again,"" Bonta said at a news conference.

A spokesperson for Providence Hospital, the hospital's parent company, said in a statement that it was reviewing the complaint.

""Providence is deeply committed to the health and wellness of women and pregnant patients and provides emergency services to all who walk through our doors in accordance with state and federal law,"" according to the statement.

Bonta's lawsuit states that California's Emergency Services Law prohibits ""the kind of patient dumping (Nusslock) experienced and requires all licensed health facilities"" with an emergency department provide emergency care to those who need it. The lawsuit alleges violations of state civil rights and unfair competition laws."
"Who is Claudia Sheinbaum, the scientist who will head Mexico as its first female president?",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mexico-claudia-sheinbaum-woman-president-aa24527fc05dafa9e30b28e4bb40ccbd,2024-10-01T04:18:22Z,"MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Claudia Sheinbaum takes office Tuesday as Mexico's first female president in the nation's more than 200 years of independence.

The 62-year-old former Mexico City mayor and lifelong leftist campaigned on a promise of continuity, of protecting and expanding the signature initiatives of her mentor, former President Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador.

In the four months between her election and inauguration she held that line, backing L√≥pez Obrador on issues big and small. But Sheinbaum is a very different person; she likes data and doesn't have L√≥pez Obrador's backslapping personal touch.

Mexico now waits to see if she will step out of his shadow.

Sheinbaum's background is in science. She has a Ph.D. in energy engineering. Her brother is a physicist. In a 2023 interview with The Associated Press, Sheinbaum said, ""I believe in science.""

Observers say that grounding showed itself in Sheinbaum's actions as mayor during the COVID-19 pandemic, when her city of some 9 million people took a different approach from what L√≥pez Obrador espoused at the national level.

She comes from an older, more solidly left tradition that predates L√≥pez Obrador's nationalistic, populist movement.

Her parents were leading activists in Mexico's 1968 student movement, which ended tragically in a government massacre of hundreds of student demonstrators in Mexico City's Tlatelolco plaza just days before the Summer Olympics opened there that year.

Sheinbaum is also the first president with a Jewish background in the largely Catholic country.

Sheinbaum led wire to wire and won convincingly in June with almost 60% of the vote, about double the number of her nearest competitor, X√≥chitl G√°lvez.

As L√≥pez Obrador's chosen successor, she enjoyed the boost of the high popularity he maintained throughout his six years in office.

The opposition's coalition led by G√°lvez struggled to gain traction, while support for the governing party carried over to Congress, where voters gave Morena and its allies margins that allowed it to pass important constitutional changes before L√≥pez Obrador left office.

Before passage of a controversial constitutional overhaul of Mexico's judiciary that will make all judges stand for election, Sheinbaum stood with L√≥pez Obrador who had pushed it.

Sheinbaum said ""the reforms to the judicial system will not affect our commercial relations, nor private Mexican investments, nor foreign ones. Rather the opposite, there will be a greater and better rule of law and democracy for everyone.""

Shortly after, when L√≥pez Obrador's proposal to put the National Guard under military command was being considered, Sheinbaum defended it against critics. She said it would not militarize the country and that the National Guard would respect human rights.

And just days before she took office, Sheinbaum stood with L√≥pez Obrador in his long-running diplomatic spat with Spain. She defended her decision to not invite Spain's King Felipe VI to her inauguration, saying in part that the king had failed to apologize for Spain's conquest of Mexico as L√≥pez Obrador had demanded years earlier.

Sheinbaum's victory came 70 years after women won the right to vote in Mexico.

The race really came down to two women, Sheinbaum and G√°lvez, but Mexico's prevailing machismo still pushed both women to explain why they thought they could be president.

Since 2018, Mexico's Congress has had a 50-50 gender split, in part due to gender quotas set for party candidates. Still, Sheinbaum inherits a country with soaring levels of violence against women.

There are also still many parts of the country, especially rural Indigenous areas where men hold all the power. And some 2.5 million women toil in domestic work where despite reforms they continue to face low pay, abuse by employers, long hours and unstable working conditions.

Mexico's Supreme Court ruled in 2023 that national laws prohibiting abortions are unconstitutional and violate women's rights.

Although the Mexican ruling orders the removal of abortion from the federal penal code and requires federal health institutions to offer the procedure to anyone who requests it, further state-by-state legal work is pending to remove all penalties.

Feminists say that simply electing a woman as president does not guarantee she will govern with a gender perspective. Both Sheinbaum and L√≥pez Obrador have been criticized before for appearing to lack empathy toward women protesting against gender violence."
Measure to expand medical marijuana in Arkansas won't qualify for the ballot,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/medical-marijuana-arkansas-petitions-ballot-cb112018ed249c36d050584bb9e9cb83,2024-09-30T23:25:26Z,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- An effort to expand Arkansas' medical marijuana program fell short of the required signatures and won't qualify for the November ballot, Secretary of State John Thurston said Monday.

Arkansans for Patient Access, the group behind the measure, said it planned to take legal action to appeal Thurston's decision.

Thurston said in a letter to the measure's sponsor that his office determined that only 88,040 of the signatures submitted by the group were valid, falling short of the 90,704 needed from registered voters to qualify for the ballot.

The medical marijuana proposal was aimed at expanding a measure that the state's voters approved in 2016. It would have broadened the definition of medical professionals who can certify patients for medical cannabis, expanded qualifying conditions and made medical cannabis cards valid for three years.

Arkansans for Patient Access submitted more than 150,000 signatures in favor of the proposed amendment. The state told the group in July it had fallen short of the required number, but had qualified for an additional 30 days to circulate petitions.

The group said rejecting 20,000 of its signatures was due to an ""arbitrary,"" last-minute rule change.

""The overwhelming support shown through the petition process proves that Arkansans want the opportunity to vote on expanded medical marijuana access,"" the group said in a statement. ""Arkansans for Patient Access will continue to fight for their right to make that decision at the ballot box this November.""

The proposal's rejection comes weeks after the state Supreme Court blocked a ballot measure that would have scaled back the state's abortion ban.

The Family Council Action Committee, an opponent of the marijuana measure, praised Thurston for rejecting the signatures but said it expected the final decision would come from the state Supreme Court.

""A measure this bad simply has no business being on the ballot,"" Family Council Executive Director Jerry Cox said in a statement.

About half of U.S. states allow recreational marijuana and a dozen more have legalized medical marijuana. Those numbers could grow after the November election. Voters in Florida, North Dakota and South Dakota will decide whether to legalize recreational marijuana for adults, and two medical marijuana proposals will be on Nebraska's ballot."
"Judge strikes down Georgia ban on abortions, allowing them to resume beyond 6 weeks into pregnancy",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/georgia-abortion-law-struck-down-632db7d5de815efa18aea52dadbfc59b,2024-09-30T20:00:34Z,"ATLANTA (AP) -- A Georgia judge on Monday struck down the state's abortion law, which took effect in 2022 and effectively prohibited abortions beyond about six weeks of pregnancy.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote in his order that ""liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.""

When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a national right to abortion, it opened the door for state bans. Fourteen states now bar abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Georgia was one of four where the bans kick in after about the first six weeks of pregnancy -- which is often before women realize they're pregnant.

The impact of bans has been felt deeply in the South because many people have to travel hundreds of miles to states where abortion procedures can be obtained legally.

Georgia's law was passed by state lawmakers and signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019 but had been blocked from taking effect until the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which had protected the right to an abortion for nearly 50 years.

The law prohibited most abortions once a ""detectable human heartbeat"" was present. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in cells within an embryo that will eventually become the heart around six weeks into a pregnancy.

McBurney wrote that his ruling means the law in the state returns to what it was before the law was passed in 2019.

""When a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then -- and only then -- may society intervene,"" McBurney wrote.

An ""arbitrary six-week ban"" on abortions ""is inconsistent with these rights and the proper balance that a viability rule establishes between a woman's rights of liberty and privacy and society's interest in protecting and caring for unborn infants,"" the order says."
California expands access to in vitro fertilization with new law requiring insurers to cover it,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/us-news/assisted-reproductive-technology-california-gavin-newsom-general-news-aefc7c8dcd6e3d5f397985719ca4c0d3,2024-09-30T18:27:04Z,"Having a baby via in vitro fertilization is about to become more accessible for many Californians after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law requiring certain health insurers to cover the fertility treatment.

IVF is a process in which eggs are retrieved from the ovaries and fertilized by sperm in a lab. The fertilized egg, or embryo, is then transferred to the uterus. The process can be stressful and emotional. It's also expensive. Treatments can run in the tens of thousands of dollars, making it unattainable for some and leaving others in debt.

California's move to insure IVF comes after four similar bills over the last five years stalled in the Legislature. At least 14 other states already require that IVF be covered.

Newsom's signature also follows IVF's emergence as a contested issue in the presidential election, and after a controversial court decision in Alabama jeopardized access to fertility treatment for people in that state.

""California is a reproductive freedom state,"" Newsom said in a written statement. ""As a national leader for increasing access to reproductive health care and protecting patients and providers, including those under assault in other states, I want to be clear that the right to fertility care and IVF is protected in California. In many other states this is not the case.""

Senate Bill 729 will require that large group health plans -- that is, employers that cover at least 100 people -- provide coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of infertility. This includes a maximum of three egg retrievals and unlimited embryo transfers.

The law pertains to approximately 9 million Californians enrolled in large group, state-regulated health plans. The new law does not apply to people who get their health coverage from religious employers, or people enrolled in Medi-Cal.

The law will go into effect in July 2025 for most beneficiaries, and in July 2027 for government workers who get their health benefits from the California Public Employees' Retirement System.

Approximately 1 in 8 couples experience fertility problems. In 2019, just over 2% of all births in the country were a result of fertility treatments.

The new law also broadens the definition of infertility so that same sex couples can be treated. Making intrauterine insemination and IVF more accessible and affordable is key to achieving reproductive equity for LGBTQ+ people, said Sen. Caroline Menjivar, a Van Nuys Democrat and author of the bill.

According to an analysis of the proposal, out-of-pocket costs for one round of IVF can cost close to $20,000. Some women may need multiple rounds.

In advocating for her bill, Menjivar shared that she and her partner had to decide how to spend their savings -- use the money to start a family or place a down payment on a house. They opted for the house.

""Today is a personal and emotional victory. And, it is a triumph for the many Californians who have been denied a path towards family-building because of the financial barriers that come with fertility treatment, their relationship status, or are blatantly discriminated against as a member of the LGBTQ+ community,"" Menjivar said in a written statement.

California law currently requires insurance companies to offer coverage for usually less expensive fertility treatments, such as diagnostic testing, medication or surgery. It's been up to employers whether to provide coverage for those treatments. Some don't.

Earlier this year an Alabama court decision launched IVF into the political spotlight. The court ruled that frozen embryos created through IVF are considered children. Therefore accidentally destroying an embryo would equate to wrongful death of a minor. That prompted some clinics to pause services, limiting IVF access in that state.

It also heightened attention on IVF in the presidential election because of the U.S. Supreme Court's shift to the right on abortion and reproductive health during former President Donald Trump's administration. Running for office again, Trump has said he would support requiring the government or insurers to pay for IVF.

California Democrats have championed policies that expand access to abortion since the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned Roe vs. Wade. Supporters of the IVF law said it's another example of expanding reproductive health care to California families.

""It's about, ultimately, the ability to decide when and if you want to start a family, that includes to make the decision that you are not ready or that you are ready,"" Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat and co-author of the bill, said in a press conference last month. Wicks, who has shared that her second child was a result of IVF, carried similar proposals in years past without success.

A big hurdle for the legislation over the years has been the price tag. A legislative analysis of the measure estimates the new mandate would increase premiums for state employees, costing the state up to $80 million in the first two years.

Health insurers opposed the measure. The California Chamber of Commerce also opposed the bill noting that health insurance costs are already a top expense for businesses.

Abortion pills will be controlled substances in Louisiana soon. Doctors have concerns,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-pill-louisiana-misoprostol-pregnancy-mifepristone-69a52fcdb711a833ae14edf6f56afc0c,2024-09-30T14:34:57Z,"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- On Tuesday, Louisiana will become the first state in the U.S. to categorize two widely used abortion pills as ""controlled dangerous substances.""

Opponents argue the classification could have catastrophic impacts in a state that already has a near-total abortion ban and one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation. Doctors fear the reclassification will cause delays in accessing the drugs -- mifepristone and misoprostol -- which together can be used to manage miscarriages, while misoprostol induces labor and treats severe bleeding after delivery. They also worry the practice of reclassifying the drugs might spread beyond Louisiana.

Proponents say the new law should help prevent coerced abortion, pointing to a Texas case in which a pregnant woman was given seven misoprostol pills by her husband without her knowledge; the baby survived. Over the past 15 years, news outlets have reported on similar cases -- none in Louisiana -- but the issue does not appear widespread.

Here's what you should know about the new law.

Mifepristone and misoprostol can both be obtained through a prescription in Louisiana, but the state has reclassified the pills as ""Schedule IV drugs,"" putting them in the same category as the opioid tramadol and other substances that can be addictive.

Mifepristone is typically taken along with misoprostol and was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2000 after federal regulators deemed it safe and effective for ending pregnancies in the early weeks of gestation. The drug, which blocks the hormone progesterone, also primes the uterus to respond to the contraction-causing effect of misoprostol.

Last year in the U.S., nearly two-thirds of all abortions were medication abortions.

OB-GYNs say a tiny fraction of patients suffer ""major"" or ""serious"" adverse events after taking mifepristone. In June, the Supreme Court unanimously preserved access to the drug, throwing out a lawsuit from abortion opponents that argued the FDA overlooked serious safety problems when it made mifepristone easier to obtain.

Medical experts say it's possible and safe to use misoprostol by itself to end a pregnancy, but it's slightly less effective than the two-drug regimen. Besides being used in reproductive care, misoprostol is also used to prevent stomach ulcers in people who take certain pain medicines.

It depends.

Under current Louisiana law, physicians convicted of performing an illegal abortion, including one with pills, face up to 15 years in prison, $200,000 in fines and the loss of their medical license.

The new classification means that if someone knowingly possesses mifepristone or misoprostol without a valid prescription for any purpose, they could be fined up to $5,000 and sent to jail for one to five years.

The law carves out protections for pregnant women who obtain the drug without a prescription to take on their own.

Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, a Republican who supports the current abortion ban and reclassification, said in September that the ""intentional delivery of these drugs by organizations operating though the internet or other networks"" is illegal and they will be prosecuted.

Doctors say the law could harm patients due to extra steps and more stringent storage requirements -- especially in emergencies in which misoprostol is used to manage dangerous postpartum hemorrhages.

""As soon as the clock strikes midnight ... this will be a reality almost immediately because we call for it in an emergency situation so frequently,"" said Dr. Jane Martin, an OB-GYN at Ochsner Health in New Orleans whose hospital sees up to 5,000 births a year. It's ""administered at least once a day on labor and delivery,"" often more frequently.

In hospitals like hers, misoprostol is usually stored in an OB-GYN unit in a ""hemorrhage box"" in the room, on the delivery table or in a nurse's pocket, said Martin, who is active in the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in Louisiana and stressed that she's speaking for herself and not the hospital. With the new law, there will be more ""red tape"" to access the drugs -- maybe down the hall in a locked container or potentially an in-house pharmacy at smaller hospitals.

Health experts said two alternative medications for hemorrhage have more side effects, can't be used in patients with certain medical problems and need to be refrigerated.

Murrill countered that the law ""does not limit a health care provider's ability to use, prescribe, or fill these medications for legitimate health purposes nor does it impose restrictive burdens on access for emergency purposes.""

Dr. Kylie Cooper, a maternal-fetal specialist in Minnesota who is active with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said that she's concerned other states will adopt restrictions like Louisiana.

Up to 5% of obstetric patients will experience postpartum hemorrhages, which cause 11% of maternal deaths in the U.S., according to The Joint Commission, a nonprofit organization that sets standards and accredits health care organizations.

""Patients can lose a large amount of blood in a very, very short timeframe,"" Cooper said. ""So in many situations, seconds and minutes count.""

Control of the US Senate is in play as Montana's Tester debates his GOP challenger,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/tester-sheehy-senate-debate-montana-9fb43b441feb0087927120dfab453b5a,2024-09-30T04:15:19Z,"BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) -- U.S. Sen. Jon Tester of Montana is fighting to hold on to his seat and prevent a Republican takeover of the Senate as the three-term lawmaker faces GOP challenger Tim Sheehy in a Monday night debate.

Tester is the last remaining Democrat to hold high office in Montana and the race is on track to be the most expensive in state history. Republicans party leaders including former President Donald Trump handpicked Sheehy in hopes of toppling Tester, a 68-year-old farmer.

Republicans need to pick up just two seats to take the Senate majority and are widely considered to have a lock on one, in West Virginia.

Sheehy, 38, is a former U.S. Navy SEAL and a wealthy businessman. He's sought to erode Tester's longstanding support among moderates by highlighting the lawmaker's ties to lobbyists. That's a tactic Tester himself used successfully in his first Senate win in 2006, also against a three-term incumbent.

Tester has attempted to make the race a referendum on reproductive rights for women, closely tying his campaign to a November ballot initiative that would enshrine abortion rights in Montana's constitution following the overturning of Roe vs. Wade.

He's labelled Sheehy as an unwelcome outsider who is ""part of the problem"" of rising taxes after home values increased in many areas of the state amid a housing shortage.

Sheehy has said his run was motivated by the disastrous U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan. The political rookie's campaign has stumbled at times: He admitted to lying about the origin of a bullet wound in his arm and has suffered backlash for derogatory comments he made to supporters about Native Americans that were obtained by a tribal newspaper.

Yet Republicans remain confident they've finally got Tester on the ropes 18 years after he entered the Senate. Recent polls suggest Sheehy making gains in a state that Trump won by 17 percentage points in 2020.

The state has drifted farther right with each subsequent election cycle, driven in part by new arrivals such as Sheehy, who came to Montana in 2014 to start an aerial firefighting business.

Sheehy has embraced his status as an outsider and said he would speak for both newcomers and longtime residents. He repeatedly tries to lump Tester with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, highlighting public dissatisfaction over the administration's struggles to stem illegal immigration on the southern border.

Seeking to blunt the attacks, Tester skipped the Democratic National Convention last month, declined to endorse Harris and avoids mention of her on the campaign trail. He's opposed the administration over tighter pollution rules for coal plants and pressed it to do more on immigration.

Sheehy has no political track record to criticize, but Tester and Democrats have pointed to his past comments supporting abortion restrictions. They claim Sheehy would help ""outlaw abortion"" in Montana."
What to watch as JD Vance and Tim Walz meet for a vice presidential debate,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/debate-what-to-watch-walz-vance-b5ef720628956789c3373562ddbd0b01,2024-09-30T04:12:06Z,"ATLANTA (AP) -- Republican JD Vance and Democrat Tim Walz will meet Tuesday in the lone vice presidential debate of the 2024 election, bringing together undercards who have spent two months going after each other and the opposing nominees who top the major-party tickets.

The matchup, hosted by CBS News in New York, might not carry the same stakes as the Sept. 10 debate between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. But it offers their top lieutenants a fresh opportunity to introduce themselves, vouch for their bosses and fulfill a time-honored role of a running mate: attack dog. It will involve the biggest television and online audience either No. 2 will see before Election Day.

Walz, the 60-year-old Minnesota governor, and Vance, a 40-year-old U.S. senator from Ohio, have previewed potential approaches for weeks. Walz, before Harris selected him, was the Democrat who coined ""weird"" as a go-to pejorative for the Republican ticket. Vance assails the governor's progressive record as proof Democrats are too far left for voters.

Vance has mocked his fellow veteran's military service record. Walz hammers Vance's opposition to abortion rights and his views on family life. Both men have played up their small-town, middle-America credentials -- contrasts to Trump, the billionaire native New Yorker, and Harris, the California Bay Area native.

It sets up a potentially fierce night in Manhattan. Here are the dynamics to consider as the rivals meet face-to-face for the first time:

Running mates have a balancing act. Their primary job is to make the case for their bosses. But a vice presidential nominee's credibility and connection with the audience are important factors in reaching that goal. If a voter doesn't like the messenger, they're less likely to buy the message.

Going into the debate, a new AP-NORC poll suggests Walz is better liked than Vance, giving the Republican perhaps a steeper challenge.

The poll found that only a quarter of registered voters have a somewhat or very favorable view of the Ohio senator, while about half have a somewhat or very unfavorable view. About a quarter don't know enough to say. Walz is viewed positively by about 4 in 10 voters and negatively by about 3 in 10; the rest don't know enough to say.

Still, Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat and the 2016 vice presidential nominee, warned participants against thinking too much about themselves.

""The only advice that matters is to protect the top of the ticket,"" Kaine insisted, recalling the 2000 matchup between Republican Dick Cheney and Democrat Joe Lieberman. ""Cheney kept attacking (Al) Gore, and Lieberman, instead of defending Gore, tried to make himself likable. ... You can't leave attacks unanswered.""

Democrats believe abortion rights and reproductive health care will motivate their core voters and sway swing voters.

Walz has tried to capitalize already by mixing his story into the argument. The governor talks often about how he and his wife, Gwen, required fertility treatments to have their daughter. Democrats have excoriated Vance for his 2021 quip about ""childless cat ladies"" shaping American life. And Walz has been eager to echo Harris' emphasis on abortion rights as an anchor of her overall campaign theme: ""Freedom.""

Vance and Trump, on the other hand, have struggled for a consistent message on abortion rights -- a reflection of how politically fraught the issue is for Republicans since support for abortion access has increased since the 2022 Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and end a woman's constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy. Trump brags about appointing conservatives who helped strike down Roe and return abortion regulation to state governments. Many Republicans now want to go beyond state bans and place federal restrictions on the procedure, but Trump has indicated that overturning Roe is enough. He has also waffled on how he'll vote on a Florida referendum that would expand abortion rights.

Vance said in August that Trump would veto a national ban if it cleared Congress. A couple of weeks later, during Trump's debate with Harris, the former president demurred on an answer, saying, ""I didn't discuss it with JD."" The Harris campaign has amplified audio of Vance saying as a Senate candidate that he would like to see abortion outlawed nationwide.

Vance often offers clearer arguments than Trump about boosting American manufacturing, helping workers and punishing corporations. He regularly attacks the Biden-Harris administration over inflation. If there's a broad topic where Vance wants to put Walz on the defensive and tether the Democratic ticket to President Joe Biden, it's the economy.

For her part, Harris declares that ""building the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency."" She acknowledges many consumers' struggles even as she generally defends Biden's overall record of economic growth, low unemployment and rising wages since inheriting a COVID-19 freefall.

Both campaigns have competing suites of economic proposals, including varying tax cuts and subsidies for certain sectors. Expect the running mates to spend considerable time trying to convince the dwindling slice of persuadable voters that their ticket is more in tune with most U.S. households' day-to-day economic concerns.

As much as the debate is about Harris and Trump, the running mates got here in no small part because of their respective biographies.

Trump's choice was a play to further cement the GOP ticket as the choice for middle America. The author of the ""Hillbilly Elegy"" memoir who grew up in small-town Ohio, Vance has roots to match his economic populism in ways the billionaire Trump does not.

Walz and Harris both grew up middle class, but Walz remains firmly ensconced there, going from his boyhood on a Nebraska farm to the high school classrooms of Minnesota before he ran for office. It's both a juxtaposition with and reinforcement of Harris' story as the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father.

Both men have made their families part of their political identities. Each have working spouses. Walz has two children -- young adult and teenage. Vance has three young sons. The Walzes and Vances are more traditional political families than those of the presidential nominees: Harris has adult stepchildren from her decade-old marriage to Doug Emhoff; Trump has five children from three marriages.

Expect both running mates, even as they try to keep the spotlight on their bosses, to highlight their own stories.

CBS announced Friday that it will be up to the candidates to keep each other honest at Tuesday's debate -- a sticking point from earlier debates this year.

In the June debate between Trump and Biden, CNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash limited follow-up questions and did not fact check either participant. In the September debate between Trump and Harris, ABC's David Muir and Linsey Davis interjected with matter-of-fact corrections to some of Trump's most glaring misstatements.

Fierce North Carolina congressional race could hinge on other names on the ballot,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-election-congress-robinson-kamala-harris-45b94a917ee0bfdf380d5a760d8059c6,2024-09-29T14:14:51Z,"ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. (AP) -- As Laurie Buckhout made her way around Nash County GOP headquarters in Rocky Mount, she seemed to be in high spirits. The Republican congressional candidate bounced around the crowded room, hugging and laughing with volunteers set to canvass local neighborhoods that afternoon.

But a scandal emerging in North Carolina politics was getting harder to ignore. The day before Buckhout's Nash County visit, CNN released a bombshell report detailing alleged racist and sexual comments made by Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson -- the GOP nominee for governor -- on an online pornography forum more than a decade ago.

Addressing the volunteers, Buckhout spoke generally about the importance of the race. Then she paused and acknowledged ""the elephant in the room.""

""My fight is right here, and when you fight, the most important part is not to get distracted by somebody over there rattling sabers,"" she said. ""It's to keep moving forward and fighting for this district.""

There's a delicate balancing act unfolding in North Carolina's 1st Congressional District -- a battleground district in a battleground state, and one of the few toss-up congressional races across the Southeast.

Incumbent Democratic Rep. Don Davis and Buckhout are campaigning fiercely for the state's northeastern district, but the outcome may not be entirely up to them. Candidates farther up the ballot -- Vice President Kamala Harris for Davis and Robinson for Buckhout -- might impact voters' choices.

The freshman representative's seat is one of the most vulnerable in the country, political analysts say. A loss for Davis could give Republicans a pathway to control the U.S. House.

Democratic groups from all over the country have heavily outspent Republicans on ads in the 1st District contest -- $9.5 million to $3.7 million as of Friday, according to AdImpact, which tracks campaign advertisement spending. As for the candidates themselves, Buckhout's campaign has spent slightly more than Davis'.

Things could change by Election Day. Republicans, boosted by a big infusion of cash from their Congressional Leadership Fund and a new ad buy announced Friday by the National Republican Congressional Committee, have $9.1 million worth of spots reserved between now and Nov. 5, compared with $8.6 million for Democrats.

The district terrain is more challenging for Davis than when he won in 2022. It became redder after the latest GOP-led redistricting added conservative-leaning Lenoir, Wayne, Currituck and Camden counties and cut out Democratic-leaning Pitt County.

He also faces a ""much stronger opponent"" in Buckhout than Sandy Smith, whose campaign two years ago was saddled with various scandals, said Peter Francia, political science professor at East Carolina University. Davis defeated Smith by almost 5 percentage points, or about 12,000 votes.

Buckhout isn't burdened by that kind of turmoil, Francia said, and her military background may help her. Buckhout served in the U.S. Army for over 25 years before retiring in 2010 and starting a Virginia consulting company specialized in military technology, according to her website. She later sold it and moved to North Carolina a few years ago.

Buckhout says her military experience and her intent not to become a ""professional politician"" -- she's agreed to be term-limited -- will allow her to get things done.

One of the volunteers at party headquarters, John Norwood, said he didn't know much about Buckhout but appreciated her military service as a veteran himself. Some friends had told him about her race, so the 32-year-old blacksmith -- wanting ""real change"" after avoiding politics for years -- traveled more than 250 miles or 400 kilometers from McDowell County near Asheville to help out.

""She definitely seems like a candidate I'd want in office,"" he said.

Davis, meanwhile, has cultivated a reputation as a moderate Democrat in a district he knows well. He grew up in Snow Hill and has served six terms as a state senator. An Air Force veteran himself, he has sponsored legislation in Congress to help veterans.

In a district that's more conservative than before, the top of the Democratic ticket could cost Davis some voters. But he hopes to benefit from Democrats energized by Harris' campaign, including Black voters, who make up more than 40% of his district's population.

Davis said in an interview that he's running much as he did in 2022 and remains committed to giving all eastern North Carolinians a ""strong voice in government."" If he wins reelection, he said, he will work to strengthen the region's largely rural communities, including by expanding broadband access and improving Social Security benefits.

""It doesn't matter if they're Democrats, Republicans, independents, we're fighting for an eastern North Carolina that has been left out of a process for so long,"" he said.

Since CNN reported on Robinson's alleged messages -- which included comments such as ""I'm a black NAZI!"" and disparaging characterizations of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. -- the lieutenant governor has denied the accusations, which The Associated Press has not independently confirmed. Robinson also has vowed to ""use every legal means to hold CNN accountable for their lies.""

The fallout has been substantial. Several members of Robinson's campaign staff have resigned. Multiple GOP officials -- Sen. Thom Tillis and state party chairman Jason Simmons among them -- have urged Robinson to disprove the allegations. Other groups, such as the Republican Governors Association, have cut ties financially.

Photos of Robinson and Buckhout together, once featured on her social media, now flash at the end of a television attack ad from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, connecting Buckhout to the lieutenant governor on abortion policies. She doesn't mention that she has donated to his campaign.

Davis said there's ""no need"" to tie Buckhout to Robinson because she's done that work herself. He said he trusts the district's voters to ""sort through all of that.""

Buckhout says she's focused on her own race.

""If folks want to make it about social media and personalities, I want to make it about issues,"" Buckhout said.

She said she's asking the same question she's asked voters throughout the race: Is anything any better than it was four years ago? Responses are ""resoundingly no,"" she says.

Buckhout has worked to tie Davis to the Biden-Harris administration's economic policies -- what she and other Republicans now call ""Kamalanomics"" -- and to what they call the failure of Democrats on immigration and crime.

Davis actually voted to rebuke Harris' work at the U.S.-Mexico border in July, setting himself apart from most House Democrats. The next day, even as he endorsed Harris' presidential run on X, he noted that immigration issues ""cannot be overlooked.""

Davis told The Associated Press he is ""fully supportive"" of Harris' presidential run and welcomes the opportunity to partner with her on ""comprehensive immigration reform"" to secure the border. He's also seen excitement for Harris firsthand in his district and said it was a ""good environment to run in.""

""I am glad to endorse the vice president,"" Davis said. ""We're committing to do everything to help her get elected.""

Voter turnout on both sides could be make or break for either candidate, Francia said. ""We're in a very tight election where every vote could potentially make the difference.""

The women urged those streaming into the evangelical church's Saturday morning civic engagement event to ""make their voices heard as Christians."" After mail-in ballots go out statewide, Booth and Hartunian will be among church volunteers collecting completed, sealed ballots and dropping them off at the county office the next day.

It's a practice known as ballot gathering - or ballot harvesting -- that's been a source of national controversy over the years.

Booth said her task is a big responsibility, but she's not nervous.

""A lot of people don't trust the mail,"" she said. ""So I feel honored and privileged to do this. I'm doing this for my kids and grandkids.""

Conservative voters who have been skeptical of mail voting and ballot gathering - a strategy often used by Democrats - are now warming up to it. Evangelical Christians, in particular, are embracing it this year.

Leading conservative figures Charlie Kirk and Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump have called on Christians and conservatives to collect ballots. Megachurches like Calvary Chapel Chino Hills in Southern California are leading the charge, urging - even training - congregations to collect ballots. They praise it as a valuable tool to raise voter turnout and elect candidates who align with their views on issues such as abortion, transgender rights and immigration.

Robert Tyler, a California-based attorney who represents conservative churches and pastors, said he still believes ""ballot harvesting and universal vote by mail creates opportunities for fraud.""

""But the rules of the game have changed,"" he said. ""Until the law changes, we have to get out and gather ballots like they are doing.""

To be clear, there has been no evidence of widespread fraud in any state related to mail voting. Some isolated cases of potential fraud involving ballot collections have been caught and prosecuted.

Tyler's comments reflect a dramatic change of course for conservatives, some of whom amplified rumors about mail ballots to explain Donald Trump's 2020 loss. Republican leaders see it as necessary if they are to be competitive in an election this year that is likely to decided by thin margins in a few swing states.

Trump has long criticized this voting method as rife with fraud -- an unfounded assertion. Now he and other top GOP officials are encouraging voters to cast their ballots by mail. The party has launched an effort to ""correct the narrative"" on mail voting to coax those who were turned off to it by Trump to reconsider for this year's election.

The practice of ballot gathering - where individuals chosen by voters return mail-in ballots on their behalf - is legal in 35 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Rules vary, but in California, where there is no limit on how many ballots a single person can collect, a collector cannot be compensated and must turn in the ballot in person or by mail within three days of receiving it, or before polls close on Election Day.

Gina Gleason, executive director of California-based Real Impact, a ministry of Calvary Chapel Chino Hills, said she saw how Southern California Democrats used this strategy to get their congressional candidate elected by a narrow margin in 2018. In 2020, her church began collecting ballots every Sunday in the weeks before Election Day.

""Voters handed their signed and sealed ballots to us,"" she said. ""We placed them in lock boxes and personally turned them over to the county offices where they needed to go.""

The initiative was somewhat successful in 2020, when the church collected about 6,000 ballots. In 2022, that number rose to well over 13,000, Gleason said, adding that while most ballots were from church members and their families, some were from members of other churches who drove to Chino Hills to submit their ballots.

""This is the kind of impact we're looking for that can flip school boards and make a difference in our communities by changing laws we don't want to live under,"" she said, citing a law signed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom to prevent schools from outing transgender and gay students to their parents. ""We don't want the government telling us what we can or cannot do when it comes to the health and safety of our children.""

When she trains church volunteers, Gleason includes key instructions, like making sure the outside envelope is filled out correctly and ballots are returned to the appropriate registrar's office. Her church collects ballots from residents of Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties in Southern California.

""And of course, no one should be electioneering or telling people whom or what to vote for,"" she said.

Over the summer, Gleason trained more than 120 people from various churches who are now ready to collect ballots, including the one in Menifee. She and Pastor Jack Hibbs, who leads her church, have been traveling the state on their ""Comeback California Tour"" with the goal of ""getting Christians energized and engaged.""

Conservative groups hope these initiatives will proliferate in other states. Timothy Head, executive director of the Faith & Freedom Coalition, a conservative political advocacy nonprofit, said ballot gathering is gaining traction among once reluctant churches in competitive states such as Nevada and Virginia. He calls it the ""crawl, walk, run effect.""

""We expect it to significantly increase this time. ... Every vote counts and every effort to maximize votes counts.""

Plus, churches are natural choices, he said.

""Congregations gather at least once or twice a week. As long as they are not explicitly partisan, it is a great place where voters can get civically engaged.""

Hibbs spoke forcefully during the church event in Menifee, urging Christians to take a stand.

""That doesn't mean I want a Christian nation,"" he said. ""I just want our country to be a place where a devout believer and an atheist have the same rights.""

He ended his discourse by telling his audience that Trump may have gotten a ""little wiggly and wobbly on abortion,"" and told them to ""forget (Trump's) rhetoric and shenanigans, the crazy and off-color talk.""

""Fewer children will die under Donald Trump than under Kamala Harris,"" he said, referring to abortions. ""So that's how I'll be voting.""

The audience burst into applause. One man yelled out: ""Yeah, Trump.""

Richard Hasen, who leads the Safeguarding Democracy Project at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law, said he is not aware of credible allegations of fraud involving ballot gathering. He would still prefer that states set limits on the number of ballots that can be collected.

""It's low-risk, but not no-risk, and the fact we haven't seen major problems is a good sign,"" he said. ""Still, any time people get together to vote, you want to make sure they are making free and fair choices - whether that place is a church, nursing home or union hall.""

Former Orange County Registrar Neal Kelley believes ballot gathering can help increase voting, but has not made a big dent on elections so far. He also is not too worried about ballot tampering, which is one concern critics have raised in the past regarding this practice.

""The general public doesn't understand all the ways we have to determine that ballots have been tampered with,"" he said. ""We can tell when envelopes have been opened and resealed. If votes are being changed, we'll see a pattern.""

Ada Briceno, chairperson of the Orange County Democratic Party, said ballot gathering allows more people to vote, especially in communities of color where people are working two or three jobs or may struggle with language issues.

""We want more people to have their voices heard, and this is just one more tool,"" she said. ""Republicans were the ones who were all upset about turning in mail-in ballots. And now they're doing it. It's just hypocritical.""

The Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference who has advised Trump, said he sees nothing wrong with churches gathering ballots.

""If other community groups are doing it, why not churches?"" he said. ""I have no doubt that churches will make sure everything is done legally and correctly because they have a higher level of accountability and that moral compass of integrity -- more so than any community group.""

Progressive groups have also trusted churches to get the vote out, said Juan Sepulveda, political science professor at Trinity University in San Antonio. Among the groups that pioneered such initiatives was the Industrial Areas Foundation, a national interfaith network established in 1940 by a community organizer, a Catholic bishop and the Chicago Sun-Times' founder.

""With the church, you have those natural bonds of trust,"" Sepulveda said. ""You didn't have to create trust. It was already there.""

Pope wraps troubled visit to Belgium by beatifying 17th century mystic during sunny stadium Mass,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/belgium-pope-abuse-women-mass-brussels-baudouin-f02c45fb9e902df27fa71fc088ce73a5,2024-09-29T08:28:26Z,"BRUSSELS (AP) -- Pope Francis wrapped up a troubled visit to Belgium on Sunday with a Mass to beatify a 17th-century mystic, after dashing the hopes of one of Europe's most storied Catholic universities by doubling down on his traditional views on women and abortion.

Francis was celebrating a Mass under a spectacular sun in Brussels' sports stadium before heading back to Rome. The stadium is named for King Baudouin, whom Francis had praised for having abdicated for a day in 1990 rather than give his assent to a parliament-approved bill legalizing abortion.

Francis' unscheduled visit to pray at the king's tomb and declaration that the legislation was ""homicidal"" were among several gestures in this once staunchly Catholic country that unnerved its secularized young people, many of whom have turned away from the faith.

Nevertheless, the stadium -- which had a capacity of 37,000 for the Mass -- was nearly full for Francis' Mass. The crowd roared when Francis arrived in his popemobile and stopped to kiss babies passed up to him.

Sunday's Mass was to beatify Spanish nun Ana de Jesus, who made a vow of chastity at 10, entered religious life the following year and helped St. Teresa of Avila reform the Carmelite religious order. The Vatican is holding her up as a model of someone who lived through a time of scandal and brought people back to the faith.

Francis' visit to Belgium was always going to be difficult, given the country's wretched legacy of clerical sexual abuse and overall secularizing trends which have emptied its majestic cathedrals and churches.

But it's unclear if he or his entourage expected such sharp public expressions of outrage from the king on down about the abuse scandal or the pointed calls for reform from Belgium's intellectual elite.

The main reason for the trip was to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the Leuven/Louvain Catholic University, the oldest Catholic university in the world and long the Vatican's academic fiefdom in Belgium.

But the rector of the Dutch campus told Francis that the abuse scandal had so harmed the church's moral authority that it would best reform if it wants to regain credibility and relevance. Rector Luc Sels suggested that opening up greater roles for women - including the priesthood - and being more welcoming to LGBTQ+ Catholics would be a good place to start.

Francis heard a similar call from the Francophone campus, where students staged a reading of an articulated critique of Francis' landmark environmental encyclical ""Praised Be"" in which they called for a ""paradigm shift"" in the way the church views women.

They noted that the encyclical virtually ignores women, cites no female theologians and contributes to their ""invisibility"" in the church and society. Women have long complained they have a second-class status in the church, barred from the priesthood and positions of power despite doing the lion's share of the work educating the young, caring for the sick and passing on the faith.

Francis, an 87-year-old Argentine Jesuit, said he liked what they said. But he repeated his frequent refrain about women being the ""fertile"" nurturers who complement men, and that regardless ""the church is woman.""

His words drew a remarkable rebuke from the Catholic university that invited him. As soon as he finished speaking, Louvain issued a statement expressing its ""incomprehension and disapproval"" of his views on women, which it said were ""deterministic and reductive.""

""We cannot agree on his position for sure,"" said rector Francoise Smets. ""We are fighting against discrimination for women, and we would like women to have another role in the society and in the church also.""

Valentine Hendrix, a 22-year-old international relations masters student at Louvain, told reporters that students had hoped that Francis might respond positively to their appeal. While others applauded at the end of Francis' remarks, she refused and said his comments on abortion and women's role meant that he had ""given up on a committed dialogue.""

""We had expectations, even if we saw that he disappointed us in just a few hours,"" she said.

Francis has made several reforms during his 11-year pontificate, allowing women to serve as acolytes, giving them the vote in his periodic synods, or meetings, appointing several women to high-ranking positions in the Vatican. He has said women must have greater decision-making roles in the church.

But he has ruled out ordaining women as priests and has refused so far to budge on demands to allow women to serve as deacons, who perform many of the same tasks as priests. He has taken the women's issue off the table for debate at the Vatican's upcoming three-week synod because it's too thorny to be dealt with in such a short time. He has punted it to theologians and canonists to chew over into next year.

Francis addressed the issue during his meeting with Belgian clergy and nuns in which he acknowledged so many Belgians had fallen away from the church. The reform process, he said, must involve returning to the Gospel.

""It is not about prioritizing 'fashionable' reforms, but asking: 'How can we bring the Gospel to a society that is no longer listening or has distanced itself from the faith?' Let us all ask ourselves this question,"" he said.

Hundreds rally in the streets of Paris to support world abortion rights,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-rights-france-paris-protest-women-553a060cb9e157b4d15dc830f81607b7,2024-09-28T17:02:45Z,"PARIS (AP) -- Hundreds of people came out in Paris on Saturday, marching in support of the right to abortion for women across the world, just six months after France became the first country to guarantee in its constitution a woman's right to voluntarily terminate a pregnancy.

The protest, organized by civil society groups to mark International Safe Abortion Day, also called for greater and easier access to abortion in France, denouncing budget cuts, staff reductions and the closure of abortion centers and maternity wards, which organizers say all contribute to penalizing women.

Sarah Durocher, president of France's not-for-profit family planning services, said French women sometimes have to travel to another region to access the medical services needed to abort, denouncing the ""obstacle course"" they sometimes face.

Thibault Thomas, 28, said the ongoing trial of a man who has confessed to drugging his wife so that dozens of men could rape her while she was unconscious, was one of the reasons that motivated him to attend the protest on Saturday.

""There's a mood in France, a particular context with the Mazan trial,"" he said, referring to the name of the small Provence town where the couple had bought their retirement home, and where the repeated rapes occurred.

""This sweeps away all the excuses, or all the mitigating circumstances that we thought could have existed before,"" Thomas said. ""In fact it is something broader, generalized.""

Earlier this year, France became the only country to explicitly guarantee a woman's right to voluntarily terminate a pregnancy, when lawmakers overwhelmingly approved a bill to enshrine abortion rights in the constitution.

Abortion in France has been legal since 1975 and enjoys wide support across most of the political spectrum.

Enshrining the right in the Constitution sought to prevent the kind of rollback seen in the United States in recent years.

Still, many in the protest Saturday said the right to abort could never be taken for granted, especially at a time when far-right nationalist parties are gaining influence, in France and other European countries.

""Every time the far right comes to power, sexual and reproductive rights are threatened. I don't see why there would be a French exception,"" said Durocher, stressing that every nine minutes, a woman dies somewhere in the world for not having been able to access safe abortion.. ""So obviously these rights are threatened.""

Also in the march on Saturday was a small organization representing Colombian women in Paris, carrying a large purple banner with a feminist sign.

""In France, fortunately, it is enshrined in the constitution. But we know that when we exert pressure in France or in Latin America, we also help all women to say, 'We are not alone,'"" said 49 year-old Talula Rodr√≠guez. ""We're all going to fight for rights, rights over our bodies. It's our choices."""
Walz has experience on a debate stage pinning down an abortion opponent's shifting positions,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-debate-tim-walz-jd-vance-a7dd9f44ebe854ce2a4f138ff3368a1a,2024-09-28T04:14:52Z,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz knows how to lean into abortion rights on the debate stage. He's done it before.

Just ask his Republican opponent in the 2022 Minnesota governor's race, Dr. Scott Jensen, who was on the receiving end of Walz's attacks -- and saw firsthand how effective Walz could be in exposing an opponent's shifting positions on abortion.

Jensen's experience two years ago could provide insight into what to expect Tuesday when Walz debates GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance on CBS. Jensen said in an interview that Walz would be smart to talk about abortion.

""I think Tim Walz will say that loud and clear, and JD Vance needs to make it very clear that there's not going to be a federal ban on abortion,"" Jensen said. ""That's what Trump has said, and they need to make that very clear.""

The family practice physician and former state senator originally voiced support for an abortion ban in his 2022 campaign and picked a running mate with a record as an outspoken abortion opponent, former Minnesota Viking Matt Birk. That helped him get the Republican nomination, but it didn't play so well with the broader electorate.

By the time Walz and Jensen met for their second of three debates two years ago, Jensen was trying to play down abortion, insisting it wasn't on the ballot.

To Walz, it most certainly was.

""My entire career I've trusted women to make their health care decisions,"" Walz said as they met at the studios of KTTC-TV in Rochester in their only televised prime-time debate. ""I don't believe anybody who sits in this office should come between them.""

Jensen had asserted that state courts had already decided that abortion rights were protected under the Minnesota Constitution and accused Walz of ""fearmongering"" by claiming they might be in danger. He said he wouldn't ban abortion because he couldn't -- that it would take a constitutional amendment.

But Walz pointed out that former President Donald Trump's nominees to the Supreme Court voted to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision after suggesting in their confirmation hearings that it was settled law. In Minnesota, Walz noted, governors appoint state Supreme Court justices.

""I just want to be absolutely clear: This is on the ballot,"" Walz said. ""It will impact generations to come.""

Vance and Trump are treading carefully after their previous support for limiting access to abortion, saying they now want to leave it to the states.

Trump repeatedly declined to say during his Sept. 10 debate with Vice President Kamala Harris whether he would veto a national abortion ban, insisting that a ban would not pass Congress anyway. Yet he has often taken credit for appointing the three justices who helped overturn the constitutional right to abortion. He's backed away from statements he'd made as recently as March that he'd support a national ban.

Vance himself had strongly opposed abortion in the runup to his 2022 senatorial election but aligned himself this year with Trump. Harris and Walz have been urging their audiences not to trust Trump and Vance on abortion rights.

Walz's comments on abortion rights from the 2022 debates with Jensen sound like lines he could try again in the clash with Vance, said Kevin Parsneau, a political science professor at Minnesota State University in Mankato. Despite Trump's and Vance's comments that a national ban is off the table and the issue in the hands of the states, he said, Walz could point out that the next president and Congress could override whatever the states do.

Not only were abortion rights a winning issue in 2022 for Walz, who defeated Jensen by nearly 8 percentage points, the issue helped Democrats take control of both chambers of the Minnesota Legislature and the governor's office for the first time in eight years. That ""trifecta"" let them enact a sweeping progressive agenda in 2023 that included stronger protections for abortion rights -- and put Walz on Harris' radar when she needed a running mate.

Both Walz and Jensen were feeling scrappy by their third debate, on Minnesota Public Radio.

Walz basically ignored Jensen's dig about his 1995 drunken driving arrest in Nebraska and Jensen calling him the ""godfather of the crime epidemic."" Walz did lapse into some rambling answers, prompting Jensen to quip one point, when the moderator offered him a rebuttal, ""Thanks, I almost fell asleep.""

Walz will make adjustments on the move, Jensen said, so Vance will need to frame his attacks carefully.

""Tim Walz has an affable personality. I worked with him when I was in the Senate,"" Jensen said. ""He's a jovial fellow. If you try to turn Tim Walz into something malignant, I don't think that's going to work. Because Tim Walz is not malignant. He's a skilled politician who's learned on the job.""

The Trump-Vance campaign has already criticized Walz's response to the rioting that accompanied protests over the 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man who died under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer, and Vance could raise it again. While Trump praised Walz at the time, Republicans now say Walz should have moved faster to use the National Guard. The governor, in the KTTC-TV debate, said he was proud of how he and Minnesota's first responders reacted to the crisis ""no matter how much I'm slandered by Scott.""

Vance has already previewed attacks on Walz's military record. Walz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years but retired when he first ran for Congress in 2005 before his unit was deployed to Iraq. He has at times called himself a retired command sergeant major and did serve as one for less than a year. But his rank was reduced for benefit purposes to master sergeant because he had not completed the necessary coursework. His careless use of language included what struck some as a claim that he served in combat when he did not.

Vance, who served four years in the Marines, including six months as a military journalist in Iraq, has accused Walz of "" stolen valor.""

""I am damn proud of my service to this country,"" Walz responded in a speech to a union convention. ""And I firmly believe you should never denigrate another person's service record. To anyone brave enough to put on that uniform for our great country, including my opponent, I just have a few simple words. Thank you for your service and sacrifice.""

An important challenge for Vance, Jensen said, will be making sure Walz answers the questions put to him.

""You don't want to underestimate Tim Walz because he has an ability to speak rapidly and sincerely, and yet, without the audiences realizing it, a lot of times he can go on for a minute or two, and everything sort of checks out OK on the surface, but when you stop and ask, 'Did he answer the question?' he didn't,"" Jensen said. ""Tim Walz will throw a word salad at you and you won't realize it's even happening."""

The final 3 anti-abortion activists have been sentenced in a Tennessee clinic blockade,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-tennessee-clinic-blockade-sentence-55c1a9853ebffbdf414503ebb7e874d8,2024-09-27T21:47:43Z,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The final three anti-abortion activists convicted of a 2021 Tennessee clinic blockade were sentenced this week, including the person considered to be the main organizer of the action.

Chester Gallagher was sentenced on Thursday to 16 months in prison, by far the longest sentence among 11 people convicted of various offenses. In addition to organizing the March 5, 2021, blockade of a Carafem clinic in Mount Juliet, Tennesse, a town 17 miles (27.36 kilometers) east of Nashville, prosecutors said Gallgher ""exploited his specialized knowledge gleaned from his law enforcement experience to prolong the blockade as long as possible.""

Gallagher and a co-defendant stalled police with phony negotiations, prosecutors said. Their actions disrupted not only the Carafem clinic, but other medical offices that shared the same building.

Heather Idoni, who is currently serving a 2-year sentence for a 2020 clinic blockade in Washington, D.C., was sentenced on Friday to 8 months in prison. However, U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger allowed the sentence to be served concurrently to the D.C. sentence.

She said she was lenient, in part, because of Idoni's many good works. They include adopting orphans from Ukraine. But Idoni has a blind spot with regards to abortion, Trauger said.

""She allowed her own personal views to inflict emotional damage on other people with views with which she disagrees,"" Trauger said.

Both Idoni and Gallagher were convicted of obstructing access to the clinic as well as a more serious federal conspiracy charge. In addition to incarceration, they were further sentenced to three years of supervised release.

Four others who were also convicted of conspiracy charges were sentenced in July to terms ranging from 6 months in prison to three years of supervised release, and three people who were convicted of misdemeanors were each sentenced to three years of probation.

Gallagher, Idoni and Eva Edl were not sentenced with their co-defendants in July because they were preparing for a Michigan trial involving similar charges. In that case all three were found guilty of obstructing access to the Northland Family Planning Clinic in Sterling Heights and felony conspiracy. Edl and Idoni were additionally found guilty of blockading the Women's Health Clinic in Saginaw. They have not been sentenced in the Michigan blockades.

On Thursday, Edl received a sentence of 3 years of probation in the Tennessee clinic blockade.

One Tennessee defendant, Caroline Davis, who pleaded guilty in October to misdemeanor charges and cooperated with prosecutors, was sentenced to three years of probation in April.

The 2021 blockade came nearly a year before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The organizers used social media to promote and livestream actions they hoped would prevent the clinic from performing abortions, according to testimony. They also intended the video as a training tool for other activists, Trauger found."
CBS News says it will be up to Harris and Walz to fact-check each other in veep debate,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/cbs-debate-vice-president-fact-check-7a3b31c98ab092dd44915df57a359d10,2024-09-27T20:53:04Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS News, hosting vice presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz for the general election campaign's third debate next week, says it will be up to the politicians -- not the moderators -- to check the facts of their opponents.

The 90-minute debate, scheduled for 9 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday in a Manhattan studio that once hosted the children's program ""Captain Kangaroo,"" will be moderated by the outgoing ""CBS Evening News"" anchor Norah O'Donnell and ""Face the Nation"" host Margaret Brennan.

During ABC's debate between presidential contenders Kamala Harris and Donald Trump earlier this month, network moderators on four occasions pointed out inaccurate statements by Trump, and none by Harris. That infuriated the former president and his supporters, who complained it was unfair.

Last spring, CNN moderators did not question any facts presented by Trump and President Joe Biden in the debate where Biden's poor performance eventually led to him dropping out of the race.

On Friday, CBS the onus will be on Vance and Walz to point out misstatements by the other, and that ""the moderators will facilitate those opportunities"" during rebuttal time. The network said its own misinformation unit, CBS News Confirmed, will provide real-time fact-checking during the debate on its live blog and on social media, and on the air during post-debate analysis.

With its plans, CBS News is clearly indicating it wants to take a step back from the heat generated by calling attention to misleading statements by candidates. Some argue that offstage fact-checking is too little, too late and not seen by many people who watch the event.

Angie Drodnic Holan, director of the international fact-checking network at the Poynter Institute, said she has seen examples of moderators who have successfully encouraged candidates to keep their opponents honest.

""I'll be interested in seeing how this works in practice,"" she said. ""Having said that, you're basically off-loading one of your journalistic responsibilities onto the candidates themselves, so I don't think that it's ideal. It takes journalistic courage to be willing to fact-check the candidates, because the candidates are absolutely going to complain about it. I don't think the moderators' first goal is to avoid controversy.""

During the ABC debate, moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis corrected Trump statements on abortion, the 2020 election, crime statistics and reports that immigrants in Ohio were eating pets.

Unlike the two presidential debates, the two sides agreed that the vice presidential candidates' microphones will not be turned off while their opponent is speaking, increasing the chance for genuine back-and-forth exchanges and the risk that the two men will talk over each other. CBS says it reserves the right to shut off a ""hot mic"" when necessary. Each candidate will have two minutes for a closing statement, with Vance winning a virtual coin toss and choosing to get the last word.

It's a big moment for CBS News, long mired in third place in the evening news ratings. O'Donnell just announced she was stepping down from the role. Brennan is considered a rising star.

Like with the presidential debates, CBS is making its feed available for other networks to televise, and many are expected to take advantage of the opportunity.

There will be no audience when Vance and Walz meet at a West Side studio that, in its past, has hosted editions of ""60 Minutes,"" ""CBS Sunday Morning,"" ""Inside the NFL,"" ""Geraldo"" and ""Captain Kangaroo.""

It's not known whether there will be other opportunities to see Trump and Harris together on the same stage before the Nov. 5 election. Harris has accepted an invitation from CNN for another debate on Oct. 23, but Trump has rejected it. In a poll taken by Quinnipiac University and released earlier this week, likely voters said by roughly a two-to-one margin that they'd like them face off again.

CBS' ""60 Minutes"" is looking to land both Harris and Trump for back-to-back interviews that will air on Oct. 7, but neither candidate has committed to it yet.

The lawsuit was filed against Combs, his companies and several associates and seeks undisclosed damages for physical injuries, severe emotional distress, humiliation, anxiety and other harms. A lawyer for Combs, his company and one of his representatives did not immediately return emails seeking comment Friday.

The woman in the latest lawsuit, identified by the pseudonym Jane Doe, accuses Combs of sexually assaulting her while she was unconscious from drugs, and it alleges Combs and his acquaintances recorded sexual encounters without her permission. She says that she met Combs overseas in fall 2020 and that the assaults and harassment continued through July this year.

Doe says she often was coerced and harassed into traveling to Combs' homes in New York, Los Angeles and Miami and other cities, including monthly in 2021 and 2022.

""At every visit, (Combs) would make her 'perform a show' for him and would ply her with alcohol and substances until she passed out -- she would wake up with bruising and injuries but with no recollection of how she sustained her injuries,"" the lawsuit says.

In a July 2022 encounter with Combs at his Los Angeles home, the woman alleges in the lawsuit, she was forced to ingest drugs she believes included ketamine and blacked out. She later took a pregnancy test and told Combs it was positive, she says. A Combs associate repeatedly demanded she get an abortion, and she had a miscarriage, she asserts.

This past July, Doe says, Combs ""commanded"" her to go to his home in Miami, where she alleges Combs shoved two pills in her mouth. She says that the next morning, she felt ill and confused and could not remember what had happened the night before, and that the bedroom was in disarray.

Doe, being represented by attorneys Marie Napoli and Joseph Ciaccio, also alleges Combs and his associates tracked her location and monitored her conversations. She says Combs discouraged her from working and gave her an ""allowance"" that he used to control her.

""Powerful figures in the entertainment industry have long exploited aspiring artists and fans,"" Napoli said in a statement. ""Recent high-profile lawsuits aim to hold these celebrities accountable, potentially transforming industry practices and providing justice for victims. No one is above the law. Fame and wealth do not protect Sean 'Diddy' Combs from serious allegations of sex trafficking and abuse.""

On Tuesday, another woman sued Combs, alleging that the music mogul and his head of security raped her and recorded it on video at his New York recording studio in 2001.

Combs remains jailed without bail in New York on the federal charges alleging he ran a vast network that facilitated sexual crimes and committed shocking acts of violence, using blackmail and other tactics to protect Combs and those close to him.

He pleaded not guilty to racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. His attorney said he is innocent and will fight to clear his name.

Earlier this month, Combs admitted that he beat his ex-girlfriend Cassie in a hotel hallway in 2016 and apologized after CNN released video of the attack.

Combs, 54, is one of the best-known music executives, producers and performers across hip-hop, having won three Grammys and worked with artists such as Notorious B.I.G., Mary J. Blige, Usher, Lil Kim, Faith Evans and 112. He founded Bad Boy Records in 1993, the influential fashion line Sean John, a vodka brand and the Revolt TV network. He sold off his stake in the latter company in June of this year."
Abortion-rights groups are courting Latino voters in Arizona and Florida,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-election-2024-latinos-florida-arizona-6530218d8ceb494bf7ab95355709329e,2024-09-27T04:08:36Z,"PHOENIX (AP) -- When Lesley Chavez found out she was pregnant at age 16, she saw her daughter as a blessing from God and never considered an abortion, a view reinforced by her devout Christian mother. If she could have voted at the time, Chavez would have opposed expanding abortion access.

But 10 years later -- as she and other Arizona residents braced for a possible ban on nearly all abortions -- Chavez drove over 300 miles (480 kilometers) to California to help a friend get one. That experience with someone she knew who was struggling financially and couldn't support another child was the final push that changed Chavez's stance on the issue.

""I just kind of felt like, dang, if I didn't have nobody, I would want someone like me to be there. I would want someone that's not going to judge me and actually help,"" she said.

Now, she helps deliver that message to other Latinos in Arizona, one of nine states that is considering constitutional amendments to enshrine abortion rights.

As abortion-rights groups court Latino voters through door-knocking and Spanish-language ads, they say the fast-growing group could determine the outcome of abortion ballot measures across the U.S., particularly in states such as Arizona and Florida with large Latino populations.

Like other Americans, Latinos have an array of personal feelings and connections to the issue that can be impacted by religion, culture, country of origin and other things, organizers say. But their views are often misunderstood and oversimplified by people who assume they are all Catholic and, therefore, anti-abortion, said Natasha Sutherland, communications director for Floridians Protecting Freedom, which is behind an abortion measure in that state.

A recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that about two-thirds of Hispanic Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases. About 4 in 10 U.S. Hispanics identify as Catholic, about one-third as Protestant or ""other Christian,"" and about one-quarter as religiously unaffiliated.

Efforts to reach Latino voters often hinge on one-on-one conversations -- ""old-school, boots on the ground organizing,"" said Alex Berrios, co-founder of the grassroots Florida group Mi Vecino, or ""my neighbor.""

Overall, about 14.7% of eligible voters, or 36.2 million people, are Latino, according to the Pew Research Center.

In Florida, 18% of registered voters are Hispanic, or 2.4 million people, according to an October 2023 analysis by the nonpartisan Latino advocacy organization NALEO Educational Fund. More than 855,000 Latinos are expected to cast ballots in Arizona for the November election, making up about 1 in 4 Arizona voters, according to NALEO.

As a lead canvasser for the grassroots Arizona group Poder in Action, Chavez has knocked on the doors of ambivalent Latino voters, persuading them to support a measure that would guarantee access to abortion until fetal viability, a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. It's generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks.

Living United for Change in Arizona, or LUCHA, moved the measure to the top of its canvassing script because voters kept bringing up the issue. LUCHA campaigns to low-income Latino, Black and Indigenous voters.

""People initiated the conversation like, 'Oh yeah I just heard on the news what happened with the 1800 abortion ban,'"" Abril Gallardo, chief of staff for LUCHA, said, referring to the 1864 abortion ban that the Arizona Supreme Court signaled in April the state could enforce but that lawmakers later repealed.

Another group, Mi Familia Vota, has put $200,000 toward its efforts to mobilize Latino voters to support the measure.

The official campaign against the proposal -- It Goes Too Far -- has enlisted Hispanic volunteers in its effort to sway voters.

Abortion is one of the most important issues in the upcoming election to about 4 in 10 Hispanic voters, below the economy, crime, and health care, and about on par with immigration, according to the AP-NORC poll.

In Florida, abortion is illegal after the first six weeks of pregnancy. The November ballot measure would legalize abortion until fetal viability.

""The Latino community is a huge part of any campaign in Florida,"" Sutherland said. ""We can't win this without Latinos, so Latino outreach is essential.""

Sutherland said her group uses bilingual phone banking and canvassing efforts, hosted a bilingual campaign launch rally, hired a Latino outreach manager and holds weekly Spanish-language meetings to discuss strategy.

The opposing campaign has ads in Spanish and has a Spanish version of its website called ""Vota No En La 4.""

Berrios' group, Mi Vecino, has focused on Florida's 9th Congressional District, which includes Osceola County and Orlando and was the first majority Hispanic district to meet the signature requirement for putting abortion rights on the ballot. Berrios tells supporters of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump that they can vote for him and for abortion rights.

""We saw a need for a culturally competent nonpartisan effort to engage and educate Hispanic voters on reproductive freedom,"" Berrios said.

For Latino men especially, it has been helpful to include messaging about limiting government decisions in family and health care decisions, several Florida organizers said.

""You need to have conversations that are tailored to the person in front of you. For folks in Florida, for example, who escaped communism in their own countries, they're really moved by things having to do with freedom and the power to determine the conditions of their own lives. We try to be as nuanced as possible,"" said Lupe Rodriguez, executive director of the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Justice.

Rocio Garcia, an assistant professor of sociology at Arizona State University, said that over time, Latinas, including those who are Catholic, have swung toward supporting abortion access, even if they would not get an abortion themselves.

Alyssa Sanchez, a 23-year-old Mexican American who is Catholic, plans to vote for Arizona's measure. Her family members have been supportive of the issue as long as she could remember.

""You do still have to take Bibles, sayings, everything about the Catholic religion to your own interpretation,"" said Sanchez, a lifelong Arizona resident. ""And then battling that thought it just comes down to, I believe in people's choice to their own bodies stronger than I believe in anything else.""

Sinsi Hern√°ndez-Cancio, vice president for health justice at the National Partnership for Women & Families, said abortion-rights supporters cannot afford to assume Latino voters do not support abortion rights, especially in majority-Republican Florida, which requires 60% voter support to pass a constitutional amendment.

""If you're going to approach any voter with false assumptions, you're not going to be able to connect,"" she said."
"At the New York Film Festival, an art form at play",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/brutalist-nickel-boys-new-york-film-festival-aa9dd331e42219084cc5b8025f7cfa95,2024-09-26T22:03:30Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- When you think of blockbusters, the first thing that comes to mind might not be a 215-minute postwar epic screening for the first time at Lincoln Center.

But that was the scene last week when the New York Film Festival hosted a 70mm print of Bradley Corbet's ""The Brutalist."" The festival hadn't then officially begun -- its 62nd edition opens Friday -- but the advance press screening drew long lines -- as some attendees noted, not unlike those at Ellis Island in the film -- and a packed Walter Reade Theatre.

Word had gotten around: ""The Brutalist"" is something to see. Corbet's epic, starring Adrian Brody as a Jewish architect remaking his life in Pennsylvania, is the kind of colossal cinematic construction that doesn't come around every day. Shot in VistaVision and structured like movements in a symphony (with a 15-minute intermission to boot), ""The Brutalist"" is indeed something to behold. It's arthouse and blockbuster in one, and, maybe, a reminder of the movies' capacity for uncompromising grandeur -- and the awe that can inspire.

It's been fashionable in recent years to wonder about the fate of the movies, but it can be hard to placate those concerns at the New York Film Festival. The festival prizes itself on gathering the best cinema from around the world. And this year, the movies are filled with bold forays of form and perspective that you can feel pushing film forward.

This is also the time Oscar campaigns begin lurching into gear, with Q&As and cocktail parties. But, unlike last year when ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Barbie"" were entrenched as favorites, the best picture race is said to be wide open. In that vacuum, movies like ""The Brutalist"" and the NYFF opener, RaMell Ross' ""Nickel Boys,"" not to mention Sean Baker's ""Anora"" and Jacques Audiard's ""Emilia Perez,"" are poised to test arthouse boundaries. This year, those films might be the blockbusters to beat.

""Nickel Boys,"" the opening night selection, is Ross' fictional film debut, but it also carries over the exquisite eye he brought to his 2018 Oscar-nominated documentary ""Hale County This Morning, This Evening."" Ross films the adaptation of Colson Whitehead's novel from the subjective points of view of two boys -- Ellwood (Ethan Herisse) and Turner (Brandon Wilson) -- who are among the Black students abused at Nickel Academy, a Florida reform school. In a film sprinkled with brutality and tenderness, the first-person approach gives ""Nickelboys"" a radical sense of empathy.

The festival includes a number of sections and sidebars, but its main slate remains its core. This year, that's 32 films from 24 countries, including ""The Seed of the Sacred Fig,"" by exiled Iranian director Mohammad Rasoul; ""Caught by the Tides,"" by Chinese filmmaker Jia Zhangke; and French director Mati Diop's documentary ""Dahomey.""

One of the standouts is Georgian director Dea Kulumbegashvili's devastating, despairing sophomore feature ""April."" Like, ""Nickelboys,"" it, too, plays with perspective. An obstetrician, Nina (Ia Sukhitashvili), is blamed for the death of a newborn, but the subsequent investigation has more to do with the illegal abortions she performs in a small Georgian village beneath the Caucasus Mountains.

Kulumbegashvili's follow-up to her debut, ""Beginning,"" is both bracingly real -- she shot a live birth for the film -- and mysteriously surreal. Occasionally we see from Nina's perspective, other times we hover just outside it; sometimes ""April"" seems to visualize something inside her. The effect is chilling, as if Nina's body is a moving target.

Like Ross, Indian filmmaker Payal Kapadia worked in documentary before turning to fiction with her luminous ""All We Imagine as Light."" Despite being a prize-winner at Cannes, the film was surprisingly overlooked for India's Oscar submission. But that shouldn't detract from Kapadia's remarkable accomplishment.

In it, three women (Kani Kusruti, Divya Prabha, Chhaya Kadam) juggle dreams and reality in modern Mumbai while working at a hospital. Midway, the film shifts from city to country, allowing them a new outlook on Mumbai and the class structures that govern their private lives. ""All We Imagine as Light"" begins with the gritty realism of a documentary but melts enchantingly into fable.

Like ""All We Imagine as Light,"" another main slate entry, Carson Lund's ""Eephus,"" reaches its conclusion at sunset with the dying out of light. In Lund's charming, wry hangout movie, a group of small-town middle-aged guys gather for a baseball game on a field that's soon to be turned into something else. With the fewest of fans and the creakiest of knees, they play one last one. There's laughter and storytelling but they're also sliding like they mean it.

There's an existentialist quality to ""Eephus"" that could make it a good parable for plenty of things, even the movies. But it's a lovely reminder that, whomever is watching, you play for the love of the game."
Senate Democrats are making a late push in red-leaning states as they try to hold majority,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/senate-elections-texas-florida-cruz-scott-tester-f22d2f79790478a41f486e3957cfe4be,2024-09-26T22:03:25Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats looking to preserve their Senate majority in the face of a difficult election cycle announced Thursday they were making a ""multi-million dollar investment"" in television advertising in Texas and Florida races with the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee saying he's ""very confident there's going to be more coming.""

Sen. Gary Peters, chair of the DSCC, discussed the new spending during an appearance at the National Press Club. Peters declined to be more specific about the amount of money the committee will invest in the two Republican-leaning states, but emphasized that the investment won't come at the expense of Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, who is viewed as the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent seeking office.

""There is no world that you can conceive of that I'm not going to be in the Montana race to the very end,"" Peters said. ""Jon Tester will have everything that he needs to win.""

The Texas race features Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who is seeking a third term against Rep. Colin Allred. Cruz won his last race by less than three percentage points with 51% of the vote. The Florida race features Sen. Rick Scott., who is seeking his second term against former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell. Scott won his race six years ago with 50% of the vote.

Democrats hold a slim majority but are likely to lose a seat in West Virginia now that Sen. Joe Manchin is retiring. Republicans would only need to flip one more seat to take the majority and much of their focus is on Montana, which former President Donald Trump won by more than 16 percentage points four years ago. There, Republican Tim Sheehy is hoping to unseat Tester, who is completing his third term in the Senate.

Philip Letsou, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, responded to Peters' announcement by saying it was ""effectively an admission from Chuck Schumer and the DSCC that Jon Tester, who is polling very badly, looks like a lost cause.""

He went on to criticize the two Democratic challengers, saying ""Allred and Mucarsel-Powell are bad fits for Florida and Texas, and voters will reject them.""

Peters cited the close wins that Cruz and Scott experienced six years ago in explaining the decision to go on the offense in the Republican-leaning states.

""Ted Cruz's numbers are worse now than they were when he ran last time,"" Peters said. ""In Florida, Rick Scott has run several statewide races, and even when he has a wind at his back with a strong Republican year, he's never won by just a hair over one point.""

Democrats are also hoping a Florida referendum on abortion will benefit Democratic candidates on the ballot. Florida law currently bans most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, before many women even know they are pregnant. If approved by 60% of voters, the ballot initiative known as Amendment 4 would ensure that abortions are legal until the fetus is viable, as determined by the patient's health care provider.

Peters said data was ""definitely showing some great momentum"" for Democrats in Florida.

""We expect there's a lot of upside, particularly when folks get to know our candidates better,"" Peters said. ""It's pretty powerful in terms of the numbers, so we made the decision that we've got to start investing."""
North Carolina lieutenant governor names new chief aide as staff departures grow,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-mark-robinson-election-staff-5eb24f5fde7a4a2f47fdf99a95aaf1a6,2024-09-26T19:13:11Z,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson quickly named his next state government office chief Thursday, as a dozen workers have quit his office or gubernatorial campaign after last week's CNN report alleging he posted strongly worded racial and sexual comments on an online message board.

Robinson said he had elevated Deputy Chief of Staff Krishana Polite to become the next chief of staff in the Lieutenant Governor's Office. The announcement came the day after current Chief of Staff and General Counsel Brian LiVecchi disclosed that he was resigning effective next week.

Polite ""has been a great major asset to our great state for years,"" Robinson wrote on X. ""We are blessed to have her leading our administration.""

LiVecchi, who has served in Robinson's office since his term began in early 2021, confirmed Thursday that three other office workers were also resigning as of Oct. 1: communications director John Wesley Waugh, policy director Jonathan Harris and director of government affairs Nathan Lewis. The office, which is allocated $1.3 million in this year's state budget, lists eight employees on its website. A lieutenant governor holds few inherent duties.

LiVecchi didn't give a reason for the departures, which were revealed a few days after the Robinson campaign's senior adviser said eight of the campaign's top staff members were stepping down, including himself, the campaign manager and finance director. Robinson, who would be the state's first Black governor if elected, has said he will rebuild his campaign staff. A spokesperson said Thursday that he had no information on campaign staff hirings.

The personnel departures come as Republican officials and GOP groups have distanced themselves from Robinson mere weeks before the Nov. 5 election where he faces Democratic nominee Josh Stein, the sitting attorney general. Absentee voting has started. The Republican Governors Association said it's no longer supporting Robinson. And Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who endorsed Robinson before the March primary, hasn't mentioned Robinson at two North Carolina rallies held since last weekend.

Last week's CNN report said Robinson left statements on a porn site's message board in which he referred to himself as a ""black NAZI,"" said he enjoyed transgender pornography, said in 2012 that he preferred Hitler to then-President Barack Obama and slammed the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as ""worse than a maggot.""

Robinson, who has denied writing the messages, already had a history of inflammatory comments about topics like abortion and LGBTQ+ rights that Stein and his allies have emphasized in opposing him on TV commercials and online. Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris' campaign and her party also are focused on linking Trump with Robinson to win the battleground state.

Robinson's campaign said this week that it had hired a Virginia law firm to investigate how what he calls ""false smears"" in the report came to be. Jesse Binnall, a partner in the law group, told Fox News that ""the voters need an answer before the election. And so we are going to move very quickly and still give them a very fulsome report.""

""We are going to investigate this strenuously,"" said Binnall, whose clients have included Trump and his campaign. ""We are going to leave no stone unturned. We're going to be very, very aggressive.""

CNN hasn't commented on Robinson's accusations. But the network report said it matched details of the account on the message board to other online accounts held by Robinson by comparing usernames, a known email address and his full name. CNN reported details discussed by the account holder matched Robinson's age, length of marriage and other biographical information."
"Top aide for North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson is resigning, adding to staff separations",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-mark-robinson-election-staff-fe65071d13923c23b8839d6ced2b403a,2024-09-26T00:08:19Z,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- The top aide to North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson within state government is quitting, a state official said Wednesday, marking another staff separation from the Republican nominee for governor following a CNN report stating he made explicit racial and sexual posts on a pornography website's message board.

Brian LiVecchi, Robinson's chief of staff and general counsel, will resign effective next Tuesday, according to state Sen. Benton Sawrey, who has known LiVecchi for many years. LiVecchi didn't return a phone call and email Wednesday seeking information about any staff changes within the Office of the Lieutenant Governor. However, Sawrey said LiVecchi had given him authority to confirm his departure.

""Brian and his staff worked every day to help make North Carolina the best state in the nation,"" Sawrey said. ""He's a true public servant that led by example and tackled every issue thoughtfully.""

Over the weekend, Robinson announced that four key staff members on his gubernatorial campaign staff had left their jobs, including senior adviser Conrad Pogorzelski IIi and campaign manager Chris Rodriguez. Pogorzelski separately Sunday named eight campaign workers who had stepped down, decimating the team six weeks before Robinson's election with Democratic nominee Josh Stein. Robinson vowed to rebuild the campaign staff and remained optimistic about the electoral outcome.

CNN's report last week unearthed posts it said Robinson left on a porn site's message boards in which he referred to himself as a ""black NAZI;"" said he enjoyed transgender pornography; said in 2012 he preferred Hitler to then-President Barack Obama; and slammed the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as ""worse than a maggot.""

Robinson, who would be the state's first Black governor if elected, has denied writing the messages that CNN says were from over a decade ago. He said Tuesday his campaign has hired a law firm to help investigate how what Robinson calls ""false smears"" originated. But that hasn't stopped top Republicans from distancing themselves from Robinson. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump endorsed Robinson before the March primary and has let Robinson speak at the former president's in-state rallies. But he was not involved in Trump rallies on Wednesday in suburban Charlotte and last weekend in Wilmington.

The Republican Governors Association has cut off support for Robinson, with no new ad placements. Stein's campaign and his allies have outraised Robinson and his supporting groups, running commercials and posting videos criticizing Robinson for his past inflammatory comments on abortion, LGBTQ+ issues and the role of women. Other state Republicans have said that unless Robinson produces evidence soon to refute the allegations in the CNN report the GOP must turn its focus to other critical races in the battleground state.

Robinson said in a post on X that he spoke with Republican leaders across the state Wednesday morning ""and made it clear: This is an election about policies, not personalities ... From President Trump to our local community officials, we must vote Republican.""

The Lieutenant Governor's Office is small -- the office website identifies eight employees -- and Robinson's duties are few. They include presiding over the state Senate and serving on the State Board of Elections. His office also handles constituent services. Robinson tackled other issues, such as boosting work apprenticeships and opposing what he considered political indoctrination in the public schools. The lieutenant governor's four-year term, like the governor's, concludes at year's end."
Senate confirms commander of US Army forces in the Pacific after Tuberville drops objections,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/tuberville-army-senate-confirmation-lloyd-austin-733ede944a6cf5d450db2c60c1430c98,2024-09-25T20:30:19Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate has confirmed a new commander of U.S. Army forces in the Pacific after Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville dropped his objections and allowed a quick vote on the nomination.

Tuberville had blocked Lt. Gen. Ronald Clark's nomination for months over concerns that the top military aide to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, along with other staff, did not immediately notify President Joe Biden when Austin was hospitalized with complications from cancer treatment earlier this year.

Clark, who Biden had nominated in July, was confirmed late Tuesday evening. Tuberville said Wednesday that he dropped his hold after meeting with Clark and talking to others in the Pentagon.

Tuberville had initially demanded to see a report from the Pentagon's inspector general that will review the matter, but that report hasn't yet been released and Congress is leaving Washington until after the November election.

""I didn't want to leave him hanging, so I asked him to come over and we sat down and talked for about an hour,"" Tuberville said. Clark's explanation matched that of others he had spoken to, ""so I trusted him and what he was telling me,"" Tuberville said.

There was bipartisan frustration with Austin and his top aides earlier this year after it became clear that Biden was kept in the dark about the defense secretary not being in command for days during his January hospital visit. Lawmakers argued that could have meant confusion or delays in military action.

Austin was admitted to intensive care for complications from prostate cancer surgery on Jan. 1, but the White House was not told until three days later. Austin's senior staff were notified on Jan. 2.

Tuberville said he's still concerned about the situation and how it unfolded, but after speaking with Clark, he believes he wasn't one of the main people responsible for the lapse.

""We do have problems there, but it wasn't his problem,"" Tuberville said.

Austin said at the time that he took full responsibility and had apologized to Biden. He insisted that there were no gaps in control of the department or the nation's security because ""at all times, either I or the deputy secretary was in a position to conduct the duties of my office.""

An earlier Pentagon review of the matter blamed privacy restrictions and staff hesitancy for the secrecy, and called for improved procedures, which have been made.

A hold by any senator on a nomination, or on a piece of legislation, blocks a quick vote by unanimous consent. Democrats could have brought the nomination up for a vote, circumventing the hold, but it would have taken several days of floor time to do so. A vote would not have been scheduled until after the November election.

The objections over Clark came a year after Tuberville's blockade of hundreds of military promotions over a Pentagon abortion policy. The Alabama senator held up the nominations for months but relented after he faced intense criticism from senators in both parties. The Senate finally approved 425 military promotions and nominations in November.

Republican colleagues said they agreed with Tuberville on the abortion policy but openly pressured him to drop the holds, voicing concern about military readiness and the toll it was taking on service members and their families who had nothing to do with the regulations."
"Nashville district attorney secretly recorded defense lawyers and other office visitors, probe finds",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/nashville-recording-criminal-attorney-e1ed505e54307fc94760fe00668e5ea1,2024-09-25T17:08:14Z,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Nashville's district attorney secretly recorded defense attorneys, colleagues and other visitors without their knowledge, according to an investigation's findings released Wednesday.

In a scathing report, the Tennessee comptroller's office found that District Attorney Glenn Funk installed an extensive surveillance system for audio and video recordings nearly four years ago. While investigators say numerous signs were posted that visitors were being filmed, there was only one small warning in an ""obscure"" place that audio surveillance was also happening.

""Former office employees informed investigators that it was common practice to use office equipment to audio and video record criminal defense attorneys in the viewing room without disclosure and for office personnel to subsequently provide the captured audio and video recordings of the criminal defense attorneys to office staff handling the criminal case,"" the report states.

Despite the common practice, the defense attorneys who spoke with the state investigators said they were largely unaware they were being audio recorded while examining evidence, stating that they often discussed privileged information and defense strategies while in the viewing rooms.

Funk rejected the suggestion that he should have done more to warn visitors about the surveillance, telling investigators that ""you don't have any expectation of privacy in the District Attorney's Office,"" according to the report.

The report highlights a 2022 incident in which Funk instructed his office to use the surveillance system to monitor a former employee whose family member voiced support for Funk's election opponent on social media. That employee later made a $500 contribution to Funk after the two met to discuss the social media post. The employee told investigators that Funk alluded that a campaign contribution of some kind would ease the situation and warned they would need to talk more about the employee's continued employment.

According to investigators, Funk was also advised to wait until after the election to terminate the employee because ""it could be used against him by his political opponent.""

Funk was eventually reelected in May 2022 and the employee resigned two months later.

""Government resources, including personnel, equipment, and property, should only be used for official purposes. Our investigation revealed that the office's resources were routinely used to promote or otherwise benefit the District Attorney General's reelection campaign and related activities,"" the report states.

Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said in a letter Wednesday that after reviewing the evidence against Funk, he doesn't think there is any basis for a ""successful criminal prosecution.""

""Please note that the closure of this matter in my office does not absolve you or your staff of any ethical duties that may be implicated by the underlying concerns,"" Skrmetti wrote. ""I am particularly troubled by the audio record functionality in places where defense attorneys converse with their clients, especially in the Crimes Against Children room.""

A spokesperson for Funk, Steve Hayslip, said Funk appreciated Skrmetti's ""prompt response"" and pointing out that as ""Funk has always stated, neither he nor his office has committed any crimes or broken any law.""

""This matter is now at an end,"" Hayslip in an email.

The investigation was also handed over to the Tennessee Board of Professional Responsibility, which did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.

Funk has been the Nashville-area district attorney since 2014. He was reelected to an eight-year term in 2022, where he notably declared that he would not prosecute medical practitioners who perform an abortion or prosecute any pregnant woman who seeks one."
Funds are cutting aid for women seeking abortions as costs rise,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-fund-cuts-texas-florida-277daed0806e76b891bf10ef452ce8a7,2024-09-25T12:53:26Z,"Organizations that help pay abortion costs are capping how much they can help as travel costs rise and the wave of ""rage giving"" that fueled them two years ago has subsided.

Abortion funds, which have operated across the U.S. for decades, in many cases as volunteer groups, ramped up their capacity fast after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, ending a national right to abortion. Donations rolled in from supporters who saw the groups as key to maintaining abortion access as most Republican-controlled states implemented bans.

The expansion of the funds and increasing access to abortion pills are major reasons the number of abortions has risen slightly despite bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy in 14 states and after about six weeks of pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant, in another four.

But the funds have found that even with record budgets, it's not enough to fill all the gaps between the cost of obtaining abortions and what women seeking them can afford as they have to travel farther for legal procedures.

The National Abortion Federation, which helps people seeking abortions across the country, used to cover half the cost of the abortion for callers who couldn't afford it. Since July, it's pulled back to 30%. Brittany Fonteno, the organization's president and CEO, said the allocations had to be cut because of the rising demand and costs -- even though the fund has a record $55 million budget this year.

""We're at the point now where we know that people who are most impacted by funding shifts -- and by abortion bans which have caused the funding shifts -- are the people who can least afford to be kept away from care,"" Fonteno said. ""And that includes people of color, younger people, immigrants and people with lower incomes.""

Other groups have also imposed limits on aid to keep from exhausting their funds.

The Blue Ridge Abortion Fund, based in Virginia, hits its budget limit nearly every week and has to put requests on hold until the next week.

The Cobalt Abortion Fund in Colorado has had to cap how much it can spend. Its president, Karen Middleton, said groups like hers are used to being scrappy.

""It's the bake sale of the abortion rights movement,"" she said.

Abortion funds have existed for decades out of the spotlight. Many were -- and some remain -- volunteer-run. Nearly all of them ramped up as the abortion landscape shifted.

Cobalt, for instance, spent $206,000 in 2021. Of that, only about $6,000 was for for travel costs -- and much of that came in the form of gas cards to help people in outlying parts of Colorado get to clinics.

This year, the group expects to spend $2.2 million -- 10 times as much as in 2021. In the first six months of this year, it spent more than $600,000 on travel and other logistical costs. Now they're booking hotel rooms and flights -- mostly on short notice.

""We're a travel agency as much as we're an abortion fund,"" Middleton said.

In Colorado, like other states between the coasts, the influx of patients began late in 2021 when a ban on abortion after the first six weeks of pregnancy took effect in Texas. That's since been replaced by a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy.

For the Blue Ridge Abortion Fund, a big change arrived after May 1, when Florida's ban on abortion after the first six weeks of pregnancy took effect. Before that, Florida, the nation's third most populous state, was a destination for people traveling from other Southern states that had stricter limits.

Greene said her fund helped 20 people from Florida from January through April. When the ban took effect, it left Virginia as the nearest state where abortion was available past 12 weeks and without a 72-hour waiting period. Greene said the fund helped about 40 Florida residents from May through August.

Their average travel cost per Floridian has been about $3,000, she said -- more than any other state.

Fonteno said the spike in requests from Florida -- six times as many each month since the ban began -- was an impetus for its abrupt policy change earlier this year. Blue Ridge and other funds have been trying to make up the difference.

""We're seeing more and more patients with more funding gaps,"" Greene said.

To try to stick to its weekly aid budget, the fund has cut back when it accepts calls requesting help to two mornings a week instead of two full work days. Greene said her fund collaborates with others to try to cover costs.

The New Jersey Abortion Access Fund responded to the National Abortion Federation's cuts by increasing what it sends every week to a solidarity fund to help people seeking abortions from other states to $5,000 from $3,000, said Quadira Coles, the group's president.

The organization also sends block grants to New Jersey abortion clinics to use to help pay for patients who cannot afford their fees. Coles said the group has increased that funding, too, after hearing from clinics that it had been running out halfway through the month.

The groups could see some of their financial pressure eased depending on the outcomes of measures on the November ballots that would add a state constitutional right to abortion in nine states.

In four of the states -- Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota -- passage would overturn current bans and potentially mean that many people could access abortion without traveling.

In other states, the change would be more subtle. For instance, part of the Colorado amendment would allow state government employee health plans to cover abortion -- possibly reducing the number of people who would seek help paying.

In the meantime, organizers of some of the funds say that some supporters have been contributing to the ballot measure campaigns, at the expense of the funds.

Joan Lamunyon Sanford, executive director of Faith Roots, which helps pay the costs of people traveling to New Mexico for abortion, said many donors who started around the time of Texas' restrictions, often called Senate Bill 8, or the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling make recurring gifts -- though others gave just once.

""For those who felt that, whether it was the righteous anger or compassion, that led them to donate after S.B. 8 and after Dobbs, we're still here, and the need is still here,"" she said. ""We still need them."""
Trump tells women he 'will be your protector' as GOP struggles with outreach to female voters,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-women-protector-abortion-election-697ce355f7386bfd192b99bb00322705,2024-09-25T04:15:04Z,"INDIANA, Pa. (AP) -- From former President Donald Trump to Ohio Senate candidate Bernie Moreno, male Republican candidates are struggling to speak to female voters, using language criticized as tone deaf and patronizing as they try to win support from women and speak to issues important to them.

On Monday night, Trump cast himself as a ""protector"" of women, saying in battleground Pennsylvania that he will save them from fear and loneliness and they will no longer have to think about abortion.

""You will no longer be abandoned, lonely or scared. You will no longer be in danger. ... You will no longer have anxiety from all of the problems our country has today,"" Trump said. ""You will be protected, and I will be your protector.""

At a town hall event on Friday, Moreno bemoaned the fact that abortion has become the deciding issue for many suburban women, calling the notion ""a little crazy, by the way, but especially for women that are like past 50. I'm thinking to myself, 'I don't really think that's an issue for you.'""

Former Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley responded with exasperation to Moreno in a social media post. ""Are you trying to lose the election?"" she asked. ""Asking for a friend. #Tonedeaf #DonLemonVibes."" The latter was a reference to former CNN anchor Don Lemon's suggestion during the 2024 campaign that Haley, at 51, was ""past her prime.""

The comments underscore the GOP's challenges in appealing to women, especially when it comes to the issue of abortion. The problem has become amplified since Vice President Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket.

Women have emerged as a core weakness for Trump's campaign, and he is viewed less favorably by women than men. A September AP-NORC poll found more than half of registered voters who are women have a somewhat or very favorable view of Harris, while only about one-third have a favorable view of Trump.

The gender gap -- the difference between the share of men and women who say they're supporting each candidate -- has been in the double digits for Trump and Harris in several recent polls. That split has been attributed, in part, to Trump's role in appointing the Supreme Court justices who overturned the constitutional right to an abortion -- a ruling he continues to celebrate at his events.

""Women will be healthy, happy, confident and free. You will no longer be thinking about abortion,"" Trump said Monday, insisting the issue ""no longer pertains,"" even as women living in Republican-led states grapple with a wave of new restrictions that have left emergency rooms refusing to treat pregnant women and been linked by ProPublica to at least two preventable deaths.

Instead of helping Trump expand his appeal with women, such language is likely to turn them off, argued Debbie Walsh, the director of the Center for American Women and Politics at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University.

""This notion that women need to be protected, that women are somehow weak or vulnerable -- this sort of protectionist, patronizing tone ... I think for a lot of women will just add to that sense of he doesn't understand their lives, that he doesn't understand where they are on a whole host of issues,"" she said.

Many women, she noted, believe that overturning Roe v. Wade has ""put their lives at risk.""

Trump's pledge to protect women is also complicated by his long history of personal attacks against women as well as a jury's finding last year that he sexually abused a magazine columnist decades earlier in a department store dressing room. Trump has denied the allegations, along with multiple others that have emerged over the years.

""This kind of language is just more evidence that Donald Trump is out of touch with American women,"" said Jennifer Lawless, chair of the politics department at the University of Virginia. ""Not only is the sentiment paternalistic, but the fact that he uttered these words while simultaneously berating women for caring about reproductive rights is stunning.""

Trump's campaign dismissed the criticism as coming from partisan voices and said Trump's comments reflected his voters' top issues.

""President Trump is responding directly to the concerns that he hears and our campaign hears from women across the country everyday, their fear, the very real fear that women have about being assaulted or potentially raped by criminals or illegal immigrants who have been allowed in this country,"" said Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt.

Harris' campaign said Trump's latest comments showed he was trying to tell women ""what to think and what we care about.""

""Women know better -- and we will not be silenced, dismissed, ignored or treated like we're stupid,"" spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement.

Moreno spokesperson Reagan McCarthy, meanwhile, said the Senate candidate's comment was made in jest.

""Bernie's view is that women voters care just as much about the economy, rising prices, crime, and our open southern border as male voters do, and it's disgusting that Democrats and their friends in the leftwing media constantly treat all women as if they're automatically single-issue voters on abortion who don't have other concerns that they vote on,"" she said in a written statement.

Trump's campaign has been spending much of its energy focused on appealing to and turning out men -- especially younger men who don't consistently vote in elections. That effort has included appearances on popular podcasts and at major sporting events like Ultimate Fighting Championship fights that have sometimes given the campaign a frat-like feel.

But campaign officials have long insisted that they have been working to appeal to women, too. They believe Trump's focus on the border and crime -- with dark threats of neighborhoods being overrun by dangerous migrants and out-of-control crime putting families at risk -- resonates especially well with women, as does his focus on the economy and his pledge to lower prices.

At Monday night's rally, Trump talked about women being worse off now than they were when he was in office. He vowed to ""fix all of that and fast.""

""I will protect women at a level never seen before. They will finally be healthy, hopeful, safe and secure. Their lives will be happy, beautiful and great again. And it's my honor to do so,"" he said.

Even some of Trump's supporters seemed to raise an eyebrow.

""He's what I call an old-style male,"" said Louella Ondo, 69, who lives in nearby Home, Pennsylvania, defining that as the kind who believes ""that women are inferior to them and that they need to be the boss."" She said she'd encountered many such male egos while working in health care alongside surgeons for 40 years.

Ondo, who's been a longtime supporter since Trump's days on ""The Apprentice,"" said that attitude bothered her during his first run. But now, she said, it's clear the country needs ""someone that is willing to do the job, not someone to sweet talk you.""

""Would I want him to be my best friend? I'm not sure I would, you know? Because my thoughts and how he presents is different. But he can do the job and get us turned around. And that's what we need.""

Others liked what they heard.

Mary Ann Williams, 63, a retired school teacher who lives in Newtown, said she feels less safe now than she did when Trump was in office and is looking for him to turn things around.

""I feel that what he's really saying, the bottom line, is that by following his policies -- like closing the border, stopping the immigrants that are criminals, drugs dealers -- in that way, women, children, everybody's safe, we're all safer,"" she said.

Retirement on Arizona right-leaning high court gives Democratic governor rare chance to fill seat,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/arizona-supreme-court-74eec5aab108902585470690878cec44,2024-09-25T01:53:11Z,"PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona Supreme Court Justice Robert Brutinel announced Tuesday he will retire this fall, giving Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs a rare opportunity to fill his seat on the Republican-dominated court.

Brutinel's retirement is effective Oct. 31, capping off more than four decades as a lawyer and judge in Arizona. He was appointed to the court by former Republican Gov. Jan Brewer in 2009. He served as chief justice from 2019 to 2024.

""I leave this position with pride in my service on the courts and great confidence in the future of our judicial system, knowing that the courts are in very good hands,"" Brutinel wrote in his retirement letter released Tuesday. ""The future of our courts is bright.""

The high court was expanded from five to seven members in 2016. All were appointed by Republican governors, though one is a registered independent.

Recently, the court decided a high-profile abortion case by reinstating an 1864 near-total abortion ban. Brutinel was one of two justices who dissented.

State lawmakers quickly repealed the ban, and Hobbs signed off on the bill. The ban was officially taken off the books this month.

Hobbs spokesperson Christian Slater said the Commission on Appellate Court Appointments must provide Hobbs with a list of candidates to replace Brutinel by the end of the year. The governor would then have 60 days to make a selection, Slater said.

"In effort to refute porn-site message report, Mark Robinson campaign hires a law firm",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-governor-mark-robinson-election-3b9ec7642bfe19fb32788359aa8f6f6b,2024-09-24T21:41:31Z,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina Republican gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson said Tuesday his campaign has hired a law firm to help investigate a CNN report stating he made explicit racial and sexual posts on a pornography website's message board.

The lawyers will look at how what Robinson calls ""false smears"" originated.

The announcement comes as more North Carolina Republicans disturbed by last week's report said that if Robinson can't formally refute the accusations quickly, the GOP should shift its focus to competitive in-state races.

Other Republicans already have abandoned Robinson, the sitting lieutenant governor. The Republican Governors Association said Monday it will no longer support Robinson. His campaign had benefitted from the group spending millions of dollars in advertising in his race with Democratic nominee Josh Stein whom polls have shown leading Robinson. Most of Robinson's top campaign staffers also quit in the report's fallout.

GOP officials are anxious that Robinson's situation could pull down Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and help Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the battleground state, and threaten the outcomes of other key seats on the ballot.

""He should conclusively and quickly prove false the allegations against him,"" Hal Weatherman, who is seeking to succeed Robinson as lieutenant governor, said on X. Weatherman runs separately from Robinson but received his endorsement. ""If he can prove this isn't true and was fabricated to hurt him, he will win in a landslide. But if he fails to do so, he will lose, because the comments being attributed to him are highly disturbing.""

Robinson, a favorite of the state GOP's conservative base, has denied writing the messages from more than a decade ago, well before he became active in politics. In a news release, Robinson said he was confident the Binnall Law Group from northern Virginia ""will leave no stone unturned and enable us to use every legal means to hold CNN accountable for their lies.""

CNN's report unearthed posts it said Robinson left on a porn site's message boards in which he referred to himself as a ""black NAZI;"" said he enjoyed transgender pornography; said in 2012 he preferred Hitler to then-President Barack Obama; and slammed the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as ""worse than a maggot."" Robinson has a history of inflammatory comments on abortion, LGBTQ+ issues and the role of women that Stein and his allies have used against him for months.

CNN didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Last week, CNN said it had matched details of an account on the pornographic website forum to other online accounts held by Robinson by comparing usernames, a known email address and his full name. CNN reported that details discussed by the account holder matched Robinson's age, length of marriage and other biographical information..

At a campaign event Monday, Robinson said he would be ""coming after CNN full throttle."" He hasn't provided evidence that would counter the broadcast report.

U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who endorsed a Robinson rival in the March gubernatorial primary, proposed Tuesday that Robinson should by Friday present evidence that would form the basis for litigation to ""defend his name or in the absence of a defense, then we've got to move on.""

Robinson was endorsed by Trump before the primary and has spoken at the former president's in-state rallies. But he was not involved in a Trump rally in Wilmington last weekend and Trump didn't mention him. Trump has another North Carolina event on Wednesday.

Speaking in Charlotte on Monday, Trump running mate JD Vance said it was up to North Carolina voters to decide what they think of Robinson's messages and whether they believe Robinson's defense.

A Republican Governors Association spokesperson said this week that no further ad placements had been made in the race after Tuesday.

Data from AdImpact, which monitors campaign spending, shows that the RGA and a separate political action committee associated with the group had spent at least $15.9 million on television and online advertising in the North Carolina general election race. Stein's campaign and his allied groups have widely outspent Robinson and his allies during the general election so far, according to data.

The deadline for any North Carolina gubernatorial candidate to withdraw from the race was Sept. 19."
"Judge lets over 8,000 Catholic employers deny worker protections for abortion and fertility care",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/north-dakota-catholic-benefits-association-abortion-bc75f5aeac6cc89967154e0ee9ab7804,2024-09-24T21:28:42Z,"BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- A federal judge is allowing more than 8,000 Catholic employers nationwide to reject government regulations that protect workers seeking abortions and fertility care.

In a sharply worded order, U.S. District Judge Daniel Traynor, of Bismarck, North Dakota, granted a preliminary injunction Monday, ruling that the Catholic Benefits Association and the Diocese of Bismarck were likely to succeed in proving that a final rule adopted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in April violated their freedom of religion. The regulations are meant to enforce the federal Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.

The judge also barred the EEOC from forcing the diocese and association to comply with harassment regulations meant to safeguard workers, writing ""in a manner that would require them to speak or communicate in favor of abortion, fertility treatments, or gender transition when such is contrary to the Catholic faith."" The ruling targeted transgender employees who would be restricted from expressing parts of their gender identities.

""It is a precarious time for people of religious faith in America. It has been described as a post-Christian age,"" Traynor wrote. ""One indication of this dire assessment may be the repeated illegal and unconstitutional administrative actions against one of the founding principles of our country, the free exercise of religion.""

The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act passed with widespread bipartisan support in December 2022. It was widely considered a victory for women who are low-wage workers and have routinely been denied accommodations for everything from time off for medical appointments to the ability to sit or stand on the job. But controversy ensued when the EEOC adopted an expansive view of conditions related to pregnancy and childbirth that required accommodations, including for abortion, fertility treatment and birth control. While the rule includes an exemption for religious employers, it says determinations must be made on a case-by-case basis.

But the judge, who was appointed in 2020 by former President Donald Trump, said the rule ""forces members to choose between expressing sincerely held beliefs and compliance,"" and would cause ""irreparable"" harm.

Martin Nussbaum, lead attorney for the association, on Tuesday called the judge's ruling a win that ""respects the religious conscience of sincere Catholic employers.""

The Department of Justice declined to comment.

Attorneys for the federal government had argued against an injunction, saying the plaintiffs' case was ""highly speculative"" because they hadn't identified any enforcement actions or employees who had sought accommodations that were denied. They also said the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to challenge the regulations, and can't show they will likely succeed in the lawsuit. The judge rejected those arguments, saying ""It should not take a legal challenge for the Agency to stop violating the Constitutional rights of Americans.""

In vitro fertilization became a major political flashpoint earlier this year, when the Alabama Supreme Court issued an opinion in a wrongful death case equating frozen embryos with children. Major IVF providers paused operations in the state until the Republican-controlled state government adopted a law offering some legal protections.

Last month, Trump said that if he wins a second term, he would make IVF treatment free, but did not detail how he would fund his plan or precisely how it would work. This month, Republicans blocked legislation to establish a nationwide right to IVF, fueling criticism from Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.

""This particular case is part of this much broader attack on women's rights and reproductive freedom,"" said Inimai Chettiar, president of legal advocacy group A Better Balance, which spearheaded a decades-long campaign for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. Neither the act nor the EEOC regulations require employers to pay for either abortions or IVF -- just to allow workers to take time off for them, she said. ""It's not creating this onerous requirement on them.""

The Diocese of Bismarck and the Catholic Benefits Association filed the lawsuit in July. The association, which provides health and other benefits via Catholic employers, counts 85 dioceses and archdioceses among its members, which total over 1,380 employers plus 7,100 parishes nationwide, according to the complaint. Those members also include religious orders, schools, charities, colleges and hospitals, along with Catholic-owned businesses. The association says it covers 162,000 employees enrolled in member health plans.

Traynor has strong affiliations with Catholic and conservative groups. He was a board member of the North Dakota Catholic Conference, which represents the state's Catholic bishops, according to a Senate Judiciary Committee judicial nominee questionnaire. He also listed his membership in two conservative law groups, the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies and the St. Thomas More Society of North Dakota. In March, he blocked the government from enforcing key federal laws and related regulations to require a Christian employers' organization to provide insurance coverage for gender-transition surgeries, counseling and other care.

Monday's decision followed a ruling in July by a federal judge in Louisiana, who granted a preliminary injunction in two similar lawsuits brought by the Louisiana and Mississippi attorneys general, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic University and two dioceses. The cases differ because the North Dakota lawsuit also explicitly challenged protections for fertility treatments, not just abortion, said Leila Abolfazli, director of national abortion strategy for the National Women's Law Center.

In practice, Abolfazli said, if a worker is denied time off for fertility care, ""that could be the difference between becoming pregnant or not."" While the ruling only applies to the Catholic groups, she explained that it's one of several lawsuits that threaten to ""bit by bit undermine the law overall.""

Sharita Gruberg, vice president for economic justice at the National Partnership for Women and Families, said she's worried about a ""broader chilling effect"" from this ruling and other decisions that could inhibit pregnant workers from feeling empowered to exercise their rights under the act.

""Religion is not a license to discriminate,"" said Gillian Thomas, senior staff attorney for the ACLU Women's Rights Project. She said the ruling ""marks a dangerous new low in the weaponization of religion against civil rights.""

Senate chairman demands answers from emergency rooms that denied care to pregnant patients,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/emergency-abortions-hospitals-pregnancy-senate-2b05c1dd929981afca79d68ec2e0a86a,2024-09-24T20:39:58Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hospitals are facing questions about why they denied care to pregnant patients and whether state abortion bans have influenced how they treat those patients.

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, sent inquiries to nine hospitals ahead of a hearing Tuesday looking at whether abortion bans have prevented or delayed pregnant women from getting help during their miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies or other medical emergencies.

He is part of a Democratic effort to focus the nation's attention on the stories of women who have faced horrible realities since some states tightened a patchwork of abortion laws. The strict laws are injecting chaos and hesitation into the emergency room, Wyden said during Tuesday's hearing.

""Some states that have passed abortion bans into law claim that they contain exceptions if a woman's life is at risk,"" Wyden said. ""In reality, these exceptions are forcing doctors to play lawyer. And lawyer to play doctor. Providers are scrambling to make impossible decisions between providing critical care or a potential jail sentence.""

Republicans on Tuesday assailed the hearing, with outright denials about the impact abortion laws have on the medical care women in the U.S. have received, and called the hearing a politically-motivated attack just weeks ahead of the presidential election. Republicans, who are noticeably nervous about how the new abortion laws will play into the presidential race, lodged repeated complaints about the hearing's title, ""How Trump Criminalized Women's Health Care.""

""Unfortunately, as demonstrated by the overtly partisan nature of the title, it appears that the purpose of today's hearing is to score political points against the former president,"" said Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho, a Republican.

A federal law requires emergency rooms to provide stabilizing care for patients, a mandate that the Biden administration argues includes abortions needed to save the health or life of a woman. But anti-abortion advocates have argued that the law also requires hospitals to stabilize a fetus, too. The Senate Finance Committee comes into play because it oversees Medicare funding, which can be yanked when a hospital violates the federal law.

The Associated Press has reported that more than 100 women have been denied care in emergency rooms across the country since 2022. The women were turned away in states with and without strict abortion bans, but doctors in Florida and Missouri, for example, detailed in some cases they could not give patients the treatment they needed because of the state's abortion bans. Wyden sent letters to four of the hospitals that were included in the AP's reports, as well as a hospital at the center of a ProPublica report that found a Georgia woman died after doctors delayed her treatment.

Reports of women being turned away, several Republicans argued, are the result of misinformation or misunderstanding of abortion laws.

OB-GYN Amelia Huntsberger told the committee that she became very familiar with Idaho's abortion law, which initially only allowed for abortions if a woman was at risk for death, when it went into effect in 2022. So did her husband, an emergency room doctor. A year ago, they packed and moved their family to Oregon as a result.

""It was clear that it was inevitable: if we stayed in Idaho, at some point there would be conflict between what a patient needed and what the laws would allow for,"" Huntsberger said.

Huntsberger is not alone. Idaho has lost nearly 50 OB-GYNs since the state's abortion ban was put into place."
GOP governor halts push to prevent Trump from losing one of Nebraska's electoral votes,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-presidential-election-nebraska-5f8fb3b96cb0d3a6fe5cf70f6e13b2b4,2024-09-24T19:50:39Z,"An effort to prevent Donald Trump from losing a potentially crucial electoral vote from Nebraska appeared dead Tuesday after the state's Republican governor said he's not planning to push for the necessary change in state law ahead of the November presidential election.

Gov. Jim Pillen said that a proposal to alter how Nebraska would allocate its five electoral votes does not have the two-thirds majority it would need to pass and take effect in time. Pillen issued a statement the day after a Republican state senator said he wouldn't support such a measure ahead of the Nov. 5 election.

Only Nebraska and Maine split their electoral votes, awarding two each to the winner of the statewide vote and one to the winner in each congressional district. Republicans have carried Nebraska in every presidential election since 1964, but in 2020, Democrat Joe Biden won the electoral vote for Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District in the Omaha area -- ousting Trump from the White House.

The former president appeared resigned for now to having to fight for a fifth electoral vote from Nebraska.

""I LOVE OMAHA, and won it in 2016,"" Trump said Monday on his Truth Social media platform. ""Looks like I'll have to do it again!!!""

Republicans have only a small voter registration advantage in Nebraska's 2nd District, and 25% of its voters are unaffiliated. Democratic President Barack Obama won its electoral vote in 2008.

Both parties see a scenario for that single electoral vote to determine whether Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris wins the presidency, 270 electoral votes to 268 for Trump, or whether the tally is tied at 269 each. With a tie, the U.S. House of Representatives would make the final decision; with each state having one vote, the situation would favor Trump.

One scenario is that Harris wins three of the seven battleground states, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and Trump prevails in the others, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina.

Jane Kleeb, the chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party, said splitting the state's electoral vote ensures the outcome ""truly represents the will of the people without interference."" She issued her statement Monday, shortly after Republican state Sen. Mike McDonnell, of Omaha, said he wasn't backing off his previous opposition to a change.

""In this election and those to come, Nebraskans will continue to lead the way by electing leaders at every level who stand up for the people and respect our spirit of independence,"" Kleeb said.

Lawmakers are out of session and not scheduled to reconvene until January, so Pillen would have had to call them into a special session to make a change. He had said he wouldn't do that without a clear indication that a measure would pass.

A bill would have required an emergency clause to take effect immediately, and the state constitution requires a two-thirds majority for that, or 33 of 49 votes in Nebraska's unique, one-chamber Legislature. Supporters would also need a two-thirds majority to end a filibuster by opponents of the measure.

The 1991 law splitting the state's electoral votes was enacted under the state's last Democratic governor Ben Nelson, in part to lure presidential candidates to a state that otherwise would be ignored by them. Republicans have wanted to go back to a winner-take-all system for years but haven't mustered the two-thirds majority to pull it off.

While Nebraska's Legislature is officially nonpartisan, 33 seats are held by self-identified Republicans. McDonnell had identified himself as a Democrat but switched parties in April, citing the Democratic Party's censure of him last year over his support for abortion restrictions.

McDonnell said Monday that it was too close to the election to make a change and that lawmakers should put a state constitutional amendment on the ballot so that voters make the final decision. Almost 45% of the voters in his legislative district are registered Democrats, and fewer than 26% are Republicans.

Trump said on Truth Social that returning to a winner-take-all rule ""would have been better, and far less expensive, for everyone!"" He said McDonnell had ""no reason whatsoever"" to block ""a great Republican, common sense, victory.""

Pillen said he and others ""left every inch on the field"" in the push for a change, but McDonnell's opposition thwarted it.

""That is profoundly disappointing to me and the many others who have worked so earnestly to ensure all Nebraskans' votes are sought after equally this election,"" Pillen said."

Wendy Bach, profesora de la facultad de derecho de la Universidad de Tennessee y una de las investigadoras principales del proyecto, explic√≥ que uno de los casos fue el de una mujer que dio a luz en su casa a un beb√© muerto a los seis o siete meses de embarazo. Bach dijo que cuando la mujer fue a organizar el funeral, la funeraria alert√≥ a las autoridades y la mujer fue acusada de homicidio.

Debido a las disposiciones de confidencialidad del estudio, Bach no quiso revelar m√°s detalles. Pero √©ste fue uno de los 22 casos del estudio en los que muri√≥ un feto o un beb√©.

""Es un entorno en el que la p√©rdida del embarazo es potencialmente sospechosa desde el punto de vista penal"", declar√≥ en una entrevista Lourdes Rivera, presidenta de Pregnancy Justice.

Las investigadoras se√±alan que el recuento de casos desde el 24 de junio de 2022 hasta el 23 de junio de 2023 es inferior al real, al igual que las versiones anteriores. En consecuencia, no pueden asegurar que entre 1973 y 2022 no hubiera tantos casos como despu√©s de la sentencia Dobbs. Durante el periodo anterior, encontraron m√°s de 1.800 casos, con un m√°ximo de 160 en 2015 y 2017.

La mayor√≠a de los casos desde el fin de Roe incluyen cargos de abuso infantil, negligencia o puesta en peligro en los que el feto figuraba como v√≠ctima. La mayor√≠a inclu√≠a acusaciones de consumo de sustancias durante el embarazo, incluidas 133 en las que era la √∫nica acusaci√≥n. Seg√∫n el grupo, la mayor√≠a de los cargos no requieren pruebas de que el beb√© o el feto hayan sufrido da√±os reales."
Election 2024 Latest: Trump makes first campaign stop in Georgia since feud with Kemp ended,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-vance-walz-election-2024-georgia-dfc341985d7658e7b3cdddb26a989068,2024-09-24T15:58:07Z,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is making his first campaign visit to battleground Georgia since a feud between the former president and Republican Gov. Brian Kemp ended last month with Kemp endorsing Trump.

Trump is speaking Tuesday in Savannah, Georgia, which has one of the busiest ports in the country for cargo shipped in containers. He's set to reveal incentives for foreign firms to leave other countries and migrate to the U.S. The former president wants to personally recruit foreign companies and to send members of administration to do the same.

Some Republicans fear Georgia has gotten more politically competitive in the two months since Vice President Kamala Harris launched her presidential bid after President Joe Biden abandoned his reelection efforts. Harris spoke Friday in Atlanta, calling Trump a threat to women's freedoms and warning voters he would continue to limit access to abortion if elected president.

Trump's running mate JD Vance is holding a rally later this week in Georgia as well as paying a visit to Macon.

Georgia is one of several presidential swing states that have new or recently altered state laws setting the rules for November's election. In Georgia, election workers will have to hand count the number of ballots cast after voting is completed. In North Carolina, some students and university staff can use their digital IDs to vote. In Wisconsin, ballot drop boxes are newly legal again, although not every voting jurisdiction will use them.

Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris says she supports reforming Senate rules in order to pass a law that would restore abortion protections lost when Roe fell.

The rules are around the filibuster. When a senator wants to prevent a vote on a bill they refuse to yield the floor. And it takes 60 votes to force them to stand down -- and that means almost any major bill requires 60 votes to pass. The Senate is split 50-50 and the tie-breaking vote goes to the Vice President. But the rules mean GOP senators could block any effort to reform abortion rights.

Harris said on Wisconsin Public Radio that she favored eliminating the filibuster for Roe, to ""get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to put back into law the protections.""

It's a position President Joe Biden has also supported. He does not support eliminating it all together - just the exception to pass abortion rights.

A new survey finds that around 6 in 10 Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander registered voters have a very of somewhat favorable opinion of Harris, compared to just 3 in 10 for Trump.

AAPI voters are also more likely to believe that she is the candidate who better represents their background and policy views.

The survey from AAPI Data and APIAVote marks an increase in favorability for Harris since October 2023, when an AP-NORC/AAPI Data poll found that about half of AAPI adults had a somewhat or very favorable view of her. Opinions of Trump among this group have remained stable.

Harris is both Black and South Asian American, and has worked to rally AAPI voters in swing states like Georgia where their numbers are growing. But while the poll indicates that AAPI voters are much more likely to see their own cultural identity reflected in her than in Trump -- about half of AAPI voters say Harris better represents their background and culture, while only about 1 in 10 say this about Trump -- it's not clear how much this is influencing their perspectives on the candidates.

Trump spoke Monday to a small group of farmers in Smithton in rural Pennsylvania, breaking with his usual campaign form by listening more than he talked.

The former president asked questions and offered a few jokes. But he mostly listened quietly as farmers from the area explained their economic difficulties. Trump also stopped at a market and gave a woman checking out a $100 bill to help pay for groceries -- further showing off a softer side.

He reverted back to form during a raucous evening event in Indiana, Pennsylvania, sharply criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris and suggesting without evidence that this year's contest would be the last election should he lose.

""I don't like anybody that doesn't like me, I'll be honest,"" he said before adding, ""sounds childish"" but ""that's the way it is ... call it a personality defect.""

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz told a group of about 30 donors focused on climate change that Trump's energy catchphrase to ""drill baby, drill"" is ""not a solution to things, and the public knows that it's a cheap, easy thing.""

The Democratic vice presidential nominee, speaking at a midtown Manhattan hotel to an audience that included former presidential candidate Tom Steyer and Hollywood producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, called climate change an ""existential threat"" but also ""an incredible opportunity to grow our economy.""

Walz cited farmers who use their land to generate wind energy in addition to growing crops.

He also praised Harris for casting the tie-breaking vote in the U.S. Senate on the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden's 2022 law to flight climate change.

Walz is scheduled to speak at a series of fundraisers in New York on Monday.

Doppelgangers have been selected to help prepare for the vice presidential debate next week.

Walz's mock debates will feature Pete Buttigieg, the U.S. transportation secretary, playing JD Vance.

Meanwhile, Vance's preparations include Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer in the role of Walz.

The choices were disclosed by people with knowledge of the candidates' preparations"
"More women are charged with pregnancy-related crimes since Roe's end, study finds",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/pregnancy-crime-charges-dobbs-roe-a2aec34ac68ef582351d671a744a6ed9,2024-09-24T13:06:43Z,"It became more common for authorities to charge women with crimes related to their pregnancies after the fall of Roe v. Wade in 2022, a new study found -- even if they're almost never accused of violating abortion bans.

In the year after the U.S. Supreme Court ended the nationwide right to abortion in its Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling, at least 210 women across the country were charged with crimes related to their pregnancies, according to the report released by Pregnancy Justice, an advocacy organization. That's the highest number the group has identified over any 12-month period in research projects that have looked back as far as 1973.

Wendy Bach, a professor at the University of Tennessee College of Law and one of the lead researchers on the project, said one of the cases was when a woman delivered a stillborn baby at her home about six or seven months into pregnancy. Bach said that when the woman went to make funeral arrangements, the funeral home alerted authorities and the woman was charged with homicide.

Because of confidentiality provisions in the study, Bach would not reveal more details on the case. But it was one of 22 cases in the study that involved the death of a fetus or infant.

""It's an environment where pregnancy loss is potentially criminally suspect,"" Lourdes Rivera, president of Pregnancy Justice, said in an interview.

The researchers caution that the tally of cases from June 24, 2022, through June 23, 2023, is an undercount, as were earlier versions. As a result, they can't be positive there wasn't a stretch between 1973 and 2022 with as many cases as after the Dobbs ruling. During the earlier period, they found more than 1,800 cases -- peaking at about 160 in 2015 and 2017.

Most of the cases since Roe's end include charges of child abuse, neglect or endangerment in which the fetus was listed as the victim. Most involved allegations of substance use during pregnancy, including 133 where it was the only allegation. The group said most of the charges do not require proof that the baby or fetus was actually harmed.

Only one charge in the report alleged violations of an abortion ban -- and it was a law that was later overturned. Citing privacy concerns, the researchers did not identify the state where that charge originated. Four others involved abortion-related allegations, including evidence that a woman who was charged had abortion pills.

Bach pointed to the news organization ProPublica's reporting last week about two Georgia women whose deaths a state commission linked to the state law that bans abortion in most cases after the first six weeks of pregnancy. The family of one of them, Candi Miller, said she was avoiding seeking medical treatment after she took abortion pills for fear of being accused of a crime.

States with abortion bans -- including 14 that bar it at all stages of pregnancy and four, such as Georgia, where it's illegal after about the first six weeks -- have exceptions for women who self-manage abortions. But Bach said that people seeking abortion have been charged with other crimes.

""She did not want to seek help because of her fear that she would be prosecuted,"" Bach said. ""That is a really realistic fear.""

The majority of the cases in the study came from just two states: Alabama with 104 and Oklahoma with 68. The next state was South Carolina, with 10.

Rivera said a common thread of those three states -- which were also among the states with the most cases of pregnancy-related charges before the Dobbs ruling -- is that their supreme courts have issued opinions recognizing fetuses, embryos or fertilized eggs as having the rights of people.

Several states have laws that give fetuses at least some rights of people, and the concept received broad attention earlier this year when Alabama clinics suspended offering in vitro fertilization after a state Supreme Court ruling recognized embryos as ""extrauterine children"" in a wrongful death case brought by couples whose frozen embryos were destroyed in an accident. Within weeks, the Republicans who control the state government adopted a law to protect IFV providers from legal liability.

""We really need to separate health care from punishment,"" Rivera said. ""This just has tragic endings and does not properly address the problem. It creates more problems."""
Trump wants to lure foreign companies by offering them access to federal land,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-foreign-companies-investment-cb60395d632e7eaa2a398abcf616d1be,2024-09-24T12:54:54Z,"SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) -- Donald Trump's new idea to lure foreign companies to the U.S. is to offer them access to federal land.

In a visit to Georgia on Tuesday, the former president and GOP presidential nominee is set to unveil what is billed as ""a pitch to foreign companies"" to revive manufacturing. He teased the plan earlier this month when he proposed a cut to the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15%, but only for companies that produce in the U.S. His opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, wants to raise it to 28%. The corporate rate had been 35% when he became president in 2017, and he later signed a bill lowering it.

Trump has pressed Harris on the economy and proposed using tariffs on imports and other measures to boost American industry, even as economists warn U.S. consumers would bear the costs of tariffs and other Trump proposals like staging the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.

Up until now, Trump has mostly framed his economic approach with measures to punish companies that take their businesses offshore. But on Tuesday, he is set to reveal incentives for foreign firms to leave other countries and migrate to the U.S. The former president wants to personally recruit foreign companies and to send members of administration to do the same.

It is unclear whether foreign companies would be attracted by some of these incentives he says he will adopt if elected to the White House. The former president also had a spotty record in the White House of attracting foreign investment. For example, Trump promised a $10 billion investment by Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn in Wisconsin, creating potentially 13,000 new jobs, that the company never delivered.

It's also not clear how possible it is for a president to offer these perks to foreign corporations. The Bureau of Land Management has restrictions on foreign entities looking to lease lands. Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to an inquiry Monday night about whether companies from China would be excluded, given his longtime accusations that China is hurting American business.

The Republican presidential nominee is set to go over this plan in Savannah, Georgia, which has one of the busiest ports in the country for cargo shipped in containers.

It is Trump's first visit in this battleground state stop since a feud between the former president and the Republican Gov. Brian Kemp came to an end last month with the popular Georgia governor finally endorsing Trump.

Some Republicans have said they fear Georgia has gotten more politically competitive in the two months since Vice President Kamala Harris launched her presidential bid after President Joe Biden abandoned his reelection efforts. Harris gave a speech in Atlanta last Friday, calling Trump a threat to women's freedoms and warning voters he would continue to limit access to abortion if elected president.

Alsobrooks presses the case for national abortion rights in critical Maryland Senate race,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/senate-maryland-angela-alsobrooks-larry-hogan-9237eeff099768e04888bb53fb98baeb,2024-09-24T04:14:07Z,"GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) -- Angela Alsobrooks sees the erosion of reproductive freedom for women with her 19-year-old daughter in mind.

""She's a sophomore, and she literally has fewer rights in this moment than her grandmother and mother,"" Alsobrooks said in an interview with The Associated Press.

Alsobrooks' daughter, now entering her second year at Spelman College in Georgia, would have limited options under that state's new six-week abortion ban if she faced a decision about whether to end a pregnancy. Now locked in one of the nation's toughest U.S. Senate races in Maryland, and with Democrats' thin Senate majority on the line, Alsobrooks hopes to be able to do something to protect not just her daughter's autonomy but that of women throughout the United States with a new federal law protecting abortion rights.

Alsobrooks' Republican opponent, former Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, has said he, too, favors federal legislation to restore abortion rights nationwide. But Alsobrooks says the need to protect women's freedom to make those decisions for themselves is too important to risk giving Republicans a majority by electing the popular former governor in what is typically a reliably Democratic state.

""The question is not whether or not we like Larry Hogan,"" she said at a recent campaign stop in Columbia, Maryland. ""That is not the question. It's not even whether or not it's a good idea to vote for him for governor. The question we are answering is: Who should have the 51st vote?""

Alsobrooks, now the chief executive of Prince George's County in the suburbs of the nation's capital, said Hogan showed his true feelings on the issue as governor when he vetoed legislation to expand abortion access in 2022 by ending a restriction that only physicians provide abortions. Democrats who control the Maryland General Assembly overrode Hogan's veto.

""I think my opponent's record is very clear where abortion care is concerned,"" Alsobrooks said.

She also said she hears on the campaign trail how much abortion rights matter to voters.

""I hear it not just from women, but I've heard from a number of men who say that they want the freedom for their daughters and their granddaughters and that they're very concerned about the direction we're heading for people to make reproductive choices,"" Alsobrooks said.

Abortion rights in Georgia have been front and center in the presidential election, with Vice President Kamala Harris tying the state's six-week abortion ban to the deaths of two women who were unable to get the treatment they needed there.

Both Alsobrooks and Hogan have said they would co-sponsor federal legislation to codify the standard that existed before Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2022 into federal law. But Alsobrooks said Hogan's affiliation with his party would have a practical impact on whether that might happen.

""When we think for example about Roe and about codifying Roe, what we recognize is there will never be a vote as to whether or not we should codify Roe in federal law if the Republicans are in the majority,"" Alsobrooks said, ""because they have made it clear, they've essentially declared war on reproductive freedoms, and we know that that vote would never happen.""

During his Senate campaign, Hogan has emphasized his support for abortion rights. He said he would not support a federal abortion ban and strongly supports in-vitro fertilization.

""Unlike most of the candidates or most of the people on my side of the aisle who are running, I've said I would co-sponsor a bill to codify Roe,"" Hogan said in an interview last month.

Abortion rights will be on voters' minds in Maryland in another sense in November. It's one of at least nine states considering ballot questions to enshrine the right to abortion in the state's constitution. State ballot initiatives protecting abortion rights have been a winning issue even in conservative states like Kansas and Kentucky since the court turned the matter over to the states with its 2022 decision.

Hogan has won two statewide races, only the second time a Republican governor has been reelected in Maryland's history. That gave him an advantage in statewide name recognition from the start of the Senate race.

Still, Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1 in Maryland, and the GOP hasn't won a U.S. Senate seat in Maryland in more than 40 years. Hogan is also running for the first time on the same ballot as former President Donald Trump, who is deeply unpopular in Maryland.

Hogan has sharply criticized Trump over the years. He's also running with heightened attention from Democrats, due to the rarity of a critical Senate race in Maryland.

The former governor says this is ""a tougher race than my two races for governor,"" but Hogan says he's finding enthusiasm for his campaign from voters who see him as a key swing voice to push back ""against the extremes of both parties.""

""What I've said over and over again, I'm the underdog,"" Hogan said. ""It's nearly impossible to do what I'm trying to do, but we're pleased with where we are.""

But Alsobrooks brings vulnerabilities of her own to the race, including a new report from CNN that she improperly received property tax credits on two homes, which her campaign said she was unaware of and plans to repay.

She's also far less familiar to most Maryland voters than Hogan.

Alsobrooks defeated Maryland Rep. David Trone in the May Democratic primary by 10 percentage points, even after the congressman who co-founded the Total Wine and More liquor store chain spent more than $60 million of his personal fortune on his campaign.

Alsobrooks also has drawn significant audiences at campaign events, where she has expressed confidence while not underestimating Hogan.

""This one is not easy, either, in the general,"" Alsobooks said in the AP interview, which took place on Friday, before the CNN report. ""And the stakes are even higher, and Marylanders are very engaged and they're going to make a decision in this race to keep the Senate blue.""

With a victory, Alsobrooks would make Maryland history by becoming the state's first Black U.S. senator. An Alsobrooks victory would also restore female representation to the state's congressional delegation. While Maryland has had a long history of female officeholders in the delegation from both parties, Maryland's delegation to Washington has been all-male since former Sen. Barbara Mikulski retired in 2016 and Rep. Donna Edwards lost the primary to succeed her.

""It is a historic race, and I'm proud of that,"" Alsobrooks said. ""It was Sen. Barbara Mikulski who said for example that she was the first woman elected but didn't want to be the only, and so I think that the significance of electing a woman to the Senate is there.""

While Hogan has been campaigning on crime and the economy, Alsobrooks highlights her experience as county executive, focusing on economic development, as well as her work as state's attorney of Prince George's County, before she became county executive.

""As I've mentioned when I was the elected prosecutor, I oversaw a 50% cut in violence,"" Alsobrooks said. ""I am also the only person in this race who has prosecuted murderers and rapists and carjackers.""

At the campaign rally in Columbia, Alsobrooks reminded voters that a loss of Senate control by Democrats could impact future nominations to the Supreme Court.

""This is a clear reason why holding the majority is going to be really important,"" she said in the AP interview."
Florida officials pressure schools to roll back sex ed lessons on contraception and consent,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/florida-sex-education-curriculum-5b1a46f5a73e3122f4815cf1d439aef0,2024-09-23T22:19:58Z,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Some Florida school districts are rolling back a more comprehensive approach to sex education in favor of abstinence-focused lessons under pressure from state officials who have labeled certain instruction on contraception, anatomy and consent as inappropriate for students.

Officials from the Florida Department of Education, led by an appointee of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, have been directing some of the state's largest school districts to scale back their lesson plans not only on sexual activity, but on contraceptives, human development, abuse and domestic violence, as first reported by the Orlando Sentinel.

The shift reflects a nationwide push in conservative states to restrict what kids can learn about themselves and their bodies. Advocates are concerned that young people won't reliably be taught about adolescence, safe sex or relationship violence at a time when sexually transmitted infections have been on the rise and access to abortion is being increasingly restricted.

Under recent changes to state law, it's now up to the Florida Department of Education to sign off on school districts' curriculum on reproductive health and disease education if they use teaching materials other than the state's designated textbook.

About a dozen districts across Florida have been told by state officials to restrict their sex ed instruction plans, said Elissa Barr, a professor of public health at the University of North Florida and the chair of the Florida Healthy Youth Alliance, which advises school districts on developing and implementing comprehensive sex education programs.

Barr says comprehensive sex ed isn't just about reducing teen pregnancy and protecting young people against HIV, at a time when Florida is reporting more HIV diagnoses than almost any other state, according to health policy research nonprofit KFF.

""Sex ed is sexual abuse prevention. It's dating violence prevention. And it just helps young people develop healthier relationships and actually delay sexual initiation,"" Barr told The Associated Press. ""We still have 1 in 4 teens pregnant at least once before age 20. So for us to cut contraceptive information and education is really doing young people a disservice. It's very harmful.""

Research has shown that comprehensive sex ed is associated with teens waiting longer to have sex for the first time, as well as reduced rates of teen pregnancy and STIs and the prevention of sexual abuse.

A spokesperson for the Florida Department of Education defended the state's approach, highlighting the importance of abstinence and recent changes to state law that require schools to teach that ""reproductive roles"" are ""binary, stable, and unchangeable.""

""Florida law requires schools to emphasize the benefits of sexual abstinence as the expected standard and the consequences of teenage pregnancy,"" department communications director Sydney Booker said. ""A state government should not be emphasizing or encouraging sexual activity among children or minors and is therefore right to emphasize abstinence.""

In Broward County Public Schools, which includes Fort Lauderdale and is the nation's sixth largest school district, state officials told the district that pictures of reproductive anatomy and demonstrations on how to use contraceptives ""should not be included in any grade level,"" according to a staff memo that was shared with the AP.

Florida Department of Education officials also told the district to remove the words ""abuse, consent, and domestic violence"" from a proposed lesson for first graders and replace it with language that's considered more age-appropriate, such as ""talking to a trusted adult when they feel uncomfortable.""

Barr said the concerns expressed about curriculum were ""inconsistent"" from district to district and were communicated verbally, not over email.

A representative for Orange County Public Schools, which includes Orlando, said the district revised its teaching plans in response to ""verbal feedback"" from the department.

""FDOE strongly recommended the district utilize the state adopted text,"" district spokesperson Michael Ollendorff said.

Under Florida law, schools don't have to teach sex ed. If they do offer lessons, they must emphasize abstinence as the ""expected standard."" Florida parents have the right to opt their students out of that instruction, though surveys show the general public overwhelmingly supports schools teaching sex ed.

""Take politics out of it, take religion out of it and really focus on the science and what works for young people,"" Barr said. ""We have the answer, and it's comprehensive sex ed.""

A state senator has thwarted a GOP effort to lock down all of Nebraska's electoral votes for Trump,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-presidential-election-nebraska-9e50607926915b1a6b34a8d1ac2fd40f,2024-09-23T20:10:31Z,"A Republican effort to lock down all of Nebraska's electoral votes for former President Donald Trump appeared doomed Monday when a state lawmaker denied backers his crucial support for the move.

GOP Sen. Mike McDonnell of Omaha said in a statement that he opposes awarding Nebraska's five electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, like 48 other states do. Nebraska and Maine give two electoral votes to the candidate who wins statewide and one vote to the winner in each congressional district.

McDonnell's position means Republicans don't have the two-thirds majority they'd need in Nebraska's unique, one-chamber Legislature to pull off a change ahead of the Nov. 5 election.

Here's a look at why Trump's allies were pushing for the change, what it would have taken to succeed and why a single state lawmaker is in the national spotlight.

Nebraska is one of nine states that Republican candidates have carried in every presidential election since 1964, but it hasn't had a winner-take-all rule since 1991. And most times since 1991, Republican candidates still have captured all of the state's votes.

But in 2020, Democrat Joe Biden captured the vote for the 2nd Congressional District in the Omaha area. President Barack Obama also did it in 2008.

A presidential candidate needs 270 of 538 electoral votes to win. One scenario is that Democrat Kamala Harris, the vice president, wins the battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, while Trump wins the other four -- North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. Harris would have 269 electoral votes to Trump's 268, which would include four from Nebraska.

In that scenario, a Trump victory in Nebraska's 2nd District would create a 269-269 tie and throw the final decision to the U.S. House of Representatives, where each state would have one vote, a situation that would favor Trump. If Harris carried the district, she'd be president.

In the 2nd District, Republicans have only a small voter registration advantage and 25% of its voters are unaffiliated with any party.

McDonnell said he has told Republican Gov. Jim Pillen that he won't back a change in the Nebraska law for allocating its electoral votes ahead of this year's election. That's consistent with what he's said previously.

Lawmakers are out of session and not scheduled to reconvene until January, so Pillen would have had to call them into a special session. He has said he wouldn't do that without a clear indication that a measure could reach his desk.

""After deep consideration, it is clear to me that right now, 43 days from Election Day, is not the moment to make this change,"" McDonnell said.

McDonnell is term-limited and will leave office in early January. He said he is encouraging Pillen and the Legislature to propose an amendment to the state constitution next year on how Nebraska awards its electoral votes, so that voters have the final say.

""Nebraska voters, not politicians of either party, should have the final say on how we pick a President,"" McDonnell said.

Republicans in Nebraska have wanted to return to a winner-take-all rule for years but have been unable to get to a legislative supermajority.

Officially, the Nebraska Legislature is nonpartisan. However, self-identified Republicans hold 33 of 49 seats, exactly a two-thirds majority.

The GOP reached that margin in April, when McDonnell switched parties, citing the Democratic Party's censure of him last year for supporting abortion restrictions.

The switch had Trump loyalists in the Nebraska GOP buzzing about going back to a winner-take-all system. Recently, Trump's allies and even the former president himself have been pressuring Republican officials to try.

But in McDonnell's 5th Legislative District, almost 45% of the voters are registered Democrats, and their party strongly opposes going back to winner take all. Fewer than 26% of the district's voters are Republicans.

Under the Nebraska Constitution, new laws don't take effect until three months after lawmakers adjourn -- too late for the proposal to affect the Nov. 5 election.

The state constitution does allow the Legislature to add an emergency clause to have a law take effect immediately, but a bill with an emergency clause must pass with a two-thirds majority.

The Legislature's rules also require the same two-thirds majority to end a filibuster blocking a measure.

Backers of dropping the winner-take-all rule in 1991 argued that it would better reflect voters' views and attract candidates to a state that otherwise would be ignored.

The change narrowly passed the Legislature during then-Democratic Gov. Ben Nelson's first year in office. Nelson was the last Democrat to win a governor's race, when voters reelected him in 1994."
Mark Robinson vows to rebuild his staff for North Carolina governor as Republican group backs away,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mark-robinson-north-carolina-governor-election-631e4b5565717ea012c1e9233495198c,2024-09-23T19:53:55Z,"WILKESBORO, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina Republican gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson vowed Monday to rebuild his campaign staff after several top aides quit and a key Republican group backed away from his race following a CNN report alleging he made explicit racial and sexual posts years ago on a pornography website's message board.

Robinson, the sitting lieutenant governor, revealed Sunday that his campaign's senior adviser, campaign manager and two other top staffers had stepped down. The senior adviser said separately that four other top aides also had quit.

And the Republican Governors Association -- anticipated to run ads to boost Robinson's bid into the fall and criticize Democratic rival Josh Stein -- sounded ready to move on to other races. Recent polls have shown Stein, the current attorney general, ahead of Robinson. Stein also has outspent Robinson on the airwaves.

""We don't comment on internal strategy or investment decisions, but we can confirm what's public -- our current media buy in North Carolina expires tomorrow, and no further placements have been made,"" association spokesperson Courtney Alexander said Monday. ""RGA remains committed to electing Republican Governors all across the country.""

Robinson, who would be North Carolina's first Black governor if elected, has denied writing the messages from more than a decade ago, well before he became active in politics, calling them ""salacious tabloid lies."" Fellow Republican leaders are suggesting Robinson, with a long history of inflammatory comments, must make a credible defense, or his gubernatorial bid is washed up.

Speaking after a campaign event Monday morning in the northwestern North Carolina mountains, Robinson said his campaign is ""getting offers from all over"" to help work for it.

""We're right in the process right now of forming a team that we know can still lead us to victory,"" Robinson said at a bakery in Wilkesboro, about 80 miles (129 kilometers) north of Charlotte. ""So we have full confidence in our ability to keep going.""

The CNN report last week unearthed posts it said Robinson left on a porn site's message boards in which he referred to himself as a ""black NAZI;"" said he enjoyed transgender pornography; said in 2012 he preferred Hitler to then-President Barack Obama; and slammed the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as ""worse than a maggot.""

Robinson also finds himself separated from Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who endorsed Robinson for governor before the March primary and has given him the stage to speak at his in-state rallies. Robinson was not involved in Saturday's Trump rally in Wilmington, and Trump didn't mention him. Trump has scheduled another North Carolina event for Wednesday in suburban Charlotte.

Talking to reporters in Wilkesboro, Robinson said his campaign is talking about taking CNN ""to task for what they have done to us ... you better understand I am coming after CNN full throttle."" CNN provided no comment Monday.

Last week, CNN said it had matched details of an account on the pornographic website forum to other online accounts held by Robinson by comparing usernames, a known email address and his full name. CNN reported that details discussed by the account holder matched Robinson's age, length of marriage and other biographical information..

In a speech to supporters at Vernon's Cake Carousel, Robinson tried to focus on campaign issues like the economy, emphasizing public safety, public education, healthcare, infrastructure and housing. He referred briefly to his working-class history, saying he knows what it's like to lose a job because the work is being moved to Mexico.

Robinson was elected lieutenant governor in his first bid for public office in 2020. He tells a life story that includes childhood poverty, personal bankruptcy and religious renewal.

Considered a rising star in the party, he has been well-known for his fiery speeches and evocative rhetoric. Trump had previously called Robinson ""Martin Luther King on steroids"" for his speaking ability.

Stein and his allies have blitzed TV and the internet with commercials and footage of Robinson making incendiary comments. In a 2021 speech in a church, Robinson used the word ""filth"" when discussing gay and transgender people. On a Facebook post in 2019, Robinson said abortion in America is about ""killing the child because you weren't responsible enough to keep your skirt down or your pants up -- and not get pregnant by your own choice because you felt like getting your groove thing on."""
Trump will attend Al Smith charity dinner that Harris is skipping to campaign in battleground state,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-al-smith-dinner-29262d451fba2b564b39d8309a504a88,2024-09-23T18:37:51Z,"Donald Trump confirmed Monday that he would be the sole featured speaker at this year's Al Smith charity dinner in New York, typically a good-humored and bipartisan political event that Vice President Kamala Harris said she is skipping in favor of battleground state campaigning.

The former president and current Republican presidential nominee confirmed in a Truth Social post on Monday that he would speak at the Oct. 17 dinner, calling it ""sad, but not surprising"" that Harris had opted not to attend.

The gala benefiting Catholic Charities traditionally has been used to promote collegiality, with presidential candidates from both parties appearing on the same night and trading barbs. But on Saturday, Harris' campaign said the Democratic nominee would not go to the event, breaking with presidential tradition so she could campaign instead in a battleground state less than three weeks before Election Day.

Harris' team wants her to spend as much time as possible in the battleground states that will decide the election rather than in heavily Democratic New York, a campaign official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss campaign plans and confirming a decision first reported by CNN. Her team told organizers that she would be willing to attend as president if she's elected, the official said.

Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who plays a prominent role in the dinner, has been highly critical of Democrats, writing a 2018 Wall Street Journal op-ed that carried the headline, ""The Democrats Abandon Catholics."" In his Truth Social post, Trump said Harris ""certainly hasn't been very nice"" to Catholics, saying that Catholic voters who support her ""should have their head examined.""

A Harris campaign official said Catholics for Harris-Walz is working to register people to vote and get involved in outreach across the country. Trump's post stems in part from 2018 questions that then-Sen. Harris posed to a federal judicial nominee about his membership in the Knights of Columbus, a lay Catholic fraternal organization. Harris asked the nominee if he agreed with the anti-abortion views of the group's leader, views that broadly align with the church's stance.

The Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner is named for the former New York governor, a Democrat and the first Roman Catholic to be nominated for president by a major party. He was handily defeated by Herbert Hoover in 1928. The dinner raises millions of dollars for Catholic charities and has traditionally shown that those vying to lead the nation can get along, or pretend to, for one night.

It's become a tradition for presidential candidates ever since Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy appeared together in 1960. In 1996, the Archdiocese of New York decided not to invite then-President Bill Clinton and his Republican challenger, Bob Dole, reportedly because Clinton vetoed a late-term abortion ban.

Trump and Joe Biden, who is Catholic, both spoke at the fundraiser in 2020 when it was moved online because of COVID-19. Amid the pandemic and economic woes, there was no joking, and both candidates instead used their speeches to appeal to Catholic voters.

Both Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton attended in 2016. Trump was booed after calling Clinton corrupt and claiming she hated Catholics.

Trump is set to travel to Pennsylvania stops focused on countering China,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-trump-harris-china-dc1e402d7d829acc904a4326370ac04a,2024-09-23T14:16:43Z,"PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Donald Trump is back on the campaign trail Monday and expected to travel to the swing state of Pennsylvania to speak about his plans to counter the U.S. reliance on China with a group led by a loyalist who served as his top intelligence official.

The former president and Republican presidential nominee is attending the 3 p.m. Eastern event in a rural area outside of Pittsburgh hosted by the Protecting America Initiative, which is led by Richard Grenell, Trump's former acting director of national intelligence, and former New York congressman Lee Zeldin.

Trump has embraced tariffs as he tries to appeal to working-class voters who oppose free-trade deals and the outsourcing of factories and jobs. The event on Monday focuses on proposals to increase America's food supply and to protect U.S. farmers.

The National Agricultural Law Center estimates 24 states ban or limit foreigners without residency and foreign businesses or governments from owning private farmland. The issue emerged after a Chinese billionaire bought more than 130,000 acres near a U.S. Air Force base in Texas and another Chinese company sought to build a corn plant near an Air Force base in North Dakota.

Later on Monday, Trump is expected to rally voters at 7 p.m. Eastern in Indiana, Pennsylvania, a town east of Pittsburgh, where he is hoping conservative, white working-class voters help him pull ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris, his opponent. Harris is also visiting Pennsylvania on Wednesday.

On Sunday, Trump shared that he doesn't ""think"" he'd run again for president in 2028 if he loses the 2024 election. The comment was noteworthy both because Trump seemed to rule out a fourth bid for the White House and because he rarely admits the possibility he could legitimately lose an election. Trump flirted with running for president for years before his successful 2016 bid and has often played up his deliberations to stay in the headlines.

His running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, meanwhile is visiting North Carolina, where Trump rallied on Saturday, making direct appeals to women on the issue of reproductive rights. The former president argued women would be safe and prosperous and would ""no longer be thinking about abortion."" They are both navigating the fallout from an explosive CNN report where North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, a Republican running for governor, made racial and sexual comments on a website where he also referred to himself as a ""black NAZI.""

Robinson had been a frequent presence at Trump's North Carolina campaign stops. The Republican presidential nominee referred to him as ""Martin Luther King on steroids"" for his speaking style. But on his Saturday rally in Wilmington, Trump campaigned without him and did not mention him by name."
Most Hispanic Americans  --  whether Catholic or Protestant  -- support abortion access: AP-NORC poll,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hispanic-americans-election-2024-abortion-trump-harris-3fcad2d82d2e1a1d7e0e415720337124,2024-09-23T12:07:29Z,"For decades, some political analysts have sought to depict Hispanic Americans as ""socially conservative"" -- and indeed many of them are.

But a new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that a solid majority of this diverse population -- whether they're Catholic, Protestant or religiously unaffiliated -- believe abortion should be legal in most or all cases.

It's a finding of interest as debate over abortion access is in the spotlight ahead of the U.S. election on Nov. 5.

The Democrat's presidential candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, strongly supports abortion rights. Her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, boasts about appointments he made to the Supreme Court that led to repeal of the nationwide right to abortion.

Overall, the new AP-NORC poll, conducted Sept. 12-16, found that Hispanic Protestants and Catholics -- despite their theological differences -- are remarkably similar in their demographic makeup and views on major issues, including abortion and immigration.

According to the poll, about 4 in 10 U.S. Hispanics identify as Catholic, about one-third as Protestant or ""other Christian,"" and about one-quarter as religiously unaffiliated. About half of the Protestants identified as evangelical or born-again, as did about 10% of the Catholics.

Around 6 in 10 Hispanic Protestants and about two-thirds of Hispanic Catholics say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. A similar share think Congress should pass a law guaranteeing access to legal abortions nationwide.

That's similar to other major religious groups in the U.S. except for white evangelical Protestants; only about one-quarter of them say abortion should be legal in all or most cases.

Overall, a majority of U.S. Catholics from multiple demographics support abortion-rights, even though the Catholic hierarchy describes opposition to abortion as its preeminent priority.

Ali Valenzuela, an American University professor of government who studies Latino politics, said many Hispanics used to be anti-abortion, primarily because of their religiosity.

He attributed the shift in viewpoints to ""the changed political reality"" after the Supreme Court's 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade, which put abortion access at risk in many states.

About 4 in 10 Hispanic Protestant and Catholic registered voters said abortion policy is among the most important issues for their vote in November. They were more likely to say the economy, health care, crime and immigration are among the most important issues.

Regarding the presidential race, Hispanics were largely divided in their assessments of Harris and Trump. Harris was viewed somewhat or very favorably by about 4 in 10 Hispanic Protestants and about half of Hispanic Catholics, and Trump was viewed favorable by about 4 in 10 Hispanic Protestants and Catholics.

Lorraine Martinez, a 68-year-old Californian, said she was raised Catholic. While she's not a regular churchgoer now, her upbringing in the faith informs her values to ""take care of your neighbor, be kind and not cruel.""

She said her 35 years as a schoolteacher inform her priorities this election season: immigration and education.

""To see (migrant) kids come in and they're flourishing, and the acceptance of the other children for them is phenomenal,"" said Martinez, who remembers Vietnamese refugees in her school starting in the 1980s and different groups of immigrants since.

Martinez, who plans to vote for Harris, added she strongly opposes mass deportations and family separations.

She also supports legal access to abortion, viewing reproductive health issues, including IVF treatments, as something women should decide without governmental interference.

Pam Butcher, 54, from Waverly, West Virginia -- whose mother's family came to the U.S. from Mexico -- is a Trump supporter who says abortion should be illegal in most cases.

""It's very important to me; I'm pro-life,"" Butcher said. ""I mean, if a mother's life is in danger, then it has to be done in order to save her, and if that's her choice, possibly rape and incest ... but to me, it's murder.""

Trump, she said, ""didn't outlaw abortion, but instead gave the states back their rights"" on a highly contentious issue.

Butcher attends a Protestant church and says her faith is important in her daily life as well as her decision to vote for Trump.

""The country was founded on religious principles,"" she said. ""I don't think that religion should be forced on anyone. But I also don't believe that it should be forced out of everything either.""

Gabriela Maldonaldo, 20, a Catholic from Chicago, also said she's voting for Trump.

She said she opposes abortion, while adding that sometimes it's a medical necessity. She believes Republicans will be better able to handle other issues that are important to her, including the economy, crime and immigration.

To Californian Haylee Rader, 21, the top issue this election season is inflation. ""It's hard even to afford a gallon of milk, and gas is really high,"" said the community college student, adding that her mother, who's Latina, has to drive half an hour to work.

On immigration, Rader believes that ""just crossing over is wrong,"" and that the government needs a better system to legally process those who come seeking safety in the United States.

In the poll, about half of Hispanic Protestant and Catholic registered voters said immigration is one of the most important issues for their vote; only about 1 in 10 in each group said it's not important.

Roughly 6 in 10 Hispanic Protestants and Catholics said religious groups should provide assistance to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. That's in line with the views of Americans overall.

Neither Trump nor Harris has an edge among Latino Catholics on their handling of immigration. Latino Protestants are slightly more likely to say they trust Trump to handle the issue.

--Hispanic Protestants and Catholics have similar patterns of church attendance. About 2 in 10 say they attend church once a week or several times a week, about 4 in 10 attend at least once a month, and about 2 in 10 never attend.

--About 7 in 10 Hispanic Catholics say they speak a language other than English at home, compared to about half of Hispanic Protestants.

--About 6 in 10 Hispanic Catholics have a somewhat or very favorable view of Pope Francis, compared to about 3 in 10 Hispanic Protestants. Overall, 4 in 10 Americans view Francis favorably.

The diverse political views of Hispanic Americans is reflected on several fronts in the ongoing election campaign. For example, there are Hispanic American candidates in two of the most closely contested U.S. Senate races.

U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego, a Democrat running in Arizona, is the son of immigrants from Colombia and Mexico. Bernie Moreno, a Republican running in Ohio, emigrated with his family from Colombia when he was a child.

And there are sharp contrasts related to abortion.

Samuel Rodriguez, who heads the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, published an op-ed on Fox News this month saying the Democrats' full-throated support for abortion access might alienate some Hispanic Americans who are open to restrictions on abortions later in pregnancy.

""The Democratic Party has now shifted dramatically to an 'abortion on demand' policy, which includes late-term abortions,"" wrote Rodriguez, a pastor in California. ""This extreme position deeply unsettles many Latinos, particularly those of faith.""

In New Mexico, meanwhile, Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced that construction is getting underway on a state-funded abortion clinic that will serve local residents and people traveling from neighboring states such as Texas and Oklahoma with sweeping bans on abortion.

""This clinic will stand as a testament to our state's commitment to reproductive freedom,"" Lujan Grisham said.

The poll of 2,028 adults was conducted Sept. 12-16, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

Harris owns a gun? Trump wants to cap credit card rates? Party lines blur in campaign's last stretch,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-policy-border-guns-credit-card-ivf-democrat-republican-87cd75cfa0d82b0e2b026c69278ff912,2024-09-23T04:05:02Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- One presidential candidate is talking up gun ownership and promising tough border security measures. The other vows to cap credit card interest rates and force insurance companies to cover in vitro fertilization.

Which one is the Democrat and the Republican?

The lines that have long defined each party's policy priorities are blurring as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump seek to expand their coalition in the final weeks of a fiercely competitive election. The contest may well hinge on how many disaffected suburban Republicans vote for Harris and how much of the Democrats' traditional base -- African Americans, Latinos, young people and labor union members -- migrates to Trump.

That's prompting both candidates to take stances that would have once been anathema to their bases, scrambling longtime assumptions about what each party stands for.

""There's a whole host of issues that draw people to support President Trump, and quite frankly, these are issues that used to be core pillar issues of the Democratic Party,"" Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii who has emerged as a top Trump ally, said in an interview.

Barbara Comstock, who co-chaired Nikki Haley's GOP presidential campaign earlier this year, is now backing Harris. A former Republican congresswoman from Virginia, she marveled at feeling more aligned with Democrats this year, pointing to Harris' call for an expanded child care tax credit, support for a tough bipartisan immigration bill and a foreign policy stance that Comstock said was in stark contrast to Trump's admiration for leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""As a Republican, I feel like, hey, the Democrats are on my side now,"" Comstock said in an interview.

Of course, Trump has broken from the GOP's traditional conservative values on issues like trade and foreign policy for much of the past decade. But he has gone further this fall, testing the loyalty of social and small-government conservatives with an agenda that downplays his opposition to abortion and calls for significant government intervention in health care and the economy.

Trump last week said he wanted the federal government to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, a move that quickly irked fiscal conservatives. He said last month he supports a federal law that would force insurance companies to pay for IVF, frustrating some social conservatives who believe the embryos used in the process should be protected. Republicans in Congress have repeatedly voted against the issue.

Gabbard declined to say whether she views Trump as a conservative, instead describing his policy approach as ""common sense.""

In addition to IVF, she pointed to the Trump-backed criminal justice reform that reduced sentences for many inmates. She also highlighted a foreign policy philosophy that seeks to avoid U.S. involvement in global conflicts like the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

""A lot of political independents and a lot of Democrats don't recognize the Democrat Party of today where not a single Democrat in the House or Senate is standing up and saying we need to bring an end to the war in Ukraine,"" Gabbard said.

Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., both former Democrats, have emerged as the Trump campaign's most visible national surrogates in his bid to win over undecided Democrats and independents. The campaign has been slow to embrace other would-be allies, including Haley, who issued her first fundraising appeal on Trump's behalf just last week.

By comparison, Harris has adopted a more organized program to connect with Republican voters.

In recent days, her campaign has hosted events around abortion rights, border security and small business creation that featured Republican officials. Seven Republicans were granted speaking slots at the Democratic National Convention last month. And a slew of outside groups are spending millions of dollars to help Harris connect with disaffected Republicans, including Republican Voters Against Trump and the Anti-Psychopath PAC.

At the same time, Harris has embraced a much more muscular foreign policy. She has vowed to feature a Republican in her Cabinet if elected. And she is speaking more openly about owning a gun -- and her willingness to use it.

""I'm a gun owner,"" Harris told Oprah Winfrey late last week.

""I did not know that!"" the television star, a Harris supporter, said in surprise.

""If somebody breaks in my house they're getting shot. Sorry,"" Harris responded with a laugh.

Harris' support for robust U.S. leadership on the global stage has already helped her win the support of more than 100 Republican national security and foreign policy officials who previously served under Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Trump himself. Former Vice President Dick Cheney is among the notable converts.

While Harris and Trump are embracing policies that appeal to the other side, their priorities still largely align with their party's tradition.

Trump opposes abortion rights and says he is proud that the Supreme Court he transformed with conservative appointees overturned Roe v. Wade. He says abortion laws should be left to states, but he plans to vote this fall to uphold a Florida law that bans all abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, before many women realize they're pregnant.

The Republican former president has promised the largest deportation in U.S. history and pledges to finish a massive border wall to stop illegal immigration. He calls climate change ""a hoax"" and has outlined an energy plan that offers strong support for the fossil fuel industry. He wants to expand tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the richest Americans. He opposes virtually all restrictions on gun ownership. And he strongly opposes diversity and inclusion initiatives designed to promote civil rights.

Still, his team believes his policy platform offers much for persuadable Democrats to like.

Trump spokesman Brian Hughes argued that the GOP nominee has appeal among African Americans, Hispanics and labor union members. Notably, the Teamsters Union, which has long supported Democrats, announced last week it would not endorse either presidential candidate, which was viewed as a big win for Trump.

""We are already demonstrably inside their base no matter how hard they insist we're not,"" Hughes said.

Harris, meanwhile, has only just begun to articulate specific policy plans, having been in the presidential race for just eight weeks. But her record and her recent statements make clear that she favors liberal policies in most cases.

Harris supports abortion rights as they were protected under Roe. She backs a ban on assault weapons and wants to extend to all Americans the $35 cap on insulin and $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket prescription drug spending enacted for seniors under President Joe Biden. She called for a ban on price gouging for groceries while pushing for a pathway to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally.

She has pledged bold action to combat climate change, although she says she supports fracking -- a shift from her position in 2020. She supports labor unions. And she supports voting rights legislation designed to combat racial discrimination.

""Vice President Harris' focus on opportunity and freedom speaks to fundamental American values that transcend party lines,"" said Harris spokesperson Mia Ehrenberg. ""Any American looking to turn the page on Trump's chaos and division and chart a new way forward for America has a home in Vice President Harris' campaign."""
"North Carolina's Robinson, omitted from Trump rally, avoids comment on report about online posts",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-governor-mark-robinson-5fa5e739329bbabbc7cc0c9ed286ed23,2024-09-22T16:59:16Z,"FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson avoided directly weighing in during a gubernatorial campaign event Saturday on a CNN report outlining evidence that he made disturbing posts on a pornography website's message board more than a decade ago.

And Robinson, a Republican who normally functions as one of Donald Trump's top surrogates in battleground North Carolina, was not mentioned by the former president and current presidential candidate during a Saturday speech elsewhere in the state that lasted just over an hour.

In his first public appearance since Thursday's CNN report, Robinson spent several minutes Saturday evening speaking and leading a prayer at the Fayetteville Motor Speedway. He didn't mention the CNN report or answer questions from reporters on hand, according to news reports.

""We're going to focus on the issues that you are concerned with,"" Robinson said. ""While everybody else wants to focus on the garbage, and the trash that tries to besmirch people, we're out here telling people about what we want to do, how we want to partner with you to make this state better and help North Carolina be better.""

Robinson earlier denied writing the posts, which include lewd and racist comments, saying Thursday that he wouldn't be forced out of the race by ""salacious tabloid lies.""

He directed his focus on other issues Saturday. ""We're going to work our butts off to make sure that we build an economy in this state that works for everybody,"" Robinson said.

His appearance Saturday came the same day Trump held a presidential campaign event in Wilmington.

Trump's campaign has appeared to distance itself from Robinson in the wake of the CNN reporting, which the AP has not independently verified, saying in a statement that Trump ""is focused on winning the White House and saving this country"" and calling North Carolina ""a vital part of that plan"" without mentioning Robinson.

Robinson has been a frequent presence at Trump's North Carolina campaign stops. The Republican presidential nominee has referred to Robinson, who is Black, as ""Martin Luther King on steroids"" and has long praised him.

Robinson has a long history of making inflammatory comments, including suggesting women who sought abortion ""weren't responsible enough to keep your skirt down"" and comparing abortion to slavery.

Already before CNN's report, Robinson was trailing in several recent polls to Democratic nominee Josh Stein, the state attorney general. Robinson has vowed to remain in the race.

Stein said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that Robinson is ""utterly unqualified, unfit to be the governor of North Carolina, and we're going to do everything in our power to keep that from happening.""

Polls show Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris locked in a close race in North Carolina and nationally. Democrats have seized on the opportunity to highlight Trump's ties to Robinson, with billboards showing the two together and a new ad from Harris' campaign highlighting the Republican candidates' ties, as well as Robinson's support for a statewide abortion ban without exceptions.

On Sunday, Republican U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that Robinson deserves a chance to defend himself against the allegations, which Graham described as ""unnerving."" He said Robinson is ""a political zombie if he does not offer a defense to this that's credible,"" while arguing the issue wouldn't hurt Trump.

""If they're true, he's unfit to serve for office,"" Graham said of Robinson and the claims in the CNN report. ""If they're not true, he has the best lawsuit in the history of the country for libel."""
"Kamala Harris to skip Al Smith dinner, a traditional event for major presidential candidates",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-al-smith-dinner-109cbfcdb2693c960483b8d4843cd704,2024-09-21T21:35:51Z,"PHOENIX (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris will skip this year's Al Smith charity dinner in New York, breaking with presidential tradition so she can campaign instead in a battleground state less than three weeks before Election Day.

The dinner benefitting Catholic Charities traditionally has been used to promote collegiality and good humor, with presidential candidates from both parties appearing on the same night and trading barbs.

"Euphoric two years ago, US anti-abortion movement is now divided and worried as election nears",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/anti-abortion-election-2024-roe-v-wade-62364f84be8c1a9fd112b1f3fa0870ae,2024-09-21T12:22:56Z,"Just two years ago, leading anti-abortion activists were euphoric as the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, thus ending the nationwide right to abortion.

Now, with a presidential election fast approaching, their movement is disunited and worried. Within their own ranks, there is second-guessing and finger-pointing, plus trepidation that Election Day might provide new proof that their cause is broadly unpopular.

Michael New, an abortion opponent who teaches social research at The Catholic University of America, offered an overview of how the movement had fared since the Roe ruling in June 2022.

""Things have not necessarily unfolded as we would hope,"" he wrote in an email to The Associated Press. ""There is certainly a sense among pro-life leaders that we should have had a stronger post-Roe game plan in place.""

""I always remind fellow pro-lifers that we were never promised a smooth glide path to victory,"" he added. ""There will certainly be setbacks and disappointments along the way.""

A key reason for the wariness is the anti-abortion movement's recent losing streak on abortion-related ballot measures in seven states, including conservative Kansas and Kentucky. Nine more states will consider constitutional amendments enshrining abortion rights in the Nov. 5 election -- Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada and South Dakota. In several of them, abortion opponents tried various unsuccessful strategies for blocking the measures.

""Pro-life people don't wear rose-colored glasses; we know we have a huge task ahead of us,"" Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, told the AP. ""Because of the massive amounts of money being dumped into the ballot measures from those allied with the abortion industry and the Democratic Party, it's an uphill battle.""

""We will continue to educate, to make people aware of the catastrophic result if these measures pass,"" she added. ""I have not seen flagging energy or any loss of determination among pro-life people.""

Texas is among the Republican-governed states that have enacted near-total abortion bans. Yet nationally, Texas Right to Life president John Seago said, the anti-abortion movement ""is in a critical chapter right now.""

""Following a historic legal victory, we have realized that while we had enjoyed massive legislative and legal victories in the last decade, public opinion had not followed the same trajectory,"" he added.

Troy Newman, who heads the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, recently published an online opinion piece assailing the movement he's been a part of for 25 years.

""The tide has turned, and the pro-life message is now considered a political liability that could prevent President Trump's victorious return to the White House,"" Newman wrote.

""After evaluating the terrible mistakes of the pro-life movement over the last several years, I can only conclude that it is our fault,"" Newman wrote. ""We have had over 50 years to change the culture's position on abortion only to have failed miserably.""

In an interview with the AP, Newman blamed those in his own ranks for the predicament -- saying some anti-abortion leaders should have been more adamant in their positions. ""We lose the minute we stop focusing on the babies,"" he said.

Kristan Hawkins, leader of Students for Life of America, suggested via email that Newman's views were ill-suited to the post-Roe era. She said the students in her organization were embracing the challenges of a state-by-state playing field.

But she acknowledged the magnitude of the challenges.

""I actually believe the biggest threat is ourselves -- our mindsets -- which will lead to decreased recruitment, training, and mobilization of our grassroots army of love,"" she wrote recently in the conservative outlet Townhall.

""Look at the struggles we face this fall with several late-term abortion ballot referendums,"" she added. ""Most will likely be a political loss for our movement because, in most states, a politically sophisticated, organized, and well-funded state-wide movement is not present.""

Hawkins also acknowledged the anger among some anti-abortion activists over the inconsistent rhetoric on abortion coming from the Republican presidential ticket of former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance.

""I'm not here to make apologies for the Campaign and their political miscalculations, which are dividing us and could very well lead to their defeat,"" wrote Hawkins.

Trump nominated the Supreme Court members who were crucial to overturning Roe and called it ""a beautiful thing to watch"" as various states took different directions. He has been evasive on whether he would veto a federal abortion ban if Congress approved one; his ""leave it to the states"" approach conveys acceptance of the current patchwork map in which abortion is widely available in at least half the states.

Eligible to vote in Florida, Trump has criticized as too restrictive a new state law banning abortion after the first six weeks of pregnancy. But he said he would vote against the ballot measure that would make abortion legal until fetal viability.

Trump's support for a state-by-state solution was a factor in the decision of Charles Camosy, an anti-abortion Catholic academic, to declare he now feels politically estranged.

""The Republican Party has rejected our point of view. Democrats are running a candidate ( Kamala Harris ) who has made abortion rights a centerpiece of her campaign,"" Camosy, a medical humanities professor at Creighton University School of Medicine, wrote recently in The Atlantic.

""Pro-lifers -- those who believe that protecting vulnerable and unborn life should be a primary policy priority -- now do not fit in either major political party.""

In an interview, Camosy said abortion-rights supporters were better prepared for the post-Roe era than their adversaries

""They were well-funded, they developed key relationships with the media,"" Camosy said, while some Republican-controlled legislatures - in his view -- went too far with stringent abortion bans.

""I see this moment as an opportunity,"" Camosy wrote in The Atlantic. ""Pro-life 3.0 must welcome people from multiple political and policy perspectives, working for both prenatal justice and social support for women and families.""

Some other anti-abortion activists have forcefully renounced Trump, including leaders of End Abortion Ohio.

""We call on God-fearing American voters to withhold their votes from Trump until he evidences genuine repentance for his pro-abortion stance,"" said the group's executive director, Nicholas Kallis.

However, Ohio Right to Life president Mike Gonidakis is encouraging support for Trump.

""A vast majority of our statewide membership absolutely support President Trump and believe he would advance the protection of life at the federal level ... more than a Kamala administration would,"" he said. ""It is not even close.""

Other anti-abortion leaders have made similar calculations.

One example: Back in April, Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said she was ""deeply disappointed"" in Trump's willingness to leave abortion policy to the states.

These days, in a move potentially benefiting Trump, the group plans a $92 million voter outreach program in battleground states depicting Harris and other Democratic candidates as ""extremists"" on abortion.

""It is imperative that the pro-life movement fully unify and mobilize to defeat this threat,"" Dannenfelser said.

Among those embracing Trump is Frank Pavone, who continues to lead Priests for Life despite being defrocked in 2022 after feuding with his bishop over his anti-abortion and partisan political activities.

""Trump has brought in far more people than he has alienated,"" Pavone said via email. ""His statements have blunted the effectiveness of the dire, scare-mongering Democrat warnings that the Republicans will ban all abortions.""

"Donald Trump returns to North Carolina without Mark Robinson, one of his top in-state supporters",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-mark-robinson-north-carolina-wilmington-1bc79594567860c9ffe7f44375fac847,2024-09-21T04:09:22Z,"WILMINGTON, N.C. (AP) -- Donald Trump returns to North Carolina on Saturday, stumping in the southern battleground state that both Democrats and Republicans are treating as increasingly critical to victory in November.

But Trump will be campaigning in Wilmington, along the state's southern coast, without Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the GOP gubernatorial nominee and one of the former president's top surrogates in the state, following a CNN report about his alleged posts on a pornography website's message board. Two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity said Friday that Robinson was not scheduled to attend the Wilmington event.

Robinson has denied writing the posts, which include lewd and racist comments, saying Thursday that he wouldn't be forced out of the race by ""salacious tabloid lies."" Trump's campaign has appeared to distance itself from Robinson in the wake of the CNN reporting, which the AP has not independently verified, saying in statement to the AP that Trump ""is focused on winning the White House and saving this country"" and calling North Carolina ""a vital part of that plan,"" without mentioning Robinson.

While Robinson won his GOP gubernatorial primary in March, he's been trailing in several recent polls to Democratic nominee Josh Stein, the state's attorney general. State Republican officials have stood by Robinson, whose decision to keep campaigning could threaten GOP prospects in other key races, including Trump's efforts in a battleground state he previously won twice.

Democrats have seized on the opportunity to highlight Trump's ties to Robinson, with billboards showing the two together, as well as a new ad from Vice President Kamala Harris ' campaign highlighting the Republican candidates' ties as well as Robinson's support for a statewide abortion ban without exceptions. According to Harris' campaign, it's their first ad effort related to tying Trump to a down-ballot race.

A Republican has carried North Carolina in every general election since 1976 save one, when Barack Obama won the state in 2008. Trump won there in both his previous campaigns but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state that Trump won. That's part of why Democrats see the state as winnable this fall.

With neither Senate seat up for grabs, the gubernatorial contest has been North Carolina's marquee down-ballot race this year. Robinson has become a natural top surrogate for Trump in the state and a frequent presence at campaign events there, appearing with the nominee as recently as an event last month in Asheboro. Trump has long praised Robinson, who is Black, referring to him as ""Martin Luther King on steroids.""

Endorsing Robinson ahead of the GOP gubernatorial primary, Trump continued: ""I think you're better than Martin Luther King. I think you are Martin Luther King times two.""

While more visits have been made by presidential contenders to the Rust Belt battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, both Harris and Trump have made multiple trips to North Carolina, highlighting the state's importance. Following Biden's departure from the race in July, Trump held his first large-scale rally there, turning his full focus toward Harris.

Wilmington is home to New Hanover County, which Biden won in 2020. But his margin over Trump in the county was among his slimmest in the state. ___

"With immigration and abortion on Arizona's ballot, Republicans are betting on momentum",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/immigration-abortion-arizona-ballot-measures-60edebf5ac6f47d2131f6f1fcb1f547e,2024-09-21T04:04:39Z,"PHOENIX (AP) -- Voters will decide ballot measures on abortion and immigration in Arizona, a key battleground state where Republicans are looking to capitalize on concerns about illegal border crossings to counter an expected increase in turnout by people determined to restore and protect abortion rights.

And while the abortion initiative is bolstered by a citizen-led campaign flush with cash, the GOP lawmakers who added a measure to empower state law enforcers to crack down on people who are in Arizona illegally say it already has so much momentum that they don't plan to raise money or spend much time selling it.

Abortion has many people fired up since an 1864 law banning nearly all abortions was revived and then quickly repealed this year. But immigration consistently ranks as a top concern in this western swing state, where anti-immigration legislation has long fueled national debates over illegal crossings from Mexico.

""Voters will approve this more to send a message that something, anything, needs to be done,"" said Barrett Marson, a Phoenix-based Republican strategist. ""It lacks financial backing because people know it's going to pass and that it has little impact on curbing illegal immigration into Arizona.""

Arizona state House Speaker Ben Toma voted with fellow Republicans in June to put the measure on the ballot. He called it common sense and just a small part of ""what actually needs to happen to secure the border.""

Frustration over illegal immigration persists despite moves by the Biden-Harris administration this year to shut down what had been an unprecedented surge in new arrivals. Democrats blame former President Donald Trump for making it a top campaign issue by persuading allies in Congress to torpedo bipartisan legislation that could have bolstered the federal response.

Republican lawmakers across the country this year have pushed tougher immigration policies, with their majorities in Texas, Iowa and Oklahoma passing laws to conduct immigration enforcement at the state level. But in each of those states, federal courts blocked their efforts to enforce the laws.

Democratic strategist DJ Quinlan said that despite universal concerns about the border, plenty of voters and stakeholders oppose this particular measure, which would make it a state crime for noncitizens to illegally cross from Mexico into Arizona outside authorized ports of entry. The crime would enable local police to arrest violators and state judges to order deportations, which are roles historically left to the federal government.

""When you talk to a lot of people in law enforcement or in the business community or that deal with these sorts of issues on a day-to-day basis, this referendum is not the answer,"" Quinlan said.

The measure also would require state agencies that administer federal, state or local benefit programs to use a federal database to verify that no ineligible noncitizens get the benefits. And it would shield law enforcement from civil lawsuits alleging racial profiling of Latinos or other minorities.

Some of its provisions aren't directly related to illegal immigration, including making selling fentanyl that leads to a person's death a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Latino groups argued this violates a state constitutional requirement that legislative proposals cover a single subject. The Arizona Supreme Court disagreed, clearing to a path for voters to decide.

Kent Jenson, a 68-year-old retiree, said he opposes illegal immigration and detests drug use, so he plans to vote for the immigration measure and against the abortion initiative. ""It's terrible what fentanyl has done to families,"" Jenson said.

Opponents argue the immigration legislation would harm Arizona's reputation and economy even more than a so-called ""show me your papers"" law approved by lawmakers in 2010 that was partially stuck down by the U.S. Supreme Court two years later.

The cost also worries some mayors, county officials and law enforcement leaders who warn that diverting resources to border security could deprive their day-to-day operations and essential public services.

An Associated Press review of state campaign finance records found no contributions specifically supporting Proposition 314, nor any donations explicitly against it.

Toma said Republicans are spending their time, money and energy on competitive races and other statewide ballot measures, with 13 in all. At stake is not only control of the U.S. Senate and White House, but also the state Legislature. Republicans have a one-seat majority in each chamber and Democrats hope to regain power for the first time in decades.

""People are going to focus, and rightly so, on the issues that actually need help,"" Toma said.

Citizen-led Proposition 139, which would enshrine abortion access in the state's constitution, has generated millions of dollars in donations and reached the ballot with more than a half-million signatures. Arizona is one of 10 states where voters will consider abortion protections.

""It is a basic human right that all women need to have autonomy over their own bodies,"" said Erin Dean, 34, a voter who used to be registered as a Republican but now backs Democrats.

The political action committee Arizona for Abortion Access raised nearly $23 million as of late July, campaign finance records show. A PAC opposing the measure, It Goes Too Far, had raised nearly $900,000.

Republican and Democratic strategists alike say the abortion measure could draw voters who might not otherwise be interested in casting a ballot.

Marson, the GOP strategist, expects it to boost turnout with young and first-time voters. The same can't be said for the immigration measure, which he predicts will pass anyway.

""Not many teenagers are itching to vote on an illegal immigration issue even if a wide swath of people support the measure,"" Marson said.

Ballot measures on immigration have been popular in Arizona before.

In 2004, voters made Arizona the only state to require proof of citizenship status to register to vote. A measure banning in-state tuition for noncitizens was passed in 2006, but key parts were overturned in 2022 when Arizonans voted to make students -- regardless of immigration status -- eligible for state financial aid. ___

Federal judge temporarily blocks Tennessee's 'abortion trafficking' law,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-trafficking-ban-laws-tennessee-republican-ec78174f1aaec284cb542185593e8aef,2024-09-21T00:46:16Z,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked Tennessee from enforcing a law banning adults from helping minors get an abortion without parental permission.

In a 49-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger argued that the Republican-controlled state cannot ""make it a crime to communicate freely"" about legal abortion options even in a state where abortion is banned at all stages of pregnancy except for a handful of situations. Trauger's decision means that the law will be placed on hold as the case make its way through court.

""The Tennessee General Assembly apparently determined that, when the topic at hand is 'abortion trafficking,' the best interests of the pregnant child are not merely a secondary consideration, but unworthy of particularized consideration at all,"" Trauger wrote.

Earlier this year, Tennessee's Republican lawmakers and GOP Gov. Bill Lee signed off on a proposal making it illegal for an adult who ""intentionally recruits, harbors, or transports"" a pregnant child or teen within the state to get an abortion without consent from the minor's parents or guardians. Those convicted of breaking the law risked being charged with a Class A misdemeanor, which requires a nearly one-year jail sentence.

The law, which went into effect July 1, did not contain exemptions for minors who may have been raped by their parents or guardians. Instead, the statute dictated that biological fathers who cause the pregnancy of their daughters, if minors, couldn't pursue legal actions.

The Tennessee law mimicked the so-called "" abortion trafficking "" law enacted in Idaho last year, the first state to ever enact such a statute. However, a federal judge has since temporarily blocked Idaho's version as the case moves through court.

Just before the law was poised to go into effect, Democratic Rep. Aftyn Behn and Nashville attorney Rachel Welty filed a lawsuit on the second anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that had guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion.

Behn called the Tennessee ruling a ""monumental victory for free speech and the fight for abortion rights.

""This ruling doesn't just protect Tennesseans -- it safeguards the freedom to discuss abortion care across state lines, ensuring that we can continue to offer support, share accurate information, and stand up for the rights of those seeking essential health care everywhere,"" she said.

A spokesperson for Attorney General's office, who was fighting to get the case dismissed, did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on Friday's ruling.

Trauger's decision sided with Welty and Behn's argument that the Tennessee law was ""unconstitutionally vague,"" specifically stressing that the word ""recruits"" is undefined in the statute.

Trauger also raised several First Amendment concerns in her explanation that her ruling would apply across the state, not just to Welty and Behn.

""The freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment is not simply a special protection that the Constitution grants to a few, high-profile speakers so that those speakers can hear themselves talk; it is a protection available to everyone, for the interconnected benefit of everyone, because messages do not gain their fullest power by being uttered, but by being spread,"" Trauger wrote.

Tennessee bans abortions at all stages of pregnancy, but there are exemptions in cases of molar pregnancies, ectopic pregnancies, and to remove a miscarriage or to save the life of the mother. Notably, doctors must use their ""reasonable medical"" judgment -- a term that some say is too vague and can be challenged by fellow medical officials -- in deciding whether providing the procedure can save the life of the pregnant patient or prevent major injury.

A group of women is currently suing in a separate case to clarify the state's abortion ban. A court decision is expected soon on whether the lawsuit can continue or if Tennessee's abortion ban can be placed on hold as the legal battle continues."
Controversial North Carolina candidate for governor rattles Republicans in critical swing state,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mark-robinson-north-carolina-governor-trump-e5f7e3740c518883eefd16fd04f8533d,2024-09-20T18:27:21Z,"The political world is still reeling from a CNN report that the Republican candidate for North Carolina governor, the current Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, posted racist and explicit messages on a pornography web site message board a decade ago.

While The Associated Press hasn't confirmed the contents of the report and Robinson denied it, the piece sparked a last-minute push by some Republicans to convince Robinson to withdraw from the governor's race in the crucial swing state.

Robinson refused to step aside, standing pat as the latest of a long line of populist, outside-the-box Republican candidates to rise in the shadow of former President Donald Trump. He's attracted so much attention not only because his story is fascinating but because it could impact Trump's hopes of returning to the White House in November.

A former furniture factory worker, Robinson's political career took off when he attended a Greensboro City Council meeting in 2018 and spoke out against the council's plans to cancel a gun show in the wake of a school shooting in Florida. Robinson's fiery defense of gun rights -- ""I'm going to come down here to this city council and raise hell just like these loonies from the left do until you listen to the majority of the people in this city,"" he said -- went viral.

Robinson left his furniture job and took up public speaking, addressing the National Rifle Association and other conservative groups. He ran for Lieutenant Governor in 2020 as a Republican, winning a statewide post that many politicians spend decades preparing for in his first campaign. Robinson swiftly began positioning himself to be the first major party Black candidate for governor in 2024, when Democrat Roy Cooper would be term-limited out of office.

Robinson also quickly became notorious for stoking conservative culture wars, taking an especially hardline stance on sex and gender politics. In a 2019 Facebook post Robinson, who admitted paying for his then-girlfriend to have an abortion in the 1980s, said abortion in America was about ""killing the child because you weren't responsible enough to keep your skirt down."" In a 2021 speech in a church, he used the word ""filth"" when discussing gay and transgender people.

Robinson's provocative language led some Republicans to worry he stood little chance of winning a general election campaign in North Carolina, which has a history of rejecting hardline conservative statewide gubernatorial candidates in favor of moderate Democrats. Most Republican voters didn't share that concern, nominating Robinson earlier this year over two rivals who were widely seen as more electable. Robinson had extra help with a primary endorsement from Trump, who compared Robinson to Martin Luther King, Jr.

The campaign hasn't gone the way Robinson supporters had hoped. Many thought a plainspoken Black man articulating conservative positions could win a right-leaning state where Democrats have long relied on African-American votes to win. Instead, Robinson has consistently trailed in polls behind the Democratic nominee for governor, Josh Stein. Stein contends Robinson's rhetoric and hardline positions make him unfit to lead the state.

Republican anxiety escalated earlier this week, when rumors of a blockbuster CNN report began circulating. Even before the report aired on Thursday, there were calls for Robinson to step aside ahead of the midnight deadline so a new GOP nominee could step in. Robinson refused, preemptively releasing a video where he said: ""Let me reassure you the things that you will see in that story -- those are not the words of Mark Robinson.""

The CNN report unearthed posts it said Robinson left on a porn site's message boards more than a decade ago in which he referred to himself as a ""black NAZI,"" said in 2012 he preferred Hitler to then-President Barack Obama, slammed civil rights icon King as ""worse than a maggot,"" and said he enjoyed transgender pornography.

CNN said it linked the posts to Robinson by tracing the email connected to the posts to the candidate as well as noting phrases Robinson still uses and references to his personal life, family history and marriage in the writings.

That left many North Carolina Republicans aghast, but midnight ticked by and Robinson remained the nominee. Ballots were mailed out to overseas voters and service members, marking the official start of voting and a point of no return.

A state's governor's race usually doesn't effect which presidential candidate wins the contest for its electoral votes. North Carolina, in particular, has shown its voters to be comfortable with divided government. But Democrats hope -- and some Republicans fear -- that Robinson's unique situation might make things different there this year.

Trump won the state by less than 1 percentage point in 2020 and Vice President Kamala Harris has her eye on its 16 electoral votes. Even before this week's CNN report Democrats were encouraged by Robinson's struggles there. Now they're piling on -- the Harris campaign on Friday launched an ad featuring Trump praising Robinson, and the Democratic National Committee bought billboards tying the two candidates together.

In a sign that Republicans are nervous, Robinson will no longer appear with Trump when he visits the state on Saturday. But the delicate dance could prove complicated down the stretch of the campaign in a crucial swing state that Trump expects to visit frequently.

Still, there remains the possibility that Robinson's troubles won't affect Trump much at all other than to make his travel schedule complicated.

""I don't think it's going to have an impact,"" Rep. Richard Hudson, a North Carolina Republican, told reporters on Friday. ""I think voters are smart enough to differentiate one race from another."""
Robinson will not appear at Trump's North Carolina rally after report on alleged online comments,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-governor-mark-robinson-trump-kamala-harris-cooper-cnn-stein-c7ee5c23f554f3708619d6b68e208b94,2024-09-20T15:23:58Z,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson will not speak or appear at former President Donald Trump 's rally on Saturday in the eastern part of his state following a CNN report about his alleged posts on a pornography website's message board, two people familiar with the matter said Friday.

Robinson is not expected to attend the event in Wilmington, according to a person on the Trump campaign and a second person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning.

Robinson has been a frequent presence at Trump's North Carolina campaign stops. The Republican nominee has referred to Robinson, who is Black, as ""Martin Luther King on steroids"" and long praised him. But in the wake of Thursday's CNN report, the Trump campaign issued a statement that didn't mention Robinson and instead spoke generally about how North Carolina was key to the campaign's efforts.

With the deadline now passed for him to withdraw, Robinson remained the Republican candidate for governor on Friday. His decision to keep campaigning could threaten GOP prospects in other key races, including Trump's efforts in a battleground state he twice won.

Robinson has denied writing the posts, which include racial and sexual comments. He said wouldn't be forced out of the race by ""salacious tabloid lies."" While Robinson won his GOP gubernatorial primary in March, he's been trailing in several recent polls to Democratic nominee Josh Stein, the state's attorney general.

""Let me reassure you the things that you will see in that story -- those are not the words of Mark Robinson,"" he told supporters in a video released by his campaign. ""You know my words. You know my character.""

State law says a gubernatorial nominee had until Thursday night to withdraw as a candidate, the day before the first absentee ballots requested by military and overseas voters are distributed. The State Board of Elections is unaware of any such withdrawal notice, spokesperson Pat Gannon said. State Republican leaders could have picked a replacement had a withdrawal occurred.

""We are staying in this race,"" Robinson said in the video. ""We are in it to win it.""

Robinson has a history of inflammatory comments that Stein has said made him too extreme to lead North Carolina. They already have contributed to the prospect that campaign struggles for Robinson could help Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris win the state's 16 electoral votes.

""The fallout is going to be huge,"" Chris Cooper, a political science professor at Western Carolina University, said Friday.

Losing swing district races for a congressional seat and the General Assembly would endanger the GOP's control of the U.S. House and retaining veto-proof majorities at the legislature.

CNN, which describes a series of comments that it said Robinson posted on the message board more than a decade ago, sent tremors through the state's political class. While the state Republican Party came to Robinson's defense, individual GOP leaders raised concerns and suggested Robinson needed to address the allegations more fully.

CNN reported that Robinson, who would be North Carolina's first Black governor, attacked civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in searing terms and once referred to himself as a ""black NAZI."" CNN also reported that Robinson wrote of being aroused by a memory of ""peeping"" women in gym showers when he was 14 along with an appreciation of transgender pornography. Robinson at one point referred to himself as a ""perv,"" according to CNN.

The Associated Press has not independently confirmed that Robinson wrote and posted the messages. CNN said it matched details of the account on the pornographic website forum to other online accounts held by Robinson by comparing usernames, a known email address and his full name.

CNN reported that details discussed by the account holder matched Robinson's age, length of marriage and other biographical information. It also compared figures of speech that came up frequently in his public Twitter profile that appeared in discussions by the account on the pornographic website.

The state GOP said in a statement late Thursday that while Robinson has ""categorically denied the allegations"" it wouldn't ""stop the Left from trying to demonize him via personal attacks.""

But U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who endorsed a Robinson rival in the primary -- citing Robinson's lack of legislative and business experience -- said on X that Thursday ""was a tough day, but we must stay focused on the races we can win.""

""If Harris takes NC, she takes the White House,"" he added. ""We can't let that happen.""

Democrats jumped on Robinson and other Republicans after the report aired, using every opportunity to show on social media photos of Robinson with Trump or with other GOP candidates attempting to tarnish them by association.

Stein and his allies have highlighted past comments by Robinson, such as a Facebook post from 2019 in which Robinson said abortion in America was about ""killing the child because you weren't responsible enough to keep your skirt down."" And there's a 2021 speech by Robinson in a church in which he used the word ""filth"" when discussing gay and transgender people.

Robinson, 56, was elected lieutenant governor in his first bid for public office in 2020. He tells a life story of childhood poverty, jobs that he blames the North American Free Trade Agreement for ending, and personal bankruptcy.

Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, a top surrogate for Harris, said late Thursday on X that Trump and state GOP leaders ""embraced Mark Robinson for years knowing who he was and what he stood for ... They reap what they sow."""
JD Vance once said conspiracy theories were idiotic. As Trump's VP pick he is embracing them,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/jd-vance-conspiracy-theories-george-soros-trump-b88fd9c7c6de677e9f2da649c86814e0,2024-09-20T15:05:13Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- JD Vance not long ago described conspiracy theories as the feverish imaginings produced by ""fringe lunatics writing about all manner of idiocy.""

That was before he became a rising star in Republican politics.

The Ohio senator and GOP's vice presidential nominee has in recent years declared that the federal government deliberately allowed fentanyl into the United States to kill conservative and rural voters. He has praised Alex Jones, a well-known conspiracy theorist who claimed the deaths of 20 young children in the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax.

And he's echoed -- contrary to all evidence -- former President Donald Trump's assertion that the 2020 election was unfairly won by Democrats and that those charged in the subsequent Capitol insurrection are ""political prisoners."" More recently, he gave credence to the debunked idea that Haitian immigrants were abducting and devouring pets in Ohio.

Longtime Republican strategists and academics say Vance's evolution on the conspiracy theories can be traced to the Ohio politician's desire to advance in Trump's Republican Party. The former president has a long history of pushing unfounded claims. He lied about former President Barack Obama having been born in Kenya, and about doctors performing ""post-birth abortions."" He has said that wind turbines cause cancer. And he has repeatedly amplified social media posts that elections cannot be trusted.

Vance has ""entirely reinvented himself,"" said Joseph Uscinski, a University of Miami professor and expert on the history of conspiracy theories. ""It's advantageous now because of what Trump has done to the GOP. It probably would not have worked, you know, 20, 30 years ago. He would have been seen as a kook. But now given what Trump has done to the GOP, this is sort of par for the course.""

Denying conspiracy theories is not a recipe for electoral success.

Mike Pence and Liz Cheney are examples of what can happen to those who refuse to embrace such ideas. Pence, Trump's former vice president, refused to go along with the scheme to overturn the 2020 election, ensuring his run in the 2024 GOP presidential primary went nowhere. Former Rep. Cheney came under assault from Trump and his allies after she helped lead the House investigation into his role in the insurrection. She was stripped of her leadership role in Congress and lost her House seat to a Trump-endorsed candidate in the Republican primary.

A spokesperson for Vance's campaign said that while the candidate stands by many of his claims -- including the idea that immigrants in Ohio are abducting pets -- others have been misrepresented by Democrats.

Vance suggested recently that he is comfortable sharing unfounded claims if they draw attention to an issue.

""If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do,"" he said Sunday on CNN.

Later in the same interview he said his claims about abducted pets had helped to ""focus"" the media's attention on immigration.

Vance, 40, found early success and fame as the writer of ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" his best-selling 2016 memoir that examined the plight of rural America.

Besides labeling conspiracy theorists as ""fringe lunatics"" in the book, Vance wrote that their beliefs were popular, in part, because people had lost faith in the media. ""With little trust in the press, there's no check on the Internet conspiracy theories that rule the digital world.""

Before he wrote the book, Vance expressed similar insights to friends.

Cullen Tiernan served in the U.S. Marines with Vance when they were deployed to Iraq in 2005 and 2006. Tiernan said Vance routinely rejected conspiracy theories that came up in discussions, including one that alleged the U.S. government had actually been behind the Sept. 11, 2001, attack.

Vance ""just didn't have time for it,"" said Tiernan, who remains a close friend of the senator.

A review of Vance's published works and speeches shows he first began diving into the conspiracy pool after announcing his candidacy in 2021 for an open U.S. Senate seat in Ohio.

He defended Jones, the host of InfoWars, in a 2021 speech, saying that ""believing crazy things is not the mark of whether somebody should be rejected.""

A spokesperson for Vance's campaign told the AP that the candidate doesn't agree with Jones when it comes to the Sandy Hook massacre, before comparing that conspiracy theory to Democratic concerns about Russian support for Trump in 2016.

The senator has also repeatedly questioned the seriousness of the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and dismissed the threats on Pence's life -- rioters were searching for the vice president in the Capitol, chanting, ""Hang Mike Pence!""

He said the ""real assault on democracy"" wasn't Jan. 6 -- but the fact that people charged in the riot were still locked up.

""It is an insult to all of us that so many people are rotting in prison without being offered a speedy trial. These people are political prisoners,"" he wrote on social media in 2022.

And he wrote a favorable blurb for a book that came out in July by Jack Posobiec, a political operative who is perhaps best known for promoting the "" Pizzagate "" conspiracy that alleged Democrats were pedophiles who were hiding abducted children in pizza parlors.

Vance has also invoked George Soros, one of the far right's favorite bogeymen.

Soros, the Jewish financier and Democratic megadonor, is such a ubiquitous target in some conservative circles that it can obscure the longstanding antisemitic tropes mirrored in language used to describe him: of rich Jewish bankers secretly controlling the world, wealthy Jewish puppet masters pulling the strings of those in power.

In December 2021, Vance said Soros "" has blood on his hands "" for helping Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner get into office. ""George Soros put millions into Krasner's campaigns, which promised to go easy on the types of criminals who commit these murders,"" Vance wrote on X.

Vance has promoted the ""great replacement theory,"" which claims that Democrats are trying to use immigrants to replace white Americans in a bid to control the nation. Rooted in anti-Semitism and racism, many adherents to the theory claim the scheme is being orchestrated by powerful Jews like Soros, along with other ""globalists"" or ""elites.""

""We have an invasion in this country because very powerful people get richer and more powerful because of it,"" Vance said on Fox News in 2022.

""It's not bad policy,"" Vance added, ""it's evil.""

Vance's campaign rejects suggestions that he engages in anti-Semitic or anti-immigrant rhetoric. It notes the candidate has three biracial children with his wife, the daughter of immigrants from India. The campaign also says Democrats have talked about how immigration could help their party's electoral chances.

""Many leading Democrats have gleefully exclaimed, in public, that changing demographics would lead to an increase in political power for their side,"" the campaign said.

By attacking Soros and promoting the great replacement theory, however, Vance is flirting with dangerous rhetoric that has touched off violence in the past, said Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs.

Not long ago, major party candidates would have rejected such theories, if only out of fear that voters would see them as racist or anti-Semitic. That is no longer the case, Spitalnick said.

""It's becoming increasingly normalized and increasingly mainstreamed,"" she said. ""It's not accidental, and it's incredibly dangerous."""
Harris focusing on personal stories as she campaigns on abortion rights,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-election-abortion-rights-georgia-amber-thurman-5ba5dabf0dc3c98de12389c34b47475d,2024-09-20T11:14:20Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time since she ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket, Vice President Kamala Harris is set to give a speech focused squarely on abortion rights and she'll do so in Georgia, where news reports have documented women's deaths in the face of the state's six-week ban.

""It is a time of mourning, but it's also a time where great action can come out of this,"" said Park Cannon, a Georgia state lawmaker and a doula who provides guidance and support to pregnant woman during labor.

ProPublica reported this week that two Georgia women died after they did not get proper medical treatment for complications from taking abortion pills to end their pregnancies.

Harris, who will be in the Atlanta area on Friday to address the issue, on Thursday night heard from the mother and sisters of one of the women who died.

During a livestreamed campaign event hosted by Oprah Winfrey and attended by Harris, Shanette Williams, the mother of Amber Thurman, tearfully told viewers that ""people around the world need to know that this was preventable."" Williams said she initially did not want to go public about her daughter's 2022 death but ultimately decided it was important for people to understand her daughter ""was not a statistic. She was loved.""

Harris told the family, ""I'm just so sorry. The courage you all have shown is extraordinary.""

The vice president added: ""This story is a story that is, sadly, not the only story of what has been happening since these bans have taken place.""

Dozens of pregnant patients have faced delayed care or been turned away from hospitals amid medical emergencies over the last two years, a violation of federal law, since Roe v. Wade was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. Violations occurred in states with and without abortion bans. But an AP analysis earlier this year found an immediate spike in some states with abortion bans, including Texas, following the ruling.

Harris was the administration's chief spokesperson on abortion rights when President Joe Biden was running for reelection, headlining rallies across the nation, and she is the highest-ranking U.S. official to make a public visit to an abortion clinic. Since becoming the nominee, though, she's broadened her focus to a wider range of issues.

Harris' campaign is hoping that reproductive rights will be a strong motivator for Democrats in the November election. Republican nominee Donald Trump, meanwhile, continues to take credit for appointing three of the conservative Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe.

About half of voters say abortion is one of the most important issues as they consider their vote - but it's more important to women who are registered voters than to male voters, according to a new AP-NORC poll. About 6 in 10 women voters say abortion policy is one of the most important issues to their vote in the upcoming election, compared to about 4 in 10 male voters.

The gender gap doesn't stop there.

About 6 in 10 women voters trust Harris more than Trump to handle abortion, while about 2 in 10 women have more trust in Trump. Half of male voters, by contrast, trust Harris more than Trump on abortion, while about one-third trust Trump more than Harris.

Democrats point to a series of electoral wins when abortion rights have been on the ballot, and advocates believe Harris is a strong messenger. During the Sept. 10 presidential debate she gave a forceful answer on how the bans have affected even women who never intended to end pregnancies.

Harris has a long history of fighting for reproductive health issues, especially Black maternal health. Since taking over the top of the ticket, others have toured the nation talking about reproductive rights, including her husband, Doug Emhoff.

In Georgia, Thurman had waited more than 20 hours at the hospital for a routine medical procedure known as a D&C to clear out remaining tissue after taking abortion pills, even as she developed sepsis. Family members told ProPublica that the other woman who died was afraid to seek help for the pain she was experiencing after taking abortion pills. She also had a lethal combination of painkillers in her system.

Dr. Nisha Verma, an OB-GYN in Georgia, said the six-week ban has caused a ""massive environment of fear and confusion and uncertainty"" for the medical community.

""Medicine is a gray area,"" she said. Laws, though ""are a blunt instrument.""

She said Republican legislators who are now blaming hospitals and doctors are seeing the ramifications of the laws playing out in real time.

""The law is preventing us from being able to provide evidence-based care without having to think about the risk of criminal prosecution,"" she said.

Harris lays the blame on Trump, saying in a statement that, ""This is exactly what we feared when Roe was struck down.""

During the presidential debate earlier this month, Trump leaned heavily on his catchall response to questions on abortion rights, saying the issue should be left up to the states. He said he would not sign a national abortion ban. But he has also repeatedly declined to say whether he would veto such a ban if he were elected again.

Harris was making a campaign stop later Friday in Wisconsin following her visit to Georgia. Trump had no public events scheduled for Friday.

Takeaways from AP's story on the role of the West in widespread fraud with South Korean adoptions,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/south-korean-adoptions-investigation-united-states-europe-takeaways-13ccde3894eb0cb655a61a1885f1dfc4,2024-09-20T04:48:49Z,"Western governments eagerly approved and even pushed for the adoption of South Korean children for decades, despite evidence that adoption agencies were aggressively competing for kids, pressuring mothers and bribing hospitals, an investigation led by The Associated Press has found.

Now adults, many of those children have since discovered that their adoption paperwork was untrue. Their quest for accountability has spread far beyond Korea's borders to the Western countries that claimed them, and is upending international adoption.

The AP, in collaboration with Frontline (PBS), spoke with more than 80 adoptees in the U.S., Australia and Europe and examined thousands of pages of documents to reveal evidence of kidnapped or missing children ending up abroad, fabricated names, babies switched with one another and parents told their newborns were gravely sick or dead, only to discover decades later they'd been sent to new parents overseas.

Here are the findings:

South Korea's adoption program started with the unwanted children of Korean women and Western soldiers from the 1950-53 Korean war, and then included the children of single mothers, the poor and others. In the West, access to birth control and abortion had caused the supply of domestically adoptable babies to plummet, and Western families were desperate for Korean children.

In 1974, South Korea tried to stop adoptions to Scandinavia, after its political rival, North Korea, charged that children were ""being sold like animals in the foreign land."" South Korean government records from the time show that diplomats from Sweden, Denmark and Norway began begging for babies.

""The adoption of Korean orphans by Swedish parents is not because Korea is neglecting its orphans, but because Swedish couples without children are desiring to adopt them, so it would be good to continue the transfers of orphans,"" the Swedish ambassador said in a meeting with South Korea's deputy foreign minister in January 1975.

South Korean Health Minister Ko Jae-pil wrote in a report that the countries sent nine pleas for adoptions to continue, citing at least 1,455 requests for Korean children. Ambassadors visited Korean officials multiple times and ""have kept badgering by sending diplomatic documents"" that practically threatened halted adoptions would damage relations, the report says. One wrote that he was ""concerned that the public opinion against South Korea would worsen"" if they halted adoptions to Scandinavia.

Under pressure, South Korea reversed course.

""Accepting the strong requests by related nations to resume adoptions is considered to promote international friendships,"" Ko wrote in 1975.

The United States pioneered the adoption system in South Korea, when an evangelical Christian farmer from Oregon named Harry Holt believed he'd received a calling from God to save Korean War orphans. He soon began flying children from Korea to the United States by the planeload for adoption by Christian American families.

Holt's program grew into the largest adoption agency in South Korea, sending thousands of children to the West.

In the 1970s, humanitarians on the ground expressed alarm that adoption was becoming a competitive business, that agencies were foraging for children. But U.S. officials processed visas allowing them to leave South Korea by the hundreds a month. A concerned social worker wrote in a 1976 document that U.S. officials were processing adoptions in a ""callous"" and ""assembly line type method.""

There were few safeguards to ensure that children adopted to the U.S. were truly orphans. Federal officials issued visas for the children, but their adoptions were finalized by thousands of local courthouses across the country -- many of which did not require proof that the children were truly abandoned or relinquished by their parents.

Susan Soonkeum Cox, a longtime executive at the company, said she rejects allegations that agencies were competing for children, and the company's goal was always to find homes for children who would otherwise have grown up in orphanages.

Cox was among the first group of adoptees brought to the United States by Holt, in 1956. She said that when she began working with the agency in the 1970s, there were still an overwhelming number of abandoned children, and the company frantically searched to find homes for them.

Holt is today a well-respected agency, and has called for stricter safeguards in the international adoption industry.

The model created in South Korea was replicated all over the world. Now the stories of adoptees have forced many European countries to face a reckoning over their role in international adoptions.

The Netherlands in May announced it would no longer allow its citizens to adopt from abroad. Denmark's only international adoption agency said it was shutting down, Sweden stopped adoptions from South Korea and Norway is investigating. Switzerland apologized for failing to prevent illegal adoptions. France in March released a scathing assessment of its own culpability.

The U.S., the pioneer of this system and long the country to adopt the most foreign orphans, has not analyzed its own accountability, and some have questioned why. The State Department said questions from AP over several months prompted it to try to piece together its history from archives. An early review found that widespread practices in Korea at the time ""may have resulted in adoptions based on falsified documentation"" but no indication yet that officials were aware of it.

Western nations were desperate for Korean babies.

Forty years ago, she said, she was kidnapped from the other side of the world, and the French government endorsed it.

She wept as she described years spent piecing it together, stymied at every turn to get an answer to a simple question: How was she, a bright, diligent schoolgirl, with known parents whom she loved, documented as an abandoned orphan in South Korea in 1984 and sent to strangers in France? She believes the government of France -- along with many Western nations -- allowed families to ""mail order children"" through international adoption, and did nothing to protect them.

""They were reckless,"" she said. ""They never questioned anything. They never checked where I was from. They never checked whether my parents existed or not.""

Kim was caught in an adoption machine that sent hundreds of thousands of Korean children to families in the United States, Europe and Australia. Now adults, many have since discovered that their adoption paperwork was untrue, and their quest for accountability now has spread far beyond South Korea's borders to the Western countries that claimed them.

Those governments turned a blind eye to rampant fraud and sometimes pressured the South Korean government to keep the kids coming, an investigation led by The Associated Press has found. Documents show that at the peak of adoptions from South Korea, Western diplomats processed papers like an assembly line, despite evidence that adoption agencies were aggressively competing for babies to send abroad, pressuring mothers and paying hospitals. Governments focused on satisfying intense demand from Western families desperate for children.

The AP, in collaboration with Frontline (PBS), spoke with more than 80 adoptees in the U.S., Australia and Europe and examined thousands of pages of documents to reveal evidence of kidnapped or missing children ending up abroad, fabricated names, babies switched with one another and parents told their newborns were gravely sick or dead, only to discover decades later they'd been sent to new parents overseas.

The seismic consequences are ricocheting around the world and challenging the entire international adoption industry, which was built on the model created in South Korea.

The Netherlands in May announced it would no longer allow its citizens to adopt from abroad. Denmark's only international adoption agency said it was shutting down, Sweden stopped adoptions from South Korea, and Norway is investigating.

An early review found that widespread practices in South Korea at the time ""may have resulted in adoptions based on falsified documentation"" but no indication yet that U.S. officials were aware of it.

Kim believes Western governments clung to the narrative that they were saving needy children and ignored evidence that suggested otherwise. Foreign diplomats in the country surely would have noticed that Seoul's streets weren't packed with abandoned babies and street children, she said.

""We were commodified like a good to be sold,"" she said. ""They made fake orphans and fed the market.""

This story is the second in an ongoing investigation led by The Associated Press in collaboration with FRONTLINE (PBS). The first story is here. The investigation includes an interactive and the upcoming documentary South Korea's Adoption Reckoning, premiering Sept. 20 on PBS and online.

___

The Korean adoptee diaspora of around 200,000 children is thought to be the largest in the world. At the peak in the 1970s and '80s, South Korea was sending out babies by the hundreds per month.

It's impossible to tell how many adoptions involved fraud, and advocates argue most went well. But France, the country that took in Yooree Kim, acknowledged in March that its own government had long known of ""the existence of illicit practices of a systemic nature.""

""The public authorities were alerted early and were late in taking action,"" the report said. ""In France, diplomatic archives and the archives of associations effectively showed these practices existed in countries over long periods of time and they were alerted at times at the highest levels, often in isolation, without any political reaction to put an end to them.""

Access to birth control and abortion in the Western world had caused the number of domestically adoptable babies to plummet, and families clamored for children. The system was designed for the convenience of consumers, and most adoptive parents didn't even have to visit South Korea.

""To put it simply, there was supply because there was demand,"" said Park Geon-Tae, who leads a team with South Korea's Truth and Reconciliation Commission now investigating its adoption practices. ""Were there so many abandoned children in South Korea? We have yet to see this.""

In 1974, South Korea tried to stop adoptions to Scandinavia, after its political rival, North Korea, charged that children were ""being sold like animals in the foreign land."" South Korean government records from the time show that diplomats from Sweden, Denmark and Norway began begging for babies.

""The adoption of Korean orphans by Swedish parents is not because Korea is neglecting its orphans, but because Swedish couples without children are desiring to adopt them, so it would be good to continue the transfers of orphans,"" the Swedish ambassador said in a meeting with South Korea's deputy foreign minister in January 1975.

South Korean Health Minister Ko Jae-pil wrote in a report that the countries sent nine pleas for adoptions to continue, citing at least 1,455 requests for Korean children. Ambassadors visited Korean officials multiple times and ""have kept badgering by sending diplomatic documents"" that practically threatened halted adoptions would damage relations, the report says. One wrote that he was ""concerned that the public opinion against South Korea would worsen"" if they halted adoptions to Scandinavia. A Danish citizen wrote to the South Korean president directly to plead for him to expedite the adoptions of two Korean boys.

Under pressure, South Korea reversed course.

""Accepting the strong requests by related nations to resume adoptions is considered to promote international friendships,"" Ko wrote in 1975.

In July of that year, Choi Young-ja's toddler ran out of the house to chase a cloud of insecticide sprayed by a fumigation truck with friends and never returned.

She and her husband reported him missing and created posters with his photo and name, Paik Sang-yeol. They carried the posters into the country's largest adoption agency, Holt Children's Services, every month for years. Each time, they were told there was no information.

Nearly 50 years later, after exhausting all other options, she submitted her DNA to a police unit that helps Korean adoptees find their families. Choi has been fighting stomach cancer. As she was rolled into the operating room, all she thought was that she could not die without seeing her son.

When she learned last year that they had found him, she fell to the ground and wept.

He'd been adopted to Norway in December 1975, five months after he went missing. The documents that went with him made up a new name, and included a photo -- black-and-white, his lips pursed tight, his hands curled inward. His adoption case number, K-8818, was taped to his chest.

The adoption agency that sent him away was Holt, the same agency she had visited so many times. She stormed into Holt's offices in Seoul, demanding her son's full adoption files, she said. When a worker refused without her son's signoff, Choi snapped: She flipped a chair, hurled a trash bin, and swung a roll of paper.

""Did you get me to sign off when you sold away my 4-year-old?!"" Choi recalled shouting. Holt did not respond to a request to verify Choi's account of the meeting.

She's working with lawyers to file a lawsuit against the South Korean government and Holt for sending her son to Norway.

Norwegian authorities ""are aware of serious findings that have come to light"" about adoptions, said Ingeborg Gloppen Johnsen, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The country launched an investigation last year to uncover whether illegal or unethical practices happened, and if Norwegian officials failed to control them.

In late October, Choi nervously paced her narrow living quarters, double-checked flight arrival times and dug through an album of fading photographs. She hadn't slept for days.

Her boy -- now a graying 52-year-old fashion designer -- was coming to visit.

Choi quietly stood at the Incheon International Airport, sporting freshly styled hair and a vibrant pink cardigan she handpicked for the reunion. She'd been rehearsing what to say, and practiced ""I'm sorry"" in English.

Then he emerged from the crowd. She knew him immediately -- the familiar round cheeks, the prominent ears, the wide, grinning eyes.

She buried her face into his chest and wailed, managing to choke out the words:

Americans pioneered the modern adoption system and brought home far more South Korean children than any other nation.

In the 1950s, Harry and Bertha Holt, evangelical Christians from Oregon, said they'd received a calling from God to save Korean War orphans. Until then, international adoptions were not common. But after the war, biracial babies born to Korean women and American soldiers were shunned by a society that valued racial purity and saw them as a painful reminder of U.S. imperialism.

Harry Holt, a farmer and timberman, flew to Korea and rounded up a dozen orphans -- eight for himself and four for friends. The Holts were ""deluged"" with letters from others who wanted orphans of their own, Bertha Holt wrote in a memoir.

Harry Holt began flying planeloads of babies to the U.S. The only qualification for adoptive families was that they were born-again Christians.

The government knew its citizens were desperate for children: Aching letters had been pouring into U.S. government offices from hopeful parents, begging for help finding someone to adopt, according to archives. A woman wrote she felt she was ""cheating"" her husband out of a family. Another said they wanted a child born to parents suitably intelligent. Yet another asked for a baby ""or one as young as I can get it.""

U.S. officials wanted to process the adoptions as quickly as possible to avoid bad publicity, according to internal government memos at the National Archives. A social worker wrote that an immigration official told her his boss ""wants no reports to reach Washington of dissatisfied customers due to delays in processing.""

The mothers of biracial children didn't always want to give them up, records show. In a letter to his wife in 1956, Harry Holt wrote: ""One poor girl almost had hysterics in the office. She thought she could keep track of her baby after he had gone to America. I had to tell her it was a clean break and forever. Poor girl, her baby wasn't weaned yet and she cried and cried.""

The adoption business boomed and attracted competitors, including Eastern Social Welfare Society, Korea Welfare Services and Korea Social Service. Holt remained the largest, sending about half of Korean adoptees abroad. Holt split in 1977, forming a separate Oregon-based agency, Holt International, that often partnered with its Korean sister. By then, South Korea was climbing out of post-war poverty, yet the numbers of adoptions kept skyrocketing.

An International Social Service social worker who visited the U.S. Embassy in Seoul around that time found what she saw ""distasteful,"" according to documents at the agency's archives at the University of Minnesota Libraries.

""It showed the callous way in which children going to the US. were processed, to me, it was a real assembly line type method,"" Patricia Nye, the east Asia director for ISS, wrote. ""Only documents are seen, children are never seen by the visa officers.""

American officials seemed to defer entirely to the agencies, she wrote: ""I was told that it is the US embassy's feelings that each agency should be left to their own cognizance."" Nye has since died.

At a hearing in 1977, a U.S. Congressman asked why so many children were still coming from South Korea. Immigration officials acknowledged it was because of ""the active cooperation of the Korean government"" and ""very active adoption agencies.""

An official testified that an officer in Tokyo would fly to Seoul for one week a month to make sure the children were adoptable orphans. But with hundreds of stories to verify in a single week, only a tiny fraction of adoptions were denied.

""We didn't pay attention when we should have been in the beginning. Somebody should have said, what is going on? How is that possible?"" said Susan Jacobs, a retired State Department official who has worked on adoption reform efforts. ""We were wrong, we were totally wrong, we constantly dropped the ball.""

Laws tended to favor the desires of adoptive parents, she said, and there were few safeguards built into the system. International adoptions were shoehorned into a process built for domestic adoptions. After the federal government issued the initial visas, adoptions were finalized through thousands of local courthouses with different judges, laws and standards.

In 1985, Judge Homer Stark in Gwinnett County, Georgia, noticed the adoption file before him for twin Korean boys included no acknowledgement of the birth parents or proof that they consented. The only paperwork submitted was a statement signed by a guardian, and it was unclear how the person came into possession of the children.

""That opens a lot of holes for illegal things,"" Stark remembers thinking, in a recent conversation with AP. ""I don't know where this child came from, he might have been picked up off the street.""

Stark asked the attorney general for an opinion. Assistant Attorney General David Will wrote that granting adoptions without documentation of the birth parents' consent ""would condone the practice of the sale of kidnapping of foreign children for ultimate adoption in this state.""

Will soon got a call from his boss to look in their office lobby, he told AP. Mothers had pushed their adopted children in strollers into the attorney general's office for a sit-in, claiming he was trying to shut down adoption.

He says he tried to tell them: ""We just want adoptions to be done right, to respect the rights of the parents and make sure that no one is stealing a child or buying a child.""

When Stark rejected the petition, it was granted by a judge in another Georgia county where the U.S. adoption agency was based. The adoptive father, who asked to not be named, still treasures the photo from that day -- him and his wife, the judge and their twin sons, all smiling.

The year after his boys arrived, the adoption industry took its case to the legislature. Georgia's governor signed a bill into law in April 1986 that exempted the requirement to prove that birth parents gave their consent for foreign adoptions. It fell to federal officials to determine whether a child was truly an adoptable orphan.

""For us, it seemed like we were sending children to a better situation -- whether that's true or not, I can't tell you, but that's what it seemed like,"" said Donald Wells, who was chief of the State Department's immigrant visa unit in Seoul from 1980 to 1984. ""I've always considered that we were doing a good thing.""

He estimates they processed more than 12,000 visas, and immigration officers checked if the child met the definition of an eligible orphan. If the paperwork then looked right to the State Department, they accepted it.

""We saw paperwork, we did not see children,"" he said, ""and we did not have the resources to go out and investigate the background and find out where this child came from.""

The immigration officer he worked with there did question where all the kids were coming from.

Robert Ackerman, immigration attache at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, told reporters in 1988 that he had heard allegations of birth mothers being bribed. But he said he saw ""no evidence of fraud or profiteering"" in his five years at the embassy, despite complaints that he was too tough with adoption applications. Ackerman, who has died, said then that he was ""bothered"" by the business.

""When I see 500 kids going out of the country a month, I have to ask, 'Do we have a humanitarian effort or just a baby pipeline?'"" Ackerman told United Press International. ""Where does humanitarianism end and business begin?""

___

Today, the United States is in the middle of an emotional debate about how best to move forward with adoptions built on a model some call deeply flawed.

Maureen Flatley, a consultant who's helped write reforms of the international adoption system, believes it can only do so after looking at its past. She recalled telling a lobbyist fighting against safeguards in the 1990s that one day, adoptees would grow up and tell their own stories, and that would force a reckoning.

""I think that day has come and I'm glad it's here,"" she said. ""I think it's long past time for the U.S. government to conduct a deep and thorough and searching investigation into what these practices have been. There's a reason the old saying is 'Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.'""

Michelle Bernier-Toth, the State Department's special adviser for children's issues, said the agency is tracking developments in Europe, and has been in contact with South Korea's truth-finding commission on adoptions. They are sympathetic to adoptees who believe their lives were shaped by fraud and deceit. The State Department just started working with an archivist to understand its own history, she said, but records are sparse and difficult to find.

The department emphasized that adoption now is very different. The United States in 2008 ratified the Hague Adoption Convention, an international treaty meant to safeguard intercountry adoptions. Agencies must now be accredited, there are far more regulations and a more stringent process for evaluating orphans. Most children now are older or have special needs, and the number of intercountry adoptions to the U.S. has plummeted from 20,000 in 2004 to less than 2,000, with just 47 from Korea last year.

That has caused some to warn of the danger of stringent regulations making it too hard to save children from dire conditions abroad.

""Of course, I, like all adoption advocates, would prefer that we have even better systems... to make sure that there are as few as possible illegal adoptions that happen,"" said Elizabeth Bartholet, a Harvard law professor and adoptive parent. ""But if you set the standard to be 'we want zero,' you are going to deny millions of kids homes. And that's enormously destructive.""

The lobby of Holt International, on a leafy street in Eugene, Oregon, is a museum to its origin story and Christian mission: to find families for the world's neediest children. It is a well-respected agency that works all over the world, and has called for stricter safeguards in the industry.

Holt asked Susan Soonkeum Cox, who retired last year after working for 40 years at the adoption agency, to speak to AP and Frontline. Holt brought Cox from Korea to the U.S. at around 4 years old in 1956.

Cox rejects the allegations that agencies foraged for babies to send abroad.

""What I'm aware of is the franticness of so many children being brought to orphanages,"" she said. ""It would be wonderful if every child born in Korea and every other country could stay with their biological family and live a happy, fulfilling life. But that's not the reality.""

Holt's South Korea operation, a separate company from the U.S. Holt International, declined to comment on specific allegations, as did the three other Korean adoption agencies. Holt Korea in recent years has denied wrongdoing, attributing adoptees' complaints to misunderstandings and the country's problems with social welfare. Kim Jin Sook, president of Eastern, said the agency was just carrying out government policies to find Western homes for ""discarded children.""

Cox said that as a representative of Holt, she's often at an ""uncomfortable juxtaposition"" where some fellow adoptees blame her. But she believes the majority are happily living their lives.

Cox still refers to Bertha Holt as ""grandma,"" and remembers finding a snapshot of a little girl staring off into the distance in a giant scrapbook when she first began working for Holt.

""Oh my God, that's me,"" she gasped at the time. ""Any kind of hint or a clue is so precious.""

She later learned that her father was a Western soldier, and her mother, now dead, gave her the name Soonkeum -- ""pure gold"" in Korean.

On her 40th birthday, she reclaimed that name as part of her own.

Most adoptees were babies and have no memories of their own. But Yooree Kim remembers.

She was 11 when she and her younger brother were sent by the Korean agency Holt to a couple in France who'd requested siblings around their ages. After a divorce, her impoverished single mother had put them in an orphanage so at least they could eat, a common practice then in Korea. Two days before Christmas in 1983, an orphanage worker pulled her aside to say they would be sent away.

She was terrified. She claimed she was abused at her new home, which her adoptive parents deny. Her brother also denies it, she said, but he did not respond to AP requests for comment. A judge dismissed a complaint she filed against her adoptive father for insufficient evidence.

Ten years after her traumatic move to France, she remembered her Korean family's names, their addresses. So she found them.

""Why did you abandon me?"" she asked her mother.

Her mother said she never did. When she returned to the orphanage, Angel's Home in Seoul, she learned her daughter was already gone.

Angel's Home has since closed. From 1973 to 1990, at least 390 children from there were sent to foreign adopters, including 217 to the U.S. and 127 to France, according to information AP obtained through a records request. All but seven were handled through Holt.

Kim's paperwork contains three conflicting stories of how she and her brother were turned into orphans.

One said they were relinquished by their paternal grand-aunt, whom Kim never recalls meeting. Korean law made clear that consent for adoption can only come from parents, direct-line grandparents or legal guardians. Another document says Kim's mother agreed to the adoption. A third says the siblings were found ""roaming"" the streets and were ""emotionally hardened"" by the experience. She wondered: How did no one in this system, from South Korea to France, catch such discrepancies?

She called the former president of Holt in Korea, who signed her paperwork.

""How can you say you knew nothing when you were the president?"" she asked on the call, which she recorded and provided to AP. He scolded her.

""You are now 50, you should know better,"" he said to Kim. ""This was something that happened 40 years ago.""

Then he hung up.

When reached by AP, the president, Kim Han-Kyu, refused to comment on individual cases.

""What would I know? The president stamps the paperwork as the guardian and the nuts and bolts are handled by working-level employees,"" he said.

He added that he didn't know where Holt got its children, but insisted it ""didn't do bad things"" and agencies didn't compete for children.

""No, no, no, the children were sent abroad as a government policy,"" he said. ""Holt and other social welfare organizations had the role of transport stations. You sent them because the government approved it, otherwise you couldn't.""

Kim's French agency, Les Amis des Enfants du Monde, didn't respond to requests for comment.

Kim wants the world to know what happened to her and to so many others. She stormed up to the home of a French adoption agency leader with a Korean film crew, pressed the buzzer and held it down for a full minute.

""Why did you steal me from my Korean parents?...They never abandoned me,"" she screamed, unsure if anyone was listening.

""Answer me!""

South Korea's government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to supply some 200,000 Korean children to parents overseas, despite years of evidence they were being procured through questionable or downright unscrupulous means, an investigation led by The Associated Press found. Those children grew up and searched for their roots -- and some realized they are not who they were told. This story comes with an interactive in collaboration with Frontline (PBS)."
The politics of immigration play differently along the US-Mexico border,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/immigration-border-town-us-mexico-7b0e02f167bb6d01159f2fda80566752,2024-09-20T04:08:58Z,"SUNLAND PARK, N.M. (AP) -- The politics of immigration look different from the back patio of Ardovino's Desert Crossing restaurant.

That's where Robert Ardovino sees a Border Patrol horse trailer rumbling across his property on a sweltering summer morning. It's where a surveillance helicopter traces a line in the sky, and a nearby Border Patrol agent paces a desert gully littered with castoff water bottles and clothing.

It's also where a steady stream of weary people, often escorted by smugglers, scale a border wall or the slopes of Mount Cristo Rey and step into an uncertain future. It's a stretch of desert where reports of people dying of exhaustion and exposure have become commonplace.

""It's very obvious to me, being on the border, that it's not an open border. It is a very, very, very difficult situation,"" said Ardovino, who pays for private fencing topped by concertina wire to route migrants around a restaurant and vintage aluminum trailers that he rents to overnight guests.

""I wish the facts would rule this conversation, and being here, I know they do not.""

As immigration politics have moved to the forefront of this year's presidential election, they've dominated contests across the country for congressional seats that could determine which party controls Congress. But the urgency of the situation is greater in some districts than others.

Three of 11 congressional district races along the southern U.S. border are hotly-contested rematches in districts that flipped in 2022 with the election of Democratic Rep. Gabe Vasquez in New Mexico and Republican Reps. Juan Ciscomani in Arizona and Monica De La Cruz in Texas.

A partner in a decades-old family business, Ardovino lives in one border district in Texas and works in Vasquez's district in New Mexico. He was disappointed by the collapse in February of a bipartisan border bill in Washington, and he bristles at politicians talking from afar about an ""open border.""

What he wants, more than anything, is a collective fix -- one that doesn't diminish the work of border agents or gloss over real-world challenges like migrants fleeing dictators.

""It's frustrating for people who need a border bill of any kind, any time, to start dealing with the big picture,"" Ardovino said. ""I'd rather be running a restaurant than working on these fences.""

Early voting starts Oct. 8 in Sunland Park, on the edge of a whiplashed congressional district that flipped in 2018, 2020 and again in 2022 with the election of Vasquez.

Democrats in Congress are promoting border enforcement as seldom before, including a half-dozen bills from Vasquez. He touts his knowledge of the region as the U.S.-born son of immigrants with relatives on both sides of the border.

""With migrant activity along the border, we have had to adjust our approach,"" said Vasquez. ""I can say here that the sky is blue for 50 years, but when it turns red, you have to admit that it's turning red.""

Here, border politics are literally matters of life and death. Federal and local authorities describe a new humanitarian crisis along New Mexico's nearly 180-mile portion of the border, where migrant deaths from heat exposure have surged and merciless smuggling cartels inflict havoc.

Where Do√±a Ana County shares a 45-mile stretch of border with Mexico, the sheriff's department reported 78 lifeless migrant bodies found between January and mid-August.

""The death toll, in my 21 years of working with the Do√±a Ana sheriff's department, we have not had this,"" said Major Jon Day.

In the Texas race, Democratic challenger Michelle Vallejo has taken a hard line on border enforcement, shocking progressive allies in her campaign to unseat De La Cruz. A recent ad from Vallejo describes ""chaos at the border"" and urges bipartisan cooperation to deploy more Border Patrol agents and fight human trafficking cartels.

In Arizona's 6th Congressional District, Republican incumbent Ciscomani calls border enforcement his No. 1 priority. But he has distanced himself from former President Donald Trump's sometimes caustic anti-immigrant rhetoric and avoided presidential campaign events in swing-state Arizona. Instead, Ciscomani tells an immigrant's story -- about his own arrival in the U.S. at age 11 from Hermosillo, Mexico. He received citizenship in 2006 and says he is determined to fix the border.

""We have a responsibility to enforce the law on the border, and we also are a community of immigrants -- myself included -- that came here to this country, and we're seeking opportunity.""

Experts say voters near the border have tangible concerns about smugglers and contraband but know the benefits of authorized cross-border commerce and commuting.

""There is, I think, more of a nuanced view,"" said Samara Klar, a pollster and professor at the University of Arizona School of Government and Public Policy.

Border patrol arrests on the southwest border plunged to a 46-month low in July after Mexican authorities stepped up enforcement and President Joe Biden temporarily suspended asylum processing. But in New Mexico, where the decline has been less pronounced, surging migrant deaths prompted coordinated U.S. law enforcement raids in August on stash houses where smugglers hide migrants.

Vasquez, looking to be the first Democrat to win reelection in New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District since 1978, has pitched legislation to improve detection of fentanyl coming across the border and to disrupt cartel recruitment of young Americans to ferry migrants to hiding places -- quick trips that offer $1,100 -- amid a scourge of addiction and proliferation of homeless encampments in cities along the Upper Rio Grande.

But he also has plans to improve conditions at migrant detention centers and offer permanent residency to immigrants who fill critical jobs in the U.S.

Vasquez ousted one-term Republican Congresswoman Yvette Herrell by only 1,350 votes in 2022 after Democrats redrew congressional maps to split a conservative oil-producing region into three districts.

Herrell, seeking the seat for the fourth consecutive time, has described an ""absolute chaotic scene"" at the border, and joined Republican House leaders in claiming that Democrats undermined U.S. elections by opposing a proof-of-citizenship requirement for new voters.

""It's one or the other,"" Herrell said at a rally in Las Cruces with Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson. ""It's our sovereignty over the open border.""

Noncitizens already are prohibited from voting in federal elections under penalties including prison or deportation, and Vasquez says the new requirement would make participation more difficult for legitimate voters, including Native Americans who couldn't vote in New Mexico until 1948. Data from states indicate that voting by noncitizens happens -- though not in high numbers.

Herrell's rhetoric on immigration takes aim at voters in a district Trump lost by a roughly 6% margin in 2020.

""It's a tightrope that she's got to walk in trying to get any of the pro-Trump enthusiasm,"" said Gabriel Sanchez, director of the University of New Mexico Center for Social Policy.

The district's voting age population is 56% Hispanic -- with centuries-old ties to Mexican and Spanish settlement and a smaller share of foreign-born residents than the national average.

""Republicans have been focused more and more on the Hispanic vote because they sense that they can make some inroads,"" Albuquerque-based pollster Brian Sanderoff said. ""And in fact the Hispanic vote in southeastern New Mexico is split. If you're a Hispanic right now in Lea County (in New Mexico), you're almost as likely to be voting Republican as Democrat.""

Recently retired Border Patrol agent Cesar Ramos of Alamogordo says he felt stymied by limitations on prosecuting undocumented immigrants, whose arrival he says contributes to higher prices for housing and essentials. He applauds Herrell's tough talk.

""People here in Alamogordo are 110% behind legal immigration, but despise that there are criminal acts of smuggling, and just breaking into the U.S. with no legal documentation,"" said Ramos, a registered Republican of Puerto Rican heritage.

In Sunland Park, a working-class community nestled between the border and a quarterhorse racetrack, Democratic Party orthodoxy is being tested, too.

Sunland Park native Luis Soto said migrants who cross the border impact his own efforts to open a cannabis dispensary in a former post office.

""I'm waiting for a fire marshal inspection and he's busy saving people in the desert, rescuing bodies from the river, helping people out that are locked in a trailer,"" said Soto, 43, the son of immigrants from Mexico in a family of lifelong Democrats. ""We come from immigrants as well, but I think if the system was fixed, it would work out even better for them as well as for us.""

He is leaning toward Herrell, and associates Trump with better times.

""There was more money, more money rolling around,"" Soto said. ""Now there's money, but it's money to pay off bills.""

Vasquez in New Mexico and Ciscomani in Arizona -- youthful by congressional standards at 40 and 42 -- are near ideological opposites, but they've co-sponsored at least three bills to modernize temporary farmworker visas, spur local manufacturing and combat opioid trafficking. Those bills haven't gotten a floor vote, while the Republican-led House approved Ciscomani's initiative to deter deadly highway pursuits of migrant smugglers by law enforcement.

""Juan and I play basketball together, and he has become a good friend,"" Vasquez said. ""There are solutions on the border that we can do today that may not look like comprehensive immigration reform, but it's biting off chunks and pieces.""

Ciscomani said he's eager to collaborate when he can. His Democratic challenger in Arizona's 6th district, Kirsten Engel, scoffs at that notion, saying Ciscomani publicly opposed a major bipartisan border bill in February, days after Trump told GOP lawmakers to abandon the deal.

The $20 billion bill would have overhauled the asylum system and given the president new powers to expel migrants when asylum claims become overwhelming.

""It was actually a pretty conservative bill and (Ciscomani) rejected it right after Trump told him to,"" said Engel, a law professor and former state legislator. ""This is the kind of solution that ... a lot of voters here really supported.""

Engel lost in 2022 by about 5,000 votes. She hopes to win this time with a campaign against consumer price-gouging and for abortion rights. A constitutional amendment to ensure abortion rights on the statewide ballot could help turn out Democratic voters.

Engel supports the abortion amendment and opposes a ballot proposal to allow local police to make arrests near the border, which she calls an unfunded mandate. Ciscomani did not say how he would vote on the initiatives but says he opposes a national abortion ban.

At Sunland Park, an off-road Border Patrol vehicle kicks dust into the morning air. An unmarked bus arrives for detained migrants. Ardovino, from his deck, gazes at Mount Cristo Rey and wonders aloud what it will take to make this work for people coming in search of a better life -- and for those already here.

""The whole desert is unfortunately littered with people's lives,"" he said.

Voters split on whether Harris or Trump would do a better job on the economy: AP-NORC poll,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-economy-poll-inflation-dc80ac9e5d7da42900762910d5f0a283,2024-09-20T04:04:19Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Going into November's election, neither Kamala Harris nor Donald Trump has a decisive edge with the public on the economy, turning an issue that was once a clear strength for Trump into the equivalent of a political jump ball.

About 4 in 10 registered voters say Republican Trump would do a better job handling the economy, while a similar number say that about the Democratic vice president, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. About 1 in 10 voters don't trust either candidate, and a similar share has equal faith in them.

The finding is a warning sign for Trump, who has tried to link Harris to President Joe Biden's economic track record. The new poll suggests that Harris may be escaping some of the president's baggage on the issue, undercutting what was previously one of Trump's major advantages.

The economy has long been a weak issue for Biden: A separate AP-NORC poll conducted in late June, before Biden's disastrous debate with Trump, found that about 6 in 10 Americans disapproved of his handling of the economy. Earlier this year, Americans were much more likely to say that Trump's presidency helped the country on cost of living and job creation, compared to Biden's.

The new poll found that the economy is one of the most important issues for about 8 in 10 voters as they consider which candidate to support, dwarfing other top issues like health care and crime.

The aftermath of inflation's spike in 2022 to a four-decade high has pervaded this year's presidential contest. Shoppers are upset over their grocery bills. Higher interest rates are financially squeezing the buyers of homes and motor vehicles. All that has appeared to matter more to the public than the low 4.2% unemployment rate and stock market gains.

According to the AP-NORC poll, only about one-third of voters say the state of the national economy is somewhat or very good, although they're more optimistic about their own situation, with about 6 in 10 voters saying their household's finances are somewhat or very good. Both of those numbers have remained steady over the course of the year, despite falling inflation.

The candidates have clashing ideas about how best to straighten out the economy, giving voters a stark choice that might hint at how partisan identity increasingly informs views of the economy and policy. But neither campaign has fully explained how its plans would be implemented. Harris insists her plans would be fully funded and not add to the deficit, while Trump's team assumes -- in defiance of most economic models -- that growth will be high enough to offset the cost.

Mark Carlough, 33, who works on medical records in Philadelphia, plans to vote for Harris and says he believes that the taxes on imports proposed by Trump would hurt most consumers.

""The tariffs would be horrible for the economy,"" he said.

Richard Tunnell, 32, of Huntsville, Texas, plans to vote for Trump, just as he did in 2020. He's not sure if the Republican has an advantage over Harris on the economy, but he noted that Trump has been a great businessman who remains one of the ""richest men on the planet"" even after filing for bankruptcy multiple times.

""I believe this country needs someone to reach their hand in it and work it like a game of Monopoly and that person is Donald Trump,"" said Tunnell, a military veteran on disability.

Chantelle Breaux, 38, a stay-at-home parent from Lafayette, Louisiana, feels neither candidate has much to offer on the economy. She doesn't plan to vote -- unless a candidate more to her liking enters the race.

""Kamala wants to put a Band-Aid where major surgery needs to be done on this economy,"" said Breaux. ""Trump wants to run the country as if it's a business, but it isn't a business that is going to support all of the people.""

Former President Trump suggests growth would come from tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy leading to more investment, while a universal tariff of as much as 20% would direct that investment to building U.S. factories.

Harris has campaigned on more benefits for the middle class to be funded by higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy, saying that would help to contain costs and deliver growth. Her team has warned that Trump's tariffs would lead to higher prices and worsen underlying inflation challenges.

The economy is one of many issues shaping public sentiment as the campaigns seek to turn out their voters. More than half of voters said health care was a top concern, while roughly half said that about crime, immigration, abortion policy and gun policy. Only about one-third called climate change one of the most important issues for their vote, and about one-quarter said that about the war between Israel and Hamas.

Trump and Harris are evenly matched in the poll on who would better handle crime and the war in Gaza. But the issues soon splinter in ways that reflect the distinct priorities of Republicans and Democrats.

Trump has an advantage over Harris on whom voters trust to better handle immigration. This issue was a problem for Biden, as well: Illegal immigration and crossings at the U.S. border with Mexico have been a challenge during much of his administration. Republicans are more likely to care about immigration, the issue where Trump has a clear upper hand.

Harris fares better than Trump when it comes to issues that Democrats care more about, including gun policy, health care, abortion policy and climate change.

Rosamaria Nunez, a 68-year-old retiree in San Antonio, Texas, identified gun violence as the most important issue facing the country, saying it became personal when her grandson called her last year to be picked up because of a school lockdown.

Nunez said she plans to vote for Harris, saying: ""First of all, she's a gun owner, so she can relate to the safety issue. She seems like she's more in tune with a real person than Trump is.""

Overall, voters see high stakes for the presidential election's impact on the country's future, the economy, and the future of democracy in the U.S., but they're less likely to think the election will have an impact on them personally. About 8 in 10 voters say the election will have ""a great deal"" or ""quite a bit"" of impact on the country's future. About three-quarters say the election will have a similar impact on the nation's economy and the future of democracy in the U.S.

By contrast, half of voters say the election will have at least ""quite a bit"" of impact on them personally.

The poll of 1,771 registered voters was conducted September 12-16, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for registered voters is plus or minus 3.4 percentage points."
A lawsuit challenging a South Dakota abortion rights measure will play out after the election,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/south-dakota-abortion-ballot-f2f6bbbfc9a0b017d8721f56cdc3e713,2024-09-19T23:45:44Z,"Media reports of an apparent disconnect between attorneys and the Second Judicial Circuit over scheduling of the trial -- initially set for Sept. 23-27 -- led the court to issue an advisory with a timeline of judge assignments in the case. A hearing on the Life Defense Fund's motion for summary judgment is now set for Dec. 2, weeks after the Nov. 5 election.

The release describes how, over about two weeks, the case was reassigned from Judge John Pekas after he learned of his wife's need for surgery. However, the case then was assigned back to him after another judge was removed from the case.

In a statement, Life Defense Fund spokesperson Caroline Woods said both parties were surprised the trial was not going to happen next week.

""After an immense amount of preparation, Life Defense Fund is deeply disappointed that we are not allowed to provide our evidence to the court,"" she said.

Dakotans for Health co-founder Rick Weiland said, ""I think for us the bottom line is that through this whole process and just trying to stop the voters of South Dakota from weighing in, and they've been unsuccessful every step of the way, and now their hope was to have a trial during the height of the election, and that's not going to happen. ... We're going to have a vote, not a trial.""

Life Defense Fund alleged a mix of wrongdoing by petition circulators in its effort to kill the measure, which would place abortion rights in the state constitution.

South Dakota outlaws abortion as a felony crime, with the only exception to save the life of the mother, under a trigger ban that took effect in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.

South Dakota is one of nine states where voters will decide ballot measures enshrining abortion rights this fall. In all seven states where the issue has previously been on the ballot, voters have sided with abortion rights."
North Carolina Republican governor candidate Mark Robinson vows to stay in race despite media report,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/north-carolina-governor-mark-robinson-2339d442ffe7e38b9a83e3ce3ad4f4d2,2024-09-19T19:50:11Z,"RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina Republican gubernatorial nominee Mark Robinson vowed on Thursday to remain in his race in advance of what he called the release of a media report against him, saying he won't be forced out by ""salacious tabloid lies.""

Robinson, the sitting lieutenant governor who decisively won his GOP gubernatorial primary in March, has been trailing in several recent polls to Democratic nominee Josh Stein, the current attorney general.

""We are staying in this race. We are in it to win it,"" Robinson said in a video posted Thursday on the social media platform X. ""And we know that with your help, we will.""

Robinson referenced in the video a story that he said was coming from CNN. Robinson didn't give details of the story content.

""Let me reassure you the things that you will see in that story -- those are not the words of Mark Robinson,"" he said. ""You know my words. You know my character.""

The contents of the story have not been independently verified by The Associated Press.

Robinson has a history of inflammatory comments that Stein had said made him too extreme to lead North Carolina. They already had contributed to the prospect that campaign struggles for Robinson would hurt former President Donald Trump to win the battleground state's 16 electoral votes, and potential other GOP downballot candidates.

Recent polls of North Carolina voters show Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris locked in a close race. The same polls showed Stein with a roughly 10-point lead over Robinson.

On a Facebook post in 2019, for example, Robinson said abortion in America was about ""killing the child because you weren't responsible enough to keep your skirt down."" In a 2021 speech in a church, he used the word ""filth"" when discussing gay and transgender people.

State law says a gubernatorial nominee could withdraw as a candidate no later than the day before the first absentee ballots requested by military and overseas voters are distributed. That begins Friday, so the withdrawal deadline would be late Thursday night.

Trump has frequently voiced his support for Robinson, who has been considered a rising star in his party, well-known for his fiery speeches and evocative rhetoric. Ahead of the March primary, Trump at a rally in Greensboro called Robinson ""Martin Luther King on steroids"" in reference to the civil rights leader, for his speaking ability."
Republicans are trying a new approach to abortion in the race for Congress,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-reproductive-rights-harris-trump-congress-bf0da946328ab06f122a99d696c04774,2024-09-19T17:14:45Z,"In the most contested races for control of the U.S. House, many Republican candidates are speaking up about women's rights to abortion access and reproductive care in new and surprising ways, a deliberate shift for a GOP blindsided by some political ramifications of the post-Roe v. Wade era.

Looking directly into the camera for ads, or penning personal op-eds in local newspapers, the Republicans are trying to distance themselves from some of the more aggressive anti-abortion ideas coming from their party and its allies. Instead the Republican candidates are working quickly to spell out their own views separate from a GOP that for decades has worked to put restrictions on reproductive care.

In New York, endangered GOP Rep. Mark Lawler, sitting at a kitchen table with his wife in one ad said, ""There can be no place for extremism in women's health care.""

In California, GOP Rep. Michelle Steel explains her own journey to parenthood with in vitro fertilization and vows, ""I have always supported women's access to IVF, and will fight to defend it.""

And in Arizona, GOP Rep. Juan Ciscomani faces the camera and says, ""I want you to hear directly from me: I trust women. I cherish new life. And I reject the extremes on abortion.""

It's a remarkable new approach as the Republican Party works to prevent losses this November that could wipe out its majority control of the House. It comes in a fast-moving election season with high-profile and gripping stories of women's lives being upended and endangered by abortion restrictions.

The new strategy is both sanctioned and promoted by the House Republicans' campaign arm, an acknowledgement of the GOP's failure to grasp the political power of women's reproductive care as an issue that would mobilize voters.

""The Republicans have always known they're actually on the wrong side of this issue,"" said Ilyse Hogue, former president of the group previously known as NARAL Pro-Choice America, who is now a senior fellow at New America, a think tank in Washington. She said the party's shift ""wouldn't surprise me.""

With the election fewer than 50 days away, the House Republican candidates are real-time road-testing how to talk about women's access to reproductive care at a time when young women are more liberal than in decades.

On the national level, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, has both celebrated the Supreme Court decision in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case overruling Roe v. Wade yet insisted it's best left to the states to decide whether to allow abortions. He's also distanced himself from the far right's longtime goal of a national abortion ban.

With Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris having replaced President Joe Biden at the top of the party's ticket, Democrats are capitalizing on the vice president's ability to mobilize women, and others, and vow to reinstate reproductive care in a campaign whose rally-goers cheer: ""We are not going back.""

The campaigns for control of the U.S. House are as tight as ever, with a few seats expected to determine which party holds the majority in the chamber, and whether Congress will become aligned with the White House or a potential opposition check on a new administration.

Republicans admit they did not expect abortion access to become such a determinative issue when the Supreme Court, in 2022, decided the Dobbs case that struck down Roe v. Wade, ending the right to abortion that had been the law of the land for nearly 50 years.

Voters didn't always mention abortion access as a top concern in the 2022 election, Republicans said, but it became disqualifying for candidates who were portrayed as too extreme. The anti-abortion movement's push for a national abortion ban and proposed rollbacks of fertility treatments sparked a new focus. That November's promised ""red wave"" of Republican election victories never materialized and the party barely won a House majority.

By summer 2024, polling by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed a solid majority of Americans oppose a federal abortion ban and a rising number support access to abortions for any reason. That's an increase from 2021, a year before the Supreme Court decision.

In one contested San Diego-area House race, the Republican challenger Matt Gunderson speaks directly to the camera and declares: ""I'm pro-choice.""

Jack Pandol, the communications director of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that in 2022, Democrats spent hundreds of millions of dollars ""lying about Republican candidates' positions on this sensitive and nuanced issue.""

""Republicans can't let Democrats lie any longer -- they should be clear, direct, and forcefully push back against these false attacks.""

Still, House Democrats are redoubling efforts to gain control of the chamber by focusing on House Republican candidates and their abortion views -- past and present.

""Republicans are trying to gaslight voters,"" said CJ Warnke, communications director of the House Majority PAC, which is the outside group supporting House Democrats.

House Majority PAC is pummeling Republicans with millions of dollars' worth of campaign ads warning against extreme GOP views on abortion and reproductive care. It has pulled up the voting records, bill sponsorships and past commentary from both incumbents and newcomers and is promising to spend at least $100 million this election cycle on the issue in House races.

Democrats, too, have shifted to speaking more openly and forcefully in favor of reproductive care, led in many ways by Harris' example.

Rep. Suzan DelBene, the chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, vowed, ""We'll make sure the American people will know exactly how the Republicans have voted to restrict reproductive rights.""

Congress has served as a key battleground in efforts to advance the anti-abortion agenda for decades, as Republicans have repeatedly proposed legislation to limit different types of abortion services, including late-term abortions.

Trump, along with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, orchestrated the confirmation of three justices to the nine-member Supreme Court -- a historic accomplishment -- during the former president's term in office, fulfilling a longtime party goal of shifting the court to a conservative majority.

First celebrated as a conservative victory when the court overtured Roe v. Wade, the aftermath of the Dobbs decision soon became a political liability for Republicans as states began instituting abortion bans.

One of the nation's leading anti-abortion advocacy groups, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, is encouraging candidates in a strategy memo to recommit to ending abortion and portraying the Democrats as extreme in seeking to make abortion access available nationwide.

But GOP Rep. Lawler said it was important he address the issue head on because Democrats are attacking him as extreme on the issue. ""Voters have a right to know where I stand,"" Lawler said.

Two Georgia deaths are tied to abortion restrictions. Experts say abortion pills they took are safe,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-pills-georgia-mifepristone-misoprostol-kamala-harris-fd3c817f42ccc74b04d12450efb92f4a,2024-09-19T16:10:05Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to speak about abortion Friday in Georgia, where two women's deaths have been tied to a state law that mostly bans the procedure after roughly six weeks.

Amber Thurman died after waiting 20 hours for a hospital to treat complications that occurred after she took abortion pills. Reported by ProPublica earlier this week, the case is the first publicly reported instance of a woman dying from delayed care.

The news organization also reported on the death of Candi Miller, a woman with lupus, diabetes and hypertension who took abortion pills she ordered online. An autopsy found fetal tissue that hadn't been expelled and a lethal combination of painkillers, ProPublica reported. The state's maternal mortality review committee did not believe abortion medication caused her death.

Still, the fact both women used the pills -- mifepristone and misoprostol -- may raise questions about whether they are safe. Here are some facts.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved mifepristone in 2000 as a safe and effective way to end early pregnancies. The drug, which blocks the hormone progesterone, also primes the uterus to respond to the contraction-causing effect of another drug typically used along with it, misoprostol. The pills are used in more than six in 10 abortions nationally.

There are rare occasions when mifepristone can cause excessive bleeding that requires emergency care.

Because of that, the FDA initially imposed strict safety limits on who could prescribe and distribute it -- only specially certified physicians and only as part of three mandatory in-person appointments with the patient getting the drug. The doctors also had to be capable of performing emergency surgery to stop excess bleeding and an abortion procedure if the drug didn't end the pregnancy.

Over the years, the FDA reaffirmed mifepristone's safety and repeatedly eased restrictions, culminating in a 2021 decision doing away with any in-person requirements and allowing the pill to be sent through the mail.

In 2022, a coalition of anti-abortion groups filed a federal lawsuit against the FDA challenging the agency's long-standing approval of mifepristone. Justices ruled in June that the abortion opponents lacked the legal right to sue and preserved access to the medication.

Abortion opponents say the more lax restrictions resulted in many more ""emergency complications."" But that argument lumps together women experiencing a range of issues with mifepristone -- from the drug not working to people who may simply have questions or concerns but don't require medical care.

OB-GYNs say a tiny fraction of patients suffer ""major"" or ""serious"" adverse events after taking mifepristone.

A legal brief by a group of medical organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says: ""When used in medication abortion, major adverse events -- significant infection, excessive blood loss, or hospitalization -- occur in less than 0.32% of patients, according to a highly regarded study with more than 50,000 patients.""

The definition that scientists generally use for serious adverse events includes blood transfusions, major surgery, hospital admissions and death, said Ushma Upadhyay, one of the authors of that 2015 study.

The prescribing information included in the packaging for mifepristone tablets lists slightly different statistics for what it calls ""serious adverse reactions."" It cites ranges for how frequently various complications occur: 0.03% to 0.5% for transfusion; 0.2% for sepsis and 0.04% to 0.6% for hospitalization related to medication abortions. The ranges reflect findings across various relevant studies, experts said.

Mifepristone's labeling also lists a complication that most medical groups don't consider a serious or major adverse event: ER visits, which ranged from 2.9% to 4.6%. The current FDA label lists going to the ER as an option if patients experience prolonged heavy bleeding, severe abdominal pain or a sustained fever.

But ER visits don't always reflect big problems, doctors told The Associated Press.

Some people may go there after a medication abortion because they want to be checked out or have questions but don't have a doctor, said Upadhyay, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. Others, she said, ""don't want to go to their primary care provider about their abortion"" because of stigma.

A study she co-authored in 2018 found that slightly more than half of patients who visited the ER because of abortions received only observational care. Some, Upadhyay said, ""don't receive any treatment.""

Mifepristone results in a completed abortion 97.4% of the time, according to U.S. studies cited in the FDA label.

But in 2.6% of cases, a surgical intervention is needed. And 0.7% of the time, the pregnancy continues.

That's compared to a procedural abortion in a clinic, where the chance of the procedure failing to end a pregnancy ""is extremely, extremely low,"" probably less than 0.1%, said Dr. Pratima Gupta, a board member for the college of OB-GYNs.

""Any time a procedural abortion is done, the clinicians ensure that it was a complete abortion"" by examining the tissue that is removed or performing an ultrasound during or after the procedure, she said.

Gupta, who has done abortion procedures for more than 20 years, said there are ""very few complications from abortion -- any kind of abortion, medication or procedural abortion."" A recent study suggests that's just as true for medication abortions that happen in a clinic, a doctor's office or at home with the help of telehealth.

The FDA makes drug approval decisions on a case-by-case basis, weighing effectiveness, safety and other factors.

No drug is 100% effective, and many common medications don't work for a significant portion of patients.

Antidepressants typically help between 40% and 60% of people with depression. New antibiotics approved by the FDA often resolve about 70% of infections.

Since 2000, roughly 6 million patients have taken mifepristone, according to the FDA. A 2021 review of agency records looking for deaths that were likely related to the drug identified 13, or .00027% of patients.

Medical organizations supporting mifepristone's availability say the drug's safety -- given the rate of deaths -- compares to ""ibuprofen, which more than 30 million Americans take in any given day.""

State asks judge to pause ruling that struck down North Dakota's abortion ban,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/north-dakota-abortion-863e8a1e97a8cb2c4f830cc954335dd7,2024-09-19T16:08:25Z,"BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- The state of North Dakota is asking a judge to pause his ruling from last week that struck down the state's abortion ban until the state Supreme Court rules on a planned appeal.

The state's motion to stay a pending appeal was filed Wednesday. State District Judge Bruce Romanick ruled last week that North Dakota's abortion ban ""is unconstitutionally void for vagueness,"" and that pregnant women in the state have a fundamental right to abortion before viability under the state constitution.

Attorneys for the state said ""a stay is warranted until a decision and mandate has been issued by the North Dakota Supreme Court from the appeal that the State will be promptly pursuing. Simply, this case presents serious, difficult and new legal issues.""

In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which established a constitutional right to an abortion. Soon afterward, the only abortion clinic in North Dakota moved from Fargo to neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota, and challenged North Dakota's since-repealed trigger ban outlawing most abortions.

In 2023, North Dakota's Republican-controlled Legislature revised the state's abortion laws amid the ongoing lawsuit. The amended ban outlawed performance of all abortions as a felony crime but for procedures to prevent a pregnant woman's death or a ""serious health risk"" to her, and in cases of rape or incest but only up to six weeks. The law took effect in April 2023.

The Red River Women's Clinic, joined by several doctors, then challenged that law as unconstitutionally vague for doctors and its health exception as too narrow. In court in July, about a month before a scheduled trial, the state asked the judge to throw out the lawsuit, while the plaintiffs asked him to let the August trial proceed. He canceled the trial and later found the law unconstitutional, but has yet to issue a final judgment.

In an interview Tuesday, Center for Reproductive Rights Senior Counsel Marc Hearron said the plaintiffs would oppose any stay.

""Look, they don't have to appeal, and they also don't have to seek a stay because, like I said, this decision is not leading any time soon to clinics reopening across the state,"" he said. ""We're talking about standard-of-care, necessary, time-sensitive health care, abortion care generally provided in hospitals or by maternal-fetal medicine specialists, and for the state to seek a stay or to appeal a ruling that allows those physicians just to practice medicine I think is shameful.""

Republican state Sen. Janne Myrdal, who introduced the 2023 bill, said she's confident the state Supreme Court will overturn the judge's ruling. She called the decision one of the poorest legal decisions she has read.

""I challenge anybody to go through his opinion and find anything but 'personal opinions,'"" she said Monday.

In his ruling, Romanick said, ""The Court is left to craft findings and conclusions on an issue of vital public importance when the longstanding precedent on that issue no longer exists federally, and much of the North Dakota precedent on that issue relied on the federal precedent now upended -- with relatively no idea how the appellate court in this state will address the issue."""
"Maternal deaths surged in Texas in 2020, 2021",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/us-news/pregnancy-and-childbirth-health-disparities-death-rates-general-news-accb20b6470cc346ce31f9dc9fc67372,2024-09-19T15:50:19Z,"The rate of Texas women who died because of pregnancy or childbirth rose sharply in 2020 and 2021 to the highest since the state started tracking maternal deaths in 2013. Even excluding deaths related to COVID-19, the numbers were worse than usual, reversing two years of progress in driving the maternal mortality rate downwards.

The Texas Maternal Mortality and Morbidity Review Committee released its report this month analyzing pregnancy-related deaths within one year of childbirth. The committee, which works on a several year delay, closely analyzed cases from 2020.

The maternal mortality rate in 2020 was 27.7 deaths per 100,000 live births, compared to 17.2 in 2019. With COVID-related deaths excluded, the rate was 24.2.

But the report shows, once again, that maternal mortality does not impact every community equally. Black women are about 2.5 times more likely to die from pregnancy and childbirth than white women. Both Black and Hispanic women saw a sharp increase in pregnancy-related mortality between 2019 and 2020 -- for Hispanic women the rate increased nearly 9 points to 22.2, and for Black women more than 11 points to 39. But white women actually saw an improvement, with the mortality rate dropping nearly 3 points to 16.1.

In 80% of these cases, the committee determined there was at least some chance of saving the patient's life - a decline from 90% from the previous report. A quarter of women died due to infections, the most common cause of death, followed by cardiovascular conditions, obstetric hemorrhage, embolisms and mental health conditions.

For years, the committee's first recommendation to improve the state's maternal mortality rate was the same: allow new moms to stay on Medicaid for 12 months after giving birth, instead of the two months Texas offered. In 2023, the Legislature approved that extension.

In the latest report, the top recommendations are a more general call to improve access to comprehensive health care services, as well as prioritizing resources for pregnant and postpartum patients in public health emergencies and engaging Black communities to address disparities.

Since the most recent case analysis is from 2020, it does not reflect any impact from changes to Texas' abortion laws. In 2021, Texas banned almost all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy. In 2022, after the overturn of Roe v. Wade, the state banned almost all abortions from the moment of conception. The law allows for an abortion to save the life of the pregnant patient, but dozens of women have come forward with stories of medical care delayed or denied because their doctors were confused or scared to treat them.

State Rep. Donna Howard, a Democrat from Austin and chair of the Women's Health Caucus, said in a statement Wednesday that legislators should work ""across partisan divides"" to address the increase in maternal mortality.

""Texas has vast resources at our disposal that can, and must, be leveraged to improve health outcomes for Texas moms,"" she said.

The maternal mortality committee, which was formed with bipartisan support in 2013, has come under increased scrutiny in the last few years.

In 2022, the report was delayed, with state officials saying they needed more time to do a complete review of 2019 cases. Advocates, in pushing for the report to be released, claimed Republican leaders, including Gov. Greg Abbott, didn't want it published ahead of the fall elections. It was released in December of that year, and showed many of the same challenges reflected in this more recent report.

During the 2023 legislative session, lawmakers added additional positions to the committee, including two community member spots to replace the existing advocate role. While the previous position was filled by a Black woman who herself experienced birth trauma, both of the new spots were filled by doctors. The position reserved for a rural community member went to an anti-abortion OB-GYN from San Antonio over a labor and delivery nurse from the Rio Grande Valley, The Texas Tribune revealed in August.

Additionally, the Legislature appropriated $6 million in 2023 to create a new state-level tracking program for maternal deaths -- and remove Texas from the Centers for Disease Control's tracking program as a result.

The report said the new system will allow ""for more efficient and timelier case identification."" But at a committee meeting in June, chair Dr. Carla Ortique said participating in the national system alongside almost all other states was key to ""efficiently and effectively"" reviewing cases. She said at the meeting that it was unclear whether the legislation would allow for them to run the state and federal systems simultaneously, but she felt it was important for such a big state to continue to contribute to the national system.

Texas Health and Human Services Commission also recently declined to participate in a federal maternal health program that would have provided funding and technical assistance, Howard said in a statement. The agency said it would need legislative direction and appropriations to be able to participate, she said.

Takeaways from AP's report on the evangelicals backing Kamala Harris,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/evangelicals-harris-trump-christians-vote-e1f1c5a0806cf3d88e95ff4bdc1fc4db,2024-09-19T12:11:54Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump has heavily courted conservative evangelicals since his arrival on the political scene almost a decade ago. Now he is selling Trump-themed Bibles, touting the overturning of Roe v. Wade and imploring Christians to get out the vote for him.

But a small and diverse coalition of evangelicals is looking to pull their fellow believers away Trump's fold, offering not only an alternate candidate to support but an alternate vision for their faith altogether.

Grassroots groups like Evangelicals for Harris have run advertisements and a Zoom call. Despite some policy differences with the vice president, they argue she is the better choice this election.

Here are takeaways from AP's report on the evangelicals supporting Vice President Kamala Harris.

Trump has historically maintained strong support among evangelical voters. According to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of the electorate, about 8 in 10 evangelical voters cast a ballot for him in 2020.

But some evangelicals have used perceived cracks in his political fidelity to further distance themselves from the former president, especially as Trump and his surrogates have waffled over whether he would sign a federal abortion ban ‚ÄØshould he become president.

The Rev. Dwight McKissic, a Baptist pastor from Texas who spoke on the Evangelicals for Harris call, said he saw no ""moral superiority of one party over the other,"" citing the GOP's recent party platform that lacked a national abortion ban and softened its stance against same-sex marriage.

Though he has historically voted Republican, McKissic said he would vote for Harris, whom he said has stronger character and qualifications.

Presbyterian pastor Lee Scott, who is part of Evangelicals for Harris, said he is anti-abortion and doesn't agree with Harris on all policies. ""But at the same time, she has a pro-family platform,"" he said, citing her education policies and promise to expand the child tax credit.

With modest funding in 2020, the group, formerly known as Evangelicals for Biden, targeted evangelical voters in swing states. This election, the Rev. Jim Ball, the organization's president, said they're expanding the operation and looking to‚ÄØspend a million dollars on targeted advertisements.

While white evangelicals vote strongly Republican, not all evangelicals are a lock for the GOP, and in a tight race, every vote counts.

In 2020, Biden won about 2 in 10 white evangelicals, but performed better with evangelical voters overall, according to AP VoteCast, winning about one-third of this group. A September AP-NORC poll found that around 6 in 10 Americans who identify as ""born-again"" or ""evangelical"" have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Harris, but that unfavorability increases to 8 in 10 for white evangelicals.

In August, Harris' campaign hired the Rev. Jen Butler, a Presbyterian (U.S.A.) minister and experienced faith-based organizer, to lead its religious outreach.

Butler told the AP she has been in touch with Evangelicals for Harris, and she wants to harness the power of grassroots groups to engage religious voters.

The campaign is focusing on Black Protestants and Latino evangelicals, especially in key swing states. They are reaching out to Catholics and mainline Protestants across the Rust Belt and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Arizona and Nevada. Butler's colleagues are working with Jewish and Muslim constituencies.

Catholics for Harris and Interfaith for Harris groups are launching. Mainline Protestant groups like Black Church PAC and Christians for Kamala are also campaigning on behalf of the vice president.

Butler said the Harris campaign can find common ground with evangelicals, particularly suburban evangelical women who want compassionate approaches to issues like immigration and abortion.

The chorus of evangelicals who find voting for a Democrat unconscionable remains loud.

The term evangelical itself is fraught and has become synonymous with the Republican Party, argues Ryan Burge, a political science professor at Eastern Illinois University.

Evangelicalism has historically referenced Christians who hold conservative theological beliefs regarding issues like the importance of the Bible and being born again. But that's changed as the term has grown more connected with Republican voters.

Latasha Morrison told the AP that as a Black woman, she didn't identify as evangelical until she started attending predominantly white churches. For years her anti-abortion views led her to vote Republican, but this election, she thinks women and children will be better off under a Harris administration.

Soong-Chan Rah, a professor of evangelism at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, said that by endorsing Harris, he hopes to ""show that there are other voices in the church aside from the religious right and Trump evangelicals.""

These evangelicals are voting their values  --  by backing Kamala Harris,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/evangelicals-harris-trump-christians-vote-9d5cb379dc3c2fdb3f4954c556a29ec5,2024-09-19T12:04:27Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the Rev. Lee Scott publicly endorsed Kamala Harris for president during the Evangelicals for Harris Zoom call on Aug. 14, the Presbyterian pastor and farmer said he was taking a risk.

""The easy thing for us to do this year would be to keep our heads down, go to the ballot box, keep our vote secret and go about our business,"" Scott told the group, which garnered roughly 3,200 viewers according to organizers. ""But at this time, I just can't do that.""

Scott lives in Butler, Pennsylvania, the same town where a would-be assassin shot former President Donald Trump in July. Scott told The Associated Press that the attack and its impact on his community pushed him to speak out against Trump and the ""vitriol"" and ""acceptable violence"" he normalized in politics.

Trump has maintained strong support among white evangelical voters. According to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of the electorate, about 8 in 10 white evangelical voters cast a ballot for him in 2020. But a small and diverse coalition of evangelicals is looking to pull their fellow believers away from the former president's fold, offering not only an alternate candidate to support but an alternate vision for their faith altogether.

""I am tired of watching meanness, bigotry and recreational cruelty be the worldly witness of our faith,"" Scott said on the call. ""I want transformation, and transformation is risky business.""

Trump has heavily courted white conservative evangelicals since his arrival on the political scene almost a decade ago. Now he is selling Trump-themed Bibles, touting the overturning of Roe v. Wade and imploring Christians to get out the vote for him.

But some evangelicals have used perceived cracks in his political fidelity to further distance themselves from the former president, especially as Trump and his surrogates have waffled over whether he would sign a federal abortion ban ‚ÄØshould he become president.

The Rev. Dwight McKissic, a Baptist pastor from Texas who spoke on the Evangelicals for Harris call, said he saw no ""moral superiority of one party over the other,"" citing the GOP's decision to ""abandon a commitment to ban abortion with a constitutional amendment"" and to soften its stance against same-sex marriage in its party platform.

Though he has historically voted Republican, McKissic said he would vote for Harris, whom he said has stronger character and qualifications.

""I certainly don't agree with her on all matters of policy,"" said Scott, who identifies as evangelical and is ordained in the mainline Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). ""I am pro-life. I am against abortion. But at the same time, she has a pro-family platform,"" citing Harris' education policies and promise to expand the child tax credit.

Grassroots groups like Evangelicals for Harris are hoping they can convince evangelicals who feel similarly to support Harris instead of voting for Trump or sitting out the election altogether.

With modest funding in 2020, the group, formerly known as Evangelicals for Biden, targeted evangelical voters in swing states. This election, the Rev. Jim Ball, the organization's president, said they're expanding the operation and looking to‚ÄØspend a million dollars on targeted advertisements.

A September AP-NORC poll found that around 6 in 10 Americans who identify as ""born-again"" or ""evangelical"" have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Harris, but around one-third have a favorable opinion of her. The majority -- around 8 in 10 -- of white evangelicals have a negative view of Harris.

Vote Common Good, a similar group run by progressive evangelical pastor Doug Pagitt, has a simple message: Political identity and religious identity are not a package deal.

''There's a whole group who have become very uncomfortable voting for Trump,"" Pagitt said. ""We're not trying to get them to change their mind. We're trying to work with them once their minds have changed to act on that change.""

In August, Harris' campaign hired the Rev. Jen Butler, a Presbyterian (U.S.A.) minister and experienced faith-based organizer, to lead its religious outreach.

Butler told the AP she has been in touch with Evangelicals for Harris. With less than two months until Election Day, she wants to harness the power of grassroots groups to quickly engage even more faith voters.

""We want to turn out our base, and we think we have some real potential here to reach folks who have voted Republican in the past,"" Butler said.

They are focusing on Black Protestants and Latino evangelicals, especially in key swing states. They are reaching out to Catholics and mainline Protestants across the Rust Belt and members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Arizona and Nevada. Butler's colleagues are working with Jewish and Muslim constituencies.

Catholics for Harris and Interfaith for Harris groups are launching. Mainline Protestant groups like Black Church PAC and Christians for Kamala are also campaigning on behalf of the vice president.

Butler, who grew up evangelical in Georgia, said the Harris campaign can find common ground with evangelicals, particularly suburban evangelical women.

""There's a whole range of issues that they care about,"" she said, citing compassionate approaches to immigration and abortion. ""They know that the way to address any pro-life concerns is really to support women.""

Even for evangelicals who dislike Trump, it can be difficult to support a Democrat.

Russell Jeong, a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate and speaker on the Evangelicals for Harris call, told AP that the group doesn't ""agree with everything that Harris stands for"" and that evangelicals can ""hold the party accountable by being involved.""

Others on the call noted they would use their vote to pressure Harris on issues where they disagreed, with Latina evangelical activist Sandra Maria Van Opstal saying she'd push the potential Harris administration ""to do better on Palestine-Israel and do better on immigration.""

Soong-Chan Rah, a professor of evangelism at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, describes himself as a nonpartisan progressive evangelical and a ""prophet speaking to broken systems."" Though he's never endorsed a candidate before, he said the stakes of this election are so high that he wanted to throw his public support behind Harris.

""Not only do I find this candidate, Trump, repugnant and repulsive,"" Rah said, ""it is to such an extreme that I want to endorse his opposition.""

But the chorus of evangelicals who find voting for a Democrat unconscionable remains loud.

Trump-supporting evangelical worship leader Sean Feucht ridiculed the existence of Evangelicals for Harris on X: ""HERETICS FOR HARRIS rings so much truer!""

The Rev. Franklin Graham, a longtime Trump supporter, took issue with one of the group's ads and its use of footage of his late father, the Rev. Billy Graham. ""The liberals are using anything and everything they can to promote candidate Harris,"" he wrote on his public Facebook page, which has 10 million followers.

But the project of shoring up Democratic evangelical voters goes beyond partisan politics. It gets at the core of what evangelicalism means.

The term evangelical itself is fraught and has become synonymous with the Republican Party, argues Ryan Burge, a political science professor at Eastern Illinois University.

""More people are probably evangelical theologically,"" said Burge, ""but they're not going to grab that word because they don't vote for Trump or they're moderate or liberal.""

Evangelicalism has historically referenced Christians who hold conservative theological beliefs regarding issues like the importance of the Bible and being born again. But that's changed as the term has grown more connected with Republican voters.

For many, evangelicalism has largely been defined along racial and socio-political lines and in endorsing Harris, Rah hopes to ""show that there are other voices in the church aside from the religious right and Trump evangelicals.""

Latasha Morrison, a speaker on the Evangelicals for Harris Zoom, told the AP that as a Black woman, ""I never associated myself with the word 'evangelical' until I started attending predominantly white churches.""

For years her anti-abortion views led her to vote Republican, but now the Christian author and diversity trainer says, ""I feel like women and children have a better opportunity under the Harris administration than the Trump administration.""

For Ball, the Evangelicals for Harris organizer, he's not looking to ""tell people if they are an evangelical"" or not.

""Diversity is a strength for us. We're not we're not looking for total unanimity. We're looking for unity,"" Ball said. ""We can be united while we still have differences.""

Harris plans a livestream with Oprah Winfrey while Trump is set to address an Israeli-American group,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-oprah-winfrey-miriam-adelson-f9384395f54a0d071ab52bca80d3659e,2024-09-19T11:23:58Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Both major presidential candidates are making appearances Thursday meant to fire up their core supporters, with Vice President Kamala Harris participating in a livestream with Oprah Winfrey and Donald Trump attending an event with prominent Jewish donors before addressing a gathering of the Israeli-American Council.

Winfrey, who has endorsed Harris and spoke at the Democratic convention in August, is set to host a two-hour ""Unite for America"" nighttime streaming session in Michigan with Harris that organizers say aims to highlight dozens of grassroots groups backing the vice president.

Trump will be in Washington to address a ""Fighting Anti-Semitism in America"" evening event with Miriam Adelson, a co-owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks and widow of billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who founded the Las Vegas Sands casino and was one of the Republican Party's largest donors.

Trump will also speak before the Israeli-American Council, a nonprofit long backed by Sheldon Adelson as well as Haim Saban, a major donor to President Joe Biden and Democratic causes. The council is holding its national convention in the weeks before the first anniversary of Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, which sparked the war in Gaza.

On Friday, Harris has campaign stops planned in swing states Wisconsin and Georgia as she calls attention to the case of a young mother who died after waiting 20 hours for a hospital to treat her complications from an abortion pill. Harris contends that outcome shows the consequences of Trump's actions.

Amber Thurman's death, first reported Monday by ProPublica, came two weeks after Georgia's strict abortion ban was enacted in 2022 after the Supreme Court's decision to overturn nationwide abortion rights. Trump nominated three of the justices who made that decision.

Trump has a Saturday rally set in battleground North Carolina.

Thursday's campaign stops follow the Federal Reserve cutting its benchmark interest rate by an unusually large half-point. That marked a dramatic shift after more than two years of high rates that helped tame inflation but also made borrowing painfully expensive for American consumers.

With the presidential election less than seven weeks away, the move has the potential to scramble the economic landscape just as Americans prepare to vote. Campaigning in New York on Wednesday, Trump said, ""I guess it shows the economy is very bad to cut it by that much, assuming they're not just playing politics.""

Asked about potential political influence of a rate cut so close to Election Day, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration has been ""very clear about this and very respectful of the independence of the Federal Reserve.""

""Unlike other administrations, we've been, I think, pretty steadfast about that, and have been continuous in making that clear,"" she added, without naming Trump and his past public criticism of the Fed or his suggestions during the campaign that presidents should have more authority over the central bank."
"Adoption fraud separated generations of South Korean children from their families, AP finds",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-international-adoption-fraud-investigation-takeaways-25fb71223bf86bfd0709863e5063faba,2024-09-19T04:34:01Z,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea's government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to supply some 200,000 Korean children to parents overseas, despite years of evidence they were being procured through questionable or downright unscrupulous means, an investigation led by The Associated Press has found.

Those children grew up and searched for their roots -- and some realized they are not who they were told. Their stories have sparked a reckoning that is rocking the international adoption industry.

The investigation, in collaboration with Frontline (PBS), was based on interviews with more than 80 adoptees in the U.S., Australia and six European countries, along with parents, agency employees, humanitarian workers and government officials. It also drew on more than 100 information requests and thousands of pages of documents -- including many never publicly seen before and some the AP got declassified.

In dozens of cases AP examined, it found: Children were kidnapped off the streets. Parents claim they were told their newborns were dead or very sick, only to have them shipped away. Documents were fabricated, leading adoptees to anguished later reunions with supposed parents -- only to discover they were not related at all.

Government officials declined to answer questions about its past, saying it will let a fact-finding commission finish its work. But in a written statement, the Health Ministry acknowledged that skyrocketing adoptions in the 1970s-80s were possibly driven by an intent to reduce welfare spending.

The adoption agencies declined to comment on specific cases, but have long defended their practices as a way to search for foreign families for vulnerable children.

Here are further findings:

Korea's adoption program grew out of the wreckage of the 1950-53 Korean War, when Americans took in the unwanted biracial children of Korean women and Western soldiers. It expanded to include the children of unwed mothers and poor families. Korea relied on private adoption agencies as its social safety net, bringing millions of dollars into the economy.

Korean officials fit their laws to match American ones to make children adoptable in the West, where access to birth control and abortion had caused the domestic supply of adoptable babies to plummet. The government endorsed ""proxy adoptions"" for families to adopt children quickly without ever visiting Korea. Korea also rewrote its laws to remove minimal safeguards or judicial oversight.

Concerns were raised early. In a 1966 internal memo obtained by AP, International Social Service, a Geneva-based organization, wrote that it suspected the Korean government assessed agencies not by child welfare standards, but by the money they brought in. Korean officials were aware that lost children were documented as abandoned; the origins of alleged orphans weren't verified; and some were ""disguised"" by agencies as being born from unwed mothers to make them adoptable, according to records seen by AP. In the early 1980s, the government itself likened the agencies' child-hunting practices to ""trafficking.""

Former adoption workers told AP that agencies paid to have every corner of the country scoured for children. One worker, employed at an agency from 1979 to 1984, said the agencies had no process to verify the backgrounds of children and invested ""zero effort"" in confirming the child was orphaned.

Private counseling records in a 1988 document prepared by the country's largest adoption agency, Holt Children's Services, show that some parents who relinquished their children soon pleaded for them back, with no success. The document, obtained by AP, describes how agency's workers told parents that their children would thrive in good Western families and may return home someday rich or ""with Ph.Ds.""

Humanitarian workers openly worried about what they were seeing. Francis Carlin, who then ran Korea's Catholic Relief Services, said there weren't enough legitimate orphans to feed Western demand, which led to ""a lot of the compromises, a lot of the hanky panky"" involving larger agencies.

""These, I would call them brokers, were going out and trying to get more and more children,"" Carlin said. ""They would put the legitimate parent on a guilt trip and say, what are you doing? You can't afford to take care of this child.... You're so selfish.""

By the 1980s, agencies were procuring most of their children directly from hospitals and maternity homes, which often received illegal payments for babies, according to records seen by AP. Though the stated intention of adoption was to spare children from orphanages, they gathered more than 4,600 children from hospitals in 1988, 60% of their supply.

A government audit in 1989 shows that Holt Children's Services, the biggest agency, made nearly 100 illegal payments to hospitals during six months in 1988, worth about $16,000 now. Eastern Social Welfare Society gave even more, worth about $65,340, to hospitals over that period.

Despite the agencies' common practice of labeling children as ""abandoned,"" records from 1980 to 1987 show that more than 90% of the Korean children sent to the West almost certainly had known relatives, said Philsik Shin, a scholar at Korea's Anyang University. It was ""almost customary"" to document children as abandoned, said Helen Noh, who matched hundreds of children with U.S. parents at Holt from 1981 to 1982.

Robyn Joy Park, who was adopted by parents in Minnesota in 1982, traveled to South Korea in 2007 to meet a woman her agency, Eastern, said was her biological mother. She developed a deep bond with the woman over several years, but was devastated after a DNA test in 2012 showed they weren't related.

The AP spoke to 10 others who found their identity was switched with someone else. When children processed for adoption died, became too sick to travel or were found by their biological families, agencies often replaced them with other children, according to former adoption workers. At a meeting with an adoptee in 2021 where AP was present, a longtime worker said Western partner agencies were willing to take ""any child of the same sex and similar age, because it would take too much time to start over again.""

Park is among more than 360 adoptees who have asked South Korea's Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate the circumstances surrounding their adoptions.

Nobody knows how many Korean adoptions were questionable or even fraudulent, in part because of the privacy and sensitivities involved along with the vagueness and unreliability of the documents. Advocates say many adoptions have happy endings."
"Rampant adoption fraud separated generations of South Korean children from their families, AP finds",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-international-adoption-fraud-investigation-e4e7d4b8823212e3b260517c5128cd66,2024-09-19T04:33:34Z,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- As the plane descended into Seoul, Robert Calabretta swaddled himself in a blanket, his knees tucked into his chest like a baby in the womb. A single tear ran down his cheek.

The 34-year-old felt like a newborn -- he was about to meet his parents for the first time since he was 3 days old.

Most of his life, he thought they'd abandoned him for adoption to the United States. When he finally found them, he learned the truth: The origin story on his adoption paperwork was a lie. Instead, he said, his parents were told in 1986 that their infant was very sick and they thought he had died.

""I am so sorry,"" his birth father had written when they found each other, his words interrupted by fits of weeping. ""I miss you. How did you endure this cruel world?""

Calabretta is among a growing and vocal community of victims of an adoption system they accuse of searching out children for would-be parents, rather than finding parents for vulnerable children -- sometimes with devastating consequences only surfacing today.

South Korea's government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to supply some 200,000 Korean children to parents overseas, despite years of evidence they were being procured through questionable or downright unscrupulous means, an investigation led by The Associated Press found. Those children grew up and searched for their roots -- and some realized they are not who they were told.

Their stories have sparked a reckoning that is rocking the international adoption industry, which was built in South Korea and spread around the world. European countries have launched investigations and halted international adoption. The South Korean government has accepted a fact-finding commission under pressure from adoptees, and hundreds have submitted their cases for review.

The AP investigation, done in collaboration with Frontline (PBS), was based on interviews with more than 80 adoptees in the U.S., Australia and six European countries, along with parents, agency employees, humanitarian workers and government officials. It also drew on more than 100 information requests and thousands of pages of documents -- including many never publicly seen before and some the AP got declassified -- from courts, archives, government files and adoption papers.

In dozens of cases AP examined with Frontline, it found: Children were kidnapped off the streets and sent abroad. Parents claim they were told their newborns were dead or too sick to survive, only to have them shipped away. Documents were fabricated to give children identities that belonged to somebody else, leading adoptees to anguished reunions with supposed parents -- to later discover they were not related at all.

The agencies and governments each played a part in keeping the baby pipeline pumping. Adoption agencies created a competitive market for children and paid hospitals to supply them, documents show. The South Korean government not only knew of fraudulent practices but designed laws to speed up the exportation of children it deemed undesirable. Western governments turned a blind eye, sometimes even pressuring South Korea for children, while promoting the narrative that they were saving orphans with no other options.

Calabretta doesn't believe he was saved; he believes he was stolen. And many in his network of adult adoptees believe they were, too.

Advocates say the vast majority of adoptions are honest and end well. But it is impossible to know how many adoptions are fraudulent because unreliable documents prevent adoptees from finding their birth families and learning the truth. Government data obtained by AP shows less than a fifth of 15,000 adoptees like Calabretta, who have asked South Korea for help with family searches since 2012, have managed to reunite with relatives.

In 2019, a Korean government agency told Calabretta they had found his father. He pictured himself as a rock on a beach, with two waves crashing over it. The first was joy -- he had been loved. The other was fury that something profound had been taken from him.

""You're constantly in flux between two worlds,"" he said, ""the one you could have and should have been in, and the one where you are.""

Adoptions from South Korea peaked in the 1980s, fueled by the government, just as Calabretta's parents arrived at the hospital with a blanket in which to carry their firstborn son home.

The adoption industry had grown out of the wreckage of the Korean War in the 1950s, when Americans took in the unwanted biracial children born of Korean women and Western soldiers. As it clawed its way out of post-war poverty, South Korea continued to rely on private adoption agencies as its social safety net, bringing millions of dollars into the economy and saving even more by never building its own child welfare program.

Meanwhile, in the West, the number of adoptable babies plummeted because of access to birth control and abortion. The desires of two cultures collided: couples in wealthy nations desperately wanted babies, and South Korea desperately wanted to rid itself of mouths to feed.

As the supply of biracial babies dwindled, South Korea turned to those it saw as unwelcome citizens: fully-Korean children of poor families and unwed mothers.

Korean officials fit their laws to match American ones to make children adoptable for what some deride as ""baby diplomacy"" to satisfy Western demand. The government endorsed ""proxy adoptions,"" for families to adopt children quickly without ever visiting Korea, meeting them by the planeloads at American airports.

In an internal memo from 1966 obtained by AP, International Social Service, a Geneva-based organization, wrote that it suspected the Korean government assessed agencies not by child welfare standards, but by the money they brought in.

""There is quite a bit of rivalry and competition among the different agencies, and it is not beyond agencies to bribe or pressure mothers for the release of these children, and not beyond agencies to try to compete with each other for the same child,"" officials noted in the document, now at the agency's archives at the University of Minnesota Libraries.

In 1976, Patricia Nye, east Asia director for ISS, concluded in a memo that the South Korean government was ""entirely irresponsible."" What was happening, she wrote, was ""close to being scandalous, the mass exportation of children, Korea has been called a baby factory.""

Nye, who has died, said publicly on a BBC program called ""A Traffic in Babies,"" that Korean adoptions had ""gone out of control.""

""We are not talking about little pets or pieces of wood,"" Nye said into the camera. ""It's almost like a trade in children ... Asian children flowing from Asia to Europe and North America.""

The Korean government tried to downplay the concerns. Documents reveal an official insisted the show -- which described the country's adoption program as ""baby wholesaling"" -- actually depicted it as ""organized and well-managed.""

In December 1976, the government facilitated a new law that widened the legal definition of adoptable children, removed judicial oversight and granted vast powers to the heads of private agencies.

The government empowered four agencies to handle most adoptions: Holt Children's Services, which had pioneered sending Korean children to the U.S., and three others, Eastern Social Welfare Society, Korea Welfare Services and Korea Social Service. A 1983 Health Ministry audit cited all four agencies and accused Holt of providing larger-than-allowed payments to impoverished birth mothers. The ministry's response was to issue a ""warning.""

Records show that officials were aware of a laundry list of dubious practices in the industry: lost children were documented as abandoned; the origins of alleged orphans weren't verified; some were ""disguised"" by agencies as being born from unwed mothers to make them adoptable, according to Health Ministry records seen by AP. In the early 1980s, the government itself likened the agencies' child-hunting practices to ""trafficking."" At a meeting in 1982, documents show, the ministry admitted to child ""intake"" problems and cautioned agencies to improve their practices to avoid the appearance of ""trafficking, profiteering."" Yet the government still called for ""as many adoptions as possible.""

Calabretta was taken from the Red Cross Hospital in Daegu in 1986. His father, Lee Sung-soo, said an administrator told him his son had serious lung and heart problems. The family didn't have a lot of money. The only option, the administrator said, was a high-risk and very expensive surgery that could leave the baby dead or severely disabled.

She advised Lee to relinquish his son to Holt, which would pay for the surgery and find a home for a disabled child if he survived.

Lee said he signed the paper, believing it was the only way to save his son, and wept. The AP could not verify Lee's account -- the hospital closed and its records were destroyed. Information obtained through a records request show that 470 children born in that hospital were adopted during the 80s and 90s.

""It felt like the sky was falling,"" Lee said. ""I felt like my heart was being ripped apart.""

By then, agencies were procuring most of their children directly from hospitals and maternity homes, which often received illegal payments for babies, records show. Though the stated intention of adoption was to spare children from orphanages, they gathered more than 4,600 children from hospitals in 1988, 60% of their supply.

""In paying rewards for childbirth delivery costs to hospitals, maternity homes, local administrative offices and others when acquiring children for adoption,"" the Health Ministry wrote in 1988, ""the social welfare institutions (agencies) have lost their morality and have descended to become trafficking institutions.""

A government audit the following year shows that Holt made nearly 100 illegal payments to hospitals during six months in 1988, worth about $16,000 now. Eastern Social Welfare Society gave even more, now worth about $64,000, to hospitals over that period.

The South Korean government declined to answer questions about its responsibility for the past, saying it will let the fact-finding commission finish its work. In a statement, the Health Ministry acknowledged that skyrocketing adoptions in the 1970s-80s were possibly driven by an intent to reduce welfare spending to balance cuts in foreign aid.

Lee Moo-ja, a retired local official in Boryeong city, recalled a sense of helplessness during the 1980s. Abandoned children were supposed to be reported to city officials, who would assign them to an orphanage, she said. But instead, agencies were directly scooping them up, and the pleading letters she sent to hospitals went nowhere.

The national government wasn't interested in enforcement, she said, leaving local officials like her powerless to stop it.

Calabretta's parents felt powerless too; they got onto an elevator with other couples holding their newborn children. All they had was the empty blanket.

With the government on their side, agencies raced against time for children.

Employees were told to process them as quickly as they could, said two former adoption workers who spoke anonymously because Korean law forbids them from publicizing confidential information.

""All I heard was work faster, faster,"" said one, employed at an agency from 1979 to 1984. ""Do it faster and faster.""

Even now, the woman clenches her hands and clutches a pillow as she said she convinced herself they were saving orphans. She couldn't help but quietly wonder: ""Is this really all for children?""

Agencies had intake workers scour every region of the country for children, she said. They invested ""zero effort"" in confirming a child was truly orphaned.

She questioned whether dubious practices were baked into the system, from beginning to end. A colleague once brought in a girl allegedly abandoned in Daegu, about 145 miles away from Seoul. She refused to process the girl for adoption because she thought it was too soon to conclude she was abandoned. Not long after, the Daegu worker sent the same girl again, with the same photo -- but a new name and background story that claimed she'd been abandoned earlier.

The former worker said she never learned whether the girl was adopted.

Some lost children ended up overseas.

Laurie Bender was approached by a strange woman while playing in the front yard in South Korea in 1975. She remembers the woman saying that Bender's family didn't want her anymore because her mother had another baby. She went with the woman, and felt so sad she thought she might die.

Bender says she was 4, but Korea calculates birthdays differently and her records say she was 6.

Every day, her mother, Han Tae-soon, went to police stations, government offices, adoption agencies. Every night, she slept with a picture of her missing daughter.

That picture was displayed everywhere -- in subway stations, on lamp posts, on bags of snacks that advertised missing children, the Korean version of American milk cartons. But Bender was on the other side of the globe -- sent by Holt to an American family who believed she was an orphan.

The U.S. took in the highest number of orphans by far, and to be eligible for a visa, they had to have lost one or both parents to death, disappearance or abandonment. The agencies seized on the word abandonment, applying it to most of the children they acquired.

Records from 1980 to 1987 show that more than 90% of the Korean children sent to the West almost certainly had known relatives, said Philsik Shin, a scholar at Korea's Anyang University. The number of children sent for adoption was often more than 10 times higher than the police count for abandoned children, he found -- close to 9,000 in 1985.

Listing children as abandoned made adoptions easier because agencies didn't have to verify child origins or obtain parental relinquishment. It was ""almost customary"" to document children as abandoned, said Helen Noh, who matched hundreds of children with U.S. parents at Holt Children's Services from 1981 to 1982.

Now a scholar at Seoul's Soongsil University, Noh said Holt workers understood the agency was charging adopters about $3,000 per child.

""My salary was 240,000 won, which is like less than $200 a month,"" Noh said. ""If you send one child ... that amount could pay at least one worker for the whole year.""

Documents obtained by AP show that agencies were likely charging even more, around $4,000 to $6,000. But they pocketed some of that money through improper means, such as charging for travel expenses for adoption workers but arranging for commercial passengers to carry babies instead.

Workers tried to meet specific requests from adoptive families. Some asked for siblings, Noh said, so she and her colleagues would compete over the small number of twins in their networks.

Another former worker, employed at two agencies from the 1970s to early 1990s, said anybody facing challenges in raising their children would be strongly encouraged to give them away.

""Many of the children we gathered would have stayed with their biological parents with a little help,"" the former worker said. ""But what we heard (from management) was always the same - if we don't take that child, another adoption agency will.""

Private counseling records in a 1988 Holt document obtained by AP show that some parents who relinquished their children soon pleaded for them back. The agency's workers told them that their children would thrive under good Western parents and may return home someday rich or ""with Ph.Ds.""

In one case, a mother returned and asked to see her son. The boy was still in Seoul, but a Holt worker told the mother he'd been flown to the U.S.

""After being told the lie,"" the worker wrote, ""the birth mother began to regain her peace of mind as expected.""

Susan Soonkeum Cox, who long worked for Holt International, the Oregon-based U.S. arm of the Holt adoption network, denied widespread problems. She said the goal was always to find good homes for children who would have otherwise grown up in orphanages.

""Has there been some activity that shouldn't have happened? Probably. We're human and everybody is different. There's good social workers, there's bad social workers, there's good employees, bad employees,"" she said. ""But...the accusation of systemic, deliberate wrongdoing, that I reject.""

The Seoul-based Holt Children's Services, which split from the American agency in the 1970s, and the three other Korean agencies declined to comment on specific cases.

Holt Korea has in recent years denied accusations of wrongdoing and attributed adoptee complaints to misunderstandings and Korea's social welfare issues. Kim Jin Sook, president of Eastern, has said the agency carried out government policies to find homes for ""discarded children.""

But some other agencies on the ground started closing their programs because of ethical concerns.

In the 1970s, Francis Carlin ran South Korea's Catholic Relief Services, which facilitated about 30 adoptions a month, compared to hundreds by the larger agencies. The demand from the West was intense, and there weren't enough legitimate orphans to feed it, he said, leading to ""a lot of the compromises, a lot of the hanky panky.""

The larger agencies toured orphanages, grabbing up healthy babies and leaving older and disabled children, he said.

""These, I would call them brokers, were going out and trying to get more and more children,"" Carlin said when reached by AP. ""They would put the legitimate parent on a guilt trip and say, what are you doing? You can't afford to take care of this child.... Why don't you just step back and let them have a better life? You're so selfish.""

One Korean social worker expressed disgust in words so crushing they stuck with Carlin all these years: ""It's sickening, just sickening.""

Catholic Relief Services ceased its adoption program in 1974. Carlin remembers standing up at a meeting of humanitarian organizations: ""We are beginning to slide into the abyss,"" he said.

Four decades later, Laurie Bender took a DNA test because her own daughter was curious about their heritage. In 2019, she got a call: ""Your mother has been looking for you.""

Bender dropped the phone.

""It's like a hole in your heart has been healed, you finally feel like a complete person,"" Bender said. ""It's like you've been living a fake life and everything you know is not true.""

Bender and her daughter flew to South Korea just weeks later. Her mother, Han Tae-soon, wore her best outfit and lipstick for the first time in a long time. She recognized her daughter immediately in the airport and ran to her, screaming, moaning, running her fingers through her hair.

Han, who is in her 70s, has notebooks feverishly annotated with English translations, written during countless hours trying to learn her daughter's language. Amid the photos of her children on her living room wall is a black-and-white one of Bender as a little girl, stuck in time.

Han plans to sue the South Korean government and Holt for robbing them of ever having a real relationship.

""I feel like I am dying. I really am dying,"" she said. ""There's so little time for me.""

She jabbed her finger at paperwork that sent her daughter away.

""Isn't this a government seal?"" she demanded. ""Why did you make this up and sell away other people's children?""

This story is part of an ongoing investigation led by The Associated Press in collaboration with FRONTLINE (PBS). The investigation includes an interactive and the upcoming documentary South Korea's Adoption Reckoning, premiering Sept. 20 on PBS & online.

-- -

This system turned children into people with no history, no parents, no ties.

Many adoptees will never know the basic facts of their lives -- their birthdays, their birth parents, if they were wanted or truly abandoned -- because their documents are false.

Robyn Joy Park, adopted to the United States, cherished her documents so much that she tattooed her adoption number -- 82C-1320 -- on her back. It was her only tether to her motherland.

Those documents said she was a girl named Park Joo Young, born in Busan in August 1982, and her unmarried mother couldn't afford to keep her. In 2007, Park traveled to Korea to meet the woman that her adoption agency, Eastern, listed as her mother.

Their bond deepened slowly over years. They visited relatives, held hands, shared hotel rooms -- the mother spoonfed her rice. The woman's son changed his name to Park Joon Young, to share the ""Young"" syllable in line with Korean naming traditions for siblings.

Five years passed. Park asked the woman to take a DNA test in the hope of finding her father.

They were not related. She was not Park Joo Young -- she was another, unknown, girl.

""I really was so hurt and stunned and devastated and incredibly angry,"" Park said. ""I could only imagine what it was like for her.""

She lost touch with the woman, although she remains in contact with the man she considered her brother. Her agency offered her nothing but an apology, and declined to comment when reached by AP.

Her story is not uncommon. When children processed for adoption died, became too sick to travel or were found by their biological families, agencies often replaced them with other children instead of redoing the process from scratch, according to former adoption workers. At a meeting with an adoptee in 2021 where AP was present, a longtime worker said Western partner agencies were willing to take ""any child of the same sex and similar age, because it would take too much time to start over again.""

The AP has spoken to 10 others who found that their identity was switched with someone else.

One of them, Mia Sang J√∏rn√∏, raised in Denmark, developed a close relationship with the family of the man listed as her father by her agency, Korea Social Service. She attended his funeral in 2000, even joining relatives as they received guests through the traditional three-day mourning procession.

He had given her the name of her mother, and she worked up the courage to contact her. They took a DNA test.

They weren't related.

The agency told her that her paperwork was mistaken, and she wasn't even the girl named on her documents, Park Sang Ok. She was Kim Eun-hye. She had mourned a father who wasn't hers.

""I always have this kind of restlessness, she said, ""of just not knowing that part of me, my identity.""

KSS did not respond to questions. In letters seen by AP and Frontline, the agency has admitted to adoptees that the stories on their paperwork were invented to get the adoptions through.

""I would like to apologize for the wrong information in your adoption paper,"" a KSS worker wrote to a Danish adoptee in 2016. ""It was made up just for adoption procedure."" The worker could not be reached by AP.

In 2022, the agency emailed another adoptee that their ""real background is different"" than listed, apologizing that the discrepancy might ""confuse"" them.

Neither Park nor J√∏rn√∏ ever found their real parents. They both think often of the girls whose identities they were given, and wonder: What happened to her?

The Korean government cracked down on the adoption industry when the 1988 Olympics brought attention to the baby trade as a national shame.

The Health Ministry instructed agencies to ""improve"" their practices and stop ""touring"" hospitals and orphanages to gather children, according to a document obtained by AP. They were told they could be punished if they continued to ""competitively engage in unlawful practices.""

Adoptions plummeted, from around 8,000 a year in the mid-1980s to around 2,000 a year in the 1990s. But tens of thousands of children were already overseas, including Calabretta.

Hospital officials told Calabretta's mother to assume he had died. She went to a temple three times to offer a Buddhist ceremony to bless the soul of the dead.

The documents that went with him to the U.S. in 1986 described him as a ""normal healthy baby, adoptable,"" born to an unwed mother, and made no mention of a surgery.

Calabretta returned to South Korea in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. His father, Lee Sung-soo, could not wait out the two-week quarantine and showed up outside the apartment the next day.

""We were supposed to be a happy family, not separated. He was my precious firstborn son,"" Lee said. ""For over 30 years, he lived in a foreign land against his will. That makes my heart break.""

Calabretta visits South Korea often, and they talk on the phone every few days. He has the same odd divot in his ear as his mother, the same laugh as his father, the same taste in shoes and jackets and music, the same allergies.

All those years, Calabretta's mother kept the blanket she'd carried empty out of the hospital, a symbol of the absence where her son should be.

He asked her to rename him, to reclaim him, as her son and a son of Korea. In Korea, there is a sentiment that something isn't truly yours until you name it, and once you do, you must take care of it.

So he prefers his new name now: Hanil Lee.

AP reporter Lori Hinnant and researcher Rhonda Shafner and Frontline's Lora Moftah and Emily Sternlicht contributed to this report.

Robert Calabretta blames not just South Korea but also the United States for taking him away from his parents and adopting him out to an American family.

""What higher trophy is it of domination than taking one's children and carting them off?"" he asked. ""The audacity of that. And it's all tied in a bow of, 'you must feel so lucky that you're adopted.'""

Western governments turned a blind eye to rampant fraud and pressured the South Korean government to keep the kids coming, an Associated Press investigation has found."

The Republican presidential nominee and former president is heading to Uniondale, on Long Island, an area that could be key to his party maintaining control of the House. His party is trying to protect 18 Republicans in Democratic-heavy congressional districts Joe Biden carried in 2020.

Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to speak at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's 47th Annual Leadership Conference in Washington and has trips planned later in the week to Michigan and Wisconsin.

A 22-year-old woman who became an abortion rights advocate after she was raped by her stepfather as a child tells her story in a new campaign ad for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.

Hadley Duvall says in voiceover that she's never slept a full night in her life -- her stepfather first started abusing her when she was five years old, and impregnated her when she was 12. As she speaks, images of Duvall as a child flash on the screen. The soundtrack of the ad is a song by Billie Eilish, who endorsed the vice president Tuesday.

""I just remember thinking I have to get out of my skin. I can't be me right now. Like, this can't be it,"" Duvall says. ""I didn't know what to do. I was a child. I didn't know what it meant to be pregnant, at all. But I had options.""

The ad is part of a continued push by the Harris campaign to highlight the growing consequences of the fall of Roe, including that some states have abortion restrictions with no exceptions for rape or incest. Women in some states are suffering increasingly perilous medical care and the first reported instance of a woman dying from delayed reproductive care surfaced this week.

Voters in northern New Jersey are set to settle a special U.S. House election to fill the seat that opened when Rep. Donald Payne Jr. died earlier this year.

Democratic Newark City Council President LaMonica McIver and Republican Carmen Bucco are competing for the seat in the heavily Democratic and majority-Black 10th Congressional District. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy set the special election under state law after Payne died in April. He had served on the House for more than two decades.

Wednesday's election determines who serves out the remainder of Payne's term, which ends Jan. 3, 2025. The regular election process held in parallel will determine who fills the seat after that. McIver and Bucco are also on the ballot for the full term in the seat, along with third-party candidates."

Women in some states are suffering increasingly perilous medical care and the first reported instance of a woman dying from delayed reproductive care surfaced this week. Harris lays the blame squarely on Republican nominee Donald Trump, who appointed three of the conservatives to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped overturn the constitutional right to abortion.

Duvall blames Trump, too.

""Because Donald Trump overturned Roe v. Wade, girls and women all over the country have lost the right to choose, even for rape or incest,"" she says in the ad. ""Donald Trump did this. He took away our freedom.""

During the presidential debate on Sept. 10, Trump repeatedly took credit for appointing the three Supreme Court justices and leaned heavily on his catchall response to questions on abortion rights, saying the issue should be left up to the states. He said he would not sign a national abortion ban.

""I'm not signing a ban,"" he said, adding that ""there is no reason to sign the ban.""

But he also repeatedly declined to say whether he would veto such a ban if he were elected again -- a question that has lingered as the Republican nominee has shifted his stances on the crucial election issue.

Duvall of Owensboro, Kentucky, first told her story publicly last fall in a campaign ad for the governor's race in her home state supporting Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear. Duvall's stepfather was convicted of rape and is in prison; she miscarried.

Beshear won reelection, and Democrats have said Duvall's ad was a strong motivator, particularly for rural, male voters who had previously voted for Trump.

Duvall is also touring the country to campaign for Harris along with other women who have been telling their personal stories since the fall of Roe, joining Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro last week."
VP says woman's death after delayed abortion treatment shows consequences of Trump's actions,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-abortion-death-trump-georgia-f9c65fb7019938f0fff18e61d4f2d84a,2024-09-17T17:18:53Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris said Tuesday that the death of a young Georgia mother who died after waiting 20 hours for a hospital to treat her complications from an abortion pill shows the consequences of Donald Trump's actions.

Amber Thurman's death, first reported Monday by ProPublica, occurred just two weeks after Georgia's strict abortion ban was enacted in 2022 following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn nationwide abortion rights. Trump appointed three of the justices who made that decision and has repeatedly said he believes states should decide abortion laws.

""This young mother should be alive, raising her son, and pursuing her dream of attending nursing school,"" Harris said in a statement. ""Women are bleeding out in parking lots, turned away from emergency rooms, losing their ability to ever have children again. Survivors of rape and incest are being told they cannot make decisions about what happens next to their bodies. And now women are dying. These are the consequences of Donald Trump's actions.""

Harris is likely to continue highlighting Thurman's case as Democrats try to use the issue of abortion access to motivate women voters.

The federal government has determined that dozens of pregnant women have been illegally turned away from emergency rooms, and the number of cases spiked in abortion ban states like Texas and Missouri, following the Supreme Court's ruling. An Associated Press report found that women have been left to miscarry in public bathrooms, wait for treatment in their cars or told by doctors to seek care elsewhere. Women have developed infections or lost part of their reproductive system after hospitals in abortion ban states delayed emergency abortions.

Thurman's death is the first publicly reported instance of a woman dying from delayed care.

The Trump campaign said on Tuesday that fault rests with the hospital for failing to provide life-saving treatment.

""President Trump has always supported exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother, which Georgia's law provides,"" Trump's press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an emailed statement. ""With those exceptions in place, it's unclear why doctors did not swiftly act to protect Amber Thurman's life.""

Thurman's case is under review with the state's maternal mortality commission. The suburban Atlanta hospital that reportedly delayed her treatment has not been cited by the federal government for failing to provide stabilizing treatment to a pregnant patient anytime within the last two years, an AP review of federal documents found.

Thurman sought help at the hospital for complications from taking an abortion pill two weeks after Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed a law that mostly outlaws abortion and criminalized performing one. Even as Thurman developed sepsis, ProPublica reported, doctors at the hospital did not evacuate the remaining fetal tissue in her uterus with a procedure called a dilation and curettage, or D&C. She died on the operating table, shortly after asking her mother to take care of her 6-year-old son. ProPublica said it will release another report on an abortion-related death in the coming days.

Democrats and abortion rights advocates seized on the report, saying that it proves women's health is suffering from draconian abortion bans, a point that anti-abortion advocates have rebuffed and discounted as misinformation.

""We actually have the substantiated proof of something we already knew: that abortion bans can kill people,"" Mini Timmaraju, president for Reproductive Freedom for All, said Monday.

Senate to vote again on IVF protections in election-year push,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/senate-ivf-vote-trump-harris-1bb3d09855a23802045fe7e6a5696561,2024-09-17T04:14:20Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate will vote for the second time this year on legislation that would establish a nationwide right to in vitro fertilization -- Democrats' latest election-year attempt to force Republicans into a defensive stance on women's health issues.

The bill, which the Senate will vote on Tuesday, has little chance of passing this Congress, as Republicans already blocked the same bill earlier this year. But Democrats are hoping to use the do-over vote to put pressure on Republican congressional candidates and lay out a contrast between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in the presidential race, especially as Trump has called himself a "" leader on IVF.""

The push started earlier this year after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Several clinics in the state suspended IVF treatments until the GOP-led legislature rushed to enact a law to provide legal protections for the clinics.

Democrats quickly capitalized, holding a vote in June on the bill from Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth and warning that the U.S. Supreme Court could go after the procedure next after it overturned the right to an abortion in 2022. The legislation would also increase access to the procedure and lower costs.

""The hard right has set its sights on a new target,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the floor Monday.

All but two Republicans voted against the Democratic legislation, arguing that the federal government shouldn't tell states what to do. They said the bill was an unserious effort.

Still, Republicans have scrambled to counter Democrats on the issue, with many making clear that they support IVF treatments. Trump last month announced plans, without additional details, to require health insurance companies or the federal government to pay for the common fertility treatment.

In his debate with Harris earlier this month, Trump said he was a ""leader"" on the issue and talked about the ""very negative"" decision by the Alabama court that was later reversed by the legislature.

But the issue has threatened to become a vulnerability for Republicans as some state laws passed by their own party grant legal personhood not only to fetuses but to any embryos that are destroyed in the IVF process.

Duckworth, a military veteran who has used the fertility treatment to have her two children, has led the Senate effort on the legislation. ""How dare you,'"" she said in comments directed toward her GOP colleagues after the first vote blocking the bill.

Republicans have tried to push alternatives on the issue, including legislation that would discourage states from enacting explicit bans on the treatment, but those bills have been blocked by Democrats who say it is not enough.

Republican Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama and Ted Cruz of Texas tried in June to pass a bill that would threaten to withhold Medicaid funding for states where IVF is banned. Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, said in a floor speech then that his daughter was currently receiving IVF treatment and proposed to expand the flexibility of health savings accounts.

Cruz, who is running for reelection in Texas, said it showed Democrats' efforts to pass legislation were a ""cynical political decision."""
Vance and Georgia Gov. Kemp project Republican unity at evangelical event after Trump tensions,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/vance-kemp-faith-freedom-c808cd8c56b63cba44fe0e0349d432e3,2024-09-17T01:06:19Z,"ATLANTA (AP) -- A leading conservative Christian group put on a show of Republican unity Monday, cementing the new d√©tente between Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and GOP nominee Donald Trump while vice presidential nominee JD Vance tried to smooth over differences on abortion policy across the evangelical community ahead of Election Day.

The Faith & Freedom Coalition, led by longtime evangelical political powerhouse Ralph Reed, brought Vance and Kemp to the same stage with a shared focus: advocating for Trump, criticizing Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and ignoring several years of tension stemming from Trump's attacks on Kemp for his refusal to help overturn Trump's 2020 defeat. Trump's efforts to undo the election results led to criminal charges against him in the state.

""We have to expand our majority in Congress, take back control of the U.S. Senate and send Donald Trump back to the White House,"" Kemp told a full ballroom of evangelical political activists and donors.

Vance, for his part, praised Kemp as ""incredible, patriotic and very effective,"" and added praise for Kemp's wife, Marty -- a far cry from Trump's using social media posts and an Atlanta rally in August to accuse the governor of ""fighting Unity and the Republican Party"" and criticizing Georgia's first lady for saying she planned to write in her husband's name on her presidential ballot.

Kemp and Vance also met backstage during the event.

The Faith & Freedom dinner follows another private meeting between Vance and Kemp that was brokered recently by South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and aimed at ending public hostilities. Republicans have feared the discord will help Harris keep Georgia in the Democratic column four years after Biden won the state by a mere 11,779 votes out of 5 million cast.

Reed, who became a national Republican player decades ago from his home base in Georgia, said the scene Monday demonstrates a GOP front that is intent on victory.

""We've moved on. He's moved on,"" Reed said of Trump and his false claims that the 2020 election was rigged. In fact, Trump still repeats those claims regularly, though the former president over the past month has stopped including Kemp in his list of figures he holds responsible for his defeat.

In addition to praising Kemp, Vance sought Monday to remind his audience of Trump's role in the Supreme Court's 2022 decision that ended the constitutional right to an abortion, a goal of the conservative evangelical movement for nearly a half-century.

""We are united in our gratitude and our admiration for these devoted defenders of the unborn and for the judges, justices, and especially President Trump, who is committed to defending the law and the Constitution allowed this breakthrough after over 50 years,"" Vance said, celebrating that abortion regulation is now back in control of state governments.

The Ohio senator did not mention any dissension over abortion among conservatives who still want a national ban on abortion access. Trump does not explicitly support a national ban and saw to it that the 2024 Republican platform would not include such a proposal for the first time in decades. Trump has argued that conservatives should concentrate their energies on state governments and not make a national ban a central part of the presidential election.

A solid majority of Americans oppose a federal abortion ban, according to a June 2024 poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Vance promised a second Trump administration would pursue policies that help would-be mothers and new mothers, such as investments in job training, education and child care.

""The Republican Party is proud to be a pro-life and a pro-family party,"" Vance said. ""We believe that human life is precious and every life is worthy of protection, because we believe that every child, born and unborn, is created in the image of God.""

For his part, Reed told The Associated Press in an interview that he sees no evidence that Trump's position will cost him support among self-identified evangelical voters. And Reed said the Republican platform still contains language that would effectively extend the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause to fetuses, effectively legally recognizing them as persons entitled to due process protections.

That, Reed argued, ""gives them the full force of the federal government to protect their life and their liberty, and that's all we needed."" So, he continued, Trump's 2024 platform actually gives conservatives a roadmap to outlaw abortion through constitutional law established by some future U.S. Supreme Court ruling based on the 14th Amendment, rather than through congressional action or a constitutional amendment that Reed said would never be adopted."
The next generation of Buffetts is poised to become one of the biggest forces in philanthropy,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/warren-buffett-children-gates-foundation-9110be0c729864105e22f4bf93dfb2e5,2024-09-16T14:21:28Z,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- The next generation of Buffetts -- Howard, Susie and Peter -- is poised to become one of the most powerful forces in philanthropy when their 94-year-old father, the legendary businessman and leader of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett, eventually passes away.

But it wasn't always going to be that way.

Buffett announced in June that he would donate his fortune, now valued at nearly $144 billion, to a charitable trust managed by his three children when he dies, instead of giving it to the Gates Foundation, as he indicated 18 years ago.

The next generation of Buffetts will then have 10 years to give the money away, Warren Buffett said.

In the meantime, the elder Buffett continues to make huge annual donations to the Gates Foundation and his four family foundations, which will continue throughout his lifetime. He first mentioned plans for a new charitable trust in November.

Howard Buffett told The Associated Press he's learned what his father told him and his siblings about philanthropy was true: ""It's not so easy to give away money if you want to do it smart, if you want to be intelligent about it.""

The middle Buffett child, Howard said his father is as sharp as ever and that he hopes he lives a long time, adding: ""It's pretty amazing that he's giving us this opportunity.""

Buffett has entrusted Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates with significant annual gifts to their foundation since 2006 -- a remarkable $43 billion to date .

""Wealthy people don't tend to give their money to other people to give away,"" said James Ferris, founding director of The Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy at the University of Southern California. But many of the wealthiest people are also hesitant to hand over their fortunes to the next generation over concerns that it hampers their ingenuity, he said.

Ferris thinks the story of Buffett's changing philanthropic intentions is a positive one. ""It shows how a donor is making choices and is adapting to circumstances,"" he said.

The Gates Foundation did not say when it learned of Buffett's decision or what the impact will be on its budget. It previously said in a statement that ""Warren Buffett has been exceedingly generous,"" and that he has ""played an invaluable role in championing and shaping the foundation's work to create a world where every person can live a healthy, productive life.""

Over the years, Buffett gave the Gates Foundation large annual donations, but also donated billions to foundations run by his three children and a fourth family foundation. Their work offers some insight into the priorities of the next generation of Buffetts.

The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named after Warren Buffett's first wife, is the largest in terms of donations. It supports organizations that provide reproductive health care and access to contraception and abortion around the world. Susie Buffett, 71, is its board chair and Peter Buffett, 66, is a board member.

Susie Buffett also leads The Sherwood Foundation, a major supporter of early childhood development nationally that gives grants to organizations and projects within Omaha, Nebraska, the Buffetts' hometown.

Peter Buffett's NoVo Foundation has been an important funder of organizations advocating for the autonomy of girls and women and against gender-based violence. In 2020, Peter and his wife, Jennifer, decided to reorient their focus, expanding their support for Native American communities and projects to build sustainable, local communities with a focus on agriculture and food access.

The Howard G. Buffett Foundation has focused on conflict mitigation and agriculture around the world. Since 2022, it has donated some $800 million -- more than most countries -- to humanitarian initiatives in Ukraine during the country's war with Russia. These include supporting food distribution at schools, demining activities, and the rebuilding of a major publishing company and a key bridge transporting grain.

In a relatively rare interview for a family that seldom makes time to speak with the media, Howard Buffett, 69, said he couldn't predict exactly how he and his siblings would give away their father's fortune. However, he said they would continue to take risks and find ways to make the biggest difference as their father recommended.

""I can tell you, we'll sit down in a room when the time comes, and we'll get it figured out pretty quickly,"" he said, acknowledging that the directive to donate all the money within 10 years was a challenge.

The siblings' different ways of thinking and approaches to giving are assets, he said.

""What this is going to do is we're going to bring all of our collective experience together,"" he said.

But don't expect to find the family name on a lot of buildings, which the siblings have largely avoid even as they've given away more than $15 billion of their father's money since 2006.

Kathleen Enright, president and CEO of the Council on Foundations, said the Buffetts have effectively made philanthropy a family business, with the next generation now seasoned donors who have built enduring institutions in their foundations.

""It is a big deal,"" she said, of the amount of money that the Buffetts are poised to give away, noting that because the fortune will likely continue to grow, they will have to give away highly visible sums to spend it down.

The tight timeframe to give away his fortune after his death reflects one of Warren Buffett's longstanding conditions for receiving charitable funding. He has instructed the Gates Foundation and his family's foundations to grant out the full amount they received within a year.

The next generation of Buffetts have run their foundations with tiny staffs -- much like how Warren Buffett oversees his massive Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate with only about two dozen people at its headquarters in Omaha.

Howard Buffett said his foundation employs less than 10 staff members. It granted $458.1 million in 2023, according to tax documents. He acknowledged that his ""lean"" staff puts some limits on their capacity, but said the way they've scaled their work is through creating strong and enduring relationships with other organizations to help implement their ideas.

In contrast, the Gates Foundation has one of the largest endowments at $75.2 billion, funded by donations from Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. It employs more than 2,000 people, many of them technical experts all over the world, and is known for making highly directed grants with rigorous reporting requirements. The foundation has said it will wind down its operations within 25 years after its founders' deaths.

Howard Buffett said he likes a challenge and thinks that in general, wealthy people should give their money away within their lifetimes, rather than holding it in perpetual foundations.

""Somebody is going to spend that money. Somebody is going to give that money away,"" he said. ""So, I would rather do that with my brother and sister and do it together, as a partnership, than see it done any other way.""

Giving away a fortune: What could Warren Buffett's adult children support?,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/warren-buffett-peter-susie-howard-philanthropy-fd195032b2253e2f791fc3e40df5c771,2024-09-16T14:16:48Z,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Warren Buffett's adult children -- Susie, Howard and Peter Buffett -- have long track records as philanthropists, giving away more than $15 billion of their dad's money through their foundations since 2006.

But because they don't habitually seek publicity about their donations, they've flown under the radar as a force within philanthropy.

Now that their father has entrusted them to donate the rest of his fortune following his death, the next generation of Buffetts is poised to become one of the largest donors in the country, tasked with giving away around $144 billion, by today's estimates, within 10 years.

The next generation of Buffetts have supported different causes over the years, but their foundations share some characteristics. They operate with small staffs and when they have spoken publicly about their giving, they talk about taking risks to confront hard problems or fund ventures others might not.

The work of the family's foundations may offer some insight into what they might support and how they might operate when the time comes to give away their fortune.

Named after Warren Buffett's first wife, it has donated $8.4 billion mainly to reproductive health care organizations, according to the charitable grants database Candid. It also funds access to abortion and contraception, granting hundreds of millions over the years to Planned Parenthood affiliates, the National Abortion Federation, and Population Services International, which works outside the U.S.

The foundation has faced criticism from some in the field of reproductive justice who say funding anonymously without a public grant application process perpetuates inequities. Essentially, those who have connections get funded and those who don't, do not. The foundation did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment.

Susie Buffett's ex-husband, Allen Greenberg, is the foundation's president, Susie Buffett is the board chair and Peter Buffett is a member of the board, according to its most recent tax filings.

Susie Buffett's foundation has been a stalwart funder for early childhood education within the U.S.

The foundation's largest grantee is the nonprofit Buffett Early Childhood Fund, of which Susie Buffett is board chair. It has granted hundreds of millions of dollars for research, advocacy, training and support for child care providers.

In 2005, the fund helped found the Alliance for Early Success, which supports state-level advocacy for early childhood education programs. Since then, it's provided ""no strings attached"" funding without any annual application or report, said Helene Stebbins, its executive director.

""You talk about trust-based philanthropy -- and there's a lot of work being done to encourage philanthropy to go in that direction right now -- Susie and the Buffett Early Childhood Fund have been doing it for 20 years,"" Stebbins said.

The lion's share of Howard Buffett's grantmaking supports food security and conflict mitigation internationally.

His foundation has supported coffee and cacao farmers in El Salvador and the Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

A major partner is Catholic Relief Services, which it has funded for at least 15 years to support farmers in Central America.

""Howard was particularly interested in addressing the factors that were driving people to leave rural communities in Central America and Mexico and risk everything to migrate to the U.S. and that's where our vision really came together,"" said Erica Dahl-Bredine, a senior adviser at CRS.

When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Howard Buffett visited within weeks and reconfigured the foundation's plans to respond to the humanitarian crisis and impact of the war on agriculture.

""Every time I leave Ukraine to return home, I ask myself the same question: If we do not stand with Ukraine as they fight to defend their freedom, then what value do we place on our own freedom?"" he wrote in the foundation's 2023 report.

For many years, Peter Buffett and his wife, Jennifer, focused their grantmaking on supporting girls around the world, including the ""Girl Effect,"" campaign with the Nike Foundation. They also supported the use of social-emotional learning in schools.

In 2020, they made a major change in strategic approach, laying off a significant part of their staff and spinning off or planning to wind down much of their funding supporting girls rights and combating gender-based violence. The decision elicited a strong reaction from groups that felt the foundation had betrayed their trust, though it remains a significant philanthropic supporter of girls, especially Black girls and other girls of color.

""We had to make very difficult decisions around what was creating meaningful change and what was fighting against a system that appeared futile,"" Peter Buffett wrote in an email to the AP. ""We were also always concerned about dependency on a single funder and we're happy to see other funders coming into the field.""

Since 2022, the foundation has increased its support for Native American organizations, which Peter Buffet has been interested in since he composed some of the music for the film ""Dances With Wolves"" and wrote the score for the miniseries ""500 Nations."" His foundation now also funds projects like a community farm, grain mill and radio station near Kingston, New York, where Peter and Jennifer Buffett live, as part of its support for sustainable, local communities.

Days of preparation and one final warning. How Kamala Harris got ready for her big debate moment,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-debate-prep-trump-haitian-migrants-campaign-ad7dde130caf787af1c113a0e74e331e,2024-09-15T12:31:32Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was almost time for the presidential debate, but Kamala Harris' staff thought there was one more thing she needed to know. So less than an hour before the vice president left her Philadelphia hotel, two communications aides got her on the phone for one of the strangest briefings of her political career.

They told her that Donald Trump had been posting on social media about a false and racist rumor that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating people's pets. The former president might mention it during the debate, they said.

The warning, described by two people with knowledge of the conversation, proved spot on.

While answering a question about immigration policy, Trump said migrants in Springfield were ""eating the dogs"" and ""they're eating the cats."" Harris laughed, shook her head and stared at her Republican opponent in amazement. ""Talk about extreme,"" she said, and then moved on.

It was easily the most bizarre moment from last week's debate, spawning an explosion of online memes and parody videos. Now, Harris is trying to use her performance as an ongoing source of momentum, hoping to rekindle the kind of energy that she generated when she replaced President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket.

It is unclear whether the debate will affect the outcome of the Nov. 5 election. In a flash poll of viewers conducted by CNN afterward, opinions of Trump were unchanged and Harris received only a slight bump in the share of people who view her favorably. But her team is making the most of it, turning key points into television advertisements and flooding the internet with clips. No equivalent effort is apparent from Trump's side, despite his repeated insistence that he came out on top.

There almost certainly will not be another debate; Trump has said he will not do one. That means the debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia may be the only chance that voters will have to see the candidates side by side.

This story is based on interviews with five people close to Harris, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private conversations and reveal new details about how she prepared for and handled the debate. It was her first time meeting Trump in person.

Harris spent five days getting ready at a hotel in downtown Pittsburgh after a breakneck few weeks of campaigning.

Her team recreated the set where she would debate Trump on the night of Sept. 10. It was a far more professional setup than Harris had used eight years earlier as she was running for Senate in California, when campaign staff taped together cardboard boxes to serve as makeshift lecterns.

Two communications aides -- one man, one woman -- stood in for David Muir and Linsey Davis, the ABC News debate moderators.

Philippe Reines, a longtime aide to Hillary Clinton, reprised his role as Trump, which he played when the former secretary of state ran for president. Reines wore a dark suit, a long red tie and orange bronzer to embody Trump.

One challenge would be the microphones.

When Biden was running, his team agreed that the debate microphones should be muted when it was not a candidate's turn to speak. But Harris' staff wanted the microphones hot at all times, which would allow her to jump in and create more opportunities for Trump to make outbursts.

But their campaign could not reach an agreement to change the rules, and the original plan remained in place.

Harris decided to make the most of the split screen format, where each candidate would be on camera at all times. Biden had flubbed the visual test when he debated Trump in June, often looking aimless with his mouth slightly agape. Harris provided silent commentary through her expressiveness -- laughing, raising her eyebrows, bringing her hand to her chin with a quizzical look.

At one point during preparations, staff members suggested practicing mannerisms that Harris could use. The vice president waved them off, saying she would be fine without that kind of rehearsal.

Harris rarely left the hotel during preparations. On Sept. 7, she took a field trip to Penzeys Spices, where she picked up some seasoning mixes. One woman in the store wept as Harris hugged her. On Sept. 8, Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, went to a military airbase and took a walk for about a half hour. Because of security considerations, the tarmac was the only place where they could stretch their legs.

Asked if she was ready for the debate, Harris gave reporters a thumb's up and said ""ready.""

She ended up leaving Pittsburgh on Sept. 9 rather than the day of the debate, canceling an extra mock debate and getting to Philadelphia earlier than expected.

As the clock ticked down to the start of the debate, dozens of staff members in the campaign's Delaware headquarters assembled in assigned seats in front of four television screens. Some were nervous, still rattled from watching Biden implode in his own debate with Trump.

But Harris' opening move, striding toward Trump to shake his hand as they took the stage, helped ease those jitters.

Throughout the debate, Harris mocked and needled Trump, throwing him off balance with jabs about the size of crowds at his campaign rallies. She pounced on questions about abortion and promised the country a new generation of leadership, while Trump became increasingly agitated and missed opportunities to press his case against her.

During the final commercial break, Trump departed the stage with a sigh. Harris stayed at her lectern, writing on her notepad, reviewing her words and taking a sip of water.

In her closing statement, she told viewers that ""I think you've heard tonight two very different visions for our country -- one that is focused on the future and the other that is focused on the past.""

Trump ended his remarks by calling Harris ""the worst vice president in the history of our country.""

There was no live audience in the room to react to the candidates, and it was not always clear whether certain lines or expressions were hitting their marks.

So when Harris left the stage, she had a question for her staff: How did I do?"
Takeaways from AP's report on a new abortion clinic in rural southeast Kansas,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-clinic-kansas-rural-planned-parenthood-e89e31ea5be2d20c361f9412a026a346,2024-09-15T04:15:09Z,"PITTSBURG, Kan. (AP) -- A new abortion clinic has brought the debate over reproductive rights to a small college town in the southeast corner of Kansas. It's one of the few states left in the region still allowing abortions.

A religious, Republican-leaning semi-rural location like Pittsburg, Kansas, would have been unlikely to host an abortion clinic before Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, but that is changing across the country.

The Associated Press reported on the new clinic and the town's reactions. Here are key takeaways.

Over the past two years, Kansas is one of five states that people are most likely to travel to in order to get an abortion if their state doesn't offer the procedure, said Caitlin Myers, an economics professor at Middlebury College who researches abortion policies.

Abortions have spiked by 152% in Kansas after Roe, according to a recent analysis by the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights.

Using Myers' count, six of the clinics in Kansas, Illinois, New Mexico, North Carolina and Virginia that have opened or relocated post-Roe are in communities with fewer than 25,000 people. Two others are in communities of fewer than 50,000.

Five weeks after Roe was overturned, voters in Kansas had to decide whether to strip the right to an abortion from the state constitution, which could have led to an outright ban.

Pittsburg is in Crawford County, where 55% of voters were part of the 59% of voters statewide who killed the proposal. But the rural counties surrounding Pittsburg voted for the amendment.

Kansas' statewide percentage is in line with an Associated Press-NORC poll from 2024 that showed 6 in 10 Americans think their state should generally allow a person to obtain a legal abortion if they don't want to be pregnant for any reason.

Abortion in Kansas is generally legal up until the 22nd week of pregnancy.

The new abortion clinic will be run by Planned Parenthood Great Plains. Its location is a few minutes' drive from the Missouri border and is less than an hour away from Oklahoma.

All of Kansas' other abortion clinics are in larger metro areas, where clinics have expanded hours -- but appointments are still in short supply. About 60% to 65% of people who call Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas for an abortion appointment are turned away because there isn't enough capacity, said Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains.

The bulk of people looking for abortions in Kansas are from out of state -- mostly Texas, which is about five hours south, Wales said. She added that some come from as far away as Louisiana and even Florida, which now prohibits the procedure after six weeks.

Experts said smaller-sized clinics can be less overwhelming for women who are coming from rural areas, like those surrounding Pittsburg. But, often, there is little anonymity in these places where religious and family ties often run deep.

Pittsburg is home to a state university with about 7,400 students. The town is also is increasingly religious, with twice as many white evangelical Protestants as the national average, and the area is increasingly Republican.

Pittsburg State students who The Associated Press talked to are supportive of the clinic, as are many of the Democrats in town.

But churches in Pittsburg are training people on how to protest at the abortion clinic, and Vie Medical Clinic, a crisis pregnancy center, has seen an increase in donations.

How a small town in Kansas found itself at the center of abortion's national moment,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-clinic-kansas-rural-planned-parenthood-d239ee0566d719a44334e58da3b3356e,2024-09-15T04:14:49Z,"PITTSBURG, Kan. (AP) -- The Rev. Anthony Navaratnam stood before his congregation and urged them to pray for the women from surrounding states who will flock to the new abortion clinic in town that opened in August.

""God is giving us an opportunity to be missionaries in Pittsburg, Kansas,"" he told those at Flag Church, which hosted a training on how to protest outside of the clinic.

The debate over reproductive rights has landed in this college town of 20,000 in the southeast corner of one of the few states left in the region still allowing abortions. It is near Missouri, Oklahoma and Arkansas and not terribly far from Texas.

A place this size, especially one in a historically red state, was unlikely to have an abortion clinic before Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022. Since then, Kansas has become one of five states that people are most likely to travel to in order to get an abortion when they're unable to at home, said Caitlin Myers, an economics professor at Middlebury College who researches abortion policies.

Abortions spiked in Kansas by 152% after Roe, according to a recent analysis by the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. Using Myers' count, six of the clinics in Kansas, Illinois, New Mexico, North Carolina and Virginia that have opened or relocated post-Roe are in communities with fewer than 25,000 people. Two others are in communities of fewer than 50,000.

""Kansas is really the only one in this region that can provide care to many people in these surrounding states,"" said Kensey Wright, a member of the board of directors for the Roe Fund in Oklahoma, which supports Kansas abortion clinics through grants.

""Without abortion clinics in that state, we would be without hope,"" Wright said.

Housed in a former urology office, Pittsburg's Planned Parenthood clinic sits across the street from a medical clinic run by a Catholic health care system. Behind the clinic are houses.

Clinic manager Logan Rink said her mother used to work in this building as a nurse -- a connection that's ""small-town stuff."" She loves this town, and said her neighbors agree the clinic is needed. But she was guarded in her optimism, saying "" the reception that we are going to get from the community is going to be favorable in some ways and probably not always.""

Experts said smaller-sized clinics can be less overwhelming for women who are coming from rural areas, like those surrounding Pittsburg. But there is no anonymity in these smaller communities, where religious and family ties often run deep. Pittsburg was established in 1876, and settled largely by immigrants from Catholic-leaning countries who came to work at surrounding coal mines. There's a typical main street and a state university with about 7,400 students.

""In a small town, it's not just that you'll know that person. Your family will know them. You will have known them for 40 years,"" said Dr. Emily Walters, a supporter of the Pittsburg clinic who works as an anesthesiologist at a hospital in neighboring Missouri. ""Your stories will be intertwined.""

She wondered aloud, ""How do I see you at a protest and then see you the next day at the grocery store and still be able to be polite and civil with each other?""

Walters also chairs the Crawford County Democratic Party in an area that is increasingly Republican and has no Democratic state legislators -- a change from 20 years ago when there were six. The county also has become increasingly religious in the same span; it now has twice as many white evangelical Protestants as the national average, and slightly more Catholics, according to the Public Religion Research Institute.

Just five weeks after Roe was overturned in 2022, voters in Kansas had to decide whether to strip the right to an abortion from the state constitution, which could have led to an outright ban. Despite the Republican and religious leanings, 55% of Crawford County voters were part of the 59% of voters statewide who killed the proposal.

It's in line with an Associated Press-NORC poll from 2024 that showed 6 in 10 Americans think their state should generally allow a person to obtain a legal abortion if they don't want to be pregnant for any reason. But the rural counties that surrounded Pittsburg chose otherwise at the ballot box.

""I remember people were stealing yard signs, putting up different ones in people's yards,"" said Anastin Journot, an 18-year-old from Independence, Kansas, who is majoring in elementary education at Pittsburg State. She said she was alarmed by Roe getting overturned, remembering she thought: ""What if I'm in a situation where I'm needing to get an abortion and it's not an option?""

Abortion in Kansas is generally legal up until the 22nd week of pregnancy. The clinic's southern location puts it closer to states that have banned abortions instead of sending people to Kansas' larger cities, where hours have been expanded and appointments are still in short supply.

About 60% to 65% of people who call Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas for an abortion appointment are turned away because there isn't enough capacity, said Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains. Already, Wales said, the bulk of people seeking abortions in Kansas are from out of state -- mostly Texas, which is about five hours south. After that, it's Missouri, a few minutes' drive east and Oklahoma, less than an hour away. She said some come from as far away as Louisiana and even Florida, which now prohibits the procedure after six weeks.

Clinics ""strategically placed near (a state's) border can really help ease the congestion,"" said Ushma Upadhyay, a public health scientist at the University of California San Francisco who studies abortion.

Most of the area that's 100 miles from the new clinic has been designated as medically underserved for primary care by the federal government, and the number of obstetricians and gynecologists for every 100,000 female residents is less than half of the U.S. average.

For now, though, the focus at the Pittsburg clinic will be on abortion. Wales said Planned Parenthood wants to slowly add more services over the next two to three months, and one future goal for the clinic is to provide gender-affirming care. Neighboring states have restricted that, too.

""Pittsburg is going to lift up a whole lot of states in the South and help people get care,"" Wales said.

But those additions, she added, will come after staff gets used to the patients and the presence of protesters and opposition.

Donations are up at Vie Medical Clinic, the town's crisis pregnancy center, executive director Megan Newman said. Such centers are typically religiously affiliated and encourage clients to continue their pregnancies.

People opposed to the Planned Parenthood clinic also are picking up pamphlets about Vie so they can hand them out to those seeking abortions. ""When we got word that Planned Parenthood was coming, you could just kind of feel that in the town,"" Newman said.

Jeanne Napier, a 68-year-old who attends a local Baptist church, vowed as she shopped at the local mall that she'll ""be there every day with signs.""

Her daughter, Terri Napier, said in a phone interview she believes part of her parents' opposition to the clinic is from watching her struggle about 20 years ago. She was in an abusive relationship with someone who has since died. She got pregnant. The family was fearful of bringing a child into the situation.

She had an abortion, and spiraled into drug use. ""I was at war with forgiving myself,"" said the 43-year-old, who is now clean.

Jeanne Napier said she felt like she encouraged the abortion. ""And I hate that,"" she said, ""because I wish I could take that sin upon myself, so it's real personal. I had an active play in terminating a life, and we don't have that right.""

Brianna Barnes, a 19-year-old journalism major at Pittsburg State who is from Wichita, has protested and prayed outside of a clinic in her hometown.

""If someone made eye contact with us, we just smiled at them, kind of showing that love and care because no one responds well to screaming, yelling, violence no matter what side it's on,"" she said just after arriving on campus for the fall semester. Most of the students the AP talked to voiced support for the clinic.

Her mother, Crystal Barnes, 42, turned to her daughter: ""You're going to be the odd man out being a Catholic, and conservative, especially with things like abortion. It is so heated.""

The Friday before the clinic opened, crews installed a wooden facade outside, the air filled with the smell of fresh-cut lumber. Walters, the local anesthesiologist, had stopped by to check on the progress.

Walters' support comes from a personal place. When she was 20 and the same number of weeks pregnant, she went to an emergency room, bleeding. She said she was sent home to miscarry instead of having her labor induced or having a procedure to remove the fetus.

That experience -- ""horrific, and wouldn't be considered standard of care, in modern practice,"" she said -- left her with a deep empathy for women in tough positions.

Just before the 2022 vote, an ad backed by 400 Kansas doctors who support abortion rights ran in some of the state's largest papers, including The Kansas City Star. Walters' name was listed first. During that time, her home address appeared online, a frightening prospect in a state where abortion provider Dr. George Tiller was shot dead in 2009 at his Wichita church by an anti-abortion extremist.

""It is critical health care for women,"" she said. ""It is going to be disruptive to Pittsburg. And that part hurts my heart.""

This new Mexican blessed is considered a protector of life from conception. Who was Mois√©s Lira?,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/moises-lira-beatification-mexican-blessed-abortion-2dd0c80c30d8c674cbdc862212310aa0,2024-09-14T13:05:53Z,"MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's Catholic Church is getting a new addition to its ranks of ""blessed,"" with the beatification of the Rev. Mois√©s Lira.

The beatification ceremony was taking Saturday at Our Lady of Guadalupe's Basilica, led by Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, who was appointed by Pope Francis for the occasion.

Before Lira, the latest Mexican to be beatified was Mar√≠a Concepci√≥n Cabrera in 2019.

Here's a look at Lira's life in a country that's home to nearly 100 million Catholics.

He was born in September 1893 in Puebla, one of Mexico's most conservative states.

His mother died when he was 5 and he suffered the absence of his father, who had to relocate for work.

Lira dreamt of becoming a priest from a young age. In 1914, he became the first novice of a congregation founded by French priest F√©lix de Jes√∫s Rougier. And in 1922, after being ordained a priest, he wrote the motto that would define his life: ""It is necessary to be very small to be a great saint.""

Lira devoted his life to teach catechists, care for the ill and offer spiritual guidance to vulnerable communities. In 1934, he founded a congregation -- the Missionaries of Charity of Mary Immaculate -- as well as schools and psychiatric institutions.

He died in Mexico City in 1950.

According to Mother Mar√≠a de la Luz Nava, from the congregation founded by Lira, the miracle took place between May and June 2004.

Back then, a pregnant woman from Guanajuato -- another of Mexico's conservative states -- got the worst news imaginable: at 18 weeks of gestation, her unborn daughter suffered from a condition characterized by accumulation of fluid.

The diagnosis, the doctor said, could be fatal for the fetus or affect the mother. And though he offered to terminate the pregnancy, the woman and her husband refused.

""There wasn't much hope,"" Mother Mar√≠a de la Luz said. ""But they were very clear about one thing: they were not going to opt for abortion. They were going to continue looking for options so that their daughter would be born well.""

Back home, the woman found a brochure on the Rev. Lira's work. ""I don't know you,"" she told him. ""But please, help me.""

For nine days, she prayed. And when a new doctor's appointment came, a surprise awaited.

""What did you do?"" the doctor asked the couple. ""Because your daughter is healthy.""

""This is where the intercession of Father Mois√©s is very evident,"" said Mother Mar√≠a de la Luz. ""And it shows how a miracle is produced by faith.""

De la Luz's congregation learned about the case in 2014. The beatification request was made through the local diocese the following year and eight years passed until Pope Francis issued a decree for the miracle in 2023.

According to the Rev. David Padr√≥n, who has worked on causes for canonization, the miracle attributed to Lira makes him a protector of life from conception.

""This is a very strong message from God,"" Padr√≥n said. ""Maybe those mothers who have a problem during their pregnancies can confide in him.""

Aside from that, he said, parishioners could also entrust him with health and education causes, because Lira worked extensively with sick people and students.

""Much of his pastoral work dignified those who, due to illness, poverty or some other situation, did not enjoy a dignified life in society,"" Padr√≥n said.

Catholic leaders trust that a second miracle would be produced after Saturday's beatification, which would allow them to pursue Lira's canonization.

In the meantime, local parishes will honor him each June 15. ""We have included him as part of the saints of the Archdiocese of Mexico, hoping that, when he is canonized, he can be celebrated throughout the world,"" Padr√≥n said.

Lira's most treasured relic is a metacarpal bone from his right hand. It's symbolic, Padr√≥n said, because Lira shared the Gospel through his writings and it's part of the pointing finger.

""The blessed and the saints are men and women who point us to Christ,"" he said.

A few first-class relics -- body parts of Lira -- will be soon distributed through parishes that were significant in his life or for Mexico's Catholic community, such as Our Lady of Guadalupe's Basilica and Puebla's cathedral.

Embattled Democratic senators steer clear of Kamala Harris buzz but hope it helps,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-senate-brown-tester-harris-trump-e7256dd5dd657f0432c36a5c2d2dc8bf,2024-09-14T04:15:24Z,"BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) -- Montana U.S. Sen. Jon Tester has made protecting reproductive freedom for women central to his campaign to remain the sole remaining Democrat to hold statewide elective office in Big Sky Country. He has campaigned with Planned Parenthood officials, advertised heavily in support of abortion rights, and embraced a ballot proposal to make abortion a state constitutional right.

Yet one woman Tester notably isn't talking about much on the campaign trail is Vice President Kamala Harris.

With control of the Senate at stake, the seats held by Tester and Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio top the list for potential Republican pickups this fall. Former President Donald Trump is expected to win the two reliably red states by wide margins, so the Democratic lawmakers must walk a political tightrope to keep from alienating too many of his supporters.

That includes minimal mention of Harris, with her ties to an administration that's unpopular in their states, even as her trailblazing effort to become the nation's first female president energizes abortion rights supporters.

Tester, in an interview, said the desire to protect abortion access will attract voters ""regardless of political ilk.""

""I think it appeals to people across the board because it's about freedom, and Montana is a freedom-loving state,"" he said. ""This issue comes up more than any other issue.""

Both Tester and Brown could benefit from any momentum Harris' presidential bid injects into key Democratic voting blocs, but if they do it almost certainly will happen quietly. Neither attended the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last month.

At least one observer thinks they're being too careful.

""Democrats are not capitalizing on this very well, not just in Montana but in general,"" said Paul Pope, a political analyst at Montana State University Billings.

Tester, Pope said, ""has not moved the needle much. If he endorses Harris, he has the opportunity to capitalize on the broad support she has, and the excitement.""

Republicans in both states, meanwhile, are doing everything they can to knock the incumbent senators off their political tightrope. Staggering amounts of money have been spent by both sides in the two states.

Democrats so far have outspent Republicans in Montana, and Republicans have bet more heavily on Ohio, according to AdImpact, which tracks advertising by campaigns nationwide. Spending by the candidates and outside groups on television, radio and digital advertisements is on track to hit $636 million, the data show, including almost $400 million in Ohio and $240 million in Montana.

That equates to almost $50 for every registered voter in Ohio and more than $300 for every registered voter in Montana.

Tester declined to endorse Harris, saying the Senate race shouldn't be about national politics, and used convention week to work on his farm and host a rally in Missoula headlined by the bassist for the rock band Pearl Jam. By contrast, his opponent, former U.S. Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, secured the GOP nomination following an early Trump endorsement and last month hosted the Republican former president at a rally in Bozeman.

During his stump speeches and on the airwaves, Sheehy constantly seeks to link Tester with Harris and other Democratic leaders, including President Joe Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.

The Republican -- who faced backlash in recent days after refusing to apologize for derogatory comments he made to supporters about Native Americans -- describes Tester as the ""deciding vote"" on key Democratic legislation over the past several years. That includes the Biden administration's climate bill and several failed GOP measures to further restrict immigration.

""Tester's voting record is his endorsement of the failed Harris agenda,"" said Sheehy spokesperson Katie Martin. ""Every time Montanans needed him to stop the insanity back in Washington, he was the deciding vote to further her progressive liberal agenda.""

Brown also used the convention week to campaign back home, sweeping through rural and urban counties to shake hands with veterans and campaign volunteers. He has said he supports and would campaign with Harris, knowing that her abbreviated campaign is unlikely to set foot in a state so supportive of Trump.

Brown has used campaign events to remind women and young voters he supports abortion rights, while airing ads highlighting union workers, police and Trump's signature on a border-related bill the senator sponsored.

Brown's Republican rival, Cleveland area entrepreneur Bernie Moreno, ranks illegal immigration and inflation as bigger concerns for voters. Moreno accused Democrats of misrepresenting his stance on abortion -- he says he supports reasonable restrictions after 15 weeks, not a ""national abortion ban"" -- and predicted that the issue would not drive turnout as much as Democrats predict.

Michael Gonidakias, president of Ohio Right to Life, said pocketbook issues are motivating many voters this year, particularly with the passage of a 2023 constitutional amendment protecting abortion rights.

""No matter how hard you try to sway someone that cares about the issue of abortion one way or the other, economic issues will still dominate -- in my opinion -- how they vote,"" he said. ""Because things aren't good right now.""

Katie Paris, founder of Red Wine & Blue, a political group focused on suburban women, said protecting abortion rights is an economic issue, and it remains a huge motivator for people she represents. The Ohio abortion amendment last year guaranteed an individual's right to make their own reproductive decisions. It won nearly 57% of the vote.

""Issue 1 last year unified Ohio, and Kamala being a candidate who's put freedom and reproductive freedom at the very center of her campaign, she's put wind in the sails (of other campaigns) with a message that does have bipartisan agreement,"" Paris said.

Both Sheehy and Moreno were endorsed by the leading antiabortion group SBA Pro-Life America. Sheehy said in a June debate that he backs restrictions on abortions with exceptions for rape, incest or to protect the mother's life.

""That baby has rights too,"" Sheehy said.

Tester's campaign brought in a Planned Parenthood executive for a recent rally in downtown Bozeman, where more than 100 people jammed into a small events space with signs saying ""Freedom"" and ""Tester"" plastered on the walls. The rally coincided with a flood of ""Republicans for Tester"" advertisements on TV across the state.

Montana State University political scientist Jessi Bennion said the dual strategy makes sense.

""There are a lot of Republicans that have nuanced views on abortion. Tester's trying to find all of those voters and they're a small group but they're swing voters, they split their ticket,"" she said.

Some people at the rally openly worried about Tester's prospects -- and that if he loses it could drag down the state's constitutional initiative on abortion.

""I'm nervous. I'm nervous about all of it,"" said Leslie Peterson, 61, a retired teacher who said women should be able to decide for themselves if they want an abortion. ""The state's just gone so red in the last couple of years. ... It's just gone completely Republican.""

Tester took the stage and described how his mother, a daughter of Montana homesteaders, fought for abortion access. The lawmaker declared the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade ""the biggest reduction of freedom in my lifetime.""

""We got some things we can do about it,"" he said as the crowd cheered. ""We're going to go the polls, we're going to make sure that initiative passes, right?"""
Arizona's 1864 abortion ban is officially off the books,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/arizona-abortion-ban-repeal-ac4a1eb97efcd3c506aeaac8f8152127,2024-09-14T04:07:21Z,"PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona's Civil War-era ban on nearly all abortions officially is being repealed Saturday.

The western swing state has been whipsawed over recent months, starting with the Arizona Supreme Court deciding in April to let the state enforce the long-dormant 1864 law that criminalized all abortions except when a woman's life was jeopardized. Then state lawmakers voted on a bill to repeal that law once and for all.

Democratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs signed the bill in May, declaring it was just the beginning of a fight to protect reproductive health care in Arizona.

""I will continue doing everything in my power to protect reproductive freedoms, because I trust women to make the decisions that are best for them, and know politicians do not belong in the doctor's office,"" Hobbs said in a statement.

Abortion has sharply defined Arizona's political arena since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. As the November general election approaches, the issue remains a focus of Democratic campaigns, and it will be up to Arizona voters to decide whether to enshrine the right to abortion in the state constitution.

It was after the state Supreme Court cleared the way for enforcement that Hobbs urged the state Legislature to take imminent action to undo the ban before it went into effect. Republican lawmakers, who hold a narrow majority in both chambers, derailed discussions about repealing the ban. At one point, the roadblocks resulted in chants of ""Shame! Shame!"" by outraged Democratic colleagues.

Emotions on the House floor and in the gallery ran high as House Democrats were able to garner the support of three Republicans to pass the repeal legislation two weeks later, sending the measure to the Senate for consideration. Two GOP senators joined with Democrats a week later to grant final approval.

Democrats were advocating for the repeal long before the Supreme Court issued its ruling. Even Hobbs called for action in her January State of the State address.

The battle in Arizona made national headlines again when Democratic state Sen. Eva Burch told fellow lawmakers in a floor speech in March that she was going to get an abortion because her pregnancy was no longer viable. She said in an interview that it was her chance to highlight that the laws passed by legislators in Arizona ""actually do impact people in practice and not just in theory.""

In the weeks between the high court's decision and Hobbs signing the repeal into law, Arizonans were in a state of confusion about whether the near-total ban would end up taking effect before the repeal was implemented.

A court order put the ban on hold, but questions lingered about whether doctors in the state could perform the procedure. California Gov. Gavin Newsom weighed in on the issue in late May, signing legislation allowing Arizona doctors to receive temporary, emergency licenses to perform abortions in California.

With the territorial ban no longer in play, Arizona law allows abortions until 15 weeks. After that, there is an exception to save the life of the mother, but missing are exceptions for cases of rape or incest after the 15-week mark.

Arizona requires those seeking an abortion prior to the 15-week mark to have an ultrasound at least 24 hours before the procedure and to be given the opportunity to view it. Minors must have either parental consent or authorization from a state judge, except in cases of incest or when their life is at risk.

Abortion medication can only be provided through a qualified physician, and only licensed physicians can perform surgical abortions. Abortion providers and clinics also must record and report certain information about the abortions they perform to the department of health services.

Voters will have the ultimate say on whether to add the right to an abortion to the state constitution when they cast their ballots in the general election.

Arizona for Abortion Access, the coalition leading the ballot measure campaign, was successful in securing the measure's spot on the ballot. The Arizona Secretary of State verified 577,971 signatures that were collected as part of the citizen-led campaign, well over the 383,923 required from registered voters.

If voters approve the measure, abortions would be allowed until fetal viability -- the point at which a fetus could survive outside the womb, typically around 24 weeks. It also would allow abortions after that time in cases where the mother's physical or mental health is in jeopardy."
A review of some of Pope Francis' most memorable quotes over his papacy,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/pope-francis-quotes-lgbtq-abortion-contraception-ae6b1b11f5a6c40980ad89818934e85f,2024-09-13T21:19:36Z,"On Friday, flying back to Rome from a lengthy trip to Asia, Pope Francis criticized both U.S. presidential candidates for what he called anti-life policies on abortion and migration. He advised American Catholics to choose who they think is the ""lesser evil"" in the upcoming U.S. elections.

""Both are against life, be it the one who kicks out migrants, or be it the one who kills babies,'' Francis said. Neither Republican candidate Donald Trump nor the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris, was mentioned by name.

It was the latest in a long string of memorable -- and sometimes controversial -- comments from the pope, who throughout his 11-year papacy has often been willing to speak out in impromptu fashion.

Several of the most noteworthy comments related to LGBTQ+ issues -- a matter of keen public interest given official Catholic teaching that condemns same-sex marriage and sexual relations. Some examples:

-- July 30, 2013. During his first press conference, says ""Who am I to judge?"" when asked about a purportedly gay priest, signaling a more welcoming approach to LGBTQ+ Catholics.

-- May 21, 2018: Tells a gay man ""God made you like this and he loves you.""

-- Jan. 24, 2023: Declares in an Associated Press interview that "" Being homosexual is not a crime.""

-- Jan. 28, 2023: Clarifies his comments to AP which implied that while homosexual activity was not a crime it is a sin in the eyes of the church. ""When I said it is a sin, I was simply referring to Catholic moral teaching, which says that every sexual act outside of marriage is a sin.""

-- Aug. 24, 2023: During World Youth Day in Lisbon, Portugal, the pope led a crowd of a half-million young people chanting ""todos, todos, todos"" (everyone, everyone, everyone) to emphasize that all are welcome in the Catholic Church.

-- May 20, 2024: Francis reportedly says "" there is already an air of faggotness"" in seminaries, in closed-door comments to Italian bishops in reaffirming the church's ban on gay priests. He later apologized for causing offense.

Among other notable quotes:

-- Jan. 19, 2015: Francis, while firmly upholding church teaching banning contraception, said Catholics don't have to breed ""like rabbits"" and should instead practice ""responsible parenting.""

-- February 2015: The pope referred to the possible ""Mexicanization"" of his native Argentina from drug trafficking. It created a stir, prompting the Vatican to send a diplomatic note to Mexico's ambassador insisting that Francis ""absolutely did not intend to offend the Mexican people"" with the remark.

-- Feb. 18, 2016: Flying back to Rome from a pilgrimage that included Mass at the Mexican side of the border with the U.S., Pope Francis, answering a reporter's question, said a person who advocates building walls is ""not Christian."" A spokesperson later insisted the pope was not singling out Donald Trump.

-- May 25, 2019: Addressing a Vatican-sponsored conference, the pope said abortion can never be condoned, even when the fetus is gravely sick or likely to die. ""Is it licit to throw away a life to resolve a problem?"" he asked. ""Is it licit to hire a hitman to resolve a problem?""

-- July 26, 2022: The pope issued a historic apology for the Catholic Church's cooperation with Canada's ""catastrophic"" policy of Indigenous residential schools. ""I humbly beg forgiveness for the evil committed by so many Christians against the Indigenous peoples,"" he said.

-- May 12, 2023: Blasting couples who have pets instead of children, Francis called for resources to be dedicated to helping couples grow their families, saying it was necessary to ""plant the future"" with hope.

-- February 2024: The pope said in an interview that Ukraine, facing a possible defeat, should have the courage to negotiate an end to the war with Russia. ""I think that the strongest one is the one who looks at the situation, thinks about the people and has the courage of the white flag, and negotiates,"" he said.

Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said Francis picked up the ""white flag"" term that had been used by the interviewer. He issued a statement of clarification after the pope's ""white flag"" comments sparked criticism that he was siding with Russia in the conflict.

Nevada is joining the list of states using Medicaid to pay for more abortions,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-nevada-medicaid-judge-30aee8ae9464893a7c66e0ce99500e29,2024-09-13T18:46:41Z,"LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Nevada is primed to become the 18th state to use Medicaid funds to increase access to abortion for lower-income women.

The change is a result of a court ruling that became official this week after the state government declined to appeal it within 30 days of the release of a written opinion in the case that found denying coverage violated the equal right protections adopted by the state's voters in 2022. Nevada officials have not said when the coverage will begin, but the judge said it should be no later than early November.

""Nevadans who have Medicaid as their health insurance will no longer need to fear that they will be forced to carry a pregnancy against their will,"" Rebecca Chan, a lawyer with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, which sued in the case, said in a statement.

Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended the nationwide right to abortion, the issue has been a legal and political battleground. Most Republican-controlled states have implemented bans or restrictions, including 14 that now bar abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and four more that generally prohibit it after about the first six weeks of pregnancy. Most Democratic-led states have taken steps to protect access.

Nevada, with a Republican governor and Democratic-controlled legislature, has protected access. Voters in November will consider enshrining the right to abortion in the state constitution; if it passes, there will be a second vote in 2026.

Apart from whether a state bans or restricts abortion, an important factor in its availability is whether it pays for abortions for those who have medical insurance through Medicaid, the joint state-federal program for lower-income people.

Under a 1977 law, federal funds are prohibited from paying for abortion except in cases of rape, incest and when abortion is necessary to save the life of the pregnant person. But states can use their allocations to pay for abortion under more circumstances.

The Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights, says that most follow the federal law for the state funds, too -- or do so but with some additional exceptions.

But 17 of them pay for abortion without limitations. Nine of those are under court orders and eight cover abortion voluntarily.

KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care issues, says that about one-third of the nation's women ages 15 to 49 live in states where abortion is not banned but where Medicaid covers abortion in only limited cases. And about one in five women in those states has Medicaid insurance coverage. Those with Medicaid are disproportionately low-income, Native American and Black."
Pope Francis slams both US presidential candidates over what he calls anti-life policies,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/vatican-pope-trump-harris-election-0e0faef49ff587098f75b265e386bf22,2024-09-13T17:57:55Z,"ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (AP) -- Pope Francis on Friday slammed both U.S. presidential candidates for what he called anti-life policies on abortion and migration, and advised American Catholics to choose the ""lesser evil"" in the upcoming U.S. elections.

""Both are against life, be it the one who kicks out migrants or the one who (supports) killing babies,"" Francis said. ""Both are against life.""

The Argentine Jesuit was asked to provide counsel to American Catholic voters during an airborne press conference en route back to Rome from his four-nation tour through Asia. Francis stressed that he is not an American and would not be voting.

Neither the Republican candidate Donald Trump nor the Democratic candidate Kamala Harris was mentioned by name.

But Francis nevertheless expressed himself in stark terms when asked to weigh in on their positions on two hot-button issues in the U.S. election -- abortion and migration -- that are also of major concern to the Catholic Church.

Francis has made the plight of migrants a priority of his pontificate and speaks out emphatically and frequently about it. While strongly upholding church teaching forbidding abortion, Francis hasn't emphasized church doctrine as much as his predecessors.

Francis said migration is a right described in Scripture, and that anyone who doesn't follow the Biblical call to welcome the stranger is committing a ""grave sin.""

He was also blunt in speaking about abortion. ""To have an abortion is to kill a human being. You may like the word or not, but it's killing,"" he said. ""We have to see this clearly.""

Asked though what to do at the polls, Francis recalled the civic duty to vote.

""One should vote, and choose the lesser evil,"" he said. ""Who is the lesser evil, the woman or man? I don't know.

""Everyone in their conscience should think and do it,"" he said.

It's not the first time Francis has weighed in on a U.S. election. In the run-up to the 2016 election, Francis was asked about Trump's plan to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexican border. Francis declared then that anyone who builds a wall to keep out migrants ""is not Christian.""

In responding Friday, Francis recalled that he celebrated Mass at the U.S.-Mexico border and ""there were so many shoes of the migrants who ended up badly there.""

The U.S. bishops conference, for its part, has called abortion the ""preeminent priority"" for American Catholics in its published voter advice. Harris has strongly defended abortion rights.

In other comments, Francis:

-- denied a French media report that he would travel to Paris for the December inauguration of the restored Notre Dame Cathedral, saying flat-out he would not be there. But he confirmed he would like to go to the Canary Islands to highlight the plight of migrants.

-- tamped down renewed speculation that he might finally return to Argentina later this year, saying he wants to go but that nothing had been decided. He added: ""There are various things to resolve first."" Francis hasn't been home since before the 2013 conclave that elected him pope.

-- declared that China was ""a promise and a hope"" for the Catholic Church and hoped to one day visit.

Lawsuit alleges plot to run sham candidate so DeSantis appointee can win election,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/orlando-state-attorney-election-lawsuit-bain-worrell-12dbdca60af7d6a084e023745ce4ed43,2024-09-13T17:53:16Z,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other GOP officials were behind a plot to eliminate competition for his appointee and keep a former Democratic state attorney who the Republican governor had removed from office last year from winning back her job as the top prosecutor in central Florida, according to a lawsuit filed this week.

The lawsuit was filed Tuesday by Thomas Feiter, a Republican candidate for the State Attorney district covering metro Orlando who lost in the GOP primary to Seth Hyman.

Hyman earlier this month dropped out of the general election race where he was facing DeSantis appointee Andrew Bain, who is running without party affiliation, and Democrat Monique Worrell, who Bain replaced after DeSantis suspended her in what opponents viewed as a political move.

After withdrawing from the race this month, Hyman endorsed Bain. No Republican was named by the state GOP to take Hyman's place on the general election ballot for November.

According to the lawsuit, the Republican officials supported Hyman's sham candidacy knowing he would drop out of the race after winning the primary.

The officials ""intended their conspiracy and misconduct to directly affect our election results to achieve their desired outcome, and keep their previously appointed candidate (Andrew Bain) in office,"" the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit alleges election fraud, violations of Florida's elections code and corruptly influencing voting. It is asking that the GOP primary results be declared invalid because of corruption, misconduct and fraud.

Hyman called the lawsuit ""completely frivolous and an abuse of the court system"" in an email on Friday. A spokesperson for Bain's campaign did not respond to an email on Friday, and there was no response to an email sent to the governor's office.

DeSantis claimed Worrell failed to prosecute crimes committed by minors and didn't seek mandatory minimum sentences for gun crimes, putting the public in danger in her central Florida district.

Worrell said her August 2023 suspension was politically motivated since it took place while DeSantis was running for the GOP presidential nomination. She argued that the state constitution only allows for the suspension of an elected official for egregious misconduct, and that she was simply doing her job as she saw fit.

DeSantis last year also removed State Attorney Andrew Warren, a twice-elected Democrat in Tampa, over Warren's signing of pledges that he would not pursue criminal charges against seekers or providers of abortion or gender transition treatments. DeSantis also disagreed with his policies on not bringing charges for certain low-level crimes."
Florida sued for using taxpayer money on website promoting GOP spin on abortion initiative,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/florida-abortion-amendment-4-website-lawsuit-de510053ee9799d6d6da3d4b203052f3,2024-09-13T15:25:08Z,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- A political committee behind the campaign to pass a constitutional right to abortion in Florida has filed a lawsuit against a state health care agency that it alleges is carrying out a taxpayer-funded ""misinformation"" campaign against the November ballot measure.

Critics say the state-backed messaging push is the latest ""dirty trick"" by Republican officials in Florida to thwart the citizen-led initiative to protect abortion in the country's third-largest state. Nearly a million Floridians signed petitions to get the measure known as Amendment 4 on the ballot, surpassing the more than 891,500 signatures required by the state.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida filed the lawsuit in a Leon County circuit court on Thursday on behalf of Floridians Protecting Freedom, Inc., the organization behind Amendment 4.

The lawsuit targets a website, television and radio ads created by Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration to give Floridians ""the truth"" about the proposed constitutional amendment. If approved by at least 60% of Florida voters, Amendment 4 would make abortions legal until the fetus is viable, as determined by the patient's health care provider.

The website launched this month states that ""Amendment 4 threatens women's safety"" and defends Florida's current law, which bans most abortions after six weeks, under a banner that reads ""Florida is Protecting Life"" and ""Don't let the fearmongers lie to you.""

In the legal filing, attorneys for the abortion rights campaign called on the court to immediately halt the messaging push and what they argue is the unlawful use of taxpayer funds by state officials in service of a political campaign, actions which they claim are infringing on the rights of Florida voters.

""Florida's government has crossed a dangerous line by using public resources to mislead voters and manipulate their choices in the upcoming election,"" ACLU of Florida attorney Michelle Morton said in a statement. ""This lawsuit aims to stop these unconstitutional efforts and restore integrity to our electoral process.""

Representatives for AHCA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In a post on the social media platform X before the lawsuit was filed, AHCA Secretary Jason Weida touted the agency's new website.

""To combat the lies and disinformation surrounding Florida's abortion laws, @AHCA_FL has launched an improved transparency page,"" Weida's post reads. ""To see more please visit our website.""

Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has defended the agency's messaging push -- and a state investigation into tens of thousands of petition signatures that were used to get Amendment 4 on the ballot. As a part of that probe, police have been showing up at the homes of some of the people who signed the petition to question them.

Speaking to reporters before the lawsuit was filed, DeSantis said the AHCA page is not political but is giving Floridians ""factual information"" about the amendment.

""Everything that is put out is factual. It is not electioneering,"" DeSantis said at a news conference, adding, ""I am glad they are doing it.""

"Measure to repeal Nebraska's private school funding law should appear on the ballot, court rules",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/private-school-choice-nebraska-ballot-7f64c3eacea5e25c730ad02c9b2418b3,2024-09-13T14:11:12Z,"A ballot measure seeking to repeal a new conservative-backed law that provides taxpayer money for private school tuition should appear on the state's November ballot, the state Supreme Court ruled Friday.

The court found that the ballot measure does not target an appropriation, which is prohibited by law

The ruling came just days after the state's high court heard arguments Tuesday in a lawsuit brought by an eastern Nebraska woman whose child received one of the first private school tuition scholarships available through the new law. Her lawsuit argued that the referendum initiative violates the state constitution's prohibition on voter initiatives to revoke legislative appropriations for government functions.

An attorney for the referendum effort countered that the ballot question appropriately targets the creation of the private school tuition program -- not the $10 million appropriations bill that accompanied it.

Republican Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen certified the repeal measure last week after finding that organizers of the petition effort had gathered thousands more valid signatures than the nearly 62,000 needed to get the repeal question on the ballot.

But in an eleventh-hour brief submitted to the state Supreme Court before Tuesday's arguments, Evnen indicated that he believed he made a mistake and that ""the referendum is not legally sufficient.""

The brief went on to say that Evnen intended to rescind his certification and keep the repeal effort off the ballot unless the high court specifically ordered that it remain.

If Evnen were to follow through with that declaration, it would leave only hours for repeal organizers to sue to try to get the measure back on the ballot. The deadline for Evnen to certify the general election ballot is Friday.

An attorney for repeal organizers, Daniel Gutman, had argued before the high court that there is nothing written in state law that allows the secretary of state to revoke legal certification of a voter initiative measure once issued.

A similar scenario played out this week in Missouri, where Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft had certified in August a ballot measure that asks voters to undo the state's near-total abortion ban. On Monday, Ashcroft reversed course, declaring he was decertifying the measure and removing it from the ballot.

The Missouri Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered Ashcroft to return the measure to the ballot.

The Nebraska Supreme Court's ruling comes after a long fight over the private school funding issue. Public school advocates carried out a successful signature-gathering effort this summer to ask voters to reverse the use of public money for private school tuition.

It was their second successful petition drive. The first came last year when Republicans who dominate the officially nonpartisan Nebraska Legislature passed a bill to allow corporations and individuals to divert millions of dollars they owe in state income taxes to nonprofit organizations. Those organizations, in turn, would award that money as private school tuition scholarships.

Support Our Schools collected far more signatures last summer than was needed to ask voters to repeal that law. But lawmakers who support the private school funding bill carried out an end-run around the ballot initiative when they repealed the original law and replaced it earlier this year with another funding law. The new law dumped the tax credit funding system and simply funds private school scholarships directly from state coffers.

Because the move repealed the first law, it rendered last year's successful petition effort moot, requiring organizers to again collect signatures to try to stop the funding scheme.

Nebraska's new law follows several other conservative Republican states -- including Arkansas, Iowa and South Carolina -- in enacting some form of private school choice, from vouchers to education savings account programs."
Feds rarely punish hospitals for turning away pregnant patients,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hospitals-patient-dumping-pregnancies-6a0fa0a16a42e4ceb4c8c14c5cd2c0f5,2024-09-13T14:05:31Z,"As the pregnant woman's contractions rolled in every two minutes, staff at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, dispatched an ambulance to send her elsewhere.

Just two minutes later, she gave birth to a 6-pound baby girl in the cab of the ambulance down the road from the 900-bed hospital.

The incident, government investigators concluded last year, was a violation of a federal law that requires emergency rooms to stabilize patients in medical distress before discharging or transferring them.

Yet, Our Lady of the Lake has never been been penalized for that incident or any of its other violations of the law. Few emergency rooms ever are.

Just a dozen hospitals have been fined for refusing to treat patients -- pregnant or not -- over the past two years, an Associated Press analysis of civil monetary penalties issued by the U.S. Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General found. It took years for the government to decide those penalties.

Not one of the more than 100 emergency rooms that mistreated or turned away pregnant women since 2022, when the Biden administration pledged to toughen enforcement of the law, has been fined.

""What little we know about the investigations have yielded very rare results,"" said Sara Rosenbaum, a George Washington University health law and policy professor.

At Our Lady of the Lake, which did not provide comment for this article, inspectors determined the emergency room's staff members violated the federal mandate seven times since 2017, when they refused a needed surgery to a Medicaid patient with a broken spine, left a suicidal teenager unattended in the lobby and failed to examine another pregnant woman before sending her to another hospital, federal records show.

Other emergency rooms denied care to pregnant women, sometimes leaving them to miscarry in bathrooms, deliver babies in cars or develop risky infections. Some repeatedly flouted the mandate without consequence, including one Tennessee emergency room with such long wait times that a pregnant woman had to be hospitalized for a week after an 8-hour wait and a man with chest pain collapsed in the lobby, then died.

HHS does not demand fines from hospitals that violate the law except in unusual cases where they refuse to improve their practices, agency officials said.

""Because the consequences are so real, we have seen hospitals work with us almost every single time,"" HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement to the AP. ""We have been and will continue to be forward leaning here, communicating our intent directly and very seriously to hospital executives and provider associations which is, in part, why we have seen such good cooperation.""

After the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide right to an abortion, the Biden administration turned to a longstanding federal law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, in a frantic effort to ensure abortion access for women in dire medical circumstances. The White House has argued that to comply with the law, hospitals must provide emergency abortions for pregnant women who need them to save their lives or reproductive organs, despite state abortion bans.

HHS has sent letters to hospitals repeatedly reminding them of that law and the penalties -- up to $129,232 per violation or loss of Medicare funding -- for flouting it.

The government also rolled out a new website making it easier for patients to file a complaint if they are rejected, and it promised to expediate those investigations. Last year, for example, HHS announced that two facilities -- Freeman Health System in Joplin, Missouri, and University of Kansas Health System in Kansas City, Kansas -- ran afoul of the federal law after refusing an emergency abortion to Mylissa Farmer.

Doctors at both hospitals told the 41-year old Missouri woman that her baby had no chance of surviving after her water broke at 17 weeks but because of the states' abortion bans, her condition needed to worsen before they'd terminate her pregnancy.

Neither hospital has been fined.

""It would be welcomed if the federal government took a stronger enforcement role in those cases."" said Alison Tanner, an attorney for National Women's Law Center who represents Farmer. ""We have a maternal health crisis in this country and in states with bans on abortion care, it is far worse and more dangerous.""

Tanner said the HHS Office of Inspector General, which is responsible for issuing fines for violations of the law, is investigating Farmer's case. The office declined to comment on cases under review.

The government's most recent fines against hospitals that turned away pregnant patients were cases from years ago.

A Tennessee hospital agreed to pay a $100,000 fine for a 2018 case involving a pregnant patient who was discharged and gave birth in a car at 42 weeks pregnant. A Kentucky hospital was fined $90,000 for refusing to help a patient with an ectopic pregnancy in 2021.

After a complaint against a hospital is filed, a state surveyor investigates the hospital. A physician and the federal government review the findings to determine whether or not a patient received inadequate treatment. If an emergency room violated the federal law, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services may refer the case to the HHS inspector general to consider penalties.

Those investigations are ""slow, insufficiently staffed, with a lot of pushback tolerated from hospitals,"" Rosenbaum, an expert on the law, said.

Emergency rooms were supposed to stop turning away patients in medical crisis decades ago, when Congress passed bipartisan legislation designed to prohibit patient dumping that then-Republican President Ronald Reagan signed in 1986.

The law requires facilities that accept Medicare funding to provide a medical screening exam to anyone who shows up at or near their door and offer stabilizing treatment, if needed. Emergency rooms without the resources or staff to properly treat that patient are required to arrange a medical transfer to another hospital, after they've confirmed the facility can accept the patient.

The law, Sen. David Durenberger promised nearly 40 years ago as he rallied for its passage, would be a warning to private hospitals that had been dumping pregnant patients and gunshot victims on the doorsteps of public hospitals.

""This amendment is to send a clear signal to the hospital community,"" he said on the floor of Congress. ""That all Americans, regardless of wealth or status, should know that a hospital will provide what services it can when they are truly in distress.""

But a decade ago, a report published by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights concluded there was ""insufficient regulatory oversight of the law,"" and that hospitals were not properly training staff to follow the mandate nor did they have proper funding to comply with it. ___ Associated Press editor Kevin S. Vineys contributed to this report."
"Nebraska ballot can include competing measures to expand or limit abortion rights, high court rules",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-ballot-measures-nebraska-a545d1cb44b18cf37084e4a62e27019a,2024-09-13T13:42:26Z,"The Nebraska Supreme Court ruled Friday that competing measures that would expand or limit abortion rights can appear on the November ballot.

The high court's ruling came days after it heard arguments in three lawsuits that sought to keep one or both of the state's competing abortion initiatives off the November ballot.

Organizers for the competing measures each turned in well over the 123,000 required valid signatures needed to get them on the ballot.

One initiative would enshrine in the Nebraska Constitution the right to have an abortion until viability, or later to protect the health of the pregnant woman. The other would write into the constitution Nebraska's current 12-week abortion ban, passed by the Legislature in 2023, which includes exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the pregnant woman.

Two lawsuits -- one brought by an Omaha resident and the other by a Nebraska neonatologist who both oppose abortion -- argued that the measure seeking to expand abortion rights violates the state's prohibition against addressing more than one subject in a bill or ballot proposal. They say the ballot measure deals with abortion rights until viability, abortion rights after viability to protect the woman's health and whether the state should be allowed to regulate abortion, amounting to three separate issues.

A similar single-subject argument on an abortion rights ballot measure before the conservative Florida Supreme Court failed earlier this year.

A third lawsuit challenged the 12-week ban initiative. That filing argued that if the high court found the abortion rights measure fails the single-subject test, it had to also find that the 12-week ban initiative failed it, too.

The 12-week ban ballot measure would loop in at least six separate subjects to include regulating abortion in the first, second and third trimesters and separate exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother, an attorney for that third lawsuit argued.

The state's high court has offered a mixed bag on single-subject law challenges. In 2020, the Nebraska Supreme Court blocked a ballot initiative seeking to legalize medical marijuana after finding that its provisions to allow people to use marijuana and to produce it were separate subjects that violated the state's single-subject rule.

But in July, the court ruled that a hybrid bill passed by the Legislature in 2023 combining the 12-week abortion ban with another measure to limit gender-affirming health care for minors does not violate the single-subject rule. That led to a scathing dissent by Justice Lindsey Miller-Lerman, who accused the majority of applying different standards to bills passed by the Legislature and those sought by voter referendum.

The court agreed to expedite its hearings and rulings on the lawsuits to eliminate the need for any proceedings at lower courts and to get the issue decided before ballots are printed across the state. The deadline to certify the Nebraska November ballot is Friday.

Nebraska will be/would have been the first state to carry competing abortion amendments on the same ballot since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, effectively ending 50 years of national abortion rights and making abortion a state-by-state issue. But the topic of abortion in general will be on the ballot in nine states across the country this year. Measures to protect access have also qualified to go before voters in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nevada and South Dakota.

New York also has a ballot measure that proponents say would protect abortion rights, though there's a dispute about its impact. A measure is not on the Arkansas ballot, but an attempt to add it is being sought through litigation. Voters in all seven states with an abortion-related ballot measure since the reversal of Roe v. Wade have favored abortion rights.

Most Republican-controlled states have implemented abortion bans of some sort since Roe was overturned.

Public opinion polling has also shown growing support for abortion rights, including a recent Associated Press-NORC survey that found 6 in 10 Americans think their state should allow someone to obtain a legal abortion if they don't want to be pregnant for any reason.

Fourteen states currently have bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions; four states ban it after about six weeks, which is before many women know they are pregnant. Nebraska and North Carolina are the only states that have opted for bans that kick in after 12 weeks of pregnancy."
Congressional Democrats push resolution that says hospitals must provide emergency abortions,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-emergency-rooms-pregnancy-emtala-394288c5dccff34f7091e2894221695c,2024-09-12T19:58:40Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A resolution introduced by Congressional Democrats would make clear that U.S. emergency rooms need to provide emergency abortions when a woman's health or life is at risk, despite strict state abortion bans.

Legislators cited a report by The Associated Press that found more than 100 pregnant women have been denied care since 2022 in introducing the two-page proposal on Thursday.

""It's an outrage,"" Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat of New Jersey who introduced the House resolution, said of the AP's findings. ""Lives are at risk and despite clear federal law and additional guidance from the Biden administration, states across the country are refusing to treat pregnant women in emergencies.""

The resolution has little chance of passing a Republican-controlled House in an election year. Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington announced on social media that she would introduce a Senate version of the resolution next week.

Federal law requires that patients who show up at emergency rooms receive stabilizing treatment for medical emergencies. But since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the national right to an abortion and states enacted strict abortion bans, confusion and conflict have emerged when pregnant women have sought help in emergency rooms in states like Texas, Idaho and Florida.

Women suffering from preterm rupture of membranes or dangerous ectopic pregnancies, for example, have been sent home without treatment or, in the worst cases, left to miscarry in public bathrooms.

The U.S. Supreme Court was given the chance to settle the debate of whether the federal law applies to emergency abortions earlier this year but failed to do so. Instead, the conservative majority court issued a narrow order that temporarily allows doctors in Idaho to perform emergency abortions, despite the state's abortion restrictions, and sent the case back to the lower courts.

Texas, meanwhile, is suing the Biden administration over its guidance around the law that says emergency rooms must perform abortions if a woman's health or life is at risk. The case could also end up before the Supreme Court.

The AP's reports found violations involving pregnant women across the country, including in states like California and Washington which do not have abortion bans. But there was also an immediate spike in the number of complaints involving pregnant women who were denied care in states like Texas after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.

The story of one Black woman who was charged with a felony after miscarrying at home because an Ohio emergency room would not terminate her non-viable pregnancy prompted Rep. Emilia Sykes, D-Ohio, to introduce the resolution Thursday.

""Let me be clear: women should be able to access reproductive health care for when they need it, whenever they need it but especially if they are in a life or death situation."""
Catholic leaders discuss family and fraternity during congress in Ecuador,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/ecuador-eucharistic-congress-family-catholic-leaders-07b6b03c95a47ddd46c175557830697f,2024-09-12T18:40:19Z,"QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- The world is wounded, Catholic leaders said Thursday in Ecuador. But an emphasis on supporting the family could be a path towards healing.

Catholic leaders from more than 50 countries have discussed this and other topics in Quito, the Ecuadoran capital, during this year's International Eucharistic Congress, which will run through Sept. 15.

Thursday's agenda was focused on family and fraternity. Both topics where addressed by Pope Francis in a recorded message that was played during the opening ceremony last Sunday. ""It's an essential condition for a new, fairer world,"" said Francis, who just opened the final leg of his tour through four countries.

""Today it is not possible to save ourselves on our own happy island and isolate,"" said Cardinal Mauro Gambetti, vicar general for the Vatican. ""We need to walk together.""

Rosal√≠a Arteaga, former Ecuadoran vice president who attended the congress, said to The Associated Press that family is a ""corner stone"" for fraternity, ""not from a patriarchal perspective,"" but because good relations between parents and children help in preserving society's values.

In Ecuador -- where 80% of its 17 million people identify as Catholic -- same-sex marriage was legalized in 2019. Abortion was decriminalized in cases of rape in 2022, though activists consider it insufficient and discriminatory, and keep pushing to widen sexual and reproductive rights.

During his remarks Thursday, Monsignor Graziano Borgonovo, appointed by the pope as under-secretary of the Dicastery for Evangelization, said that families, as social institutions, are currently in ""crisis"" due to same-sex marriages and ""other forms of coexistence.""

""The family is the original nucleus,"" Borgonovo said.

A Jesuit priest, Iv√°n Lucero, said that the Catholic Church could look for new ways to support same-sex marriages and non-traditional families.

""The pope has a greater understanding and closeness to these couples, whose number is growing,"" Lucero said. ""But at the same time, we must ensure that the traditional family is not lost or questioned.""

ACLU Michigan commits $2 million in ads focusing on reproductive rights for state Supreme Court race,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/aclu-invests-millions-michigan-supreme-court-abortion-bf2ab13eeeffa59ac99afd8cc721d4b8,2024-09-12T17:28:40Z,"LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan has announced a multimillion-dollar investment into two races for the state Supreme Court, signaling the importance of the competition in the battleground state where control of the court is at stake.

The liberal-championing ACLU Michigan announced Thursday that it's investing about $2 million into the races with seven weeks of statewide radio ads ahead of the November election. Political Director Merissa Kovach said messaging will largely focus on the candidates' records on reproductive rights.

While Michigan voters enshrined abortion rights in the state constitution in 2022 -- firmly cementing the right to abortion -- Democrats and allies have still framed the state Supreme Court race through the lens of reproductive rights, saying the court could rule on the topic in the future.

Michigan's state Supreme Court elections are technically nonpartisan, meaning candidates appear on the ballot without a party designation and straight-ticket voting does not count towards the races. However, candidates are nominated at state party conventions.

The ACLU supports abortion access and its legal enterprise challenges restrictions and bans around the country. While Kovach said the ACLU is not endorsing candidates in the Michigan races, the advertising will certainly benefit Democratic-backed Justice Kyra Harris Holden and law professor Kimberly Ann Thomas.

Bolden and Thomas will face Republican-nominated Judge Patrick O'Grady and state Rep. Andrew Fink, respectively.

The current court is controlled by Democrat-backed justices in a 4-3 majority. The ACLU's ad campaign will also highlight decisions from the court in recent years that the left-leaning organization has applauded, as well as the four candidates' records on other causes such as LGBTQ+ rights and voting access.

""We're going to use our position here as a leading civil rights organization to educate voters on that impact of the Michigan Supreme Court,"" Kovach said.

Kovach said the reservation from the ACLU Voter Education Fund is the first it has invested in the Michigan Supreme Court race. The political action committee is also putting about $300,000 into state House of Representative races.

Michigan Democrats say reproductive rights are still a major voter motivator in the battleground state and the state Supreme Court could interpret the 2022 constitutional amendment in future cases. A lower court judge blocked Michigan's 24-hour waiting period for abortions earlier this summer.

Michigan Republicans, on the other hand, have framed the state Supreme Court elections as a race against government overreach from the Democratic trifecta, saying that the matter of abortion is settled in law with the constitutional amendment. Along with the state Supreme Court, Democrats in Michigan also control the House and Senate and elected a Democratic governor.

The 2022 abortion ballot measure helped drive Michigan Democrats to flip the state blue.

The Michigan Democratic party is also pouring ample resources into the high court races. The Michigan Advance first reported the party is spending more than $1 million in digital advertising and Bolden and Thomas are spending $1.5 million on a TV ad campaign.

According to the most recent campaign finance reports, Bolden and Thomas have outraised their counterparts by hundreds of thousands of dollars thanks in no small part to contributions from political action committees tied to labor unions and Democrat heavyweights like Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.

Scott Greenlee, former vice chair of the Michigan Republican Party and consultant in the races, said because the Democratic-nominated candidates had no challengers at the state convention, they are ahead in fundraising and spending. The Republican-nominated candidates faced opponents at their party convention in August.

""We are in catch-up mode,"" Greenlee said.

State Supreme Court races have taken on new meaning in light of the U.S. Supreme Court's June 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, shifting abortion policy to the states. Millions of dollars were spent in hotly contested races in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania the following year. Supreme Court races in Ohio and Montana are also expected to be heated because of potential rulings on abortion."

(AP) -- A state judge struck down North Dakota's ban on abortion Thursday, saying that the state constitution creates a fundamental right to access abortion before a fetus is viable.

In his ruling, state District Judge Bruce Romanick also said that the law violates the state constitution because it is too vague.

Romanick was ruling on a request from the state to dismiss a lawsuit filed against the ban in 2022 by what at the time was the sole abortion clinic in North Dakota. The clinic has sinced moved across the border to Minnesota, and the state argued that a trial wouldn't make a difference. The judge had canceled a trial set for August."

Harris has her sights set on North Carolina, where she's scheduled to hold rallies in Charlotte and Greensboro on Thursday.

Trump is heading west to Tucson, Arizona, as he looks to stabilize his campaign, which continues to struggle to recalibrate nearly two months after Harris replaced President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket.

Young women are more liberal than they have been in decades, according to a Gallup analysis of more than 20 years of polling data.

Over the past few years, about 4 in 10 young women between the ages of 18 and 29 have described their political views as liberal, compared with two decades ago when about 3 in 10 identified that way.

For many young women, their liberal identity is not just a new label. The share of young women who hold liberal views on the environment, abortion, race relations and gun laws has also jumped by double digits, Gallup found.

Young women ""aren't just identifying as liberal because they like the term or they're more comfortable with the term, or someone they respect uses the term,"" said Lydia Saad, the director of U.S. social research at Gallup. ""They have actually become much more liberal in their actual viewpoints.""

Former Michigan governors and elected officials from both parties are joining a wider effort to combat misinformation and attacks on voting and ballot-counting in several swing states ahead of the fast-approaching presidential election.

The Democracy Defense Project also includes former officials from a number of states where then-President Donald Trump tried to overturn his election loss in 2020, including Georgia. Their goal is to build trust in elections through radio and TV ads, media outreach and local engagement.

""We're going to jointly, wherever necessary, speak out when people try to call into question the integrity or the accuracy of our voting. We believe in our system and we don't appreciate people making up stories that are self-serving,"" former Michigan Gov. James Blanchard told The Associated Press ahead of the formal Thursday launch of the Michigan chapter.

Blanchard, a Democrat who served as governor from 1983 to 1991, is joined on the Michigan team by former Republican Gov. John Engler, former Democratic Lt. Gov. John Cherry and former Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Bishop.

Florida Democrats made bold claims last week about their chances in a state that has steadily grown more conservative in recent years. But so far they have not matched their words with the kind of money it will take to win there.

""Florida is in play,"" proclaimed Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a former representative from Miami, at the start of a bus tour in defense of women's reproductive rights in Boynton Beach. Mucarsel-Powell is the choice of Florida Democrats to challenge incumbent Republican Sen. Rick Scott for one of a handful of Senate seats the GOP is defending this election cycle.

According to data from AdImpact, which tracks spending on advertising by political campaigns and their surrogates, Republicans have outspent Democrats on Florida's U.S. Senate race by roughly a 4-to-1 margin through Sept. 11, $12.7 million to $3.2 million. Based on ad spots currently reserved through the general election, that margin is expected to grow."
"Young women are increasingly likely to identify as liberal, a Gallup analysis finds",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/women-voters-kamala-harris-swift-trump-abortion-76269f01d802ac4c242f8d36494bcd83,2024-09-12T10:31:04Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Young women are more liberal than they have been in decades, according to a Gallup analysis of more than 20 years of polling data.

Over the past few years, about 4 in 10 young women between the ages of 18 and 29 have described their political views as liberal, compared with two decades ago when about 3 in 10 identified that way.

For many young women, their liberal identity is not just a new label. The share of young women who hold liberal views on the environment, abortion, race relations and gun laws has also jumped by double digits, Gallup found.

Young women ""aren't just identifying as liberal because they like the term or they're more comfortable with the term, or someone they respect uses the term,"" said Lydia Saad, the director of U.S. social research at Gallup. ""They have actually become much more liberal in their actual viewpoints.""

Becoming a more cohesive political gtoup with distinctly liberal views could turn young women into a potent political force, according to Saad. While it is hard to pinpoint what is making young women more liberal, they now are overwhelmingly aligned on many issues, which could make it easier for campaigns to motivate them.

Young women are already a constituency that has leaned Democratic -- AP VoteCast data shows that 65% of female voters under 30 voted for Democrat Joe Biden in 2020 -- but they are sometimes less reliable when it comes to turnout.

Young women began to diverge ideologically from other groups, including men between 18 and 29, women over 30 and men over 30, during Democrat Barack Obama's presidency. That trend appears to have accelerated more recently, around the election of Republican Donald Trump, the #MeToo movement and increasingly successful efforts by the anti-abortion movement to erode abortion access. At the same time, more women, mostly Democrats, were elected to Congress, as governor and to state legislatures, giving young women new representation and role models in politics.

The change in young women's political identification is happening across the board, Gallup found, rather than being propelled by a specific subgroup.

Taylor Swift's endorsement Tuesday of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, after her debate against Trump, illustrated one of the issues where young women have moved to the left. In Swift's Instagram announcing the endorsement praised Harris and running mate Tim Walz for championing reproductive rights.

The Gallup analysis found that since the Obama era, young women have become nearly 20 percentage points more likely to support broad abortion rights. There was a roughly similar increase in the share of young women who said protection of the environment should be prioritized over economic growth and in the share of young women who say gun laws should be stricter.

Now, Saad said, solid majorities of young women hold liberal views on issues such as abortion, the environment, and gun laws.

Young women are ""very unified on these issues ... and not only do they hold these views, but they are dissatisfied with the country in these areas, and they are worried about them,"" she said. That, she added, could help drive turnout.

""You've got supermajorities of women holding these views,"" she said, and they are ""primed to be activated to vote on these issues.""

Debate was an 'eye opener' in suburban Philadelphia and Harris got a closer look,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-debate-pennsylvania-voters-a077717b399dbb9322a347d10c6e761b,2024-09-12T04:21:47Z,"BRISTOL, Pa. (AP) -- The presidential debate this week was the final affront to Rosie Torres' lifelong Republicanism. She said her allegiance to Donald Trump, already strained by his stand on abortion, snapped in the former president's ""eye opener"" encounter with Kamala Harris.

It's time to put ""country before party,"" Torres, 60, said Wednesday in Bristol, a riverfront town in suburban Philadelphia. Trump left her frustrated after his appearance recently at Arlington National Cemetery when a member of his staff pushed a cemetery official, she said.

""I still was willing to vote for Donald Trump,"" Torres said. ""But you know, I think that what he did at the cemetery for the veterans -- that was very disrespectful. I feel like our country is being disrespected.""

In Bucks County, a critical area in a vital swing state, the debate is producing a lot of hard thinking about what to do in November. Millions of Americans elsewhere have made up their minds but in purple Pennsylvania, plenty of voting choices are still in play.

In interviews in Bristol and Langhorne, another longtime Republican came away from the debate intrigued but not sold on Harris, a young first-time voter is going for Trump, and a Democrat is still trying to shake the image in his head of people eating pets after Trump's ""moronic"" talking point on that subject Tuesday night.

A closer look at what voters in a key part of the country are thinking after what could be the only presidential debate:

There's Mary Nolan, 70, of Bensalem, a registered Republican for 50 years who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Trump in 2020. She has more thinking to do after a debate in which Harris both impressed and frustrated her.

""I wasn't happy with Biden-Trump,"" she said of the options before President Joe Biden abandoned his reelection campaign. ""I didn't feel we had any good choices. And I'm still not sure we do. We might. But I still want to see more about Kamala Harris.""

She said she and her husband, who's registered as a Democrat, split their party registrations so they could have a say as a family in primary elections. Immigration, the economy (she said she had just paid $6 for a pound of butter) and the infrastructure bill that Biden signed into law were her top issues.

""I like that Kamala Harris does say I am going to be the president for everyone,"" Nolan said. ""I don't think our politicians say that often.""

She figures she'll make her voting decision by the end of October, just days before the election. Meantime, she's aggressive about collecting information.

""I take different opinions from all over. I don't do any blogs. It's simply news. Different interest groups like AARP.""

Her political ideology? ""I think the world is changing fast, and I'm still in my values from 1960,"" Nolan said.

What values?

""Family, home, morals. You know, our kids don't have the upbringing that you did or I did because the streets are different now. I think if someone would say, you know, this is what I'm going to do to improve life in the United States, I definitely would vote for them.""

She said she thought Harris had a good debate, but dodged some things.

""I did not like that she avoided questions. She talked around them when they asked her direct questions about abortion. There was one about abortion. There was another about immigration. And there were a couple that said, hey, you've been here three and a half years, but you haven't done those things that you're saying are so important. Why not? She ran off into her talking points and never gave a direct answer.""

But Harris gave her a good impression. Trump did not.

""I think yesterday, definitely Kamala Harris presented herself very well. She's dignified. ... She would be a good representative of our country.""

Trump? ""I think his policies are good. I just want a more stable, dignified president."" She wants ""someone that doesn't yell and scream and call people names.""

Terry Culleton, 68, of Langhorne, Pennsylvania, is a retired high school English literature teacher and was reading ""Autocracy, Inc."" by Anne Applebaum at a cafe Wednesday morning. His support for labor, then for civil rights and human rights, made him a Democrat.

He thought Harris held her own against Trump and articulated her plans well.

But what really stuck with him was Trump's false comments about immigrants in Ohio eating pets.

""So moronic a thing to say and to repeat that I just can't get it out of my head that somebody would go on national TV and state that,"" he said.

He said he got a sense of history unfolding watching the debate last night.

""I think it's democracy versus something close to totalitarianism. I think it's a matter of supporting democratic governments as opposed to supporting the kind of governments that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is trying to export, which Trump has no problem with, as far as I can tell.""

Kelli Surline of Langhorne was at a caf√© with her fianc√© and young daughter who wore an Eagles kelly green T-shirt. She described herself as politically unengaged until the pinch of higher prices got to her. She didn't watch the debate, in part, because she's made up her mind.

""I'm 28 years old and I've never seen the country this bad ever,"" she said. ""So I made the choice to get my voter's registration, and I'm definitely voting for Trump.""

She talked about how difficult it has been to get ahead.

""We wanted to get a place together,"" Surline said, motioning to Geoffrey Trush, 40, her fianc√©. ""We're not able to do that."" Instead, she's living with her mom. Unaffordable prices make it ""a struggle every week.""

Ron Soto, 86, of Levittown, Pennsylvania, is a longtime Trump supporter and retired tractor-trailer driver and Army veteran who left the Democratic Party in the 1990s for the GOP after coming to realize he disagreed with Bill and Hillary Clinton's positions.

He said he tuned into the debate Tuesday, his hound dog, Sam, by his side, after watching the Phillies game.

Illegal immigration is a major issue for him and Harris didn't win him over.

""The biggest issue is I don't like her, and I don't like Joe Biden.""

Saying he served in the Army from 1955 to 1963, Soto asked: ""What the hell did I stick my neck out for? Why? So you can give it away? The Democrats can open the gates, the floodgates, and tell the whole world. You're welcome. Come on in."" He added: ""These people have ruined this country.""

Christine Desumma, 50, a former Trump voter and the owner of a salon on Bristol's quaint shop-lined street, expressed frustration with both parties and said she won't be voting at all in November. She said her taxes were lower when Trump was in office and recalled the sting of COVID-19 shutdowns.

She got fed up, particularly with social media and Facebook. Online debates, she said, were driving a wedge within her own family, and she's washing her hands of it.

""I just made the decision that I'm not going to vote and I don't want to hear it,"" she said. ""Now I choose to not watch, not pay attention."" She's found another pursuit."
"Abortions are down under Florida's 6-week ban but not by as much as in other states, study says",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-survey-florida-network-pills-0b2c8bb775b70611908bc4d52845c477,2024-09-12T04:17:00Z,"When Florida's ban on abortions after the sixth week of pregnancy began on May 1, the number of abortions didn't drop as much as it has when other states implemented similar policies, a study released Thursday estimates.

The study by the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion access, suggests that Florida clinics, abortion funds and support networks were better prepared than their counterparts in other states to help women get abortions legally by detecting pregnancies earlier and using out-of-state telehealth pill prescriptions.

It's the latest report to underscore that women are still finding ways to end their pregnancies despite two years of bans and restrictions in Republican-controlled states since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended a nationwide right to abortion. Previous studies have found that the number of abortions nationally has risen slightly compared with the period before that ruling.

""An infrastructure of abortion funds and support organizations really has come into play to get patients to services as quickly as they can,"" Guttmacher data scientist Isaac Maddow-Zimet said of the Florida findings.

Using a survey of brick-and-mortar abortion facilities as well as online prescribers, Guttmacher estimates that there were 30% fewer abortions in the state in May than there were on average for the first three months of the year, before an increase in abortions in April ahead of the new ban taking effect. In June, the number was slightly lower, at 35% fewer.

When similar bans kicked elsewhere, the number of monthly abortions fell more dramatically. It dropped by 45% in Georgia after its law took effect in November 2022, by nearly 80% in South Carolina, where it took hold in August 2023, and by about 50% in Texas after its law took effect in September 2021. Texas has since implemented a near-total ban on abortion. Iowa also has a six-week ban, but enforcement began only in July.

The availability of legally prescribed abortion pills in Florida and other states with bans is because some states with Democrats in charge of the governments have passed laws that allow providers to prescribe the pills via telehealth to patients in states with bans. One study found that by March -- before the Florida ban took effect -- the pills prescribed by telehealth providers in those states accounted for about one-tenth of the nation's abortions.

The statutes, known as shield laws, have not yet faced a major test in court.

The Guttmacher survey includes those out-of-state prescriptions, but it doesn't include people who received abortions outside of the formal medical system, such as by obtaining pills without a prescription.

Florida's size and geography make it an important part of the abortion landscape. After Roe fell, strict bans -- many of them barring abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with narrow exceptions -- were implemented in most Republican-led states, including most of those in the South.

Florida had a new ban, too, but it was far more forgiving than most: It prohibited abortion after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy in most cases. Women from nearby states who could not legally obtain an abortion at home often traveled to Florida to get one. In 2023, about 1 in 11 abortions in Florida was for a patient who traveled from out of state, according to state data.

The six-week ban was adopted in 2023, and the state's Supreme Court ruled on April 1 that enforcement could start in one month.

Bans everywhere affect people seeking abortions, but Florida has some added implications.

As the third-most populous state, it has more abortion-seekers than nearly anywhere else. And because of its geography, it is an 11-hour drive from Miami to the closest state that allows abortions later in a pregnancy, North Carolina. Even then, North Carolina has a 72-hour waiting period after a patient makes an in-person appointment before an abortion can proceed, making that an impractical destination for many Florida women, including those who might struggle to get enough time off work or arrange for several days' of child care.

Michelle Quesada, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood of South, East and North Florida, said the group's clinics have been prioritizing getting patients appointments fast, especially if they're close to the six-week cutoff, and cross-trained staff on ultrasounds to provide gestational dating as quickly as possible.

But she said there are still abortion seekers who are turned away. About 600 abortion seekers at the five abortion clinics in her group have gone to other states with the help of Planned Parenthood navigators. And she said that about 50 patients a week choose to self-navigate, possibly continuing a pregnancy they don't want or obtaining an abortion outside a clinic.

She said one impact may be that some patients rush to have abortions that they may not have had with more time to think through their pregnancy options.

""Now you have patients coming to us at five weeks, five days,"" she said, ""and they literally have 24 hours to decide.""

Kelly Flynn, president and CEO of A Women's Choice, which has abortion clinics in Florida, North Carolina and Virginia, said the number of abortions at her Jacksonville, Florida, clinic has dropped by at least half since the ban took effect -- though those patients are often seen by the organization's other clinics.

""This ban has been devastating and cruel for patients who have desperately needed access to safe abortion care,"" she said. And Flynn said the abortion funds that help with travel logistics and funding are finding that they're not as flush with donations as they were after Roe was overturned.

Florida is one of nine states where voters in November will decide whether to add the right to abortion to their state constitution. In Florida, the proposed amendment would require 60% support to pass."
Harris and Trump are jockeying for battleground states after their debate faceoff,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-north-carolina-arizona-election-34bca16175c387a076131ad69bc18d47,2024-09-12T04:14:24Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are making a beeline for swing states that they hope to flip in their favor this year, both of them trying to expand their narrow paths to victory in a closely fought presidential campaign.

Harris has her sights set on North Carolina, where she's scheduled to hold rallies in Charlotte and Greensboro on Thursday, her first political event after she buoyed supporters with her commanding performance in Tuesday's debate.

Trump is heading west to Tucson, Arizona, as he looks to stabilize his campaign, which continues to struggle to recalibrate nearly two months after Harris replaced President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. Although Harris' team said she's willing to do another debate, the Republican candidate has waffled.

""Are we going to do a rematch?"" Trump said Wednesday. ""I just don't know.""

The candidates are barnstorming one day after they marked the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, a somber occasion that provided little respite from partisan politics in a high-speed campaign season.

At a fire station in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, close to where United Airlines Flight 93 crashed after passengers fought back against their hijackers, Trump posed for photos with children who wore campaign shirts. One of the shirts proclaimed former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Biden and Harris were ""dumb and dumber and dumbest.""

Biden and Harris visited the same fire station earlier in the day. Someone there offered Biden a red-white-and-blue baseball hat that said ""Trump 2024,"" and suggested the president put it on to demonstrate his commitment to bipartisan unity. Biden briefly put it on and flashed a wide grin.

Only a handful of battleground states will decide the outcome of the election.

Democrats haven't won North Carolina's electoral votes since 2008, when President Barack Obama was elected for the first time. However, Trump's 2020 margin of victory of 1.3 percentage points was his narrowest win of any state that year, and Democrats hope that North Carolina's growing and diversifying population will give them an edge this time.

Harris's campaign said Thursday's trip will be her ninth to the state this year, and recent polls show a tight race. More than two dozen combined campaign offices -- supporting Harris and the rest of the party's candidates -- have been opened, and popular Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper is one of her top surrogates.

Republicans have been confident about Trump's chances in the state, and the former president held rallies there in August.

Registered independents -- known in North Carolina as unaffiliated -- are the state's largest voting bloc and are usually key to determining outcomes in statewide elections. A state Supreme Court ruling this week affirming that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. must be removed from North Carolina ballots could bring additional votes Trump's way given Kennedy's endorsement.

The state's Republican Party has dismissed concerns that a poor showing by its gubernatorial nominee, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, could harm the electoral chances of other party candidates, including Trump.

Democratic nominee Josh Stein and his allies have hammered Robinson for months on the airwaves and social media for his past harsh comments on abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. Stein, the state attorney general, had a lead over Robinson in several recent polls of North Carolina voters.

Arizona is another state where the presidential race could be shaped, at least in part, by down-ballot races. Kari Lake, a prominent Republican election denier who lost her campaign for governor in 2020, is running for the U.S. Senate seat that's being vacated by Kyrsten Sinema.

Lake exemplifies the rightward shift of the state party in the Trump era. She's opposed by Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, who was leading in several recent polls, although the race was close in another.

Republicans have won Arizona in nearly every presidential election since World War II, but Biden eked out a narrow victory in 2020.

The rise of Arizona Democrats has been driven by the arrival of transplants from blue states and a political realignment that has seen suburban voters -- particularly college-educated women -- shift away from Republicans.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris' running mate, held a rally in the state on Tuesday ahead of the debate, and the Democratic ticket campaigned together there last month.

Republicans still outnumber Democrats in Arizona, but a third of voters are independent. Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump's running mate, appeared last week in a heavily Republican area of metro Phoenix with Charlie Kirk, the founder of an influential conservative youth group.

Trump was last in Arizona two weeks ago for a news conference along the U.S.-Mexico border, where he drove one of his most effective attacks on Harris over the number of people crossing the border to seek asylum, followed by a rally at a former hockey arena in the Phoenix area.

Scott Walker's campaign baffles Wisconsin voters who mistake him for more famous namesake,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/scott-walker-republican-wisconsin-legislature-democrat-a256cce96d77155eb2f02ae3ec0e55fc,2024-09-12T04:13:49Z,"PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- Scott Walker loves unions, thinks women should have the right to an abortion and wants to expand health care coverage.

If you're confused, get in line.

This Scott Walker isn't the former Wisconsin governor whose battles with teachers and other public unions made him one of the most polarizing political figures in the battleground state's recent history. That was Scott Kevin Walker. This is Scott Abbot Walker, a Democratic country doctor running for the state Legislature.

""Sometimes you get people who are openly hostile,"" Walker said of voter reactions when he introduces himself. ""Sometimes they're closing the door as I say my name because they're unhappy.""

Walker is running against 14-year Republican incumbent Travis Tranel in the 49th Assembly District, which covers a swath of rolling farm country across Grant and Crawford counties in Wisconsin's far southwestern corner. The district's largest municipality is Platteville, a city of about 11,000 people whose biggest claim to fame is a small state university.

Walker goes into November as a distinct underdog in the decidedly red district. Former President Donald Trump won it in both 2016 and 2020 and Tranel has held the Assembly seat since 2011.

Grant County Democratic Party Chair Joyce Bos and Walker the candidate discussed how to approach the name thing when he got into the race. They briefly considered branding him ""Dr. Scott"" or ""Dr. Walker"" but ultimately decided to let it ride. Walker does wear a button letting people know he's ""the other Scott Walker,"" though.

""It's the elephant in the room,"" Scott Abbot Walker said of his name. ""But going door-to-door, it's an advantage. I never have to say my name twice.""

Tranel downplayed his opponent's famous moniker, saying voters are more concerned about inflation. He said people should be worried about Walker's ""socialist polices"" and criminal background.

Walker the candidate was fined $700 in 2018 after he was charged with pointing a shotgun at his housekeeper. According to court documents, the housekeeper hadn't been paid and showed up at Walker's house demanding property as compensation. Walker pointed the gun at her when she refused to leave.

He told The Associated Press that he was depressed at the time and going through bankruptcy. He said he didn't have a phone to call the police when the woman refused to leave, so he pointed his shotgun at her car tire. He insisted he never pointed the gun at her.

The differences between the two Walkers couldn't be starker.

The former governor is 56 years old with dark hair, doesn't have a college degree and currently serves as president of Young America's Foundation, an organization that supports young conservatives. As governor, he stripped public unions of their bargaining rights in early 2011, prompting weeks of protests at the state Capitol and an unsuccessful recall attempt. Democrat Tony Evers eventually defeated him in 2018.

Asked through a spokesman for comment on the candidate Walker sharing his name name, the former governor responded with a statement saying Tranel ""is the real deal"" and he is proud to support him. He did not comment on Walker the candidate.

Walker the candidate is 66, tall, with silver-white hair. He holds a medical degree from Case Western Reserve University and runs a clinic for the underinsured in the 49th. He supports unions and has Planned Parenthood's endorsement.

So far, at least, voters have greeted Walker's candidacy with a mixture of amusement and puzzlement.

Democrats who stopped to pick up Walker yard signs at the Grant County Democratic Party headquarters in Platteville jokingly suggested the candidate should change his name. ""Go with Scotty or something,"" 71-year-old Denny Fuseth of Lancaster told him, eliciting chuckles from the candidate.

Fuseth said he was confused when a friend told him that Scott Walker was running.

""Why would we go back?"" Fuseth said. ""We got rid of him once.""

Ron Johnsen, 64, at first didn't seem to grasp which Walker was on his porch when the candidate knocked on his door to hand him a flyer. Johnsen, a retired University of Wisconsin-Platteville maintenance worker, informed Walker that he wasn't happy about losing his union rights and had signed the recall petition.

""I looked at him, and he don't look like the (Scott Walker) I remember,"" Johnsen said."
Trump wouldn't say whether he'd veto a national ban even as abortion remains a top election issue,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-trump-harris-contraception-debate-vance-2f11a66ab4619fcb3d9917ee51a9c060,2024-09-11T23:21:45Z,"CHICAGO (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump repeatedly declined to say during this week's debate if he would veto a national abortion ban if he were elected again -- a question that has lingered as the Republican nominee has shifted his stances on the crucial election issue.

In Tuesday's debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump said he would not sign a federal abortion ban, insisting that a ban would not pass Congress anyway. But he refused twice to say if he would veto such legislation if it landed on his desk. Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance, a Republican from Ohio, said in an interview with NBC News last month that the former president would veto a ban.

In response to moderators prompting him about Vance's statement, Trump said: ""I didn't discuss it with JD, in all fairness. And I don't mind if he has a certain view, but I don't think he was speaking for me.""

The exchange comes as voters and advocates across the spectrum wait for Trump to clarify his fluctuating stances on abortion, and Democrats warn that reproductive rights nationwide may be threatened by a second Trump presidency. Meanwhile, Harris emphasized support for reinstating a federal right to abortion Tuesday night.

""He was given an opportunity to give clarity to the American people. He could not do it,"" said Mini Timmaraju, president of the national abortion rights group Reproductive Freedom for All. ""He will not answer that question directly.""

During the debate, Trump repeatedly took credit for appointing the three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the constitutional right to abortion and leaned heavily on his catchall response to questions on abortion rights: saying the issue should be left up to the states.

""I'm not signing a ban,"" he said, adding that ""there is no reason to sign the ban"" because of the overturning of Roe v. Wade, which once granted a federal right to abortion.

He repeated that he is ""not in favor of an abortion ban, but it doesn't matter, because this issue has now been taken over by the states.""

""This entire campaign cycle we've been telling voters they can't trust Donald Trump when it comes to their reproductive freedom,"" said Jenny Lawson, executive director at Planned Parenthood Votes. ""And he just proved that right last night.""

Following the debate, Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, said she wasn't surprised Trump didn't say he would support a national abortion ban because he has said in the past that there should not be one.

She said her group hasn't been focusing on a national ban ""because it's not going to happen. The votes aren't there in Congress. You know, President Trump said he wouldn't sign it. We know Kamala Harris won't.""

Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, said the anti-abortion movement largely disagrees with Trump that abortion should be left up to the states, and in an April open letter to Trump, Students for Life of America urged him to commit to signing legislation restricting abortion. But Hawkins said, ""That's a conversation that will be had in detail after the election.""

Trump's states-based narrative is among his attempts to appear more moderate on abortion rights, which remain broadly popular and have emerged as among the GOP's greatest vulnerabilities heading into November.

Timmaraju said she believes Trump is only voicing opposition to a national ban now due to political pressure and a desire to win votes in November.

""Trusting him to be moderate in his position while in office is out of touch with reality,"" she said.

Around 6 in 10 Americans think their state should generally allow a person to obtain a legal abortion if they don't want to be pregnant for any reason, according to a July poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Voters in seven states, including conservative ones such as Kentucky, Montana and Ohio, have either protected abortion rights or defeated attempts to restrict them in statewide votes over the past two years.

Trump's shifting abortion policy stances began when the former reality TV star and developer, who had once called himself ""very pro-choice"" started flirting with running for office.

Before becoming president, Trump has said he ""would indeed support a ban"" in his book ""The America We Deserve,"" which was published in 2000. In 2016, he said he was ""pro-life with exceptions"" but said ""there has to be some form of punishment"" for women seeking abortions -- a position he quickly reversed. At the 2018 annual March for Life, Trump voiced support for a federal ban on abortion on or after 20 weeks of pregnancy.

More recently, Trump suggested in March that he might support a national ban on abortions around 15 weeks before announcing that he instead would leave it to the states.

In an April interview with Time magazine, Trump also said it should be left to the states whether to prosecute women for abortions or whether to monitor women's pregnancies and declined to comment on access to the abortion pill mifepristone, which was embroiled in an intense legal battle. When asked about mifepristone, he claimed only that he has ""pretty strong views"" on the matter and vowed to make a statement that has never come.

In May, he said he was open to regulations on contraception before backing away from the statement, claiming his comments were misinterpreted.

Trump also has appeared to reverse course on Florida's six-week abortion ban, which he has previously called a ""mistake"" and too extreme. Last month, he ultimately said he would vote against a state ballot measure attempting to repeal the law and enshrine abortion rights into the state constitution, a day after he seemed to indicate he would vote in favor of the measure. He told reporters the initiative is from ""radical"" Democrats and falsely claimed it would allow abortions up until birth.

More than 67 million people watched Donald Trump and Kamala Harris debate. That's way up from June,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-abc-ratings-aeafb814b675cc14edcf5a0441677ec8,2024-09-11T22:56:37Z,"An estimated 67.1 million people watched the presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, a sharp increase from the June debate that eventually led to President Joe Biden dropping out of the race.

The debate was run by ABC News but shown on 17 different networks, the Nielsen company said. The Trump-Biden debate in June was seen by 51.3 million people.

Tuesday's count was short of the record viewership for a presidential debate, when 84 million people saw Trump's and Hillary Clinton's first faceoff in 2016. The first debate between Biden and Trump in 2020 reached 73.1 million people.

With Harris widely perceived to have outperformed Trump on Tuesday night, the former president and his supporters are sharply criticizing ABC moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis. The journalists waded into on-the-fly fact checks during the debate, correcting four statements by Trump.

No other debates are currently scheduled between the two presidential candidates, although there's been some talk about it and Fox News Channel has publicly offered alternatives. CBS will host a vice presidential debate between Tim Walz and JD Vance.

Tuesday's debate stakes were high to begin with, not only because of the impending election itself but because the last presidential debate uncorked a series of events that ended several weeks later with Biden's withdrawal from the race after his performance was widely panned.

Opinions on how ABC handled the latest debate Tuesday were, in a large sense, a Rorschach test on how supporters of both sides felt about how it went. MSNBC commentator Chris Hayes sent a message on X that the ABC moderators were doing an ""excellent"" job -- only to be answered by conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, who said, ""this is how you know they're complete s -- -.""

While CNN chose not to correct any misstatements by the candidates during Trump's debate with Biden in June, ABC instead challenged statements that Trump made about abortion, immigration, the 2020 election and violent crime.

Southern Baptist trustees back agency president but warn against needless controversy,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/southern-baptist-convention-agency-leadership-controversy-267b65b1f49b83716513ca87b93f222a,2024-09-11T21:02:01Z,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Less than two months after the Southern Baptists' policy arm issued an embarrassing retraction of an announcement of its leader's firing, it gave him a strong vote of confidence this week -- but with a caution against stirring unnecessary controversy.

Trustees for the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission affirmed both their president, Brent Leatherwood, and the direction of the organization, which has long been on the vanguard of the religious right in voicing the conservative views of the nation's largest Protestant denomination.

""We strongly affirm the ERLC under the leadership of Brent Leatherwood,"" said incoming chair Scott Foshie. ""The world and Southern Baptists need to hear that.""

His words echoed a formal statement issued by the trustees Wednesday after a lengthy closed-door session Tuesday. The statement acknowledged that, while the commission speaks out on numerous contentious issues where controversy is inevitable, that's all the more reason not to stir up more controversy on nonessential issues.

Trustees acknowledged that support for the organization is wavering among individual churches, who fund almost all its budget. They supported the commission's plan, already in the works, to create a new office to work more closely with pastors to help them better understand and guide the agency's work.

""In a time of deep division in our culture, from polarization in our political environment, to falling trust in institutions, to the fracturing of families, the ERLC is needed now as much as ever both to serve in the public square,"" the statement said.

But it urged the commission to be careful.

It said the staff needs to follow a companion set of guidelines, also issued Wednesday, which says the commission needs to base its public stances on the Bible as well as on the official faith statement and other resolutions approved by Southern Baptists at annual meetings in recent decades. The guidelines state that if advocacy on a particular issue is likely to ""upset certain segments of the SBC,"" the staff needs to evaluate the issue carefully -- but may still speak out if it's deemed essential.

The commission has staked out staunchly conservative stances on religious and political issues, with strong opposition to abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. Still, it has drawn the criticism of a vocal segment of the convention that wants to move the denomination even further to the right and sees it as drifting leftward.

Leatherwood has resisted calls to support the criminalization of women seeking abortion. He's been criticized for supporting U.S. aid for Ukraine's military defense and for supporting a Tennessee bill that would prevent access to firearms for people deemed a threat to others or themselves -- an issue that is personal to Leatherwood after his children's school was targeted in a deadly 2023 shooting.

Then in July, criticism erupted after Leatherwood issued a statement commending President Joe Biden for the ""selfless act"" of withdrawing from the presidential race after a dismal debate performance. Numerous voices in the Southern Baptist Convention, where overwhelmingly pro-Republican views prevail, denounced the statement, saying Biden acted not out of selflessness but out of political necessity.

Within a day, the commission's chairman, Kevin Smith, moved to oust Leatherwood, and the agency issued a statement saying he had been removed. But after it emerged that Smith acted without a vote of the board's executive committee, as required by bylaws, Smith resigned and the agency retracted its announcement.

Two members of the executive committee declined to comment on the episode in interviews, deferring to the agency's strong statements in support of Leatherwood.

Even before that episode, Leatherwood recognized the problem of wavering support for the commission. At the Southern Baptists' annual meeting in Indianapolis in June, church representatives voted down a proposal to abolish the commission entirely -- but with a notable minority of voters supporting its abolition.

Those results ""weren't just disappointing, they were unacceptable,"" Leatherwood said in an official address to the commission Tuesday.

""I say that not to the outrage artists and the grievance grifters who will never be on our side, who spin up political attack committees to come and throw bombs at us,"" he said. ""No, I'm talking to the local pastor and the everyday church member who just need to better understand our mission and the work that we do, and know that our work represents real Baptist leadership.""

He said the agency has already been taking such steps, surveying pastors and issuing lengthy guidebooks on issues they said were priorities, including election polarization and gender issues. It also issued a state-by-state guide to various abortion-related measures on November ballots.

""Our culture is not well right now,"" Leatherwood said. Partisanship has been overwhelming ""so many Christians,"" he said. ""Mistruths and conspiracy theories, they are everywhere right now.""

He urged Baptists to respond with gentleness and reason to such partisanship.

""The anxiety that people are feeling is real, but we help them understand it's not supposed to be this way,"" he said.

Indiana judge rules against abortion providers fighting near-total ban,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/indiana-abortion-ban-planned-parenthood-lawsuit-ruling-1780230981a25d078036cb496e323b55,2024-09-11T17:35:11Z,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- An Indiana county judge ruled Wednesday against abortion providers who are seeking to broaden access to the procedure under the near-total ban state lawmakers passed after the U.S. Supreme Court ended federal protections in 2022.

The providers -- including the regional Planned Parenthood affiliate -- had sought a permanent injunction to expand the near-total ban's medical exemptions and to block its requirement that abortions can only be performed at hospitals.

Judge Kelsey Blake Hanlon, who conducted a three-day bench trial in late May in southern Indiana's Monroe County, denied the providers' request for the permanent injunction against both elements of the state's law, known as S.B. 1.

""Significant and compelling evidence regarding the policy implications of S.B. 1 and its effect on medical professionals in particular was presented. However, the Court cannot substitute its own policy preferences for that of the Indiana General Assembly,"" Hanlon wrote.

The providers are likely to appeal the ruling by Hanlon, an elected Republican from a different county who was appointed as a special judge in the case.

Indiana became the first state to enact tighter restrictions after the U.S. Supreme Court ended federal abortion protections by overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022. Rare exceptions to the near-total ban include when the health or life of the mother is at risk as well as in cases of rape, incest and lethal fetal anomalies in limited circumstances.

The Indiana Supreme Court upheld the state's ban in June 2023, ending a broader legal challenge brought by the same plaintiffs, but said the state's constitution protects a women's right to an abortion when her life or health is at risk.

Indiana's clinics stopped providing abortions ahead of the ban officially taking effect in August 2023.

The providers said that the ban's exceptions for protecting health are written so narrowly that in practice, many doctors won't end a pregnancy even when a woman's condition qualifies under the statute. The state defended the statute and said it sufficiently protects women when health complications arise in pregnancy.

Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita praised the judge's ruling Wednesday. ""Indiana's pro-life law is both reasonable and constitutional, and we're pleased the Monroe County Circuit Court upheld it,"" he said in a statement.

Planned Parenthood and the ACLU of Indiana did not immediately respond Wednesday to requests for comment on the ruling.

In a 50-page order, Hanlon said providers gave hypothetical scenarios but did not identify a situation where the health and life exemption or the hospital requirement prevented a woman from obtaining an abortion.

Hanlon agreed with the state's argument that the health and life exemption constitutionally protects pregnant patients with ""serious health risks,"" but acknowledged the ill-defined standard has been challenging for physicians in a ""politically charged environment"" and under the threat of criminal liability. However, Hanlon said physicians do not have to wait until a woman is ""clinically unstable to provide care.""

She wrote that some conditions outlined by the providers can be treated with interventions other than abortion depending on the severity of the health risk, such as medication, therapy and nutritional changes. She also rejected the argument from the providers that mental health conditions constitute serious health risks.

In rejecting the providers' request to strike the hospital requirement, Hanlon said hospitals are better equipped to handle lethal fetal anomaly, rape, incest and serious health risks.

""The evidence demonstrates that many women receiving abortion care when they are seriously ill or at risk of becoming seriously ill will likely be receiving in-hospital care irrespective of the hospital requirement,"" she wrote."
Tube-tying rose most steeply in states that ban abortion after Roe was overturned,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-tubal-ligations-tying-tubes-dobbs-roe-jama-2ec56d7f2707db083e513bdc74a5016d,2024-09-11T15:12:19Z,"More women chose to have their tubes tied after Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, a new study shows, and the biggest increases were in states that ban abortion.

A research letter published Wednesday in JAMA examined insurance claims data from 2021 and 2022 for around 4.8 million women who got tubal ligations, which are surgeries to close the fallopian tubes so the patient can no longer get pregnant. The data came from 36 states and Washington, D.C., and researchers categorized these places as ""banned,"" ""limited"" or ""protected,"" based on their abortion policies.

In the 18 months before the Dobbs decision in late June 2022, tubal ligations remained stable in all three groups of states. But in the latter half of 2022, the procedure rose in all three groups. Researchers also looked at sustained change in the numbers over time, finding that tubal ligations rose by 3% each month in banned states.

It's ""not entirely surprising"" given the changes to abortion laws, said Xiao Xu, lead author of the research letter and associate professor of reproductive sciences at Columbia University's Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons.

The research letter adds to other findings about a rise in sterilization procedures after Roe was overturned, including a study from researchers published in April in JAMA Health Forum that found an abrupt increase in tubal ligations among women 18-30 years old and vasectomies among men in that age group.

""It looks like the data they used were able to break things down by state, which is nice and something we were unable to do with the data we used,"" said Jacqueline Ellison, an author of the April study who works at the University of Pittsburgh's School of Public Health.

Dr. Clayton Alfonso recalled seeing a rise in tubal ligations in his OB-GYN practice at Duke University in North Carolina, ""especially closer to the Dobbs decision.""

Patients who didn't want more -- or any -- children were worried about contraceptives failing and becoming pregnant unexpectedly, said Alfonso, who wasn't involved in either study. Patients told him they would rather be sterilized in case they weren't able to get an abortion.

North Carolina banned most abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy in 2023. Alfonso said the the number of patients seeking tubal ligations has fallen a bit, which he suspects happened when people became more certain about local laws.

He also said he'd like to see research on what happens past 2022, given the ""ever-evolving landscape."" Xu said her team is interested in doing such a study when the data becomes available.

The Latest: Harris-Trump debate sets up sprint to election day as first ballots go out in Alabama,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-debate-election-9683d23dc4d0ec143f70dc64870be8c3,2024-09-11T12:45:24Z,"Kamala Harris pressed a forceful case against Donald Trump on Tuesday in their first and perhaps only debate before the presidential election, repeatedly goading him in an event that showcased their starkly different visions for the country on abortion, immigration and American democracy.

Less than two months from Election Day and hours before the first early ballots will begin to be mailed Wednesday in Alabama, the debate offered the clearest look yet at a presidential race that has been repeatedly upended.

When President Joe Biden gave bumbling remarks about abortion on the debate stage this summer, it was widely viewed as a missed opportunity -- a failure, even -- on a powerful and motivating issue for Democrats at the ballot box.

The difference was stark, then, on Tuesday night, when Vice President Kamala Harris gave a forceful defense of abortion rights during her presidential debate with Republican Donald Trump.

Harris conveyed the dire medical situations women have found themselves in since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the national right to abortion in 2022. Harris quickly placed blamed directly on Trump, who recalibrated the Supreme Court to the conservative majority that issued the landmark ruling during his term.

Women, Harris told the national audience, have been denied care as a result.

""You want to talk about this is what people wanted? Pregnant women who want to carry a pregnancy to term, suffering from a miscarriage, being denied care in an emergency room because health care providers are afraid they might go to jail and she's bleeding out in a car in the parking lot?"" Harris said.

The moment was a reminder that Harris is uniquely positioned to talk about the hot-button, national topic in a way that Biden, an 81-year-old Catholic who had long opposed abortion, never felt comfortable doing.

Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday amplified false rumors that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were abducting and eating pets, repeating during a televised debate the type of inflammatory and anti-immigrant rhetoric he has promoted throughout his campaigns.

There is no evidence that Haitian immigrants in an Ohio community are doing that, officials say. But during the debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump specifically mentioned Springfield, Ohio, the town at the center of the claims, saying that immigrants were taking over the city.

""They're eating the dogs. They're eating the cats. They're eating the pets of the people that live there,"" he said.

Harris called Trump ""extreme"" and laughed after his comment. Debate moderators pointed out that city officials have said the claims are not true.

Trump's comments echoed claims made by his campaign, including his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, and other Republicans. The claims attracted attention this week when Vance posted on social media that his office has ""received many inquiries"" about Haitian migrants abducting pets. Vance acknowledged Tuesday it was possible ""all of these rumors will turn out to be false.""

Officials have said there have been no credible or detailed reports about the claims, even as Trump and his allies use them to amplify racist stereotypes about Black and brown immigrants.

Taylor Swift, one of the music industry's biggest stars, endorsed Kamala Harris for president shortly after the debate ended on Tuesday night.

""I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos,"" Swift wrote in an Instagram post, which included a link to a voter registration website.

Swift has a dedicated following among young women, a key demographic in the November election, and her latest tour has generated more than $1 billion in ticket sales. In a half hour, the post received more than 2.3 million likes.

She included a picture of herself holding her cat Benjamin Button, and she signed the message ""Childless Cat Lady."" The remark is a reference to three-year-old comments made by JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate, about women without children not having an equal stake in the country's future."
"As Trump and Harris spar, ABC's moderators grapple with conducting a debate in a polarized country",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-abc-muir-debate-80459d35f25c8fd3207c558bdb7e2339,2024-09-11T05:05:42Z,"The ABC News moderators were great. No, actually they were a ""disgraceful failure,"" They cut off Kamala Harris too much. No, actually they corrected Donald Trump unfairly.

Such is the contentious tenor of the times in 2024's campaign season. And so it went Tuesday night at Trump's and Harris' first -- and quite possibly only -- debate.

In an illustration of how difficult it is to conduct a presidential debate in a polarized country, ABC News moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis fact-checked and corrected Trump four times Tuesday and were attacked angrily by the former president and his supporters.

Trump, shortly after he left the stage in Philadelphia, sent out a message on his social media platform: ""I thought that was my best debate, EVER, especially since it was THREE ON ONE!""

Muir and Davis moderated what is expected to be the only debate between the former president and the sitting vice president. They asked about economic policy, the war in Ukraine, abortion, the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol insurrection and changes in Harris' stances since her 2020 presidential run.

In the end, Trump logged 43 minutes, 3 seconds of time talking, while Harris had 37:41, according to a count by The New York Times.

The debate's stakes were high to begin with -- not only because of the impending election itself but because the last presidential debate in June -- between Trump and sitting President Joe Biden, whose performance was roundly panned -- uncorked a series of events that ended several weeks later with Biden's withdrawal from the race and Harris stepping in.

Opinions on how ABC handled the latest debate Tuesday were, in a large sense, a Rorschach test on how supporters of both sides felt about how it went. MSNBC commentator Chris Hayes sent a message on X that the ABC moderators were doing an ""excellent"" job -- only to be answered by conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, who said, ""this is how you know they're complete s -- -.""

While CNN chose not to correct any misstatements by the candidates during Trump's debate with Biden in June, ABC instead challenged statements that Trump made about abortion, immigration, the 2020 election and violent crime.

During a discussion of abortion, Trump made his oft-repeated claim that Democrats supported killing babies after they were born. Said Davis: ""There is no state in the country where it is legal to kill a baby after it was born.""

Muir pointed out that Trump, after years of publicly not admitting to his defeat to Biden in the 2020 election, had recently on three separate occasions conceded he had lost. Trump replied that he had been sarcastic in making those recent statements.

""I didn't detect the sarcasm,"" Muir said.

After suggesting that crime had gone up during the Biden administration, Muir pointed out that violent crime had gone down during that period, prompting an argument with the former president. ABC also noted, after Trump had repeated a debunked report that immigrants were killing and eating pets in Ohio, that there had been no evidence that had happened.

ABC moderators did not correct any statements made by Harris.

""Could they have done more? Yes,"" said Angie Drodnic Holan, director of the international fact-checking network at the Poynter Institute, said in an interview. ""Did they do enough? I would say yes. The alternative was none.""

Toward the end of the debate, CNN fact checker Daniel Dale said on social media that ""Trump has been staggeringly dishonest and Harris has been overwhelmingly (though not entirely) factual.""

As is often the case in debates, the moderators often saw specific questions go unanswered. Harris, for example, was asked to address Trump's criticism that the U.S. Justice Department has been weaponized against him. She did not. She also skirted questions about changes to some of her past positions on issues. Muir twice asked Trump whether he wanted Ukraine to win its war against Russia, and he didn't answer.

The split screen views of both candidates onscreen told different stories. Trump often looked angry or smiled at some of Harris' statements, while avoiding eye contact with his opponent. Harris looked over at her opponents several times, often in bemusement, sometimes in open amusement, sometimes shaking her head.

Online anger toward how ABC handled the evening began while the debate was ongoing, and quickly became a talking point.

""These moderators are a disgraceful failure, and this is one of the most biased, unfair debates I have ever seen,"" conservative commentator Megyn Kelly posted on X. ""Shame on ABC.""

Answering online critics who complained ABC stacked the deck in Harris' favor, Atlantic writer James Surowiecki wrote that ""the way they 'rigged' the debate is by letting (Trump) hang himself with his own stream of consciousness rambles.""

""It was like a 4Chan post come to life,"" CNN's Jake Tapper said.

On Fox News Channel, anchor Martha MacCallum said after the debate that Harris ""was never really held to the fire."" Commentator Brit Hume agreed with her, but said something else was at play.

""Make no mistake about it,"" Hume said. ""Trump had a bad night.""

Kamala Harris gives abortion rights advocates the debate answer they've longed for in Philadelphia,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-debate-kamala-harris-donald-trump-35078cdb5bb939eec323c7aa56434cad,2024-09-11T04:28:02Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- When President Joe Biden gave bumbling remarks about abortion on the debate stage this summer, it was widely viewed as a missed opportunity -- a failure, even -- on a powerful and motivating issue for Democrats at the ballot box.

The difference was stark, then, on Tuesday night, when Vice President Kamala Harris gave a forceful defense of abortion rights during her presidential debate with Republican Donald Trump.

Harris said.

The moment was a reminder that Harris is uniquely positioned to talk about the hot-button, national topic in a way that Biden, an 81-year-old Catholic who had long opposed abortion, never felt comfortable doing.

Harris has been the White House's public face for efforts to improve maternal health and ensure some abortion access, despite the Supreme Court ruling. Earlier this year, she became the highest-ranking U.S. official to make a public visit to an abortion clinic.

Dr. Daniel Grossman, a University of California, San Francisco OB-GYN, said he was glad to see Harris highlight the challenges people face in states with abortion bans. ""People who have been unable to get abortion care where they live, who have to travel, people who have suffered obstetric complications and are unable to get the care they need because of the abortion bans,"" Grossman said.

Harris still hedged, however, on providing details about what type of restrictions - if any - she supports around abortion. Instead, she pivoted: saying that she wants to ""reinstate the protections of Roe,"" which prohibited states from banning abortions before fetal viability, generally considered around 20 weeks.

Trump, meanwhile, danced around questions about his intentions to further restrict abortion. He would not say whether he would sign a national abortion ban as president.

Anti-abortion advocates say they don't believe Trump would sign a ban if it landed on his desk.

Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, said her group hasn't been focusing on a national ban ""because it's not going to happen. The votes aren't there in Congress. You know, President Trump said he wouldn't sign it. We know Kamala Harris won't.""

Trump also falsely claimed that some Democrats want to ""execute the baby"" after birth in the ninth month of pregnancy."
Candidates spar on economy and abortion as Harris takes on Trump in a way Biden could not,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/debate-president-trump-harris-takeaways-b648ff0b9baf10d4625548e815d7cfe3,2024-09-11T02:39:49Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Donald Trump and Kamala Harris faced each other on the debate stage Tuesday night for the first and possibly the last time.

Harris, the Democratic vice president who is a former courtroom prosecutor, was eager to prosecute Trump's glaring liabilities. But she also was tasked with re-reintroducing herself to voters, who are still getting to know her as the party's presidential nominee.

Trump, a Republican now in his third presidential election, was set on painting Harris as an out-of-touch liberal. He also tried to win over skeptical suburban voters -- many of them women -- turned off by Trump's brash leadership style and his penchant for personal insults.

The 90-minute debate played out inside Philadelphia's National Constitutional Center. In accordance with rules negotiated by both campaigns, there was no live audience and the candidates' microphones were muted when it was not their turn to speak.

Some takeaways on a historic night:

The vice president walked across the stage and introduced herself, ""Kamala Harris,"" before reaching out and grabbing Trump's hand in the opening moments.

In her first answer, Harris said Trump's trade tariffs would effectively create a sales tax on the middle class. She soon accused Trump of presiding over the worst attack on American democracy since the Civil War -- the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. And she charged the former president with telling women what they could do with their bodies.

But Harris may have got under Trump's skin the most when she went after his performance at his rallies, noting that many people often leave early.

Trump was largely calm when he defended himself against each charge, but he showed annoyance with her comment about his rallies. He insisted his events were larger than hers and he seemed to grow angrier at times as the debate continued.

Harris frequently shifted her message from Trump back to the American people.

""You will not hear him talk about your needs, your dreams and your needs and your desires,"" Harris said of Trump's rallies. ""And I'll tell you, I believe you deserve a president who actually puts you first.""

The debate opened with an unexpectedly wonky exchange on the economy: Harris took on Trump for his plan to put in place sweeping tariffs and for the trade deficit he ran as president; Trump slammed Harris for inflation that he incorrectly said was the worst in the country's history.

The exchange ended up with some of Trump's traditional bombast. He said Harris was a ""Marxist"" even though she had just cited positive reviews of her economic plans from Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs and the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. But it was particularly notable for Harris' effort to turn the tables on Trump.

Trump noted that people look back on his presidency's economy fondly. ""I created one of the greatest economies in the history of our country,"" he said. Harris flatly told viewers: ""Donald Trump has no plan for you.""

Americans are slightly more likely to trust Trump over Harris when it comes to handling the economy, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs poll from August.

Harris came out swinging in defense of abortion rights, perhaps the strongest issue for Democrats since Trump's nominees created a Supreme Court majority to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion. Her sharp arguments provided a vivid contrast to President Joe Biden's rambling comments on the issue during his June debate with Trump.

""The government, and Donald Trump, certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,"" Harris said. She painted a vivid picture of women facing medical complications, gut-wrenching decisions and having travel out of state for an abortion.

Trump was just as fierce in defense, saying he returned the issue to the states, an outcome he said many Americans wanted. He struggled with accuracy, however, repeating the false claim that Democrats support abortion even after babies are born. He stuck to that even after he was corrected by moderator Lynsey Davis.

""I did a great service in doing that. It took courage to do it,"" Trump said of the overturning of Roe v. Wade and its constitutional protections for abortion. ""And the Supreme Court had great courage in doing it. And I give tremendous credit to those six justices.""

Polls has shown significant opposition to overturning Roe and voters have punished Republicans in recent elections for it.

Trump refused to say whether he would veto a bill banning abortion nationwide, saying such legislation would never clear Congress and reach the president. He also broke with his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, suggesting Vance spoke out of turn when he said Trump would veto a national abortion ban.

""I didn't discuss it with JD,"" Trump said.

Trump objected when Harris interrupted him -- an interjection that he could hear but viewers could not because her microphone was muted according to the rules of the debate.

""Wait a minute, I'm talking now,"" Trump said. He was putting his spin on a line she used famously against Mike Pence in the 2020 vice presidential debate.

""Sound familiar?"" Trump added.

Four years ago, Harris rebuked Pence for interrupting, saying: ""Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking."""
Nebraska's top election official might try to remove a ballot measure to repeal school funding law,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/private-school-choice-nebraska-ballot-e53365c420dc65fe35b9edc66865d4d8,2024-09-11T00:03:03Z,"The Nebraska Supreme Court appears set to decide if voters get to determine whether to reject a new law pushed through largely by Republican lawmakers to provide taxpayer money for private school tuition. But depending on how they rule, the Nebraska Secretary of State could unilaterally deprive voters of that choice.

The state's high court heard arguments Tuesday in a lawsuit brought by an eastern Nebraska woman whose child received one of the first private school tuition scholarships available through the new law. Tom Venzor, a lawyer for the woman, argued that the referendum initiative to repeal the funding violates the state constitution's prohibition on voter initiatives to revoke legislative appropriations.

Daniel Gutman, the attorney for the referendum effort, countered that the ballot question appropriately targets the creation of the private school tuition program -- not the $10 million appropriations bill that accompanied it.

But what drew more attention was the assertion by lawyers on both sides that Republican Nebraska Secretary of State Bob Evnen intends to decertify the ballot question -- only days after certifying it -- unless specifically ordered by the high court to keep it on the ballot.

Evnen certified the repeal measure last week after finding that organizers of the petition effort had gathered thousands more valid signatures than the nearly 62,000 needed to get the repeal question on the ballot. He apparently changed his mind, according to a brief filed late Monday afternoon by the Nebraska Attorney General's office, which states that after reviewing the court challenge to it, ""Secretary Evnen is convinced that the referendum is not legally sufficient.""

The brief adds that if the high court fails to rule on the merits of the challenge and simply dismisses the case for procedural reasons, ""Secretary Evnen will immediately rescind his legal sufficiency determination and not place the referendum on the ballot.""

Asked whether state law allows for a secretary of state to decertify an already certified ballot measure, Gutman said there is ""nothing in the statutes that we're aware of that says that he can revoke that decision.""

The problem, he said, is that the law requires the November ballot to be set by Friday.

""I think that his threat of revoking the decision threatens the credibility of certification generally,"" Gutman said. ""Our frank concern is that if this court dismisses this case for lack of jurisdiction, or basically on a procedural ground, that there will be a decertification issued on Friday afternoon and there simply will be no time.

""We will have no recourse.""

Evnen declined to confirm or deny Tuesday that he plans to remove the private school tuition repeal measure off the ballot unless ordered to keep it on by the court, offering only, ""What we need now is a decision on the merits from the Nebraska Supreme Court.""

A similar scenario played out Monday in Missouri, where Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft had certified a ballot measure last month that asks voters to undo the state's near-total abortion ban. On Monday, Ashcroft reversed course, declaring he was decertifying the measure and removing it from the ballot.

The Missouri Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered Ashcroft to put the measure back on the ballot.

The development comes after a long fight over the private school funding issue. Public school advocates carried out a successful signature-gathering effort this summer to ask voters to reverse the use of public money for private school tuition.

It was their second successful petition drive. The first came last year, when Republicans who dominate the officially nonpartisan Nebraska Legislature passed a bill to allow corporations and individuals to divert millions of dollars they owe in state income taxes to nonprofit organizations. Those organizations, in turn, would award that money as private school tuition scholarships.

Support Our Schools collected far more signatures last summer than was needed to ask voters to repeal that law. But lawmakers who support the private school funding bill carried out an end-run around the ballot initiative when they repealed the original law and replaced it earlier this year with another funding law. The new law dumped the tax credit funding system and simply funds private school scholarships directly from state coffers.

Because the move repealed the first law, it rendered last year's successful petition effort moot, requiring organizers to again collect signatures to try to stop the funding scheme.

Nebraska's new law follows several other conservative Republican states -- including Arkansas, Iowa and South Carolina -- in enacting some form of private school choice, from vouchers to education savings account programs."
Harrison Butker endorses Donald Trump: 'The most pro-life president',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/harrison-butker-endorses-donald-trump-the-most-pro-life-president,2024-10-12T01:35:28Z,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Harrison Butker announced on ""The Ingraham Angle"" he is supporting former President Trump in this year's election because of an issue that is ""the most crucial topic for me.""

While sitting next to U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, the Kansas City Chiefs kicker said he would be supporting ""the most pro-life president.""

""I'm supporting the president that's going to be the most pro-life president, and I think Donald Trump is the most pro-life president,"" Butker said. ""That's a topic that is the most crucial topic for me. I want us to be fighting for the most vulnerable, fighting for the unborn, and that's what we should prioritize.""

Butker has often spoken out about his religious beliefs with respect to women's reproductive rights. He actually seemed to disagree with Trump in August. The former president wrote in a Truth Social post that his ""Administration will be great for women and their reproductive rights.""

In an X post of his own, sharing Trump's words, Butker wrote, ""No party or candidate is perfect"" and ""implore[d]"" JD Vance to defend the unborn.

However, Butker has made it clear he is not on board with President Biden's stance on abortion, calling it ""delusional.""

""[Biden] has been so vocal in his support for the murder of innocent babies that I'm sure to many people it appears that you can be both Catholic and pro-choice,"" Butker said during his infamous commencement speech at Benedictine College.

RUSSELL WILSON SLATED TO BE ACTIVE FOR FIRST TIME THIS SEASON -- BUT IN UNFAMILIAR ROLE

During the Super Bowl-winning Chiefs' visit to the White House last year, Butker wore a tie that had ""Vulnerari Praesidio"" in cursive. It's a Latin term that translates to ""Protect the most vulnerable."" He also wore a gold pin representing the size of a 10-week-old baby's feet. Butker was in attendance this year too.

Butker said in an interview with ETWN News in March that unborn babies ""are the greatest victims of our society.""

Rural Minnesotans who voted for Tim Walz 7 times may support Trump in November: report,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/rural-minnesotans-who-voted-tim-walz-7-times-may-support-trump-november-report,2024-10-12T01:12:23Z,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz shared a laugh with host Jimmy Kimmel after the Democratic vice presidential nominee made a comical gaffe during his first appearance on late-night TV.

The people of rural Minnesota voted for Democrat Gov. Tim Walz six times for Congress, and once for governor, but times have changed, according to a new report.

Residents of Albert Lea, Minnesota, a rural Midwest town of 18,000 in Freeborn County, seem to be abandoning their support for Walz, Politico reported Friday.

""I don't think Trump has ever been stronger in rural areas,"" Terry Gjersvik, a local Democrat who lost his bid for a state house seat in 2018, told Politico.

While Minnesota is not a key battleground state in the upcoming election, national and state polls show support for former President Trump in rural areas and small towns at around 60 percent or above.

But, the Harris-Walz campaign is targeting those rural areas ahead of November's election.

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

""If you can do a couple points better, five points better, in those rural areas, and you multiply that by all the rural areas in those states, it's a big deal,"" John Anzalone, a veteran pollster and Harris adviser, said. Walz, he said, ""is the first nominee in modern history, maybe since [Jimmy] Carter, who can talk small town America, rural America.""

Politico spoke with a multitude of people on the ground, and found that many Freeborn County locals who previously had voted Democrat were planning to pull the lever for Trump.

Rich Murray, Albert Lea's current mayor, told Politico that Harris and Walz will win the state, but that the governor is ""not going to get the votes out here,"" which was not the case before 2016.

Freeborn County went twice to Obama and Walz carried the county when he unseated a Republican in his House race in 2006. But by 2016, Walz's support was narrowing and the county went for Trump twice.

Walz barely won the county when he was elected governor in 2018, but when he ran for reelection in 2022, he lost Freeborn to Republican challenger Scott Jensen by almost 15 points, a nearly 30 percentage point swing against him from his first Congressional race in 2006.

WALZ ROASTED AFTER DECLARING 'WE CAN'T AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF THIS' AT RALLY

When he first entered politics, Walz struck a moderate tone, but as governor he signed into law bills that enacted universal background checks, free school lunches and protections for abortion and gender transitions, Politico reported. Those policies, as well as lingering frustration over his COVID response, didn't appeal to voters in places like Freeborn County.

""I call it the Democrat 'smash and grab' in the Capitol,"" Freeborn resident Karla Salier said. ""They went for everything they could get to make us a sanctuary for transgenders and illegals. They just went nuts.""

But, the shift might be due in part to the polarization of voters.

""I think the voters changed,"" Eric Ostermeier, a politics professor at University of Minnesota, told Politico. ""And I would say this is the other aspect of it, is the willingness of voters to split their ticket has changed.

""Because I think with people in their [information] silos and increasingly characterizing the other side as evil, it's difficult for people to say, well, there is this one good Democrat and I'm still going to vote for him, or there is this one good Republican ... he's not so bad,"" he said. ""Which is saying party over personality, I guess."""
"Trump, Harris locked in dead heat in 7 battleground states, poll finds: 'Could not be closer'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-harris-locked-dead-heat-7-battleground-states-poll-finds-could-not-closer,2024-10-11T12:50:48Z,"'Fox News @ Night' panelists Brianna Lyman and Rob Smith break down media confidence for Vice President Kamala Harris.

A new Wall Street Journal poll has found little separation between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris in seven battleground states, prompting a Democratic pollster to say that the 2024 election ""really could not be closer.""

The survey of 600 registered voters in each of the states, which was conducted from Sept. 28 to Oct. 8 with a margin of error of +/- four percentage points, found that in a head-to-head contest, Trump and Harris are tied in North Carolina and Wisconsin.

Harris leads Trump 48-46% in Arizona and Georgia, and 49-47% in Michigan, according to the poll. In Nevada, Trump has his biggest swing state lead of 49-43%, while he leads Harris in Pennsylvania 47-46%, the poll also found.

""It really could not be closer,"" Democrat Michael Bocian, one of the pollsters who worked on the survey, told The Wall Street Journal. ""It's an even-steven, tight, tight race.""

DEMOCRAT STRATEGISTS FRET HARRIS 'SUGAR HIGH' IS OVER

Overall, Trump leads Harris 46-45%, with 93% of Democrats and Republicans across the seven states indicating their support for their parties' respective candidates.

As for independent voters, 40% said they would vote for Harris, compared to 39% for Trump.

On the issues, voters say they trusted Trump more to handle the economy, inflation and immigration and border security.

They preferred Harris when it comes to housing affordability, abortion, healthcare and having someone in the Oval Office who cares about you.

The poll found that 47% of voters believe Trump will stand up better for the American worker, compared to 45% for Harris, and that nearly two-thirds believe the national economy is poor or not so good.

POLL SHOWS HARRIS TAKING A SLIM LEAD OVER TRUMP THANKS TO SUPPORT FROM A SURPRISING GROUP

""This thing is a dead heat and is going to come down to the wire. These last three weeks matter,"" Republican pollster David Lee told The Wall Street Journal.

The newspaper cited Lee as saying that around this time in 2020, Biden had polling average leads of more than 5 points over Trump in each of the industrial northern swing states, compared to the narrower margins Harris is facing right now.

However, Bocian says that Trump had a ""clear advantage"" over Biden in March - the last time The Wall Street Journal polled the swing states - during a period where third-party candidates were having a ""massive impact"" on the numbers.

'The epicenter': How 'key' to White House could lie in suburban Georgia county,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/how-key-white-house-could-lie-suburban-georgia-county-the-epicenter,2024-10-11T10:19:04Z,"MARIETTA, Ga. -- While 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. may sit within the boundaries of Washington, D.C., the key to unlocking its front door could lie in the suburbs outside Atlanta, local officials say.

""It's not just the state, it's federal,"" Cobb County Democratic Party Chair Essence Johnson told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""Cobb County is the epicenter. It's the bellwether of Georgia, but also on the federal level. ... That's why Cobb County is so vital.""

Salleigh Grubbs, chair of the Cobb County GOP, told Fox News Digital her area would be ""very key in this election.""

""I think Cobb County is key,"" she said. ""I battle with people all the time about whether Cobb is blue or red and that kind of thing. And the reality is is that we do have some of the largest number of Republican voters in the state for our population.""

GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO WIN BACK PEACH STATE

Georgia's traditionally Republican status flipped when then-Democrat candidate Joe Biden won the state in 2020. Its status as a battleground state was solidified in the 2022 midterms with the victory of Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga.

Statewide, Biden beat then-President Trump by less than 1%. In Cobb County, which encompasses parts of the Atlanta suburbs and is anchored by the city of Marietta, Biden's margin of victory was nearly 15%.

Asked how the Democrats' ground game in Cobb County has changed now that they're seeking to hold onto Georgia rather than flip it, Johnson said the key was being ""intentional"" in outreach and meeting ""people where they are.""

She also signaled that abortion is a top issue for Democrats in this election cycle but noted that it may still be an uphill battle to get certain groups - like Black men and White women - out to the ballot box for Harris.

GEORGIA DEMS CHAIR REVEALS MESSAGE TO UNDECIDED GOP VOTERS AS HARRIS WORKS TO BUILD BROAD BASE

""We have seen some areas of weakness as far as voters and also reaching those communities to really understand the reason why they feel that they are not being heard,"" Johnson said.

""They don't feel that certain policies have reached them. And even though I say there is no specific policy for anybody, reproductive rights impact my son, right? He has a responsibility to reproductive rights because that could be his girlfriend, his partner, his best friend.""

She also said suburban White women were ""sometimes the weakest link when it comes to voters"" but noted that reproductive rights impacted them as well.

Meanwhile, the Trump campaign has been seeking to court minority men disenchanted with the Democratic Party, with Trump allies believing the strategy pivotal to winning battlegrounds like Georgia.

Grubbs would not say which demographics she believes are key to winning back Cobb County, but she noted the GOP's road to victory includes focusing on local issues and election integrity.

""I don't tend to look at things like that,"" Grubbs said.

""The way I view it more is, particularly on the local level, is what's going on in your community and what are your values and what is your quality of life, and just translating the quality-of-life issue from the county level all the way to the national level.""

She cited the recent port workers strike, supply chain issues and ""school quality"" as issues with both local and national implications for people.

TRUMP VS HARRIS ROUND 2? VOTERS IN KEY GA COUNTY REVEAL IF THEY WANT SECOND DEBATE

Grubbs said she also had a focus on Americans feeling confident in the elections: ""In this election, everybody needs to get out and vote. Everybody needs to have their voice heard. Everybody needs to be concerned about election integrity.""

"Louisiana coach fanning faith into football players, teaches them how to put God first: 'I love what I do'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/louisiana-coach-fanning-faith-football-players-teaches-god-first-love,2024-10-11T10:11:07Z,"Head coach and pastor, Denny Duron, leads the Evangel Christian Academy football team in their quest for a 15th State Championship in Fox Nation's new show, 'God. Family. Football.'

One pastor and football coach in the small town of Shreveport, Louisiana is impacting young lives in a big way.

Louisiana Tech hall-of-fame quarterback Denny Duron started the Evangel Christian Academy with humble beginnings and the intent to spread the Christian faith among a new generation. Since founding the program in 1980, Pastor Duron has helped the team win 12 district championships, 14 state championships, one national title, and has had 14 graduates play in the NFL.

""I'm just so grateful to God that, at 72 years old, I have a chance to show up every morning and teach the word of God to 75 young men. Most of them have never owned a Bible until we give it to them. And they are being molded together as a beautiful family. And it really is all about God and family. And now football is some kind of tool that we get to use, the platform, the vehicle -- the conduit, I should say -- to which we can put the message of Jesus into their lives,"" Duron said during an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital.

KIRK CAMERON URGES AMERICANS OF FAITH TO 'BE BRAVE' AND 'VOTE THEIR VALUES' THIS ELECTION

""For my boys, many of them hurt. Many of them have endured great trauma and pain in their lives and in their homes. Evangel is very different than where they live. And so we never, ever stop praying.""

Told through the eyes of members of Shreveport, Louisiana's Evangel Christian Academy football team, Fox Nation's new series ""God. Family. Football"" spotlights real-life challenges players must overcome on and off the field in their quest for a 15th state championship title.

From ill family members to peer pressures to struggles at home and dating for the first time, the series follows the Evangel Eagles through practices, strategy sessions, dates, homecoming and all the ups and downs of high school life.

Duron was asked about his own journey to becoming a pastor and coach, telling Fox News Digital that God had led him on a long journey that, at times, he did not understand.

Denny signed to the Washington Redskins as a third-string quarterback, calling it the ""easiest gig [he] ever had."" Before he was able to lace it up for the Redskins, Duron revealed that the Lord ""spoke to [his] heart"" and said ""this is your last day"" at training camp.

NFL HALL OF FAME COACH TONY DUNGY QUESTIONS KAMALA HARRIS' FAITH-BASED TWEET ABOUT ABORTION RIGHTS

""I walked across the road from the training camp in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and got my car. And just before I even put the key in the ignition, I just sat there, and I said, 'okay, Lord, you've used to this football thing. But now I pray that because I will never be in a position as a player to use it again as a platform, you put me in touch and allow me to influence those that will have a platform,""' he said.

Upon hearing about the overwhelming amount of faith Duron has been able to instill in his players from various generations, the pastor's prayers to God allowing him to faithfully influence others has seemingly come true.

Throughout his time at Evangel Christian Academy, ""Coach Duron"" coached numerous All-Americans while at the same time virtually re-writing the national offensive record books for yardage, touchdowns, and points scored.

Evangel Christian Academy was named by USA Today as one of the top eight high school springboards to the NFL, and Fox Sports recognized Evangel as the 1999 National High School Champions. The 2024 season could have as many as eight former Evangel Eagles in the NFL.

KELLYANNE CONWAY: Trump vs. Harris: Don't rule out a 'narrow landslide',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kellyanne-conway-trump-vs-harris-dont-rule-out-narrow-landslide,2024-10-11T09:13:28Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The ups and downs, ebbs and flows, bumps and slumps that have characterized this unpredictable and chaotic campaign season seem to have stabilized. Credible polling indicates that with four weeks until Election Day, the 2024 presidential contest is tied nationally and tighter than a tick in the seven swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. According to the Real Clear Politics (RCP) average, neither candidate is up by more than 1 point in these battlegrounds. In six of the seven, the margin is either less than 1 point or in an exact tie.

Some internal polling shows former President Trump gaining ground in Wisconsin and in must-win Pennsylvania, our ""reach state"" in 2016 and one that remains poised to help decide the presidency this year.

Trump is experiencing his best polling in the three times he has been the Republican nominee. Nationally, the latest RCP average shows Harris up by only 2.0%. That is quite a contrast from 2020, where Joe Biden led by 10%, and in 2016, which showed Hillary Clinton up by 5.8%. Trump could be headed for a ""narrow landslide.""

RealClearPolitics (RealClearPolitics - Live Opinion, News, Analysis, Video and Polls) posts a chart daily showing the polling averages nationwide and in the swing states on ""This Day in History"" comparing 2016, 2020, and 2024 polling. Sure, it illustrates flawed and agenda-driven polling by media outlets and academic institutions, but it also exposes the vulnerabilities Harris has relative to Biden and Clinton at this same stage.

BATTLEGROUND DEM WARNS TRADITIONAL VOTING BLOC BEING 'SPLIT' IN 2024

For 35 years as a pollster, I've been urging people to dig beyond the horserace numbers and examine the fundamentals of what's driving voter opinion and what the truly 5% undecideds wish to see, read and hear to help them settle on a candidate. Let's dig into a few of them.

First, look at the issue set. Harris is banking on abortion to keep her in the White House. Abortion is a vote motivator and turnout intensifier. Most abortion-minded voters (pro-life, pro-choice or somewhere in between) are baked into the existing electorate. A recent CNN poll showed 11% of likely voters said that abortion is their top issue. This week's NYT/Siena poll indicated that only 3% of undecided voters said that abortion was their top issue in this election cycle.

In the same CNN national poll, 41% of likely voters said the economy was their most important issue, followed by protecting democracy (21%), and immigration (12%). Likely voters trust Trump over Harris on the economy (50% vs. 39%), immigration (49% vs. 35%), and foreign policy (47% vs. 40%). Even among those who find Trump's policies ""too extreme"" (yes, CNN asked that questions), 15% trust him more on the economy and immigration These voters are a good example of what we saw in 2016: We complain, kvetch and converse according to what offends us, but we vote according to what affects us.

HARRIS' STRUGGLES WITH MICHIGAN'S WORKING-CLASS VOTERS PROVIDES OPENING FOR TRUMP, GOP

Harris' problem of being both ill-defined on issues but well-defined on transparency were revealed in a recent Fox News national poll. Just 43% of voters say Harris says what she believes; separately, 55% think she says whatever it takes to get elected. In contrast, a majority (51%) says the ubiquitous, loquacious Trump speaks what he believes.

Second, Harris continues to underperform among core constituencies that any Democratic presidential campaign must retain to win. Harris gained reluctant Democratic voters upset with Biden, but she continues to underperform Biden's actual 2020 Election Day margins. She has failed to scaffold together either the Obama Coalition of 2008 or the Biden (Harris) Coalition of 2020.""

The major key cohort that Harris is overperforming with is White College Grads, where she is running 9% better than Biden at this point in October 2020 and 16 points ahead of Biden's eventual Election Day margin. Otherwise, the Harris Honeymoon is over and her debate performance is in the rear-view, as she struggles to skeptical voters she needs to win.:

‚óè Harris is losing working-class voters by 36%. Biden lost them by 26%

‚óè Harris is up among Black voters by 64%. Biden won them by 81%

‚óèBiden won Hispanics by a 23-point margin in 2020, where current polls show Hispanics migrating toward Trump and but Harris' lead anywhere from a few points to 14.)

‚óèHarris has a lead of 17 points among young voters (aged 18-29), but Democrats have won this group by over 20 points in the 2012, 2016, and 2020 presidential elections. (She is also only +12 among voters under 34, a group Biden won by double that, 24 points, in 2020.)

‚óèHarris is hemorrhaging men, losing them to Trump by 14 points, an increase over Biden 6% deficit in 2020, creating a double gender gap.

Significantly, rank-and-file union members are tepid about Harris and not timid about supporting Trump. The Teamsters, ""America's largest, most diverse union"" boasting 1.3 million members, declined to endorse a presidential candidate for the first time since 1996. That slap at Harris followed internal polling that showed 60% of members intend to vote for Trump, and just 34% for Harris.

KAMALA HARRIS CONFRONTED ON NOT EARNING TEAMSTERS ENDORSEMENT: 'WHAT WAS THEIR REASONING?'

So, Trump has successfully grown his coalition with more Hispanics, Blacks, union households, men, working-class, non-college educated and younger voters. If Trump maintains his gains among these key groups, and continues to outperform Republicans from historical standards, the 45th president will be the 47th president.

Third, the political environment and underlying fundamentals are more favorable to Trump and the GOP, according to Gallup.

‚óèAmericans are dissatisfied with the state of the nation, with only 22% satisfied the way things are going in the US

‚óèThey view the economy negatively with a Democratic administration in office. 48% view the current economic conditions as ""poor"" versus only 22% who think they are ""excellent"" or ""good.""

‚óè46% believe the GOP is better able to handle the most important problems facing our nation, compared to 41% who think the Democrats can do the same.

‚óèRepublicans also have an advantage in U.S. adults' party identification and leanings. 48% are Republican/Lean Republican, vs. 45% Democratic/Lean Democratic.

And in the CNN national poll, 51% of Americans view the Trump presidency as a success, while 61% view the Biden-Harris presidency as a failure.

For all the talk of diversity, expansion, forward-looking turn the page-iness, Americans still feel Harris and her party feel stale and sclerotic. Biden is hanging around the rim, affirming in his recent press conference that Harris has been his #2 the entire time, as inflation exploded, the border disappeared, the world erupted with war all around.

Fourth, gains in the non-sexy parts of politics are bolstering the GOP and Trump. The Trump Campaign, RNC and allied groups have smartly invested heavily in those efforts, buttressing election integrity measures, and building a ground game and a get-out-the-vote operation targeted at those elusive, yet decisive, noncommitted voters. Even Trump has changed his tune on early voting this cycle, telling voters, including viewers on my show, Fox Nation's ""Here's the Deal with Kellyanne,"" to make a plan and vote how and when they are most comfortable, including early, something he said he might do in Florida this month.

Republicans are also gaining an edge of hundreds of thousands of votes compared to the 2020 Election. For example, in September 2020, there were about 685,000 more registered Democrats in Pa., and 391,000 more registered Democrats in N.C. than Republicans. By comparison, in September 2024, there are only 343,000 more registered Democrats in Pa. and 126,000 more registered Democrats in N.C. than Republicans.

Meanwhile, reports show that Trump, as well as his dynamic Vice-Presidential nominee JD Vance, will barnstorm the swing states and be on the plane every day from here on out as he has been doing the last few weeks. This was key to his 2016 election victory. This is the most savvy and strategic way to keep Trump front and center, offering solutions, getting specific, showing joy on the job, and challenging his political opponent on her record and rationale for running (""I'm not Biden; I'm not Trump"" feels stale). If he is in your city, he's in your consciousness - just look at the local news in Butler, PA this weekend.

In our culturally cleaved, politically divided country, the 2024 presidential election may mirror the tighter-than-a-tick 2016 and 2020 contests, which were decided by handfuls of votes across several states out of more than 155 million cast in 2020 alone.

This may come down to a technical, tactical trench warfare campaign, a battle of who is seen as more competent and, in the face of natural disasters, more ready, responsive and compassionate. This will help engage (and not just enrage) voters who see a binary choice in governing and vision.

The polling may suggest a race at ""deuce"" but the advantage is currently for Trump. He and his running mate, Senator JD Vance, pledge to stay on the road daily, blitzing key states while dipping into traditionally Democratic demographic cohorts.

The 2024 presidential election has been touted as the ""most important"" election in U.S. history by both campaigns, as former President Trump works to reclaim the Oval Office and Vice President Harris pitches herself to voters as the next leader of the U.S.

As the high-stakes election comes down to its final weeks, Fox News Digital compiled the top political and legal tactics that critics, most notably on the right, have slammed as efforts by the Democratic Party to undermine democracy in the run-up to the big day on Nov. 5.

Before the Republican Party officially nominated Trump as its presidential nominee, Democrats in states such as Colorado, California, Illinois and others attempted to remove Trump's name from primary ballots.

Last year, a group of Colorado voters brought a lawsuit arguing Trump should be deemed ineligible from holding political office under a Civil War-era insurrection clause and that his name should thus be barred from appearing on the 2024 ballot. The group said Trump's actions on Jan. 6, 2021, when some of his supporters breached the U.S. Capitol, violated a clause in the 14th Amendment that prevents officers of the United States, members of Congress or state legislatures who ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion"" against the Constitution from holding political office.

The Colorado case ultimately made its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which unanimously sided with Trump that he should remain on the state's ballot. The ruling affected all states across the nation that worked to remove Trump's name, requiring them to include him on primary ballots as well.

SUPREME COURT RULES UNANIMOUSLY FOR TRUMP IN COLORADO BALLOT DISQUALIFICATION DISPUTE

The tactic was slammed by Republicans and conservatives as a ""constitutional violation,"" while even former Obama adviser David Axelrod warned on CNN that removing Trump's name would be seen as ""a subversion"" of democracy.

Fox News Digital spoke to Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray when the SCOTUS decision was released, who called the Democrat tactic ""lunacy."" Gray had been battling Democrats' argument that Trump was ineligible to appear on the primary ballots over Jan. 6 for months ahead of the Supreme Court decision.

""I think one of the lessons of this is ... the way the radical left despises the American people and our process, and what happens then is lunacy. And that's what their whole argumentation and what they were trying to do was. It was pure lunacy,"" Gray told Fox Digital in March.

""We're going to continue to monitor the processes across our nation and be vigilant. Any time the people are able to choose for themselves, that's a win for our republic, and that's what our elections are about. And I'm going to continue to unapologetically fight for the people of Wyoming and the people across our country to choose who to elect for themselves,"" Gray added at the time.

FAILED EFFORT TO BOOT TRUMP FROM BALLOT EXPOSES 'RADICAL' LEFT'S 'PURE LUNACY': STATE ELECTION CHIEF

The Biden-Harris administration in July rolled out a slate of policies to overhaul the Supreme Court. The proposal includes calls for term limits for Supreme Court justices, an enforceable ethics code for justices and an amendment to the Constitution to overturn the high court's ruling that former presidents have substantial immunity from prosecution for official acts while in office.

Critics slammed the proposal as an attempt to pack the court, including attorney Mark Paoletta, who worked for the Trump administration. He argued that, including the term limit proposal, Biden and Harris' plan outlined a system in which the president appoints a new Supreme Court justice ""every two years to spend 18 years in active service on the Supreme Court.""

""Even though Joe Biden caved to radicals and recently endorsed court packing, Harris is even further to the left of him on this thoroughly discredited idea,"" Paoletta said in a statement to Fox News Digital in August.

Conservative activist Leonard Leo also argued to Fox Digital that the proposal would likely serve as a prelude to court packing if Harris is elected next month.

LEONARD LEO WARNS BIDEN-HARRIS EFFORTS TO RADICALLY OVERHAUL SUPREME COURT COULD 'BACKFIRE'

""If Kamala Harris is elected president, and if the Senate is in Democrat hands, I think that there is some risk of court packing. I think that there is some risk of continued, scurrilous attacks on the integrity of the court, all based on a disagreement over the outcomes of various decisions that Democrats don't like,"" he said. ""And that would really be most unfortunate.""

Democrats have pushed to broaden the court in an effort to switch it from a conservative majority. Biden, however, had previously called court packing a ""bonehead idea"" in 1983 while serving as a U.S. senator from Delaware, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken called it ""anti-democratic"" in 2021.

Harris called for the end of the filibuster last month in an effort to pass a law restoring abortion access nationwide, which was slammed by lawmakers and conservatives as an attack on democracy.

""Shame on her,"" independent Sen. Joe Manchin said at the Capitol last month. ""She knows the filibuster is the Holy Grail of democracy. It's the only thing that keeps us talking and working together. If she gets rid of that, then this would be the house on steroids.""

HARRIS CALLS FOR ELIMINATING FILIBUSTER TO PASS 'ROE' ABORTION BILL INTO FEDERAL LAW

The filibuster is a Senate rule that allows a minority to block legislation pending a supermajority vote, so ending it would make it easier to pass laws related to abortion rights.

Harris said late last month she would like to end the filibuster to pass a law protecting access to abortion.

""I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe,"" Harris said during a WPR interview. ""And get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do.""

Democrat-turned-independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema also panned the proposal, calling it a ""terrible, shortsighted idea.""

""To state the supremely obvious, eliminating the filibuster to codify Roe v Wade also enables a future Congress to ban all abortion nationwide,"" Sinema, who left the Democratic Party in 2022, wrote on X. ""What an absolutely terrible, shortsighted idea.""

KAMALA HARRIS ISN'T ALONE: VULNERABLE DEMS WANT CURRENT FILIBUSTER GONE

Illegal immigration via the nation's southern border grew to crisis levels under the Biden administration, with at least 7 million migrants coming into the nation in the last three and a half years.

Illegal immigrants are not able to vote in federal elections, but conservative lawmakers and pundits have warned that upcoming elections could be affected by the flux of migrants.

SENATE PASSES FUNDING BILL WITHOUT SAVE ACT, AVOIDING POTENTIAL SHUTDOWN

""If you have a small percentage of the millions and billions (sic) of illegals who came over the border in the last four years under border czar Kamala Harris' policies, they can throw an election, they can throw the majority of the House,"" Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said last month.

Republicans in Congress introduced legislation this year, the SAVE Act, that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote. Lawmakers who promoted the legislation cited that it would ""preserve our democracy.""

""There's nothing more sacred and more profound than the right to vote and especially to preserve our self-governing constitutional republic and to preserve our democracy. And the Democrats can keep talking about democracy, but nothing undermines the values of the right of each individual to have their vote cast and allowing non-citizens to vote,"" New York Republican Rep. Claudia Tenney, the chair of the House Election Integrity Caucus, told Fox News Digital in July.

'TERRIBLE MESSAGE': GOP LAWMAKER FUMES AFTER ONLY 5 HOUSE DEMS SUPPORT BILL REQUIRING CITIZENSHIP TO VOTE

Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, told Fox News Digital this year that illegal immigration ""distorts the mechanics of democratic government"" and may significantly impact states' representation in the House of Representatives and Electoral College.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris' running mate, advocated for the end of the Electoral College during a campaign event this week - a call conservatives have previously panned.

""I think all of us know the Electoral College needs to go,"" he said, according to a pool report at the event, Bloomberg reported. ""We need a national popular vote, but that's not the world we live in.""

The campaign subsequently walked Walz's comment back shortly after.

TIM WALZ CALLS FOR ELIMINATION OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE AT CALIFORNIA FUNDRAISER, SAYS 'IT NEEDS TO GO'

""Governor Walz believes that every vote matters in the Electoral College and he is honored to be traveling the country and battleground states working to earn support for the Harris-Walz ticket,"" a Harris campaign spokesperson told USA Today. ""He was commenting to a crowd of strong supporters about how the campaign is built to win 270 electoral votes. And, he was thanking them for their support that is helping fund those efforts.""

Liberals have increasingly called for the end of the Electoral College, which is the formal process of electing the president and vice president, in favor of the popular vote. The Electoral College consists of a certain number of electors from each state who cast votes for the president and vice president, then whichever candidate receives the most ballots is awarded the electoral votes for that state.

Since 1992, Democrats have won seven of the eight popular votes, including failed 2016 candidate Hillary Clinton and failed 2000 candidate Al Gore, who lost the Electoral College despite winning the popular vote.

Conservatives have slammed efforts and calls to end the Electoral College, including the Heritage Foundation's Hans Von Spakovsky, who argued that getting rid of the process would not produce a more democratic election.

""The U.S. should maintain the Electoral College, which has successfully elected Presidents throughout this nation's history in a way that best represents the diverse and various interests of America,"" Von Spakovsky wrote in a piece after the 2020 election.

""In an age of perceived political dysfunction, effective policies that are already in place - especially successful policies established by this nation's Founders, such as the Electoral College - should be preserved.""

In 2012, Trump also panned the electoral system, calling it ""a disaster for a democracy."" In 2018, he again voiced support for the idea because a popular vote would be ""much easier to win.""

However, more recently, the Trump campaign has since slammed Walz for his comments calling for the abolition of the Electoral College, with spokesperson Karoline Leavitt saying this week that the process is ""a critical component of our Constitution.""

Harris ascended to the top of the Democrat ticket without facing a primary after President Biden dropped out of the race this past summer as concerns mounted over his mental acuity and age.

Biden endorsed Harris for the Oval Office shortly after dropping out of race via a social media post on X, with the Democratic Party subsequently quickly coalescing around the VP. She won enough delegate support to secure the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in August.

HARRIS SAID CANDIDATES MUST 'EARN' VOTER SUPPORT DESPITE SKIPPING PRIMARIES BEFORE BECOMING DEM NOMINEE

Harris also ran for the White House during the 2020 election season, but dropped out of the race before primary elections kicked off.

Conservatives and liberals alike have slammed the Democratic Party for championing Harris as their candidate despite the VP not earning the position directly from voters.

SEAN HANNITY: KAMALA HARRIS WAS CORONATED AFTER WINNING ZERO PRIMARY VOTES

""A 24-hour process of talking to party bosses is not democratic, nor is it a process Democrats should be proud of,"" left-wing organization Black Lives Matter said in a press release in July.

""We do not live in a dictatorship. Delegates are not oligarchs. Installing Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee and an unknown vice president without any public voting process would make the modern Democratic Party a party of hypocrites,"" the group added.

Ryan Walker, executive director at Heritage Action For America, a conservative political advocacy organization in Washington, D.C., affiliated with the Heritage Foundation, said that votes for Biden in this election cycle were ""thrown away.""

""The votes of 14 million Americans who voted for Joe Biden were thrown away as Harris was installed as the Democrats' nominee for president, a job for which she has never received a single vote,"" Walker said when reacting to former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi recently saying that the primary process was ""open"" and Harris ""won it.""

""Saying she won an open primary is a joke,"" Walker said.

Michigan gov feeds kneeling female podcast host Doritos while wearing a Harris-Walz hat,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/michigan-gov-feeds-kneeling-female-podcast-host-doritos-while-wearing-harris-walz-hat,2024-10-10T23:12:50Z,"Trump supporters in Saginaw, Michigan, told Fox News Digital the top issues Trump should hit as he seeks to win the critical swing state.

A video showing Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, D., feeding a kneeling ""feminist"" podcast host a Doritos chip while wearing a Harris/Walz cameo campaign hat, prompted questions and criticisms on Thursday.

Author and filmmaker Liz Plank shared the video on her Instagram account ""feministabulous"" showing Whitmer feeding her a Doritos chip while she is kneeling.

""If he won't, Gretchen Whitmer will,"" a caption under the Instagram video post reads. ""Chips aren't just delicious, the CHIPS Act is a game-changer for U.S. tech and manufacturing, boosting domestic production of semiconductors to reduce reliance on foreign suppliers! Donald Trump would put that at risk.""

She also shared the video on TikTok with the caption, ""new interview with big gretch just dropped!""

MICHIGAN GOV. WHITMER SAYS PEOPLE SHOULDN'T 'GIVE A DAMN' IF TAYLOR SWIFT IS FRIENDS WITH BRITTANY MAHOMES

The video made waves on social media with critics blasting Whitmer as mocking Catholics.

""Let's be clear what's happening in this video,"" former Trump advisor Tim Murtaugh posted on X. ""Gov. Whitmer of Michigan is pretending to give communion to an leftist podcaster on her knees, using a Dorito as the Eucharist while wearing a Harris-Walz hat. Do they want ZERO Catholic votes for Harris?""

However, some tied it to a TikTok trend of people feeding one another. Earlier this week, a trend called ""Feeding Someone"" with videos showing friends and partners feeding food to one another. Some videos amassed millions of views.

""This is a tiktok trend that has absolutely NOTHING to do with Catholicism...this is quite a stretch,"" conservative social media influencer Amala Ekpunobi wrote on X.

When asked for comment, a political aide for Whitmer told Fox News Digital, ""the governor's social media is well known for infusing her communications with pop culture.""

The aide added, ""This popular trend has been used by countless people, including Billie Eilish, Kylie Jenner, and Stephen Colbert, and the fact that people are paying attention to a video promoting President Biden's CHIPS Act proves it's working. Republicans want to distract from the fact that Democrats have invested billions of dollars into local economies to create a record number of jobs and bring supply chains back from overseas, while Donald Trump's policies would kill these jobs and send them back to China.""

The video posted by Plank was used to promote Whitmer's appearance on her podcast called Chip Chat that was published Thursday on YouTube.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN DISTANCES ITSELF FROM '60 MINUTES' EDIT: 'WE DO NOT CONTROL CBS'S PRODUCTION DECISIONS'

During the podcast, the two discussed former President Trump, abortion, and men who are undecided about Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.

""What would you say to a man who feels like he can't vote for a woman, he can't vote for Kamala Harris?"" Plank asked.

""We deserve and need a commander-in-chief who is tough,"" Whitmer responded. ""We're going to have to deal with the worst of the worst bullies around the globe. From Vladimir Putin to Chinese leadership to what's happening in North Korea. We've got to have a tough commander-in-chief, not someone who kowtows ... or who is on an ego trip.""

Plank applauded the Democratic governor for her ""superhuman"" leadership in the state.

Trump calls for federal education dollars to 'follow the student' in push for universal school choice,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-calls-federal-education-dollars-follow-student-push-universal-school-choice,2024-10-10T20:08:49Z,"Marking the kickoff of 'National School Choice Week,' senior fellow at the American Federation for Children Corey DeAngelis joined 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss the National Education Association launching an anti-school choice campaign.

Former President Trump is proposing that federal education dollars ""follow the student"" in his possible second term, while pushing his ""universal school choice policy,"" and stressing that he backs it ""all the way.""

The former president championed school choice last week, making his strongest case yet for the movement on the federal level.

""We want federal education dollars to follow the student, rather than propping up a bloated and radical bureaucracy in Washington, D.C.,"" Trump said at an event in Milwaukee.

TRUMP PUSH TO DISMANTLE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT MET WITH ENTHUSIASM IN HOUSE GOP

""If you want a better education for your child, Kamala Harris stands in your way,"" Trump said. ""Kamala and the Radical Left Democrat Party want to keep Black and Hispanic children trapped in family government. I think that's really the reason.""

The former president said he believes school choice ""is the civil rights issue of our time.""

""A child's fate should be determined by their love of education, by their parents, by so many factors. But it can't be determined by a ZIP code,"" Trump said. ""And no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government-run school.""

Trump's universal school choice would allow parents to send their children to public, private or religious schools.

Trump's stance is reflected in the 2024 Republican Party platform. According to proponents of school choice, it recognizes a role for both federal and state governments in expanding tax credit scholarship programs and Education Savings Accounts, which currently serve more than a million K-12 students across the country.

The Trump campaign said school choice ""leads to higher graduation rates, higher parental satisfaction and involvement, lower costs, increased competition among schools, and higher reading and math test scores.""

At this point, 11 states have universal school choice, and 32 states and Washington, D.C., have at least one private school choice program - but 18 states have none.

""Before President Trump took office, zero states had a universal school choice policy. Now, almost a dozen do, and it is in large part because of the voice and visibility that he gave to elevate the issue into the national consciousness during COVID - but even before that,"" former Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told Fox News Digital.

""There is an increase in the number and needs of American school children with respect to alternatives to conventional public schools,"" Conway said. ""There is an increase in resistance among Kamala Harris and Democrats to allow these types of alternatives - these types of options and choices - to be in the hands of parents.""

On the other side of the aisle, Democrats are expanding their opposition to school choice, and teachers' unions rejoiced when Vice President Kamala Harris tapped Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, dubbing the ticket as a major win for public educators.

Walz is a former teachers' union member who has said he is opposed to the school choice ""agenda.""

MINNESOTA WALZ-APPOINTED BOARD REQUIRES TEACHERS TO 'AFFIRM' THEIR STUDENTS' GENDER IDENTITIES

Teachers' unions pushed hard to prolong school closures during the COVID-19 pandemic, with many districts shuttered for more than a year.

Former Trump Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said Walz was a ""5-alarm fire for parents and students.""

As for the Democratic Party platform, Democrats support all children ""no matter their ZIP code"" to have access to a ""quality public K-12 education and for college to be affordable for every American.""

Democrats are looking to push federal dollars toward public schools in an effort to ""expand opportunities for higher education and job training.""

Harris' campaign did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment, but her website lays out her plan to ""ensure parents can afford high-quality child care and preschool for their children.""

Harris also plans to focus on working to ""end the unreasonable burden of student loan debt and fight to make higher education more affordable, so that college can be a ticket to the middle class.""

Harris said she would work to ""scale up programs that create good career pathways for non-college graduates.""

But Conway explained that parents are focused on having more of a role in their child's education - now more than ever.

""There is a continuation of the parent's rights renaissance that started during COVID and spilled over into 2021 and into Glenn Youngkin's election over Terry McAuliffe in 2021 and continues unabated in so many states across this country,"" Conway said, noting that since the COVID-19 pandemic, which shuttered schools at the request of the teachers' unions, there ""are a higher number of people running for school board, and you have more parents engaged in choices of schools and character of curricula.""

""There is a need for a charismatic and compelling leader to take this on,"" Conway said, referring to Trump.

By December 2020, Trump signed an executive order to expand education opportunities for American children and families impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. That order offered flexibility to provide children with emergency K-12 scholarships to access in-person learning opportunities - an effort to provide an in-person learning option after prolonged school closures.

The Trump administration also invested nearly $1.5 billion in the development of public charter schools and, under his tax reform bill, made it possible for parents to withdraw up to $10,000 tax-free per year from 529 education savings plans to cover public, private, or religious K-12 schooling costs.

""President Trump says this is the civil rights issue of our time, and it is true, but also, when you look at the sheer numbers of charter schools and school choice scholarship recipients and even the alternatives, like homeschooled students - and that is still a growing piece - but parents want to take things into their own hands. They know their children best,"" Conway said. ""If Trump is re-elected, this is going to be a biggie.""

As for the word ""choice,"" Conway said the left ""wants to own that word"" but only when it relates to abortion.

""The Democrat Party really only wants to talk to women from the waist down, whereas, these parents of school-aged children want people to talk to them from the waist up - their eyes, ears, brain and hearts - and that includes them giving choices,"" she said. ""We should not be ceding the word 'choice' and the idea that women have a right to choose to the left based on abortion. It should be, women have a right to choose where their children go to school and what is taught there.""

But Democrats believe school choice is anti-public schools - something Conway pushed back on - and argue that it would take funding away from teachers and schools themselves.

""It is just about competition,"" she said. ""You can customize your coffee 14,000 different ways at Starbucks. You can get Amazon to deliver anything to your home this afternoon. And yet, you are stuck with one choice for school.""

She added: ""It is like shopping in a Soviet Safeway for your child's education, and it makes no sense, and it does not match the rest of the way we live our lives.""

Voters in key battleground states give Trump an edge over Harris on this top tier issue: poll,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-dominates-harris-key-issue-battleground-states,2024-10-10T19:06:50Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A new poll released this week shows former President Trump with a strong lead over Vice President Kamala Harris on the subject of immigration - even after Harris has sought to present herself as the best candidate to secure the southern border.

The Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday found Harris leading Trump in Pennsylvania, while Trump is ahead in Michigan and Wisconsin. The three Rust Belt states are being closely watched as they could determine which candidate is the next president.

But on the question of who is best to handle immigration, Trump has the edge in all three states. He carries a four-point lead in Pennsylvania (50-46), a nine-point lead in Michigan (53-44) and an eight-point lead in Wisconsin (52-44).

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

Trump was also preferred in all states on the economy and handling the conflict in the Middle East, while Harris was preferred on abortion and preserving democracy.

Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, along with Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada, had razor-thin margins that decided President Biden's 2020 White House victory over Trump. And the seven states are likely to determine if Trump or Harris wins the 2024 presidential election.

Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are also the three Rust Belt states that make up the Democrats' so-called ""Blue Wall.""

The party reliably won all three states for a quarter-century before Trump narrowly captured them in the 2016 election to win the White House.

A recent Marquette Law School poll found that 49% favor Trump while just 37% favor Harris on immigration, with 8% saying they'd be about the same, and 6% saying neither are good on the issue.

Harris was tasked with tackling root causes of migration to the southern border in early 2021 as border numbers began to surge. She was eventually dubbed the ""border czar"" by media outlets and critics - although the White House rejected that title.

HARRIS SHIFTS KEY POSITIONS ON BORDER, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AS CAMPAIGN PROMISES 'PRAGMATIC' APPROACH

Republicans have accused her of playing a key role in the border crisis and the policies they believe fueled it, including the rolling back of Trump-era policies. Trump has promised to launch a massive deportation operation if elected, restart border wall construction and end Biden-era parole policies.

Critics have also highlighted her more left-wing policies as a senator and presidential candidate in 2019 - including her positions on immigration funding and the detention of illegal immigrants.

Harris' campaign says her views have changed since 2019 and have been shaped by her involvement in the administration. This year, her campaign has highlighted her past as a prosecutor and noted her backing of a bipartisan Senate bill to increase funding to the border.

Contentious exchanges over illegal immigration front and center in Arizona Senate debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/contentious-exchanges-over-illegal-immigration-front-center-arizona-senate-debate,2024-10-10T17:42:47Z,"Republican New York Rep. Elise Stefanik joins 'America Reports' to discuss the Republican counterprogramming during the DNC, focusing on the border.

Arizona Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego faced off against Republican challenger Kari Lake on Wednesday night and wasted no time exchanging blows over the illegal immigration crisis plaguing the state's southern border.

Lake, trailing behind Gallego entering into the debate, appeared much more on the offensive. Meanwhile, Gallego - a five-term member in Congress - appeared more relaxed, given his comfortable lead in several recent polls.

The two candidates sparred over border security and abortion in the first half of the debate night. Lake touted H.R. 2 - the House GOP-led bill that would tighten border security - while Gallego pointed to his support for the failed bipartisan border bill that Democrats, Republicans and White House officials negotiated earlier this year.

BATTLEGROUND SENATE CANDIDATE UNLOADS ON 'RADICAL' DEM OPPONENT FOR DISPARAGING TRUMP VOTERS

Gallego also accused Lake of wanting to deport Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients, while Lake accused Gallego of not wanting to deport any of the illegal immigrants who have crossed the border over the last three and a half years.

""Dealing with the people who've poured in during the Bidenvasion, the 20 million people who have come in unvetted into our country, we must deal with them in order to save our homeland,"" Lake said during the debate. ""We must send them back to their homeland. I'm talking about the people came in unvetted in the past three and a half years. I'm not talking about the dreamers.""

""Do you want to deport any of the people who've invaded our country in the last three and a half years? Ruben, do want to deport any of them?"" Lake probed.

""Yes, actually we should have a proper deport deportation proceedings,"" Gallego replied. ""But I also think that we shouldn't deport Dreamers.""

ENIGMATIC VOTER GROUP COULD SPLIT TICKET FOR TRUMP, DEM SENATE CANDIDATE IN ARIZONA

""She says she's going to deport people. Will you deport those Dreamers? Just be honest, yes or no,"" Gallego said.

Lake responded that former President Donald Trump wanted to make a deal when it came to Dreamers, which Gallego did not support.

""You said no. Unfortunately, the radical Democrats, like my opponent, would rather use people as political pawns. I want to secure the border,"" Lake said.

Though it was a debate for the Arizona Senate seat, the debate did not shy away from weighing into national waters. Other issues like reducing inflation and re-federalizing Roe v. Wade came up later in the debate.

At one point during the night, Gallego took a swipe at Lake, accusing her of spending more time at Trump's Mar-a-Lago than visiting the border.

Lake also made sure to align herself as a strong Trump ally throughout the night who would restore a ""strong Trump economy,"" while painting Gallego as a supporter of ""Kamala Harris, the border czar, and Joe Biden's open border.""

When it came to abortion, which Democrats have selected as one of their winning platform issues this election cycle, Lake said she opposed a federal abortion ban, but Gallego pointed to her supporting the state's 1864 near-total ban in 2022.

Gallegho said ""it is absolutely abhorrent"" that his 15-month-old daughter ""has less rights in control of her body than her mother and then her grandma."" State law currently bans abortion at 15 weeks gestation.

""And the reason we need to codify [Roe v. Wade] because people like Kari Lake are the ones that make this a dangerous situation,"" he said.

Pro-defund police Dem in key race once threatened to 'kill' and 'bury' man over the phone: police records,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pro-defund-police-dem-in-key-race-once-threatened-to-kill-and-bury-man-over-the-phone-police-records,2024-10-10T16:14:17Z,"FIRST ON FOX: An incumbent House Democrat, who is involved in one of the tightest House races in the country in New Mexico's 2nd Congressional District, threatened to ""kill"" and ""bury"" a fellow student during a dispute while attending college, according to police records obtained and verified by Fox News Digital.

Rep. Gabe Vasquez, while enrolled as a college student at New Mexico State University, was the subject of a police report filed by another student that claimed Vasquez used the ""telephone to terrify, intimidate, threat, harass"" him and threatened to ""kill"" and ""bury"" him.

In the February 2005 police report, obtained by Fox News Digital, Vasquez admitted to making a call that was construed as threatening but apologized and said, according to police, he was ""very upset"" over the condition of a friend of his who was suffering from alcohol poisoning on his birthday after being pressured to drink and later died.

The victim claimed in the police report that in addition to threatening the lives of the people involved, Vasquez used ""several bad words in Spanish.""

Vasquez got off with a warning after promising not to contact the individual again and the matter was closed.

ANDREW CUOMO SLAMS 'DEFUND THE POLICE' MOVEMENT IN FIERY CHURCH SPEECH: 'DUMBEST WORDS EVER UTTERED'

Fox News Digital reached out to the individual who filed the complaint against Vasquez, but he refused to speak about the complaint and said they ""conciliated"" and ""went on with our lives.""

In a statement to Fox News Digital, Vasquez's campaign manager Dylan McArthur said, ""It's sad to see Yvette Herrell stoop as low as using a close college friend's death from nearly 20 years ago to lie about the Congressman's character because she is trying to distract people from her horrible history of wanting to ban all abortion in the state.""

Vasquez's interaction with the police was not the only time that he has had issues with law enforcement.

The year before, Vasquez reportedly had a controversial interaction in New Mexico when he was accused in a police report of using the ""n word"" while calling a former employer of his, the Washington Free Beacon reported.

Vasquez denied being the individual who placed that call in a statement to the Daily Mail saying, ""I have not and would never use language like this, this attack is categorically false.""

BALANCE OF POWER: FIVE RACES THAT COULD DECIDE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE IN NOVEMBER

Police records, first reported by the Washington Free Beacon, also show that in 2005, Vasquez was arrested by the Las Cruces Police Department after neighbors called in a noise complaint. Vasquez is alleged to have attempted to flush marijuana down the toilet before his arrest.

Vasquez was also involved in a domestic dispute with his girlfriend in Las Cruces after an argument over her drinking too much, which led police to his home ""in reference to a possible domestic."" Vasquez was not arrested in that incident, which did not include physical violence.

It has also been reported that Vasquez failed to appear in court in El Paso, Texas, in 2002 for driving without insurance and that a warrant for his arrest was issued in April 2008. That warrant was finally carried out in March of this year, resulting in Vasquez posting a roughly $900 cash bond and pleading no contest, the Washington Free Beacon reported.

Vasquez is running against former New Mexico Congresswoman Yvette Herrell in a race the Cook Political Report ranks as a ""Democrat toss up.""

""Threats to kill and bury someone should not be glossed over,"" Herrell told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""This is extremely dangerous and unhinged behavior from Gabe Vasquez, and he owes New Mexico's Second District an immediate explanation and apology.""

Under the backdrop of Vasquez's run-ins with police departments in New Mexico and Texas, the congressman has advocated for policies that defund police departments.

Vasquez appeared on a local news station seemingly dressed in disguise during the 2020 George Floyd unrest and said, ""It's not just about defunding police, it's about defunding a system that privileges White people over everyone else.""

Vasquez previously vowed he would ""fully support"" cutting in half the police budget of Las Cruces, where he served on the city council, Fox News Digital previously reported.

""I wholeheartedly and absolutely support police reform and the #blacklivesmatter movement, and will not be stopping short of transformational reform that brings justice to our city and to people of color in our community. You can count on my support,"" Vasquez wrote to a constituent demanding ""at least"" a 50% reduction of the Las Cruces police department budget.

In a statement to Fox News Digital in 2022, Vasquez said, ""I oppose defunding the police. As a Las Cruces Councilmember, I repeatedly voted to increase funding for the police and partnered with them, while supporting common sense reforms.""

""Gabe Vasquez has a long track record of extreme verbal abuse,"" NRCC spokeswoman Delanie Bomar told Fox News Digital. ""Between calling a former colleague the n-word and now this, it's very clear that Gabe is not fit to serve in public office, and he does not represent New Mexico values."""
"Hospital that delayed emergency abortion bears blame for Georgia woman's death, family's lawyer claims",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hospital-delayed-emergency-abortion-bears-blame-georgia-womans-death-familys-lawyer-claims,2024-10-10T15:26:29Z,"Two Georgia doctors, one a congressman and the other a state legislator, weigh in on the tragic case of Amber Nicole Thurman and media claims that state laws regulating abortion led to her death.

The family of a Georgia woman who died after undergoing a medication abortion - and was subsequently cited by Democrats as a tragic example of red states' ""restrictive"" abortion laws - is blaming the hospital for the woman's death and readying a lawsuit, according to their attorney.

Amber Thurman, 28, died in 2022 after experiencing complications from taking abortion pills. She traveled to the Piedmont Henry Hospital in Stockbridge to receive a dilation and curettage procedure to remove the remaining tissue from the terminated pregnancy, but hospital staff allegedly waited about 20 hours before performing the procedure.

High-profile civil rights and personal injury attorney Ben Crump will represent the family in their upcoming case against the hospital. Crump pinned blame for Thurman's death on the hospital and not Georgia's recent law that bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, Spectrum News reported.

""Even under Georgia law, the doctors had a duty to act to save Amber,"" Crump said last week. ""She had taken the abortion pills and there were tissues left. There was no viable fetus or anything that would have prevented them from saving her life while she suffered.""

HARRIS ECHOES DEBUNKED CLAIM ABOUT GEORGIA ABORTION LIMITS CAUSING WOMAN'S DEATH DESPITE PUSHBACK FROM DOCTORS

""You have a duty to stabilize her and then give her the option to go to another hospital facility,"" Crump said. ""But you cannot let her suffer and die on your hospital bed when the death is preventable.""

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed the LIFE Act into law in 2019, but it did not take effect until 2022, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which effectively ended the recognition of a constitutional right to abortion.

Thurman's death in August 2022 has since become the first known abortion death since the Supreme Court's decision, with Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, citing her death as the result of ""restrictive"" Republican-backed abortion laws.

Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy."" The law makes exceptions for abortions after the six-week mark, including in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy, or a pregnancy through rape or incest when the probable gestational age of the baby is less than 20 weeks.

ProPublica first published an article on Thurman's death last month, blaming her death and another Georgia woman's death, Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits.

Harris cited Thurman's death on Sunday during an interview on the popular ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast.

""[Thurman] was, as described by her family, so excited and so ambitious, and she had plans. Then she found out she was pregnant, and she didn't want to go through with her pregnancy. And she was living in Georgia, and she couldn't receive care there because she was past six weeks. And so she ended up going to another state, and...she couldn't get there on time. And because the other state had been so overwhelmed by all these women coming from all these southern states who couldn't get treatment in their own state, her window for her appointment had closed and instead of having a surgical procedure, she had medication and basically went back home and then had some complications and went to the hospital because she was bleeding.""

""And they delayed 20 hours before they treated her,"" Harris continued, suggesting that Georgia's laws prevented her from receiving lifesaving care.

In a previous press release announcing Crump would represent Thurman's family members in court, he did blame Thurman's death on Georgia's abortion law.

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

""Amber Thurman's preventable death is a horrifying consequence of draconian abortion laws that put politics ahead of women's lives. These lawmakers bear responsibility for creating hesitation among health care workers, who are fearful of the legal consequences when providing necessary care. Her family deserves accountability for the delays in life-saving care that cost Amber her life. We are committed to seeking justice for Amber and fighting for a country where no other family suffers such a devastating loss due to dangerous, unnecessary legal barriers,"" Crump said in the press release.

OB-GYNs have criticized the recent narrative from Democrats as a misleading story that is pushed by the media.

""I was not surprised to see this pro-abortion media try to point the blame at Georgia's pro-life laws, but, in fact, Georgia's laws allow doctors to intervene to save the life of the woman,"" Charlotte Lozier Institute Vice President and Director of Medical Affairs Dr. Ingrid Skop recently told Fox News Digital.

""I think the focus of the Democratic Party upon abortion as an issue is only because the American people do not understand the laws. Many times, women are hurt by abortions. It is not necessary for women to live their best life. And, of course, it's the fearmongering and lies that have led us to this place where we are today, where people even think there would be a reason to point at the law.""

AMBER NICOLE THURMAN WAS A 'VICTIM OF HIGH-RISK ABORTION DRUGS': DR. CHRISTINA FRANCIS

Thurman's stepfather, Elijah Warren, has called on Democrats, specifically Harris, to stop politicizing the death, saying when he sees politicians talking about Thurman's death, it is ""like a funeral happening over and over.""

""I can see [Harris] using that as the only tool in Georgia against Trump,"" Warren told the New York Post this week.

""She is going to push that; I expect it. But it's too much. It's kind of like a funeral happening over and over again every time I see that.""

Warren said he views Thurman's death, which was caused by septic shock, ""more as a neglect of the hospital"" than the Georgia law.

""They should have watched over my stepdaughter ... The abortion already happened. There wasn't a heartbeat going on,"" he said. ""They should have just cleaned the tissue; that would have saved her life.""

'Somebody with a plan': Swing state voters share their top issues in presidential showdown,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/somebody-plan-swing-state-voters-share-top-issues-presidential-showdown,2024-10-10T09:16:31Z,"CLARK COUNTY, Nev. - Cost of living, immigration and abortion were top concerns for Nevada voters who spoke with Fox News Digital ahead of the presidential election.

""Definitely the economy,"" Nick said. ""I think immigration is a big deal, I just think energy is probably a big one, too. I think people are tired of paying $4 a gallon of gas.""

Bri, a realtor, agreed.

""The inflation seems to be wearing on people,"" she said while out for a morning walk in Henderson. ""I see how it's affecting my clients [and] other people who are looking at purchasing real estate, but they really just don't know what's going to happen with the economy.""

NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION HAS TO 'GET SERIOUS' ABOUT IMMIGRATION, SAY VOTERS IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE

Nevada is one of a handful of states where former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are in a neck-and-neck race.

Joao, a Trump supporter, said illegal immigration is his top priority.

""Close the border,"" Joao said. ""Don't let no one in unless you are [here] legally.""

Donna, who was protesting outside a campaign event for GOP Senate hopeful Sam Brown in Las Vegas, had several priorities including safeguarding legal abortion.

""Even though abortion is protected in Nevada for right now, it's a key issue when I'm talking to other people who are voting,"" Donna told Fox News Digital. ""And they're very concerned about people like Sam Brown and their stance against abortion and a woman's right.""

HISPANIC VOTERS RAIL AGAINST 'DISHONEST' BIDEN-HARRIS BORDER RECORD AS POLL SHOWS TRUMP GAINING IN KEY STATES

Brown supported Texas' 20-week abortion ban during an unsuccessful bid for state office there in 2014, The Nevada Independent reported. More recently, Brown has maintained that, although he is personally pro-life, he would oppose a federal abortion ban.

Jerrie agreed that abortion was among the top issues for Clark County voters, who trend slightly more Democratic than the state as a whole. The rising cost of living also ranked high for him, though.

""Go to the grocery store, you get three items, and there's 50 bucks right there,"" he said.

Who are American evangelicals, and what do they want? This is one of the questions perplexing politicians, pollsters and strategists in the run-up to Election Day.

Recent research from Dr. George Barna conservatively projects a national population of 25 to 30 million adults who qualify as theologically-defined evangelicals - and estimates that one third of them do not vote.

Election Forum estimates that nearly 7 million evangelicals in swing states alone did not vote in the 2020 election. Whether out of disillusionment, disconnection or distrust, millions of would-be Christian voters sat out an election that was decided by tens of thousands of votes.

Both major political parties have tried to appeal to faith voters in a way that demonstrates a partial (at best) understanding of who these Americans are and what they believe. Tactics like concocting candidate faith testimonies, parading denominational ""roots,"" or drumming up doctrinal statements just don't work to activate truth-loving voters.

WHY EVANGELICALS ARE WEDDED TO TRUMP AS HE MAKES A MORE BIBLICAL APPEAL

Recent polling indicates there is no presidential candidate in 2024 with the ability to decisively command the ""Christian"" vote. There are several possible reasons why evangelical Christians have not been energized to turn out as a unified voting bloc.

One such reason is backlash to emotional manipulation in politics. Politicians and their proxies in religious circles have distorted public policy issues to manipulate and confuse well-meaning Christian voters.

Policies like unrestricted abortion and open borders have been painted with a veneer of Christian-like empathy and understanding. Well-funded special interest groups have employed sophisticated measures to influence evangelical voting behavior from within the church.

Christians have lost trust in politicians and surrogates who attempt to hijack their sincerity to provoke sympathy for lawlessness or pressure them into tolerating beliefs that harm those who hold them. But attempts to shame and suppress conservative evangelicals using words like ""political idolatry"" and ""divisiveness"" are no longer working. Christians who are waking up to the fact that niceties do not convert fundamentally bad ideas into good or biblical policies should express this at the ballot box.

'EVANGELICALS FOR HARRIS' HOST HAS SAID 'WHITENESS IS WICKED,' POLICE NEED TO BE 'DESTROYED AND REBUILT'

Second, most Christian voters have not had the opportunity to hear their own pastors speak freely about the issues at stake. Pastors have long been hindered from doing so by the Johnson Amendment, the provision in the Internal Revenue Code that restricts 501 (c)(3) nonprofits, including churches, from making statements of support or opposition to political candidates or even comparing the positions of candidates to Scripture.

Absent such restrictions, this would be a critical time for faithful Christian clergy to speak with one voice to energize and activate their congregations to vote in alignment with their genuine interests and concerns. National Religious Broadcasters recently filed a challenge to the Johnson Amendment to preserve robust First Amendment freedoms in future elections, ensuring that pastors can speak freely on all matters that their faith informs - including issues on the ballot.

But at this stage in the 2024 presidential election, there are very few truly undecided voters. Most evangelical Christians have already concluded which candidates best align with their Christian beliefs and their hopes for America's future. While there may only be a small number of voters still contemplating the choice between former President Trump, Vice President Kamala Harris, or other federal, state or local candidates further down the ballot, many more are wavering between action or inaction. The decision at hand is whether to put their vote into the ballot box.

FAITH VOTERS WILL 'DECIDE THIS ELECTION,' ACCORDING TO PROMINENT GOP MEMBERS

The justification for participating in the 2024 presidential election does not rest on the religious devotion or clean moral track record of any candidate for office. I believe that every Christian has a moral and ethical duty to participate in this election for three main reasons.

First, the magnitude of what this president will inherit cannot be overstated. The job of the 47th U.S. president will not be to charm and delight the U.S. public. On the contrary, the individual who takes the oath of office on Jan. 20, 2025, will be responsible for the following:

An untenable situation at the U.S. southern border, which constitutes a massive humanitarian and public safety crisis billable to the American taxpayer; a dangerously destabilized Middle East, with Iranian missiles sailing into Israel in recent days; the urgency of negotiating peace between Ukraine and Russia; the troubled state of the U.S. economy and much more.

To deliver this job to someone without the strength, fortitude and moral clarity to choose the correct course of action - and do what they say they will do - would be a great disservice to America and to the world.

DEMOCRATS DRIVING RELIGIOUS VOTE AWAY FROM PARTY AS TRUMP COURTS CATHOLICS: 'ANTI-CHRISTIAN' PARTY

Second, the violence and bloodshed surrounding this presidential election is a direct reflection of America's spiritual condition. Trump is only the second U.S. president (after President Gerald Ford) to survive multiple assassination attempts, with the attack on Trump's rally in July resulting in the death and injury of innocent bystanders.

Far from being defined by ""joy,"" the run-up to this election has been murderous and bloodthirsty. The 2024 presidential election has been a national encounter with spiritual darkness. The forces of evil have shown up. Will Christians respond? We must not only pray steadfastly for America's spiritual welfare, but we must show up to vote with determination and resolve come Nov. 5.

Third, Harris and Trump offer two radically different visions for America, implicating serious issues of Christian concern beyond the obvious national priorities.

Trump does not assert that his policies are informed by Christianity or the Bible, but by principles of common sense and consensus-building. Indeed, he has acted with an eye toward pragmatism and political viability on some issues where Christians have asked for stronger commitments. Trump has nonetheless demonstrated openness to persuasion on moral issues and has pledged to safeguard the free exercise of religion and conscience protections that are cherished by religious believers.

NEW 'GOD'S NOT DEAD' FILM INSPIRES CHRISTIANS TO MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD AT BALLOT BOX

Harris has cited faith as a direct justification for her positions and ideas and has asked that faith leaders use their credibility to support these aims. In 2022, Harris told the National Baptist Convention, ""As extremists work to take away the freedom of women to make decisions about their own bodies, faith leaders are taking a stand, knowing one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held religious beliefs to agree that a woman should have the ability to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do.""

One cannot help but conclude that Harris would not favor strong conscience protections for these ""extremists,"" nor spare the taxpayer dollars of her coreligionists from being spent on unrestricted abortion.

Single-issue voters should be aware that there are multiple issues at stake in this election which Scripture addresses clearly. Bound up in these diverging visions for America are numerous proposals that Christian voters must diligently examine from a biblical viewpoint, such as protecting the innocence of children, promoting a culture of life and family formation, empowering parents, ending the unjust weaponization of government and defending against persecution of Christians.

REV. FRANKLIN GRAHAM CALLS OUT 'EVANGELICALS FOR HARRIS' FOR 'TRYING TO MISLEAD PEOPLE' USING HIS FATHER IN AD

If you are not certain of the importance of your voice on Nov. 5, I urge you to further research the policies connected to the names on the ballot. Learn what your candidates are promising to do, and consider whether they can keep their promises. Voters who feel torn by the presidency need to remember that there are issues and candidates up and down the ballot whose decisions will directly impact the state and community where you live.

Christian, your vote will influence the outcome of the 2024 election whether you cast it or not. Our country needs you at the ballot box. As Christians, we willingly render unto Caesar what is Caesar's, and unto God what is God's.

In this era of our nation's history, our elections involve questions of moral good and evil, the lives and health of the next generation, and the future of global peace and security. Christian presence and participation is critical to preserving our nation for the glory of God.

Your duty as a Christian in election season is not to be entertained, amused or cheered up -- but to be a sober-minded and watchful guardian of what God has entrusted us. Make it your mission to convert inertia and inattention among your friends, relatives, and fellow Christians into participation and purpose.

Don't sit this one out. Vote, and encourage others to vote, by Nov. 5."
Progressive journalist unleashes on liberal intolerance that drove her away from Democratic Party,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/progressive-journalist-unleashes-liberal-intolerance-drove-her-away-from-democratic-party,2024-10-10T01:16:40Z,"During a discussion on feminism, progressive pundit for ""The Young Turks,"" Ana Kasparian, took a beat to chastise the left's obsession with identity politics.

""The Young Turks"" co-host Ana Kasparian explained what drove her to ditch the Democratic Party while on Jillian Michaels' ""Keeping It Real"" podcast on Monday.

The progressive media host described feeling ""politically homeless"" over the past few years, as she started seeing an intolerance to debate and the free exchange of ideas as well as an embrace of soft-on-crime policies by the left that she believed were detrimental to society.

She ripped efforts to ""demonize and even dehumanize the other side"" while admitting she used to be a person who believed you could not be friends with conservatives or someone who supported former President Trump. Both women said they identified with disaffected Democrats who now feel unwelcome in their former party.

Kasparian said a turning point for her was when she was scolded by liberals after confessing she was fearful to leave her house after being sexually assaulted by a homeless man while walking her dog in Los Angeles in 2022.

DEMOCRATIC OPERATIVE WHO DITCHED PARTY AFTER DNC BLASTS 'HYPOCRISY': 'I DON'T RECOGNIZE THIS PARTY ANYMORE'

""Before I knew it, I started getting these messages, and it's really, really harsh stuff, about how, 'You are painting a picture of the homeless community. How could you be like this? These are your unhoused neighbors and they need help,'"" she said of the negative messages she received.

""A few people accused me of being racist, even though I had never disclosed the race of the individuals who did this to me. And in fact, they were White,"" Kasparian continued.

""That woke me up,"" Kasparian said. ""Some of the people that I've associated myself with because I thought they were the good people....They definitely have stereotypes in their head and are totally blind to the fact that they have those stereotypes and go around accusing others of being bad actors when they themselves need to do the work.""

Kasparian said she also disagreed with the ""defeatist mentality"" shown towards minorities.

""At some point last year, the other thing that really hit me was the difference between my upbringing and what the Democratic Party espouses,"" Kasparian said.

She described being raised by ""very tough"" parents who taught her to work hard to be self-sufficient and create her own opportunities. While she acknowledged there are obstacles today that some younger people are facing that older generations may not have had to face, she still sees America as a land of opportunity, which she said goes against messaging from the Democratic Party.

""However, we all get to wake up in the morning and make choices for ourselves. And when I hear the Democratic Party constantly disempower people of color, because that's what they're doing,"" she said.

""They keep using this messaging that infantilizes them and makes them seem as though, you know, if it weren't for us White saviors, messing around with these laws and policies, they would never be able to survive. And I find that so gross,"" she continued.

CALIFORNIA EXODUS CONTINUES AS CONSERVATIVE STATES ATTRACT BLUE-STATE RESIDENTS: REPORT

Kasparian gave examples of how a Los Angeles school district scrapped its honor student program because there wasn't enough Hispanic students enrolled in the program.

""That p---d me off,"" Kasparian said. ""It's doing away with an opportunity rather than seeing what the flaws are in our education system and then rising to the occasion to help these students, where we do see the disparity, to get to where we want them to be. That's the right way to approach it. But there's just this weird defeatist mentality. And I'm honestly also very sick of White people going around being offended on behalf of marginalized people.""

""They're just virtue signaling. It's disgusting,"" Michaels agreed.

""We should celebrate people who want to better themselves and better their lives,"" Kasparian said later in a discussion about the ""fat-acceptance"" movement on the far-left.

""Instead, there's this effort to basically tell people, 'you're fine the way you are, you don't need to change a thing,' even if that thing is slowly killing you. It doesn't make any sense,"" she continued.

The pair also said they've seen their home state of California become ""crazy"" over time from when they were growing up.

Michaels, who left California in 2021, has previously shared how the deep blue state's soft-on crime policies drove her and her family to leave and move to Miami.

""Nothing was crazy like this right?"" Michaels told Kasparian. ""Homelessness, crime, advocating for medicalization of children, advocating for late-term abortion?""

Gov. Gavin Newsom is leading the ""madness"" in the state, Michaels said. ""The concern is that it goes from California to a federal problem.""

""Unfortunately, some of the failed policies we've started here have been exported to other states,"" Kasparian agreed.

Democrat Angela Alsobrooks holds a healthy lead over Republican Larry Hogan in Maryland's 2024 U.S. Senate contest, according to a UMBC poll.

The survey was conducted Sept. 23 to Sept. 28. When asked who they would vote for if the Senate contest ""were held today,"" 48% of likely Maryland voters picked Prince George's County Executive Alsobrooks, while just 39% picked former Gov. Hogan, according to the poll.

Vice President Kamala Harris, the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, has endorsed Alsobrooks' Senate bid.

MARYLAND DEMOCRATIC SENATE CANDIDATE SAYS THERE SHOULD BE NO LIMIT ON ABORTION

GOP Presidential nominee Donald Trump told Fox News earlier this year that he would like Hogan to win the Senate race. And when asked whether he was endorsing Hogan, Trump replied, ""Essentially I would be endorsing him, yeah.""

But Hogan indicated that he was not interested in the former president's endorsement, saying during an interview with WTOP, ""I didn't seek it, I didn't wanna have it, and I have no interest in it.""

Hogan has never voted for Trump and has said that he will not vote for Trump in 2024. In 2016, Hogan wrote in his father Larry Hogan Sr., and in 2020, he wrote in the late President Ronald Reagan.

Hogan has said that as a senator, he would support legislation to codify Roe v. Wade into law. Roe was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2022.

He has also indicated that he would not support confirmation of Supreme Court nominees who cannot earn bipartisan support.

""Today, I made a commitment to Maryland that, as Senator, I will only vote for nominees who can earn support from both sides of the aisle,"" the moderate Republican noted in a recent post on X. ""If there's one place that we should not be playing politics, it's appointments to the Supreme Court and the cabinet.

Maryland consistently goes to Democrats during presidential elections. The last Republican to win the state in a presidential contest was George H.W. Bush, who won Maryland in 1988.

The trend appears likely to continue in 2024.

Asked who they would cast their ballot for if the election ""were held today,"" 57% of Maryland likely voters chose Harris while just 35% picked Trump, according to the poll.

Melania Trump speaks out against transgenders in women's sports: 'Seeing that dream collapse',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/melania-trump-speaks-out-against-transgenders-womens-sports-seeing-dream-collapse,2024-10-09T21:10:19Z,"Macy Petty, a Concerned Women for America legislative assistant and an NCAA college volleyball player, discussed the controversy surrounding San Jose State University's volleyball team.

Former first lady Melania Trump has been an advocate for the LGBT community, but where she draws the line is biological men competing in women's sports.

The 54-year-old model and mother spoke out against transgender inclusion in women's sports in an excerpt of her new memoir ""Melania,"" which released on Tuesday. She called the premise of biological men competing in women's sports ""unfair,"" due to natural physical advantages that males hold over females in terms of strength and speed.

""Male bodies generally have physical advantages - muscle strength, height, bone density, and lung capacity - that can affect fairness in competition, even at the high school level,"" she wrote. ""High school athletes often dedicate years to training with the hope of being recruited by universities. Seeing that dream collapse is an unnecessary and avoidable consequence.""

The former first lady also spoke out against groups that are advocating for transgender inclusion in women's sports, and condemned their ideologies.

""Today, some groups attempt to impose their ideologies on everyone, deepening the divisions in our society. One example is the ongoing debate over trans inclusion in sports, specifically when male-born athletes who identify as female compete against women,"" she wrote. ""Some argue that the number of trans-athletes is low, but even one can upset the balance in a female league or tournament due to these physical advantages.""

More than anything, Trump wants what is best for women's athletes. This includes their protection and privacy from men in locker rooms, as well as their financial well-being as their earnings could be impacted by competing against biological males.

""I fully support the LGBTQIA+ community. But we must also ensure that our female athletes are protected and respected,"" she wrote. ""This issue also has broader implications, including the loss of future earning potential as professional athletes and a potential setback for equal pay in sports.""

Her husband, former President Trump, has been a vocal opponent of transgender inclusion in women's sports for years, and has even made it a part of his policy agenda in the upcoming election.

Trump re-affirmed his stance in late August at the annual gathering of Moms for Liberty - a national nonprofit that has spearheaded efforts to keep LGBT identity and critical race theory out of classrooms. The former president preached at the event that transgender women should not be allowed to play in women's sports and said access to gender-affirming health care should be restricted.

GOP GOVERNOR REVEALS WHY HE ORDERED SCHOOLS TO BAR TRANSGENDERS FROM GIRLS SPORTS

The Trump campaign launched a series of ads attacking Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, during NFL football this past Sunday, focused on her stance on transgender inclusion. The ads all contained the slogan ""Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.""

In April, the Biden administration issued a sweeping rule that said Title IX's ban on ""sex"" discrimination in schools covers discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and ""pregnancy or related conditions.""

The rule took effect Aug. 1, and, for the first time, the law stated that discrimination based on sex includes conduct related to a person's gender identity. The Biden administration insisted that the regulation does not address athletic eligibility. However, multiple experts presented evidence to Fox News Digital in June that Biden's claims that it would not result in biological men participating in women's sports weren't true and that the proposal would ultimately put more biological men in women's sports.

The Supreme Court voted 5-4 to reject a Biden emergency request to enforce portions of that new rule that includes protection from discrimination for transgender students under Title IX, after more than two dozen Republican attorneys general sued to block the Title IX changes in their own states.

Trump invited former NCAA swimmer and OutKick contributor Riley Gaines to his rally in Glendale, Arizona, on Aug. 23. Gaines has testified in Georgia about her experience competing against and sharing a locker room with a biological male, Lia Thomas, alongside four other NCAA All-American women athletes in the 2022 NCAA championships. The women filed a lawsuit against the NCAA in March alleging the association knowingly violated Title IX in allowing Thomas to compete.

Gaines lambasted Democrats for their positions on multiple gender identity issues at the event, including transgender inclusion in women's sports.

""They don't believe in school choice; they don't believe in parental rights or the safeguarding of children; they don't believe in freedom unless it's the freedom to have an abortion or chemically and surgically castrate children,"" she said. ""You have one ticket that knows what a woman is and has vowed to take decisive action at protecting our sex-based rights, compared to the other ticket that thinks men can become pregnant and that tampons belong in boys' bathrooms."""
Taylor Swift rubs Brittany Mahomes' pregnant belly after endorsing Harris,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/taylor-swift-rubs-brittany-mahomes-pregnant-belly-after-endorsing-harris,2024-10-09T18:10:54Z,"Brittany Mahomes' baby bump has been touched by the hand of Taylor Swift.

Mahomes is pregnant with her third child with NFL star Patrick Mahomes. The quarterback's wife posted a photo on Instagram on Wednesday that shows Swift rubbing her pregnant belly. The photo was taken at the Chiefs game against the New Orleans Saints on Monday night.

""Same girls, new bump,"" the caption on the post read.

It was the first time Mahomes and Swift were seen together at a Chiefs game this season.

It was also the first time that the pair had been seen together at all since Swift publicly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris on Sept. 10.

Swift did not list any specific policy stance for her endorsement of Harris in her Instagram post. However, in the past, Swift has advocated for abortion, LGBT rights and gun control in multiple interviews, including one with The Guardian in 2019 when she said she believed in telling people who to vote for, despite not watching the news for the sake of her ""mental health.""

Swift has endorsed Democratic candidates dating back to 2018, when she endorsed Democratic candidates Phil Bredesen and Jim Cooper in the 2018 U.S. midterm elections in Tennessee.

Swift's support for Harris prompted a vocal response from former President Donald Trump, who Mahomes has been tied to supporting. Trump posted a message to his Truth Social platform that read ""I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,"" on Sept. 15, and in an interview with ""Fox & Friends"" on Sept. 11, the former president said he ""liked Mahomes much better"" than Swift.

Swift had not been seen in the same room as Mahomes since they were at the U.S. Open men's singles final on Sept 9, when they were seen hugging, until Monday night.

Mahomes had been linked to multiple displays of supporting Trump via social media activity dating back to mid-August.

It started with a simple Instagram like of Trump's 2024 policy platform on Aug. 13. Images of the like were rapidly spread around social media channels, inciting backlash so fierce the pregnant mother posted additional statements to defend herself and her beliefs. Mahomes later liked a comment that said ""TRUMP-VANCE 2024"" on one of her Instagram posts.

Multiple online Swift fan pages contributed to spreading screenshots of Mahomes' initial like of Trump's policy platform, inciting much of the backlash against Swift's friend.

Mahomes' husband Patrick defended and commended her political influence after Trump praised her over Swift on Sept. 11.

""I think you see Brittany does a lot in the community,"" the 28-year-old QB said. ""I do a lot in the community to help bring people up and give people an opportunity to use their voice,"" he said. ""In political times, people are going to use stuff here and there, but I can't let that affect how I go about my business every single day of my life and trying to live it to the best of my ability.""

Patrick himself said he would not endorse a political candidate, but he encouraged Americans to do what is right for ""their families.""

BRETT FAVRE BACKS PATRICK MAHOMES ON PRESIDENTIAL ENDORSEMENT STANCE AMID TRUMP VS. TAYLOR SWIFT CONTROVERSY

""At the end of the day, it's about me and my family and how we treat other people,"" he said.

Brittany and Patrick were born and raised in east Texas and started dating when they attended Whitehouse High School in Whitehouse, Texas. Whitehouse is a town with a population of about 8,500 and has a history of voting Republican, according to Data USA. The couple got married in March 2022 and have two children, 3-year-old daughter Sterling Skye and 1-year-old son Patrick ""Bronze"" Lavon Mahomes III.

Shortly after the scrutiny began about Brittany liking Trump's Instagram content, Patrick wished her a happy birthday on Aug. 31.

On a recent episode of the ""Whoop"" podcast, Brittany said she has leaned on her three-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback husband to get her through the recent public scrutiny.

""Having him to help me get through it has helped a lot because he is very good at managing those things and blocking people out and doing all that type of stuff,"" she said. ""Having him beside me and kind of guiding me, coaching me through it has helped a ton. I think that's kind of gotten to where we are at now.

""I think the main thing he always told me is like, 'Stop caring about what people think, especially the people that don't even know you,'"" she said. ""And so I think social media used to get me a lot, and now it's just like, honestly, I don't give a f--- about what people have to say about me anymore.""

Meanwhile, Swift's boyfriend and Patrick's teammate Travis Kelce has not made an endorsement in the upcoming election either, nor has he commented on her political stances or his own since Swift's endorsement.

However, in March, Kelce told the Los Angeles Times he and Swift shared values after they started dating just a few months earlier, both at the age of 33.

""I think the values that we stand for and just, you know, who we are as people,"" Kelce said when asked why he believed people were so fascinated by their relationship. ""We love to shine light on others, shine light around the people that help and support us. And, on top of that, I feel like we both have just a love for life."""
"Michigan Senate candidates clash on national security, immigration and abortion",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/michigan-senate-candidates-clash-national-security-immigration-abortion,2024-10-09T17:30:01Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Republican former Congressman Mike Rogers clashed over national security, immigration and abortion at a debate Tuesday as each candidate vies to be the next U.S. senator from Michigan.

Retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., has endorsed Slotkin, a three-term lawmaker who currently represents Michigan's 7th Congressional District, to fill her seat. Rogers served in the House from 2001-2015, was chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and has been endorsed by former President Trump.

This race in battleground Michigan is close, though Slotkin has enjoyed an average 5 percentage point lead in public opinion polls. The victor could very well determine which major party gains control of the Senate next year. Fox News' Power Rankings list the Michigan Senate race as Lean D.

The hour-long debate hosted by NBC affiliate WOOD TV was mostly polite and issues-focused. However, there were several times when the candidates accused each other of lying or twisting the facts of their records.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: HARRIS TICKS UP AND SENATE REPUBLICANS TAKE CHARGE

""Dishonest and deceptive,"" Rogers fumed after Slotkin insisted he repeatedly voted to ""privatize or cut Medicare and Social Security"" while he was a member of Congress. ""I'm not even sure she could pass the polygraph test in the CIA anymore,"" he said, referring to Slotkin's former career as a CIA analyst.

Slotkin hit back later after Rogers said she was ""huffing at the microphone"" during a discussion about nuclear power and competition with China.

""It's just sad that a guy who considers himself a national security guy can't see that we need to work together on this issue, not lie repeatedly,"" she said.

Early voting is underway in swing state Michigan and both candidates pitched themselves as willing to work with the other side. Each attacked the other as a partisan.

""We're a very purple state. Lots of Democrats, lots of Republicans,"" Slotkin acknowledged. ""I was voted the 14th most bipartisan member of Congress out of 435.""

She noted that Rogers served as deputy whip in the House, ""the guy who got everyone to vote with the Republicans.""

MICHIGAN DEM LAUNCHES ANTI-EV AD IN BID FOR SENATE RACE AFTER VOTING AGAINST A BIPARTISAN PUSHBACK ON MANDATES

Rogers in turn said Slotkin contributed to high gas prices, inflated grocery bills and increasing crime by ""voting 100% with the Biden-Harris agenda."" He said that if elected to the Senate, he ""will look for every opportunity to be bipartisan.""

The candidates appeared deeply divided on issues of foreign policy, national security, immigration and abortion.

Slotkin framed electric vehicle production in Michigan as a national security issue. ""I don't care what kind of car you want to drive,"" she said, before adding that it will either be ""us or China"" that builds the next generation of vehicles.

""China is eating our lunch on these types of vehicles,"" Slotkin continued, warning that Michigan's auto industry may repeat a historic mistake by ""ceding ground"" to a foreign competitor if America does not invest in EVs.

Rogers accused Slotkin of supporting EV mandates and pointed out, ""85% of everything processed in electric vehicles has to go through China.""

""Why in God's green earth we would cede that auto market to the Communist Party of China is beyond me,"" he said. ""My opponent has multiple times supported EV mandates, trying to pick the cars that our companies have to build and the cars that you're going to have to buy. And by the way, that got us 2,400 layoffs at Stellantis, a thousand layoffs at General Motors. Ford is talking about closing two lines. The CEO of Ford came out and said this is unworkable. It won't work for America.""

The debate became heated as each candidate tried to accuse the other of having a close relationship with China. Rogers repeated allegations he's made on the campaign trail that Slotkin signed a non-disclosure agreement with Gotion, a Chinese-linked company that has received $175 million in taxpayer money to build a battery plant in Big Rapids. Slotkin said her opponent's claims were ""offensive"" and shot back that Rogers was chief security officer of AT&T ""when they were actively working to get Chinese companies into our telecoms."" Rogers denied the charge.

In another exchange on the Middle East, Rogers jabbed at ""my opponent's notion that their somehow serving in Iraq gives permission to be wrong in the entire effort toward Iran."" Slotkin accompanied troops as a CIA analyst during three tours in Iraq.

THE BIDEN-HARRIS EV MANDATES WILL HURT WORKERS IN STATES LIKE MICHIGAN: TUDOR DIXON

When the topic turned to abortion, Rogers said the choice to terminate a pregnancy is ""the most heart-wrenching decision a woman will ever have to make.""

Acknowledging that the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, permitting states to regulate abortion, Rogers said, ""The people of Michigan voted overwhelmingly to make abortion legal in a part of the state constitution of Michigan. I will do nothing when I go back to Washington, D.C., to do anything that would change what the Michigan Constitution, voted on by the people of Michigan, have given us that guidance to go back.""

Slotkin said she would vote for a bill to codify Roe - thereby erasing state restrictions on abortion - and said Rogers could not be trusted on the issue. ""He voted for every single ban, every restriction, every bill that came across his desk to make it harder for a woman and to ban, in some cases, a woman and her right to choose 56 times in total.""

""He voted and sponsored bills that would make it impossible to have IVF and contraception,"" she asserted. ""If he does not trust us to protect our own rights, do not trust him.""

""Deceive and deception,"" retorted Rogers. ""I have come out and talked about making sure that IVF is available for families so they can grow their families. It's a very personal thing for these families, and I support it 100%.""

Slotkin also framed Rogers as a carpetbagger, noting that he was living in Cape Coral, Florida, while Michigan voters took up the abortion question in a ballot initiative in 2022, before Rogers returned to Michigan to run for Senate.

On immigration, Slotkin said the ""system is broken"" and that Congress must do more to secure the border. ""To me, if you are not here legally, you should not be here. You should go back to your home country and be removed to your home country."" She accused Republicans of using the issue as a ""political talking point,"" noting that a bipartisan border security deal in the Senate fell apart after GOP opposition.

Rogers said he was ""delighted to hear that my opponent has had a conversion about border security"" after supporting the Biden administration's policies.

""Here's the thing. You can't vote against the wall. You can't vote against sanctuary cities,"" he continued. ""You cannot do the things that you've been doing in allowing 10 million people to come into our country. We spent something like $450 billion on taking care of illegals' room and board and phones and health care. That's enough money to pay for every Michigan teacher and every Michigan state trooper for 15 years.""

He called the bipartisan bill Slotkin referenced ""a bill to exacerbate and make permanent the problem.""

Tuesday's debate was the first of two planned debates between the Senate hopefuls. A second debate hosted by Detroit's WXYZ-TV Channel 7 is scheduled for next Monday."
Trump has 9-point lead on most important issue to voters: poll,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-has-9-point-lead-most-important-issue-voters-poll,2024-10-09T16:16:12Z,"CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten said that if the 2024 presidential election polls are as off as they were in 2020, former President Trump ""wins in a blowout.""

New polling shows former President Trump has a 9-point lead over Vice President Kamala Harris when it comes to handling the economy, the single most important issue for voters going into the 2024 presidential election.

The new poll from Gallup found that 54% of Americans say Trump is more capable of handling the economy, compared to 45% for Harris. The economy ranked as the most important issue for Republicans and for all Americans, but it didn't rate in the top five for Democrats.

Veteran Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf says Democrats are simply confident in Harris' plan to handle the economy.

""Independents are looking for a reason to vote for a candidate, but they just haven't found it yet,"" Sheinkopf told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""Americans focus on the issue most important to them in every election. This time it's their pockets. And they are still feeling pain no matter what candidates say. Time is running out for Harris to prove she can make it better.""

He went on to argue that the economy is no less politicized an issue as immigration or abortion, suggesting polarization has an outsized impact on voter's opinions on the economy.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW

For Republicans, the top issues after the economy are immigration, terrorism and national security, crime and taxes.

For Democrats, the top issue is democracy in the U.S., followed by the type of Supreme Court justices a candidate would pick, abortion, health care and education.

Trump also holds leads over Harris on immigration (54%-45%) and foreign affairs (52%-47%). Harris holds her own leads on the top issues for Democrats, however, including health care (54%-44%), abortion (56%-40%) and climate change (61%-35%).

Climate change ranks as the least important issue for Republicans, with just 5% saying it is a priority. The least important issues for Democrats are the federal budget deficit and trade with other nations, both tied at 16%.

Gallup conducted the poll from Sept. 16-28, surveying 941 registered voters via telephone interviews on cellphones and landlines. The poll advertises a margin of error of 4%.

A New York Times/Siena College survey released on Tuesday found that Harris has a slight lead over Trump in a national poll. The survey found that Harris stands at 49% support among likely voters nationwide, with the former president and GOP nominee at 46%.

According to the poll, Harris stands at 47% and Trump at 44% in a multi-candidate field. Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver each grabbed 1%, with roughly 7% supporting another candidate or undecided.

Harris' edge - which is within the survey's sampling error - is up from the New York Times/Siena poll from last month, when the two major party nominees were deadlocked at 47%.

""Vote for someone who is going to move us forward into the next iteration of our country,"" Rep. Nikema Williams, D-Ga., told Fox News Digital in an interview roughly a month before Election Day.

""We are tired of the vision of Donald Trump and his Republican Party, because right now what we know is there are Republicans out there willing to put country over party, and we need more like-minded people willing to do that.""

Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign has sought to make inroads with a litany of different voting blocs, including those that traditionally skew Republican.

GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO WIN BACK PEACH STATE

Likely nowhere will that strategy prove more critical than Georgia, which Democrats are fighting to hold onto after President Biden took the Peach State by less than 1% in 2020, breaking a yearslong streak of the state voting Republicans into the White House.

Williams, who took over as state party chair in 2019 and was elected to Congress in 2020, said Democrats were not taking those recent victories for granted when asked how the Left's strategy has shifted since then.

""When I became chair in 2019, nobody believed that Georgia was in play,"" Williams said. ""We are a true battleground state, which means we have to talk to every voter, take nothing for granted.""

SPEAKER JOHNSON RIPS 'LACK OF LEADERSHIP' IN BIDEN ADMIN'S HELENE RESPONSE: 'ALARMED AND DISAPPOINTED'

The Democratic leader said the state party's organizing efforts spanned all of Georgia's 159 counties, with nearly 30 field offices and more than 200 paid staffers.

""We've got to have conversations with the voters about the issues that matter to them. I'm hearing about people who are so concerned that their freedom and our freedoms are on the ballot,"" Williams said.

When pressed later about what issues voters are most concerned about, Williams suggested abortion access was a top topic.

She referenced the death of 28-year-old Amber Thurman, a Georgia mother who died after allegedly being denied emergency abortion care for 20 hours after a rare complication from abortion pills.

Democrats and pro-choice activists have blamed her death on the Republican Georgia state government's recent law banning abortion after six weeks except in cases of rape, incest, or medical emergencies.

Republicans and pro-life groups have pushed back on those attacks, however. They have instead blamed Thurman's death on complications caused by the abortion pills she took, and argued that there was nothing stopping doctors from performing surgery on her after the fetus's heartbeat was already stopped.

FORMER REPUBLICAN US SENATOR ENDORSES KAMALA HARRIS, SAYS ELECTION OFFERS 'STARK CHOICE'

""She has an eight-year-old son growing up without a mother. But it doesn't have to be this way. These are policy decisions,"" Williams said.

Meanwhile, both the Harris and Trump campaigns have courted Georgia's Black population -- voters who were key to Biden's 2020 victory.

Trump has made it a point in particular to try to appeal to Black and brown men, a group of voters who Republicans believe are growing disenchanted with Democrats' progressive policies.

Williams said Black voters were ""not a monolith,"" however, and signaled that the Harris campaign is also working to appeal to as many people as possible.

""We can't win this election based on any one demographic group. We're building multiracial coalitions here on the ground in battleground Georgia, and we're going to continue to do that,"" Williams said.

""It proved successful in 2020. It proved successful in our run-offs in 2021 and again in 2022 when we sent our senator, Reverend Raphael Warnock, back for a full six-year term. And we're going to do it again in November."""

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz pulled back the curtain to reveal the odd pseudonym he uses for his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris, on his phone.

During his late-night debut on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" this Monday, the Democratic politician told the host he put her contact name in his phone as ""My dry cleaner.""

""They told me to come up with something and that was all I could think of,"" Walz added.

When Kimmel asked what would happen if Walz's actual launderer called him, he said he didn't think that far ahead, while Kimmel joked that he should update his dry cleaner's name to ""Madam Vice President.""

Walz also divulged the tale of how he initially ignored Harris' call to tell him he was her VP pick because he didn't recognize the number and thought it was ""a car warranty thing,"" prompting a call from a ""high-ranking aide"" to convince him to pick up the call.

To date, Vice President Harris and Walz have done a combined 31 interviews while former President Trump and his running mate JD Vance have spoken with various media outlets about multiple issues concerning voters across 69 interviews leading up to election day.

Walz's appearance on the late-night show followed Harris' highly criticized appearance on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast the day before.

During a 44-minute sit down interview with podcast host Alex Cooper, Harris touched on the controversial issues surrounding domestic violence and abortion.

During her interview with Cooper, Harris repeated the debunked claim that a woman in Georgia died due to delayed care as a result of the state's abortion limits, despite doctors previously denouncing the narrative as false.

Oscar-winning actress Sally Field shared her experience of undergoing a ""horrific"" ""life-altering"" illegal abortion as a teenager in a new video posted to social media, pleading with Americans to support Vice President Kamala Harris and ""reproductive freedom"" at the ballot box.

""I've been so hesitant to do this, to tell my horrific story. It was during a time even worse than now. A time when contraception was not readily available and only if you were married. But I feel that so many women of my generation went through similar, traumatic events and I feel stronger when I think of them. I believe, like me, they must want to fight for their grandchildren and all the young women of this country,"" Field, 77, wrote on Instagram.

""I still feel very ashamed of it because I was raised in the '50s and it's ingrained in me,"" Field said to start the video.

She explained how she didn't have any family support or finances when she became pregnant at 17. A family friend, who was a doctor, along with his wife and her own mother, drove Field to Mexico to have an illegal abortion, she said.

""It was beyond hideous and life-altering,"" she said, explaining she had no anesthesia except for a few ""puffs of ether"" given by the technician. She also said the technician was molesting her during the procedure.

""It was this absolute pit of shame,"" she recalled.

When it was over, Field said she was rushed out, ""like the building was on fire."" She thanked her doctor for his ""generosity and bravery"" in risking his license to help her get an abortion.

Field said her experience was similar to other young women's experiences during that time. As ""fate"" would have it, she said, later that year she was cast in her breakout role as ""Gidget"" in the 1960s television series of the same name.

She warned that ""we can't go back"" to the time when abortions were illegal in the United States. Field urged voters to back Harris and other candidates and ballot initiatives that protect abortion rights this election.

""It's one of the reasons why so many of us are supporting Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Everyone, please, pay attention to this election, up and down the ballot, in every state - especially those with ballot initiatives that could protect reproductive freedom. PLEASE.

DOJ accuses popular gym chain of discriminating against disabled people,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/doj-accuses-popular-gym-chain-discriminating-disabled-people,2024-10-08T21:48:53Z,"A man is in jail after he stabbed another man in the buttocks after an alleged dispute over a workout machine. (FOX 7)

The Department of Justice (DOJ) is accusing LA Fitness of discriminating against disabled people in a lawsuit that was announced on Tuesday.

In a press release published by the DOJ, the agency explained that it was suing Fitness International LLC - the company that owns LA Fitness - for ""discriminating against people with disabilities at its gym and fitness clubs.""

The DOJ is asking the Central District of California to ""stop LA Fitness from discriminating against people with disabilities, including by requiring LA Fitness to make its facilities and equipment accessible.""

According to the DOJ, LA Fitness discriminated against disabled people because some of the chain's amenities were not sufficiently accessible. The press release referenced broken pool lifts, broken elevators and broken equipment.

The chain is also accused of charging disabled patrons an extra fee for certain services. The lawsuit seeks money damages for the people who were ""harmed by LA Fitness's discrimination.""

""This includes people who were directly harmed by LA Fitness's barriers to access and broken equipment, as well people who need help to use LA Fitness's clubs and were charged extra fees to have a friend, nurse or personal assistant help them use LA fitness facilities,"" the press release noted.

LA Fitness, one of the largest chain gyms in the U.S., operates nearly 700 clubs across the country. The DOJ's lawsuit hinges on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which was passed in 1990 to ""establish a clear and comprehensive prohibition of discrimination on the basis of disability.""

""The ADA requires LA Fitness to give people with disabilities equal access to LA Fitness's services and facilities, remove architectural barriers to make its facilities accessible to people with disabilities and maintain accessible features,"" the DOJ argued.

""The ADA also prohibits LA Fitness from charging extra fees to people with disabilities.""

In a statement, Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said that access to physical health activities is ""crucial for promoting the health and well-being of all individuals, including those with disabilities.""

""For over 30 years, the ADA has prohibited gyms and fitness clubs like LA Fitness from denying patrons with disabilities the opportunity to use and enjoy facilities enjoyed by patrons without disabilities,"" Clarke said. ""Through this lawsuit, the department seeks to remedy LA Fitness's discriminatory actions and ensure that patrons with disabilities have equal access to fully participate at their local LA Fitness gym and fitness clubs.""

Fox News Power Rankings: The biggest surprises come after October,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-power-rankings-biggest-surprises-come-after-october,2024-10-08T13:04:54Z,"Fox News Poll Republican partner Daron Shaw on how Trump and Harris are polling with significant voter groups and in swing states ahead of the general election.

A Democratic win in Indiana. A Republican victory in New Mexico. And an election where Missouri was decided by less than 4,000 votes.

They've all happened in the last twenty years.

These results are little more than trivia questions today (the answers are 2008, 2004, and 2008 again). At the time, they raised eyebrows and changed our understanding of the electorate.

Surprises happen on election week. And when the national race looks this close, one unexpected flip can decide who wins the White House.

Vice President Harris still has the edge in this week's forecast. It predicts that Harris will take home at least 241 electoral college votes to Trump's 219.

Her advantage is no larger than it was in September, and as this column has mentioned, battleground states are usually - and mostly - won and lost together. The six toss-up states in this forecast are worth 78 votes, enough to give either candidate a victory on election night.

National polls show a tight race: a Quinnipiac survey has Harris and former President Trump tied at 48%-48% with likely voters, while Marist has the candidates at 50%-48%, well within the polls' margins of sampling error.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: TRUMP MAINTAINS LEAD ON TWO TOP ISSUES

Neither poll shows Trump slipping with the national electorate. Other recent polls showed a point worth of erosion after the September presidential debate.

Battleground state polls have been sparse. (Hurricane Helene has devastated communities in Georgia and North Carolina, and Hurricane Milton will soon make landfall in Florida. This will affect the accuracy of polling in these areas.)

Overall, this race is still anyone's game.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance debated a week ago in New York City. Vance mostly broke through the character that Democrats had constructed for him, while Walz stumbled out of the gate.

A flash poll showed neither candidate winning the night. As always, wait for results from multiple polls conducted in the weeks after the debate to properly assess the polling impact.

That was the only scheduled event that could surprise voters this month. (Fox News Media has proposed a second Harris-Trump debate later in October.)

Of course, it's the unexpected events in years past that have done more to reshape the race. And events in two categories have already resurfaced.

FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS CITE HIGH PRICES AS BIGGEST MOTIVATOR TO VOTE

Polarization will limit the impact of these events on the horserace. But watch Harris and Trump's support with independents over the coming weeks. Those voters made up 5% of the electorate in 2020, and they broke for President Biden by 15 points; recent polls put Harris in that ballpark. Trump likely needs to claw that back to win the race.

Two states that could surprise in November

There are nine ""likely"" races on the Power Rankings map. The two that would have the biggest impact on the race are Florida and Virginia.

Former President Trump improved his performance in Florida in the 2020 presidential election, bringing his margin up to about 372,000 votes.

That's a win of 3.4 points, or his second-closest victory of the cycle. (The closest was North Carolina, a toss-up in the rankings, which he won by 1.3 points.)

Republicans have strong advantages. The state's White working-class and senior voters lean towards Trump, while its large Hispanic population, particularly the Cuban and Venezuelan communities, has shifted right in recent years.

The GOP won big at every level in the midterms and enjoys a 1 million-plus voter registration advantage, and most tellingly, the Democratic Party is not making significant investments.

Democrats hope that a competitive Senate race, where incumbent Republican Rick Scott has personally spent more than $8 million, means the presidential election is closer than people think. Florida is also one of three competitive states with an abortion measure on the ballot.

It would take a blowout night for Harris to flip the Sunshine State. It would also be the first state after the battlegrounds to go blue.

Florida stays at Likely R in the rankings.

A win for Trump in Virginia would also be shocking, especially since Biden won this state by more than 10 points in 2020.

The state has a higher proportion of Black, suburban, and college-educated voters than the rest of the country, and all three groups help Democrats run up the margin. While Republicans talked about Virginia after the June presidential debate, the race has changed, and neither party is making big investments in the state today.

Some polls show a race that isn't over for the GOP. A survey from Virginia Commonwealth University in September put Harris at 47% with registered voters and Trump at 37%. A poll from the Washington Post earlier in the month had Harris at 50% to Trump's 42%.

Still, it would take a blowout in the other direction for the Old Dominion to reject Harris. Virginia remains a Likely D race.

Four weeks until election night

More than 1.5 million voters have cast their ballot as the countdown to election night continues. Early voting has now begun in:"

""Democrats, they're such a frightened group of people,"" Moore said during a Monday interview on CNN. ""I mean, they still think that Trump is going to win.""

MICHAEL MOORE WARNS KAMALA HARRIS TO NOT GO 'CENTRIST'

CNN anchor Brianna Keilar asked Moore if he believed polling which shows the race is close.

According to the latest national Fox News poll from September, Harris currently holds a two-point edge over Trump with voters.

""I don't think it's a dead heat,"" Moore responded. He clarified that while he wasn't outright dismissing polling, he had more faith in surveys that questioned voters on the issues, rather than the candidates.

He pointed to polling misses from the 2016 campaign, such as when The New York Times predicted on Election Day, 2016, that Hillary Clinton had an 85% chance at winning the presidential election.

""No, I don't think people should be running their lives based on these polls,"" he said.

BLUE PHILLY WORKING-CLASS VOTERS START LEANING TOWARD TRUMP AHEAD OF THE ELECTION: 'PEOPLE ACTUALLY LOVE HIM'

Moore ripped Democrats pushing Harris to the center because of these concerns, arguing that the VP's progressive policy positions on abortion, the environment, guns and jobs are actually in the mainstream.

""You mentioned Democrats who want [Harris] to 'tone it down,'"" Moore continued. ""That's something women have been told for decades.""

""The reason she's so progressive -- because she believes in a woman's right to choose, she believes a 14-year-old shouldn't take an assault rifle to school....you go down all her positions and they line up exactly with where the majority of Americans are at,"" he continued.

""The majority of Americans believe climate change is real. The majority of Americans believe the minimum wage is too low. Just go down the list,"" Moore argued.

""The majority of Americans want regulation. They want people to be making sure that, when you have a hurricane and only 1% of the people have flood insurance -- That's not the country I live in. That's not the country I'm going to live in, where people now are suffering because of this,"" he said, referring to devastation from Hurricane Helene.

Last week, Moore warned Harris to not ""move to the center"" or it could backfire for Democrats.

""If Harris is advised by her wealthy donors to shun the left and drop her more progressive positions in favor of a 'move to the center,'"" Moore warned in a post on Substack, that could ""reduce or depress the vote."""
"Early voting kicks off in Indiana, New Mexico, Ohio, Wyoming",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/early-voting-indiana-new-mexico-ohio-wyoming,2024-10-08T09:15:20Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Four more states began their early voting processes on Tuesday: Indiana, New Mexico, Wyoming and the major swing state of Ohio.

Here is everything you need to know about casting a ballot in each of the states.

Ohio is home to one of the most competitive Senate races on the map.

Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown has won the Midwestern state three times, but with Trump pushing White working-class voters toward the GOP and record spending from both parties, this is set to be a tight race. Brown faces Republican businessman Bernie Moreno.

Republicans have made inroads in the northeastern and heavily industrial areas bordering Pennsylvania. Trumbull County flipped to the GOP in 2016, and Trump increased his margin to 10 points in 2020; Mahoning County flipped in 2020 by almost two points. These counties played a key role in Trump's statewide wins.

Democrats are performing better than ever in the ""three C's"": Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. These areas have the highest percentages of college-educated voters. President Biden won the counties home to these cities by double-digit margins in 2020, with roughly 30-point wins in Franklin (Columbus) and Cuyahoga (Cleveland).

Unlike in other competitive states, Republicans still hold up in Ohio's suburban and exurban areas, particularly those surrounding Cincinnati.

Ohio's Senate race is a toss-up and the presidential race is ranked Likely R on the Fox News Power Rankings.

Meanwhile, New Mexico is also in the ""likely"" column, both at the presidential and senate level. The state delivered Biden an 11-point win in 2020, but Latino or Hispanic voters made up 35% of the state's electorate in the 2020 election, and those voters' support for the Democrat ticket has wavered in recent polls.

Republicans would need to run up their margins with these voters all across the state and keep Harris at bay in places like Do√±a Ana County, home to Albuquerque and which last voted for Biden by 18 points, to pull off a victory.

Voting also begins today in four House districts ranked Lean or Toss Up on the Fox News Power Rankings. For a full list of competitive races, see the latest Senate and House rankings.

"Kamala 2.0's challenge? Making more news, and not just with ultra-friendly hosts",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-2-0s-challenge-making-more-news-not-just-ultra-friendly-hosts,2024-10-08T07:11:26Z,"For well over a month, Kamala Harris rode a wave of the most positive press any presidential candidate has gotten in two decades, and her own skills, to turn what had been a lost cause for the Democrats into an extremely tight race.

But does she have a second act?

Kamala 2.0, under constant attack by Donald Trump and the Republicans, doesn't have much new to say. She is conducting a play-it-safe campaign, like a basketball team sitting on a lead and running out the clock.

But Harris doesn't have a lead in the three ""blue wall"" midwestern states she needs to win, and the loss of any one of them could hand Trump the presidency once again.

VANCE-WALZ VP DEBATE ENDED IN A 'DRAW': DEMOCRAT REP. DEBBIE DINGELL

For all the focus on Pennsylvania, Harris leads by 0.7 percent in Michigan - a statistical tie, based on the Real Clear Politics average.

On Sunday's ""Media Buzz,"" Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell told me her state could go either way.

""The vice president has a problem with union workers,"" Dingell said. ""Many of the men, as well as, quite frankly, African-American young men who have said to me, I was with a group with them last week. 'You know what, Donald Trump talks to us. Democrats take us for granted.'""

The lawmaker recalls how ""everybody got mad at me"" when she predicted in 2016 that Trump would win Michigan - which he did, along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

A major problem for Harris is that she doesn't seem to know how to make news. With less than 30 days to go, with many voters understandably believing they don't know her, or enough about her policies, since she took over for Joe Biden, the VP is stitching together parts of her stump speech and recycling the same anecdotes virtually verbatim.

A presidential candidate has to deliver a few new lines, a new proposal, something to break into the news cycle, which is currently being dominated by Trump.

So what's on this week's agenda? Kamala will sit down with Howard Stern (who is totally against his old pal Donald); ""The View,"" where the ladies despise Trump, and Stephen Colbert, who hosted fundraisers for Joe Biden in 2020 and this year.

For good measure, she's also spoken to Alex Cooper, whose podcast, ""Call Your Daddy,"" is about sex.

WHY VANCE EASILY BEAT WALZ IN DEBATE, SOFTENING HIS IMAGE IN THE PROCESS

I'll go out on a limb here and say these sessions are designed to be friendly - not unlike the conversation with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle, who kept agreeing with Harris and had just pronounced Trump a danger to democracy.

In fairness, Harris also sat for a ""60 Minutes"" interview, an invitation declined by Trump.

Look, there's nothing wrong with candidates showing their softer side with unorthodox outlets in our fragmented media universe. We've come a long way since critics scoffed at candidate Bill Clinton answering the ""boxers or briefs"" question on MTV, calling it unpresidential.

On ""Call Your Daddy,"" Harris was actually quite thoughtful in responding to Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying that her kids keep her humble and the VP doesn't have anyone to keep her humble.

Rather than jab at the Arkansas governor, which would have produced a cheap headline, she ruminated that families come in all shapes, bound by blood or love, that she is deeply involved with her stepchildren, and this isn't the 1950s anymore. They also discussed, uh, tampons.

Still, the party is getting nervous. ""Democratic operatives, including some of Kamala Harris' own staffers,"" says Politico, ""are growing increasingly concerned about her relatively light campaign schedule, which has her holding fewer events than Donald Trump and avoiding unscripted interactions with voters and the press almost entirely.""

Since the convention, the veep has spent more than a third of days on meeting and briefings, with no public events.

With early voting under way in more than half the states, Politico describes this ""a do-no-harm, risk-averse approach to the race.""

GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO WIN BACK PEACH STATE

Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan, who fervently doesn't want Trump to win, nonetheless is whacks Harris pretty hard:

""She hasn't fleshed out her political intent -- what she stands for, what she won't abide, what she means to establish, what she won't let happen.

What is her essential mission? Is it national 'repair,' is it to 'stabilize' an uncertain country, is it 'relaunch'?..

""She so far hasn't conveyed a sense of intellectual grasp. Her campaign has placed too many chips on the idea of the mood, the vibe, the picture.""

And vibes can only take you so far.

But the VP has certain duties, and spent two days visiting hurricane victims and relief workers in North Carolina and Georgia-which also happens to be good politics. She also met with Volodomyr Zelenskyy.

Harris attended a fundraiser over the weekend. Why bother? Her campaign has already had $400 million roll in. She's already outspending Trump 2-¬Ω to 1 on ads. She doesn't need any more money. What's more, Harris doesn't make news at these fundraisers, which in any event are off camera. A ground game is great, but it has to be married to a winning message.

Here's one more: Dan Pfeiffer, a former top Obama White House official, says on Message Box, his Substack column, that ""the media -- and Politico Playbook in particular -- are fuming over the Harris-Walz media strategy.""

Kamala ""must be on offense at all times -- say new things, be edgy enough to get attention, and dictate the terms, or the campaign could ""take on water...In this media world, there is a never-ending, insatiable appetite for content. Either serve lunch or become the menu...

""Dominating attention is Trump's political superpower...Even when he doesn't have a big moment, Trump speaks so outrageously that it shifts attention to his issues of choice.""

Now it's easy to snipe from the sidelines. For Harris to be neck and neck in the core battleground states means she's obviously done many things right. She had to overhaul the Biden operation and vet a running mate while the campaign was in full swing, like changing the tires on a speeding hot rod. She could still win.

One positive sign: The Harris camp took off the bubble wrap and allowed Tim Walz to appear on ""Fox News Sunday."" This was an attempt at damage control, since he lost the debate so badly to JD Vance.

While Shannon Bream repeatedly pressed the governor on late-term abortions, his Minnesota record and his history of falsehoods and exaggerations, Walz was far more forceful than he'd been in the CBS debate. He ducked certain questions, but an interview format is much better suited to him than friendly exchanges with his opponent.

Walz's next stop? A man who relishes his feuds with Trump, Jimmy Kimmel."
SEAN HANNITY: Harris and Biden have been completely missing in action,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/sean-hannity-harris-biden-have-been-completely-missing-action,2024-10-08T02:15:46Z,"Fox News host Sean Hannity analyzes 2024 election polls and Vice President Kamala Harris' upcoming interviews on 'Hannity.'

Fox News host Sean Hannity reveals why Vice President Kamala Harris is now doing interviews before the election on ""Hannity.""

SEAN HANNITY: There is one huge reason, and only one reason, that Kamala is now going on and doing any interviews. Her internal poll numbers have got to be horrendous. Now, meanwhile, the publicly available poll numbers from the most credible pollsters in 2016 and 2020 and swing states we've been showing you (are) not great for Kamala Harris.

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

She is down in multiple polls in Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia. The race is even tighter in Virginia, where Kamala holds a slight lead. A brand new Yahoo News poll shows Trump surging nationwide.

Harris is desperately trying to make up ground. That's why she's finally doing friendly interviews, but lapping it up with Trump-hater Howard Stern, those hard-hitting interviewers on ""The View"" and Stephen Colbert, who's dull as dirt, or the ""Call Me Daddy"" podcast, while millions of Americans are suffering the devastating effects of Hurricane Helene and another major hurricane on the way, is not exactly the best look for the vice president when she and Joe Biden have been completely missing in action."
Georgia high court restores state's 6-week 'heartbeat' abortion law,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-high-court-restores-states-six-week-heartbeat-abortion-law,2024-10-07T22:07:07Z,"Abortion Survivors founder Melissa Ohden breaks down how Governor Tim Walz has changed Minnesota's abortion laws during an appearance on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.'

The Georgia Supreme Court on Monday stopped a lower court's ruling from last week that allowed abortions up to 22 weeks, as opposed to six weeks, as it considers an appeal filed by the state.

The order from the state Supreme Court came a week after Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled that abortions must be regulated the way they were before the ""Heartbeat Law"" went into effect, meaning abortions could be allowed until the 22-week mark.

The Associated Press reported that Justice John J. Ellington argued against McBurney's ruling, saying the case ""should not be predetermined in the State's favor before the appeal is even docketed.""

""The State should not be in the business of enforcing laws that have been determined to violate fundamental rights guaranteed to millions of individuals under the Georgia Constitution,"" Ellington wrote. ""The 'status quo' that should be maintained is the state of the law before the challenged laws took effect.""

GEORGIA JUDGE OVERTURNS STATE'S 6-WEEK 'HEARTBEAT' ABORTION LAW, CALLS IT 'UNCONSTITUTIONAL'

Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed the ""Heartbeat"" abortion bill, also known as the Living Infants Fairness and Equality Act, into law in 2019. The law made abortions after the six-week mark illegal.

McBurney called the law ""unconstitutional.""

""The authors of our Constitutions, state and federal, entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning,"" McBurney wrote in his final order last week. ""A review of our higher courts' interpretations of 'liberty' demonstrates that liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.

GEORGIA GOV BRIAN KEMP SIGNS CONTROVERSIAL 'HEARTBEAT' BILL INTO LAW

""That power is not, however, unlimited,"" the judge added. ""When a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then - and only then - may society intervene.""

McBurney continued by saying a law that prevents abortions after six weeks was inconsistent with those rights as well as the proper balance that a viability rule establishes between a woman's rights and society's interests in protecting and caring for unborn infants.

There were exceptions written into the law Kemp signed in 2019, including rape and incest as long as a police report was filed.

GEORGIA ABORTION LAW: A LOOK BACK AT WHAT HOLLYWOOD PRODUCTION COMPANIES HAVE SAID ABOUT FILMING IN THE STATE

The law signed by Kemp was blocked by a federal judge in October 2019 - before it went into effect - and ruled it violated the right to abortion as established by Roe v. Wade in 1973.

The Supreme Court then overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, clearing the way for Georgia's law on abortion to go into effect.

McBurney, in November 2022, ruled the law was ""unequivocally unconstitutional"" because it was enacted in 2019 when Roe v. Wade allowed abortions after six weeks.

But in October 2023, the Georgia Supreme Court rejected the ruling in a 6-1 decision, saying McBurney was wrong.

McBurney's ruling last week determined that the state, county, municipal and other local authorities are ""enjoined"" from seeking to enforce the six-week abortion law."

With less than a month to go until Election Day in November, a new poll indicates Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Trump among self-identified Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada, two crucial southwestern battleground states.

But Trump has made gains with younger male Hispanic voters compared to four years ago, according to a pair of Suffolk University/USA Today surveys released on Monday.

According to the poll, Harris leads Trump 57%-38% among Hispanic voters in Arizona, with Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver both under 1% support. Three percent of voters remain undecided. When asked how they voted in the 2020 election, 55% of those Hispanic voters said they voted for President Biden, while a third said they voted for Trump.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW

The vice president's lead over the former president is slightly smaller in neighboring Nevada, at 56%-40%. According to the survey, Independent American Party's Joel Skousen is just over 1%, Libertarian Chase Oliver is under 1%, and 2% are undecided. When asked how they voted in the 2020 election, 56% said they voted for Biden, while 33% said they voted for Trump.

""So far, Harris is falling short of the 24-26 point advantage that Joe Biden carried with Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada in 2020, according to the exit polls from those states,"" Suffolk University Political Research Center director David Paleologos highlighted. ""This Democratic shortfall is largely due to young Hispanic men.""

In both states, a majority of men under 50 years of age are choosing Trump over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 53%-40% among Hispanic men ages 18-34 in Nevada, and tops her 53%-39% among Hispanic men ages 35-49.

In Arizona, the Republican presidential nominee leads the Democratic Party standard-bearer 51%-39% among Hispanic men ages 18-34, and 57%-37% among Hispanic men ages 35-49.

TIGHTEST PRESIDENTIAL RACE SINCE 2000 - WITH ONE MONTH UNTIL ELECTION DAY

The economy and immigration were the top two issues on the minds of those questioned in the survey in both states.

Arizona and Nevada have referendums to protect access to abortion on the ballot in November - and the poll indicates majority support for the measures in both states.

Arizona and Nevada - along with Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin - had razor-thin margins in the 2020 presidential election that decided Biden's victory over Trump. And all seven states are likely to determine if Harris or Trump wins the 2024 election in the race for the White House.

The latest surveys in Arizona and Nevada - as well as the other five swing states - indicate margin-of-error races between Harris and Trump.

Supreme Court denies Biden administration appeal over federal emergency abortion requirement in Texas,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-denies-biden-administration-appeal-over-federal-emergency-abortion-requirement-texas,2024-10-07T15:06:02Z,"Abortion Survivors founder Melissa Ohden breaks down how Governor Tim Walz has changed Minnesota's abortion laws during an appearance on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.'

The U.S. Supreme Court decided not to hear oral arguments about whether a Texas state abortion ban is at odds with a federal emergency care law - permitting the ban in the Lone Star state to be upheld.

Supreme Court justices, for now, are keeping in place a lower court ruling that hospitals in Texas can deny terminating certain emergency pregnancies that violate state law, despite the federal requirement.

The Biden administration had requested that the justices overturn the lower court's ruling, contending that federal law requires hospitals to provide abortions in emergency situations. They referenced last term, when the Supreme Court permitted emergency room abortions to continue in Idaho while a lawsuit continues in federal court. Texas is asserting that its laws are distinct from Idaho's because Texas has a health exception for pregnant patients.

TEXAS SUPREME COURT REJECTS CHALLENGE TO STATE ABORTION BAN'S MEDICAL EXCEPTIONS

In Texas, the central legal issue is whether the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which mandates hospitals to treat emergency conditions, overrides state laws that prohibit abortion in emergencies. The case focuses on whether a state can stop an emergency physician from performing an abortion if it's necessary to stabilize a pregnant woman's health.

Previously, the Texas Supreme Court ruled in June against a group of women who suffered serious pregnancy complications and became the first in the country to testify in court about being denied abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022.

In a unanimous ruling, the court upheld the Texas law after the women filed a lawsuit in March 2023 seeking clarity on when exceptions to the abortion ban are permitted, arguing the law was confusing for doctors who might turn away patients over fears of repercussions.

The court ultimately ruled that the law's exceptions are broad enough and that doctors would be misinterpreting the law if they decided not to perform an abortion when the mother's life is in danger.

With the SCOTUS decision looming just a month before Election Day, abortion has become a major focus for the Harris-Walz campaign.

Harris echoes debunked claim about Georgia abortion limits causing woman's death despite pushback from doctors,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-echoes-debunked-claim-about-georgia-abortion-limits-causing-womans-death-despite-pushback-from-doctors,2024-10-07T10:33:58Z,"Two Georgia doctors, one a congressman and the other a state legislator, weigh in on the tragic case of Amber Nicole Thurman and media claims that state laws regulating abortion led to her death.

Vice President Kamala Harris repeated the left's claim Sunday that a woman in Georgia died due to delayed care as a result of the state's abortion limits, despite doctors previously denouncing the narrative as false.

During an interview on the raunchy and often-sexually explicit ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, host Alex Cooper asked Harris about the impact of the overturning of Roe v. Wade, blaming the death of Amber Nicole Thurman on the Supreme Court ruling and the state's abortion limits after she received a chemically induced abortion in 2022.

""So, Amber was a young mother of a six-year-old son. She was a medical assistant who was so excited because she was just getting on her feet to be independent. She got her own apartment in a gated community with a pool that her son could play in. She got accepted to nursing school,"" Harris told listeners.

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

""She was, as described by her family, so excited and so ambitious, and she had plans. Then she found out she was pregnant, and she didn't want to go through with her pregnancy. And she was living in Georgia, and she couldn't receive care there because she was past six weeks. And so she ended up going to another state, and...she couldn't get there on time. And because the other state had been so overwhelmed by all these women coming from all these southern states who couldn't get treatment in their own state, her window for her appointment had closed and instead of having a surgical procedure, she had medication and basically went back home and then had some complications and went to the hospital because she was bleeding.""

""And they delayed 20 hours before they treated her,"" Harris continued, suggesting that Georgia's laws prevented her from receiving lifesaving care.

Her remark comes after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

Harris and other members of the Democratic Party, including her running mate Tim Walz, have cited their deaths as evidence for the need to expand abortion access after the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.

""Here's the thing that's so messed up about this,"" Harris told Cooper. ""Some of these people will say whoa, but I do believe in exceptions, I believe that there should be an exception in terms of the life of the mother. You know what that means in practical terms? She's almost dead before you decide to give her care. What, so we're going to have public health policy that says a doctor, a medical professional, waits until you're at death's door before they gives you care. That's outrageous...where is the humanity?""

Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

OB-GYNs have criticized the Amber Thurman narrative as a misleading story that is being pushed by the media and Democrats.

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Charlotte Lozier Institute Vice President and Director of Medical Affairs Dr. Ingrid Skop called out the ""fearmongering"" and ""lies"" of the media that are hurting women who don't understand new abortion laws.

""I was not surprised to see this pro-abortion media try to point the blame at Georgia's pro-life laws, but, in fact, Georgia's laws allow doctors to intervene to save the life of the woman,"" Skop recently told Fox News Digital.

""I think the focus of the Democratic Party upon abortion as an issue is only because the American people do not understand the laws. Many times, women are hurt by abortions. It is not necessary for women to live their best life. And, of course, it's the fearmongering and lies that have led us to this place where we are today, where people even think there would be a reason to point at the law.""

U.S. Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., and state Rep. Mark Newton have also come out to say they don't believe Georgia laws had anything to do with Thurman's death, alleging it was caused by complications from abortion pills because doctors may have waited too long to intercede.

""We never deny a woman an abortion because it's going to harm her in some way. She will always be protected,"" McCormick said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital.

""You have every right to an abortion, even with that heartbeat law,"" he continued. ""So, let's make that very clear right now. When they say there's no exceptions, there's never any law in any state where there's no exceptions. That doesn't exist. That's simply not the way it works. The mother's life is always protected. With that said, it doesn't mean it's easy to get an abortion just because you have a complication or because something goes wrong.""

Dr. Christina Francis, CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), made similar comments on ""Fox & Friends"" last month.

""We are seeing the direct results of spreading lies and misinformation about these laws. Women are being harmed by that because they are delaying in seeking care. And so I think it's really important, no matter where somebody stands on the issue of abortion, we should all want women to have accurate information so that they seek care immediately if they're experiencing complications from things like these high-risk abortion drugs,"" Francis said.

ProPublica previously defended their story in a statement to Fox News Digital, saying, ""We stand by our reporting. The state's committee of more than 30 experts concluded that the deaths of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller were preventable, a newsworthy finding. Our ongoing reporting is illuminating the challenges doctors face in caring for patients with pregnancy complications in states with restricted access to abortion.""

SCOTUS kicks off historic term under scrutiny amid ethics code debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/scotus-kicks-off-historic-term-scrutiny-ethics-code-debate,2024-10-07T10:05:55Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The Supreme Court begins its new term today amid lingering internal strife over several recent rulings, with details of its thorny internal deliberations selectively leaked to certain media outlets.

All of this as the nine justices have come under increasing public scrutiny and criticism over perceived blatant partisanship on hot-button issues, ethics controversies and its own wilting reputation as a body remaining above politics.

""The Supreme Court, in a sense, is on the ballot this election, or at least the future of the Supreme Court,"" said Thomas Dupree, an appellate attorney and former top Justice Department official. ""So any time the court wades into political waters, it's going to be upsetting people, people who are on the side that loses. And they'll say the court shouldn't have got involved in the political fray. The court recognizes that it's not something that it wants to do, but in some cases, it has no choice.""

JUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON SAYS SHE WOULD SUPPORT AN 'ENFORCEABLE CODE' OF ETHICS FOR THE SUPREME COURT

Here are five questions confronting the Supreme Court:

Directly or indirectly, the nine members of the Supreme Court could again play an outsized role in determining who will be the next president.

There is no indication yet of another Bush v. Gore, the case in which the justices in 2000 ended ongoing litigation over the Florida election results, essentially handing the presidency to George W. Bush.

But the high court four years ago summarily refused to consider a series of lawsuits from Trump and other Republicans in five states President Biden won: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Former President Trump has again promised court challenges if he loses, and in a recent social media post, he said this election ""will be under the closest professional scrutiny"" and ""people that cheated will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law.""

Trump has proceeded with his campaign without the imminent cloud of legal jeopardy hanging over his head. His criminal sentencing in the New York business fraud conviction has been postponed until November at least.

And his two separate federal cases involving document mishandling and 2020 election interference have been deferred indefinitely. Those prosecutions could disappear entirely if Trump is elected and dismisses the Justice Department's special counsel.

All this after the Supreme Court in July ruled former presidents enjoy a substantial amount of immunity for ""official acts"" committed in office. Trump has used that ruling to demand both of his federal cases be dismissed.

Two justices took the unusual step of commenting publicly on its effect.

""You gave us a very hard question,"" Justice Neil Grouch exclusively told Fox News' ""America Reports"" co-anchor Sandra Smith. ""It's the first time in American history that one presidential administration was seeking to bring criminal charges against a predecessor. We had to go back and look at what sources were available to us.""

The Trump appointee said the Supreme Court ruled in Nixon v. Fitzgerald (1982) that civil claims cannot be brought against a president ""presumptively, in his official capacity, after he leaves office. Why? Because that would chill him from exercising the powers and duties of a president while he is president,"" Gorsuch said. ""He would be overwhelmed. His political enemies would simply bring suits against him forevermore.""

But Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who was on the losing side of the 6-3 opinion, has taken another approach.

""I was concerned about a system that appeared to provide immunity for one individual under one set of circumstances, when we have a criminal justice system that had ordinarily treated everyone the same,"" she told CBS News while promoting her new book, ""Lovely One: A Memoir.""

The Supreme Court has already gotten involved in several pre-election challenges: allowing some redistricting maps for congressional seats to go into effect and blocking others.

And the justices last month allowed Arizona to temporarily enforce its law requiring proof of citizenship on state voter registration forms.

'STOP PRETENDING': CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST WANTS DEMS BEHIND SCOTUS ETHICS RULES TO TAKE THEIR OWN MEDICINE

Five days before President Biden withdrew as a candidate for re-election, he made the Supreme Court a major political issue.

Word leaked from the White House on July 16 that Biden was seriously considering proposals to establish term limits for the justices, and an ethics code that would be enforceable under law, amid growing concerns they were not being held accountable.

The proposal was made public days later, including a congressional law limiting justices to 18-year terms despite the Constitution's guarantee of life tenure for all federal judges.

Biden framed it as an effort to address ""recent extreme opinions the Supreme Court has handed down [that] have undermined long-established civil rights principles and protections.""

Public calls for changes came after revelations of previously undisclosed free trips and gifts by the justices and lucrative book deals. Recent public polls support greater ethics reform.

Other federal judges are bound by an enforceable code of conduct, but the high court had long resisted being included.

Under Chief Justice John Roberts' leadership, he and his colleagues adopted a revised code last year, but it still lacks any enforcement mechanism, which critics say makes it feckless and ineffective.

Fox News previously reported that the court had been privately meeting for months on how to structure a new ethics code, one that would address public concerns over its behavior without abdicating what Roberts in particular had said was the court's independence on such matters from congressional oversight.

So, the justices have near-total discretion to decide whether to abide by the new code.

But growing and very public calls for more have come from some justices in recent days.

""A binding code of ethics is pretty standard for judges,"" said Jackson, ""and so I guess the question is: Is the Supreme Court any different? I guess I have not seen a persuasive reason as to why the court is different.""

""I am considering supporting it as a general matter,"" she said. ""I'm not going to get into commenting on particular policy proposals, but from my perspective, I don't have any problem with an enforceable code.""

And Justice Elena Kagan, perhaps the most vocal advocate for an enforcement provision, said this month, ""It seems like a good idea in terms of ensuring that people have confidence that we're doing exactly that. So, it seems like a salutary thing for the court.""

Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin, D-Ill., recently told the chief justice that the unilateral ethics code adopted by the justices falls short and needs an enforcement trigger.

In a closed-door meeting with federal judges attending a semiannual policymaking conference at the high court, Durbin was seated next to Roberts and made clear that failure by the justices to strengthen their judicial code of conduct could prompt congressional intervention.

Sources say Roberts made no commitments but thanked Durbin for the ongoing dialogue on the issue.

But Justice Neil Gorsuch urged caution, telling ""Fox News Sunday"" host Shannon Bream last month that he did not want to get into ""what is now a political issue during a presidential election year.""

He added about the role of an independent judiciary, ""It's there for the moments when the spotlight's on you, when the government's coming after you. And don't you want a ferociously independent judge and a jury of your peers to make those decisions? Isn't that your right as an American? And so I just say be careful.""

TOP DEM PLOTS TYING SCOTUS FUNDING TO 'ENFORCEABLE' ETHICS CODE AMID THOMAS, ALITO CONTROVERSIES

Following the contentious conclusion of the court's term in July, much was written about the ""Barrett Factor"" and the supposedly evolving jurisprudence of Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

She has become something of a recent lightning rod on the right and left over her occasional willingness to depart from her fellow conservatives, especially in cases involving the man who appointed her in 2020.

The 52-year-old Barrett took issue with some conclusions in the former president's historic immunity ruling and criticized parts of the majority ruling keeping him on the ballot in Colorado.

And breaking with conservatives, she separately authored pointed dissents on an obstruction case dealing with a 2021 U.S. Capitol riot suspect as well as an environmental case on federal rules to manage downwind air pollution.

Many court watchers on the left characterized her ""burgeoning"" legal reasoning as an ""independent streak,"" increasingly ready to ""skewer"" her right-leaning colleagues and a ""principled voice in the middle"" with a strong set of principles that present a ""different world view"" from other conservative justices.

But other legal observers say it is too early to dub Barrett the new deciding vote on hot-button cases who would resist walking lockstep with any ideological bloc.

""I don't think she's really trying to become the 'swing' justice or auditioning for that role. She's calling these cases as she sees them, and she's, generally speaking, a conservative justice,"" said Dupree. ""But what we've seen over the last term is Justice Barrett really coming into her own. She has the confidence to write separately and in some cases to break from the other conservatives when she sees the law a little differently. I suspect that will continue.""

And it remains clear Barrett's conservative credentials in most cases are solid: She has ruled to strike down Roe v. Wade, expand gun rights and scale back affirmative action in higher education.

SCOTUS GIVES PARTIAL VICTORY TO GOP TRYING TO ENFORCE PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP TO VOTE IN ARIZONA

We recently highlighted potential Supreme Court nominees in another Biden or Trump administration, based on what sources in both camps exclusively told Fox News.

Now the dynamic has shifted, with Vice President Harris heading the Democrat ticket.

Campaign sources say the whirlwind of taking over the nomination from her boss in recent weeks has left Harris, her legal advisers and campaign team little time to focus on the what-ifs of choosing justices or broader legal policy.

But it is a topic of particular interest to the former prosecutor, state attorney general and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Administration sources say that since taking office, she has been part of the inner circle cultivating an informal White House list of high court possibles. And Harris was deeply involved in spearheading Jackson's selection and confirmation in 2022, Biden's only Supreme Court nominee.

As a senator, her 2018 questioning at the confirmation hearings for now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh were especially contentious, and she later called for his impeachment after unproven allegations of past sexual misconduct.

Harris herself was under serious consideration for a Supreme Court seat during the Obama years, but sources say her percolating ambitions at the time were directed to elected office.

As for Trump, sources close to him tell Fox News he is expected to soon release his own preemptive list of candidates, as the Republican nominee did in 2016. That evolving list of two dozen or so names became a centerpiece of his successful campaign and later presidency.

This time, the former president will rely on those he has already named to the federal bench for the top names he would choose from to fill any Supreme Court vacancy.

VP HARRIS OUTLINES 'ORDERLY AND SECURE' IMMIGRATION PLAN, RIPS TRUMP IN FIRST BORDER STOP SINCE NOMINATION

The Constitution's framers viewed the judiciary as the ""least dangerous branch,"" but to hear some politicians and pundits on both the left and right, the Supreme Court is prepared to lead the country into imminent ruin.

Such attacks on the justices are nothing new, but the tenor of the criticism, especially in a presidential year, coupled with self-inflicted missteps on ethics and docket discretion, have combined to put its nine members on the defensive.

And the public seems to have noticed.

A Gallup poll this summer found 43% approve of how the Supreme Court handles its job, with 52% disapproval. That is a drop of 15 points since 2020 (58%-38%). In 2000, 62% approved of the institution.

Especially concerning the court are continued leaks to the media of its internal, mostly secretive, operations.

A draft opinion of the 2022 ""Dobbs"" abortion case, published two months before the final ruling that struck down nationwide access to the procedure, sent shock waves in Washington in a massive breach of protocol.

That was followed by selective leaks in the past year over how the court decided hot-button issues like affirmative action and election redistricting.

And in recent weeks, the New York Times received leaked internal memos from the chief justice over his leading role in the Trump immunity opinion.

Court sources say the leakers, who have never been publicly identified, have further eroded institutional camaraderie and trust among the justices, long seen as essential to doing their jobs. It has led to outside partisan finger-pointing.

Roberts, who will gavel in his 20th term next week as chief justice, has not publicly responded to the latest controversies or calls for ethics reform, declining repeated invitations from the Senate to testify.

It reflects his ""less is best"" approach to explaining and promoting his own court's resolution of thorny legal and political issues.

In September 2022, after the abortion ruling was issued, he said, ""Simply because people disagree with opinions is not a basis for questioning the legitimacy of the court. I think just moving forward from things that were unfortunate is the best way to respond,"" he said.

And he has carefully glided over his role to force internal change and to defend his court's reputation all while being unable to stop the continuing leaks over their deliberations.

""It seems like at times they're [leakers] motivated to be able to potentially lead to mistrust in the [judicial] branch, attacks on what the branch is doing,"" said Jennifer Mascott, a former law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas and then-Judge Kavanaugh and now a Catholic University law professor.

Added Dupree, ""You can't have a court deliberate and perform its constitutionally assigned function if it can't be ensured of the sanctity of its deliberations, if it thinks that anything that one justice says to another colleague or any memo that they write internally is going to appear on the front page of the newspapers the next day. That's a very, very worrisome trend. It may be the new normal.""

After a three-month recess, the justices met together for the first time this week to reset their docket and discuss appeals that have been filed over the summer.

Sources say the chief justice, who leads the closed-door meeting, had sent a memo to his colleagues indicating some of the controversies surrounding the court, like the leaks and ethics reform, would be privately and candidly discussed.

The Supreme Court in its new term will confront issues like gun rights and transgender care for minors, with pending appeals over the Affordable Care Act, religious freedom, immigration and abortion access.

It is a unique, fast-moving time of change and challenge at an institution used to being slow and deliberate.

""I did learn early on that when you are holding the reins of leadership, you should be careful not to tug on them too much,"" said Roberts in 2016. ""You will find out they aren't connected to anything."""
Battleground Senate candidate unloads on 'radical' Dem opponent for disparaging Trump voters,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/battleground-senate-candidate-unloads-radical-dem-opponent,2024-10-07T08:07:07Z,"PHOENIX, AZ - Arizona GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake is blasting her Democratic opponent Rep. Ruben Gallego and labeling him as ""radical as they come"" after a resurfaced interview of him disparaging Trump voters.

""Isn't that terrible?"" Lake said in response to Fox News Digital reporting of a comment made by Gallego in 2016 where he said that Trump voters were ""dumb"" and the ""worst people in the world.""

""He's been lying about who he is,"" Lake added. ""He's trying to paint himself as a moderate, which is it's laughable if it wasn't so dangerous.""

Lake told Fox News Digital that Gallego ""bullied"" moderate Sen. Kyrsten Sinema out of the race ""because she wasn't liberal enough.""

KARI LAKE SHREDS VP HARRIS' 'DESPICABLE' SOUTHERN BORDER VISIT: JUST TO MAKE THE 'MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAPPY'

""Now he is doing all these ads trying to say he's a moderate when, in fact, he's voted to spend our federal dollars, our tax dollars, our money, supporting sanctuary cities and states. He's voted against securing our border every step of the way. He's for an open border America. He's voted to defund the police. He actually co-sponsored the George Floyd legislation, which would have defunded the police nationwide.""

Lake went on to tell Fox News Digital that Gallego has ""never batted an eyelash"" when it comes to spending bills and has not been strong enough defending women's sports.

""He wants biological men to participate in women's athletics.,"" Lake said. ""That means it's an end for girls sports. Anybody out there who played sports? I did for a little bit. It's an end. I mean, if you have to compete with biological men, what's the purpose of having girls sports?""

ENIGMATIC VOTER GROUP COULD SPLIT TICKET FOR TRUMP, DEM SENATE CANDIDATE IN ARIZONA

Lake added, ""It's absolutely crazy and he's as radical as they come.""

Gallego and Lake will both be attempting to sway independent voters, especially in Maricopa County, the largest county in the state, where independents make up a third of the electorate. Lake told Fox News Digital she is optimistic she can win votes from Arizonans who aren't Republicans.

""I do believe that independents are with me, I think we're doing pretty well, our polling is showing that we're building on the independent vote,"" Lake said. ""And I think a lot of Democrats, while he [Gallego] hates Trump voters and he hates Republicans. I don't hate Democrats. I actually believe that disaffected Democrats are going to help us turn the corner.""

""They're realizing, looking at Kamala Harris and Ruben Gallego, and they're saying, wait a minute, this isn't the Democrat Party that I signed up for years ago, the old Democrat Party used to care about the working class. The old Democrat Party wanted a strong economy for everybody. This Democrat Party is a bunch of globalists, and they are for, they want to spend more money helping people coming here illegally than they do people who are American citizens.""

While the Real Clear Politics average of polls shows Gallego leading Lake by about 7 points, Lake told Fox News Digital she is confident the race is much closer and says her internal polling shows that she is within the margin of error.

""We have to go into it acting like we're ten down, but we're not ten down,"" Lake said. ""This is a very tight race. I'm proud of that, considering, as I said, he spent 75 million. He's been outspending us massively and the fact that this is such a tight race is incredible. Chuck Schumer is in a panic about Arizona. He's dumping 5 million bucks a week into Arizona.""

Lake told Fox News Digital that Democrats are in a ""tailspin"" in Arizona because their efforts to make the election about abortion have not been fruitful because most voters are focused on other issues like the economy.

Lake also criticized Gallego over his record before he entered politics, including his involvement with a bank that worked with illegal immigrants, a harassment claim against him by a 20-year-old intern while he worked at city hall, and his time working for an ambulance company that was being investigated for fraud.

""The people of Arizona know me and they trust me and I love the people of the state, Lake said. ""I want to represent all of them, including people who maybe don't even vote for me. If you choose not to vote for me, I hope I can earn your vote, but I still want to represent you and I want to do a great job for you in Washington, D.C. We need decent, honest people back to D.C. and Ruben Gallego was not honest before he got into politics.""

Melania Trump says former President Trump was aware of her abortion stance 'since the day we met',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/melania-trump-former-president-trump-aware-abortion-stance-since-day-met,2024-10-06T17:19:22Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Former first lady Melania Trump spoke with former President Trump before writing about her support for abortion in her self-titled memoir, she told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on Sunday.

""He knew my position since the day we met, and I believe in individual freedom. I want to decide what I want to do with my body. I don't want government in my personal business,"" she said in an exclusive ""Sunday Morning Futures"" interview.

""I think it's very important and, as I said in the book, and it's very well explained in the chapter, 'What does my body, my choice mean?' because timing really matters and also the restrictions, so I encourage people to read it because we live in a world that everybody should have individual freedom,"" she continued.

Trump is promoting her upcoming ""Melania"" memoir, which disclosed a shocking truth to many of her husband's supporters regarding her stance on the controversial issue, calling abortion a ""fundamental right of individual liberty,"" according to a report from last Wednesday.

MELANIA TRUMP'S ABORTION VIEWS IN NEW MEMOIR SPUR OUTRAGE FROM PRO-LIFERS: 'SHE IS WRONG'

She reportedly wrote, ""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government.""

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes. Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

MELANIA TRUMP'S PRO-CHOICE STAND ISN'T THAT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER REPUBLICAN FIRST LADIES

The revelation ignited a flurry of responses across the political spectrum, with pro-lifers slamming her for the view they argue fails to align with the Catholic faith, to which she subscribes.

Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America advocacy group, called the view ""anti-feminist"" and the ""opposite of empowerment.""

Others, including Lila Rose and president of pro-life advocacy group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Marjorie Dannenfelser, criticized the stance as well.

On the left, ""The View"" co-host Joy Behar accused Trump of lying about being pro-choice, calling her stance a ""big scam.""

Others have posed the question: why make the revelation just before the election?

""That was not written in the last week or the last month,"" Trump told Bartiromo.

""That book was written months before, and it was in print months before, so that was my belief, and it is my belief, and I wanted to put it in the book because I want to be authentic. I want people to read the book because they could find out a lot of things that were never discussed. I'm very selective in what I do, and when I'm doing interviews or not or where I am or not, and this is my story. This is my perspective and the truth, and there is a lot of misinformation about me and falsehoods written about me, so that book, 'Melania,' will bring out my truth.""

Tim Walz discusses Israel's right to defend itself and Kamala Harris' economic policies on 'Fox News Sunday.'

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz sought to distance Vice President Kamala Harris from laws he himself signed that granted benefits to illegal immigrants in Minnesota on Sunday.

Walz made the comments during a wide-ranging interview on Fox News Sunday with host Shannon Bream. Bream pressed Walz on his military history and his record on abortion in addition to questioning him on legislation he signed in Minnesota that allows illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses and receive state-funded tuition assistance, among other benefits.

""Are those not magnets to draw people here, many times on dangerous journeys for themselves? And why should your taxpayers in Minnesota or across the states pay for those programs?"" Bream asked.

""Well, that's not the vice president's position,"" Walz admitted, before going on to defend his leadership in Minnesota.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN PUSHES BACK ON 'SNL' SKIT ABOUT ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS: 'DISGUSTING'

""But I will say this, Minnesota ranks as a top five business state. We rank as a top three state for children living, and we're a top state for health care access,"" he said. ""Look, the Vice President has made it clear that she has policies that make a difference. Her border policies are the most strongest, the fairest we've seen.""

Bream also challenged Walz to clarify his ticket's position on abortion access. The exchange ultimately led to Walz flatly accusing former President Trump of lying when he said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law.

Bream began by pointing out that Minnesota's abortion law imposes no limits on abortion procedures through all nine months of pregnancy, something that goes far beyond the provisions of Roe v. Wade, which Harris and Walz said they support.

""You signed the bill that makes it legal through all nine months. Is that a position you think Democrats should advocate for nationally?"" Bream asked.

""The vice president and I have been clear the restoration of Roe versus Wade is what we're asking for,"" Walz responded.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN PLEDGES MORE MEDIA INTERVIEWS AS VOTERS STILL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HER POLICIES

""But that law goes far beyond Roe v. Wade,"" Bream pressed. ""Let's agree, in what you signed there's not a single limit through nine months of pregnancy. Roe had a trimester framework that did have limits through the pregnancy. The Minnesota law does not have that.""

""This doesn't change anything. It puts the decision back on to the woman, to the physicians,"" Walz responded. ""And we know that this is simply something to be brought up - to be very clear Donald Trump's asking for a nationwide abortion ban.""

""[Trump] has said repeatedly that he will not sign a national abortion ban. Are you calling that a flat out lie?"" Bream asked.

""Yes, of course, and Senator Vance has in the past said so too,"" Walz said.

Bream concluded the interview by giving Walz a chance to respond to criticism of his frequent ""misstatements,"" such as his claims about military service and his assertion that he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square massacre.

""Look, I speak passionately. I had an entire career, decades before I was in public office. They know, and I'm very proud of my 24 years in service and my record. I have never disparaged someone else in this, but I know that's not what Donald Trump does. They disparage everyone,"" Walz said.

""I will own up when I misspeak. I will own up when I make a mistake. Let's be very clear. On that debate stage the other night, I asked one very simple question and Senator Vance would not acknowledge that Donald Trump lost the 2020 election,"" he finished."

A recent poll by the Pew Research Center found that former President Trump is winning the Catholic and Protestant vote.

Conducted from Aug. 26-Sept. 2, the survey found that 52% of Catholics and 61% of Protestants support Trump for president, while 47% of Catholics and 37% of Protestants back Kamala Harris.

As more Americans become aware of how radical Harris is, it's clear to see why Trump has won this support from religious voters.

Harris may have been the surprise replacement for Joe Biden, but her position on issues is far from unknown. She claims to be a future-oriented, change candidate eager to ""turn the page and chart a new way forward.""

DEMOCRATS DRIVING RELIGIOUS VOTE AWAY FROM PARTY AS TRUMP COURTS CATHOLICS: 'ANTI-CHRISTIAN' PARTY

However, Harris is a professional politician with a radical policy record that she can't defend among the religious electorate.

Consider that in 2014, in the case of Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, Attorney General Harris filed an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court and was joined by 13 states and the District of Columbia.

Harris called on the court to force Hobby Lobby to violate its religious beliefs and cover the cost of contraception for its employees. (The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby, protecting the family-owned arts and crafts chain to operate its business in line with its religious beliefs and values.)

5 REASONS KAMALA HARRIS IS SNUBBING THE AL SMITH DINNER, CATHOLICS, AND TRADITION

Also, as attorney general of California, Harris was a vocal advocate and ""proud"" co-sponsor of the Reproductive FACT Act, which Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law in 2015. The law required medically licensed pro-life pregnancy centers to display signs advertising low-cost or free abortions available in California.

The law ""was very clear that it was targeting pro-life viewpoints,"" said Denise Harle, who served as senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom. In a 2018 decision, the Supreme Court agreed with this view and struck down the law.

Writing for the majority in National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra (initially named NIFLA vs. Kamala Harris), Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the majority opinion, ""the FACT Act unduly burdens protected speech.""

As a U.S. senator of California from 2017-2021, Harris introduced and was the lead sponsor of the Do No Harm Act, which would have ended religious exemptions for certain government mandates, such as rules requiring insurance coverage of specific medical procedures. As a legal expert at First Liberty wrote at the time, ""This country was founded on religious liberty. The Do No Harm Act strikes at the heart of that freedom.""

Additionally, the Do No Harm Act would have undermined the bipartisan Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a 1993 landmark law that protects the rights of people of faith to worship freely and in accordance with their conscience.

Further, Sen. Harris was also an original co-sponsor of the ""Equality Act,"" a bill that would have further unraveled the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and enabled the government to prosecute faith-based institutions for refusing to hire employees who openly oppose their religious teachings. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops was clear in denouncing the proposed legislation and said the Equality Act would ""run roughshod over religious liberty.""

Additionally, Sen. Harris questioned three judicial nominees on their affiliation with the Knights of Columbus, suggesting that involvement with the Catholic fraternal organization disqualifies a nominee for potential bias.

When I served as President Trump's ambassador to the Holy See, I witnessed the importance of having a president who stands up for religious freedom. President Trump has a proven track record for promoting and protecting religious freedom at home and abroad. Kamala Harris has repeatedly advanced an anti-faith agenda."

Estimates of still-undecided voters in Wisconsin are in the low single digits, with the latest Marquette Law School poll reporting that just 4% identified themselves as such.

Fox News Digital spoke with two such voters, who laid out why they are still holding out and what they need to seal the deal.

""I'm going to throw a dart,"" he laughed.

Schiekiera is an immigrant from Germany who noted that he grew up during the Second World War. For him, former President Trump's comments on foreign policy have been troubling, enough so to make him hesitate to support Trump for a third time.

""I voted for Trump the first year. I voted for him the second year. I don't -- this time, I don't know,"" he said.

""I'm from Germany, and things that he's said about [the] NATO Alliance -- he wants quit it, and he doesn't know what to do,"" he said of what's making him unsure of Trump. ""A real danger lives overseas.""

Schiekiera was also concerned about what Trump has said with relation to conflicts around the world, particularly involving Ukraine and Iran. ""He can stop the war?"" he asked, in reference to Trump's own claims about the war between Ukraine and Russia. ""He cannot stop the war.""

However, he added that ""Biden or Kamala Harris -- she doesn't know what's going to happen,"" either. According to him, he isn't confident that either of the top candidates can effectively lead on the world stage in the current geopolitical climate.

There are other issues that Schiekiera is taking into consideration as well, such as abortion. ""I got my own ideas,"" he said.

He noted that Trump has appeared to change positions on ""issues nationally [and] worldwide.""

""Trump's gone one way, and then he [goes] to another way. He's undecided what he's going to do, really.""

DEMOCRATS WORRY ABOUT HARRIS' CAUTIOUS MEDIA APPROACH IN TIGHT 2024 RACE: 'VOTERS DESERVE BETTER'

In contrast, Keon Pierce of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, isn't considering Trump at all. But he is not sold on Vice President Kamala Harris either.

""I'm leaning Kamala, but I have to see. She's got to convince me a little more,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""I'm waiting to see who has the best -- the best protection for different groups of people. You know, the best rights and best laws that can help all groups of people.""

Pierce explained that he wanted to be sure the president would ""help all people. Asian people, Indian people, Black people, everybody.""

When Fox News Digital noted that Harris is both Black and Indian, he responded, ""We had a Black president before, and it didn't necessarily translate to helping the people,"" in reference to former President Barack Obama.

He said he was ""open to"" Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who will appear on the Wisconsin ballot after a court challenge to see her ousted was denied.

""It's possible that I wouldn't vote as well,"" he added.

As for the Milwaukee area, Pierce explained, ""It's bad here. It's really segregated here, and opportunities are limited.""

He said he needs to hear more about what will be done to bring more ""opportunities, jobs, education, [and] a better school system in the inner city.""

Vice President Kamala Harris recently recorded an interview with the raunchy and often-sexually explicit ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, though she continues to play coy with traditional media outlets.

The Harris campaign confirmed that Harris sat down for the interview this past Tuesday where she focused on talking to audiences about abortion and reproductive rights issues. The interview is set to air sometime next week.

Harris' ""Call Her Daddy"" interview comes as she has been criticized for not doing enough traditional news interviews since the start of her presidential campaign in late July.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS IN 'DANGER ZONE' AS AMERICANS WORRY ABOUT COUNTRY'S DIRECTION, SAYS CNN DATA GURU

So far, Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., have done a combined 24 interviews, a number which pales in comparison to the Trump-Vance ticket's combined 63 interviews in that same time frame.

Harris still has not held a formal press conference since replacing President Biden as the Democratic nominee, while Trump has held five since the beginning of September.

The ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, put on by SiriusXM, is hosted by Alex Cooper and reaches a massive, predominantly female audience. According to Spotify, it is ""the most-listened to podcast by women.""

The podcast is well-known for hosting explicit discussions about sex and women's health advice. Axios reported that the vice president's appearance on the podcast ""highlights her campaign's emphasis on appealing to women voters and younger audiences."" According to CNN, the podcast generally has ""a reputation for raunchy sex and relationship conversations.""

Former President Trump and his running mate JD Vance have done multiple interviews on major podcasts shows in recent months, trying to bring their messaging to younger audiences.

Trump recently sat down with podcaster and influencer Theo Von on his podcast and did a livestream with popular influencer Adin Ross that was conducted at the former president's Mar-a-Lago residence. Vance did an interview on the Full Send Podcast in August.

That Harris would opt for a sit-down with the sex-positive show generated some chatter on social media.

Pro-Trump influencer Collin Rugg shared a clip from the show in which Cooper interviewed a porn star.

Ohio Sen. JD Vance, as anticipated, easily won the vice-presidential debate Tuesday, October 1, on demeanor, facts, and analysis. But in fairness to a sometimes herky-jerky and nervous Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, he had the harder task of defending the temporary pseudo-conservative make-over of Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.

His additional burdens were her co-culpability for the last three-and-a-half-years of the Biden disaster, and her unwillingness to implement her supposedly ""change"" agenda in the last months of her vice-presidential tenure.

The CBS News moderators, Nora O'Donnell, and, especially, Margaret Brennan, also as expected, ganged up on Vance. They had learned nothing, and forgotten nothing from the last disastrous, and biased debate moderators.

EMHOFF DENIES REPORT HE SLAPPED EX-GIRLFRIEND OUTSIDE RITZY OVERSEAS MOVIE EVENT

The two moderators shamelessly broke their own rules by fact-checking (wrongly and solely) Vance. They ignored questions of the administration's tardy responses to Hurricane Helene, the Ukraine war, the recent Trump assassination attempts, or crime, while only briefly touching on Iran and a Middle East on the brink of total war. Instead, they concentrated, as also expected, on climate change, abortion, healthcare and childcare.

All were issues they thought might more easily embarrass Vance. And, of course, as also expected, the two ended the debate pressing Vance on January 6. And yet Vance again parried easily and won decisively. In doing so, he dispelled the smear that he was somehow ""mean,"" when, in fact, he proved calm and magnanimous as he methodically dissected Walz.

The nation perhaps learned that a confident Trump selected him to articulate his MAGA positions, and perhaps in a manner superior to Trump's own.

In contrast, an insecure Harris picked Walz. The vice president was assuming that he would not upstage her and perhaps, by his limitations, would make her look competent in comparison.

The debate will give some momentum to Trump-Vance in the last month of the campaign.

It follows the lethargic Biden-Harris reaction to Hurricane Helene, whose toll in human life and property had been initially and vastly ignored by the media.

It follows the growing specter of a theater-wide Middle East war, as a solitary Israel faces off against Iran and its appendages (all empowered after 2020 by Biden-Harris).

It follows the chaos of a longshoremen's strike intended to shut down the entire country. And it follows Harris's continued inability to survive even serial soft-ball interviews without her memorized and banal answers.

As a result, the slow, steady hemorrhaging of support for Harris-Walz will likely still continue in the last month of the election."

Fox News Digital spoke with residents just south of Houston, Texas this week about the economy and who they trust more between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to boost the economy as president.

After shopping at Costco, local residents expressed frustration with current overall costs and the economy as a whole, both on and off camera.

""All the prices have gone up,"" Melissa told Fox News Digital.

""No, it's not doing well at all,"" said another resident, originally from Egypt.

Ralph said the economy has resulted in increased costs for his family, stating, ""I think inflation is out of control. Housing and interest rates are out of control. Grocery trips have doubled. And a good grocery trip used to be like 150-125. Now an average grocery trip is now 250-300.""

Locals also shared who they feel will best handle the economy as president.

""When Trump was in office, you know, things were doing well,"" said Mark.

Ralph said he ""definitely"" trusts Trump more to tackle the economy.

""I don't think Kamala even knows what's going on. I think she's a puppet,"" he said. ""He's got a proven track record, hoping he gets back in and rescuing this Harris economy.""

Another resident also said she trusts the former president more: ""Trump, because he's the only businessman that's capable of running our country.""

Mark cited Trump's time in office compared to the current Biden-Harris administration as a reason for trusting the former president.

""Trump because of what he did the last time, who was in office and what the current administration, what's happened with the current administration over the past four years,"" he said. ""If it's not broke, don't fix it. You know, they tried to fix it. So here we are today.""

No Republican presidential candidate has lost Texas since 1976, but the state has become increasingly competitive in recent elections. Trump won it by less than six points in 2020, a sharp contrast from just 12 years ago when Mitt Romney carried the state by nearly 16.

The economy remains the top issue on the minds of American voters as they prepare to cast their ballot in the presidential election.

A September Fox News national poll also in the field entirely post-debate spotlighted that 39% of voters surveyed said the economy was their most pressing issue, far ahead of immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues tested were in single digits.

While the nation's economic recovery from the pandemic continues, inflation remains a leading concern among Americans.

The former president's up 13 points over the vice president in a post-debate survey from the New York Times and Siena College, and favored by 7 points in an ABC News Ipsos survey also conducted after the showdown.

But Trump's advantage over Harris on the economy stands at only 5 points in the Fox News poll, and just 2 points in the AP/NORC survey.

Harris has touted what she calls the ""opportunity economy"" and said her administration will crack down on price gouging and also lower taxes for middle-class Americans. Trump has pointed to economic performance under his administration as successful and that a return to office would bring back those days.

The Harris ticket was buoyed on Friday by a strong September jobs report. Also, striking U.S. dockworkers returned to work Friday after reaching a tentative agreement with employers on an improved wage offer."
"Trump can win on these 3 key issues, Michigan voters tell Fox",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-can-win-three-key-issues-michigan-voters-tell-fox,2024-10-04T17:40:00Z,"Trump supporters in Saginaw, Michigan, told Fox News Digital the top issues Trump should hit as he seeks to win the critical swing state.

Michigan voters attending former President Donald Trump's Saginaw rally Thursday told Fox News Digital that the former president needs to focus on the economy to win the critical swing state, particularly job creation and curbing inflation.

""Opening up the pipelines to get the jobs back,"" one voter who attended Trump's rally on the campus of Saginaw Valley State University said when asked which issue the former president needs to focus on to win Michigan.

The comments come as Trump made yet another visit to the crucial swing state of Michigan, a state that could play a decisive role in determining who wins November's election. It also marked the second time the former president visited mid-Michigan in just a few weeks, a blue collar area of the state where the campaign believes it can make inroads with voters in what promises to be a close race.

TRUMP'S 2ND TERM FOREIGN POLICY LIKELY TO FOCUS ON 'STRENGTH' AND 'DETERRENCE': EXPERT

Vice President Kamala Harris is set to visit the same area of the state Friday, signifying the importance of Michigan as the clock nears the end of a dramatic election season.

Polls show Michigan as a toss up as of Wednesday, with the Real Clear Politics Polling average giving Harris a thin lead of just 0.7 points in the state. However, polls also showed Trump trailing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Biden in Michigan by 5.3 and 5.7 points respectively, numbers that turned out much more favorable to Trump on election day.

Trump narrowly won Michigan in 2016 before dropping it to Biden in another close race in 2020, but voters in mid-Michigan believe Trump's focus on the economy should help put him over the top in 2024.

VOTERS IN CRITICAL MICHIGAN COUNTY FOCUSED ON ECONOMY, CANDIDATE CHARACTER AS 2024 RACE TIGHTENS

""Bring inflation down and safety and security in the state of Michigan,"" one voter told Fox News Digital.

""Illegal border crossings and the economy,"" another voter said. ""Keeping jobs in America, lowering inflation.""

However, other voters signaled that Trump could win on a range of issues, including national security and reducing crime in inner cities.

""Our national security does come first. But if the people at home, if they can't make ends meet, they're living in misery, that's just as important,"" a voter told Fox News Digital. ""Being truthful to the American people, which he has been.""

""Focusing on the inner cities. Putting together ways to decrease the violence,"" another voter said.

Meanwhile, one voter who said she was at the rally to support Trump said that the former president could lead the charge in helping Michigan residents see the issue of abortion differently.

Melania Trump's pro-choice stand isn't that different from other Republican first ladies,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/melania-trumps-pro-choice-stand-isnt-different-from-other-republican-first-ladies,2024-10-04T17:11:57Z,"Former first lady Melania Trump opens up about her life before, during and after the White House in a sit-down interview on 'Fox & Friends.'

Melania Trump is not the only first lady to express pro-choice views. She joins several former Republican first ladies who have shared similar perspectives, often in their memoirs, despite this stance historically contrasting with the GOP platform.

Other spouses of Republican presidents, such as Pat Nixon, Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Laura Bush, have been recorded either during or after their husbands' tenure in office expressing pro-choice views.

""I feel very strongly that it was the best thing in the world when the Supreme Court voted to legalize abortion and, in my words, bring it out of the backwoods and put it in the hospital where it belongs,"" Betty Ford said in a CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" interview in 1975, two years after Roe v. Wade was handed down.

MELANIA TRUMP'S ABORTION VIEWS IN NEW MEMOIR SPUR OUTRAGE FROM PRO-LIFERS: 'SHE IS WRONG'

Following Ford's comments on premarital sex, marijuana and abortion during the CBS interview, then-President Gerald Ford reportedly joked that she had cost him votes.

As a more conservative first lady, Nancy Reagan avoided taking a public stance against abortion that would put her at odds with former President Ronald Reagan. However, she later revealed her personal position on the issue.

""I'm against abortion, I don't believe in abortion,"" Reagan said at George Washington University in 1994, five years after her husband left the Oval Office. ""On the other hand, I believe in a woman's choice. So, it puts me somewhere in the middle, but I don't know what you'd call that.""

Barbara Bush, former President George H. W. Bush's wife, was more reserved in her public statements about abortion and was at odds with her husband's anti-abortion stance. While she was not as outspoken as Betty Ford, she wrote in her 1994 memoir, ""I hate abortions, but I just could not make that choice for someone else.""

Former first lady Laura Bush, wife of former President George W. Bush and daughter-in-law to Barbara Bush, also differed with the former Presidents Bush on abortion.

""I think it's important that it remain legal, because I think it's important for people for medical reasons and other reasons,"" she said in an interview with Larry King Live in 2010.

Pat Nixon, then-President Richard Nixon's wife, told reporters during a 1972 press conference - as Roe v. Wade arguments were being considered by the Supreme Court - that she supported the right to choose an abortion, but opposed ""wholesale abortion on demand.""

Trump, wife of Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump, wrote the memoir entitled ""Melania"" that is scheduled to come out on Oct. 8, per the Amazon release date. In the book, according to a preview by The Guardian, she expresses a viewpoint closely aligned with that of former first ladies before her.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,"" Trump reportedly wrote.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.

""Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

The former first lady drew criticism from pro-life advocates on social media after the excerpts were published just a month away from Election Day. This year, the Republican Party's official platform also softened its language on abortion, as former President Trump also said he would not support a federal abortion ban."
"'Lies throughout': Trump-backed challenger, longtime Dem senator face off in heated battleground debate",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lies-throughout-trump-backed-challenger-longtime-dem-senator-face-off-heated-battleground-debate,2024-10-04T14:14:11Z,"Lackawanna County, Pa., has emerged as a key battleground county this election cycle, with voters on the streets of Scranton speaking with Fox News Digital about their top issues.

Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger Dave McCormick squared off in their first debate Thursday evening, less than five weeks ahead of what is expected to be one of the most closely watched races this election cycle.

Casey and McCormick took the debate stage Thursday at 8 p.m. in Harrisburg, where the two traded barbs over issues such as the economy and inflation, immigration, abortion. The race, which is rated as ""leans Democrat"" by the Cook Political Report, is expected to be one of the tightest Senate races across the country, with Casey himself acknowledging earlier this year that it will be a ""close, tough race.""

Casey has long been a Pennsylvania Democratic stalwart, first winning his election to the U.S. Senate in 2007. The Casey name also has deep roots in the state, with Bob Casey Sr., the senator's father, serving as the Keystone State's governor from 1987 to 1995, following years of serving in various other elected roles.

McCormick is an Army combat veteran and former CEO of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, who served as the Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security as well as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs under former President George W. Bush's administration. Former President Donald Trump endorsed McCormick in April, lauding him as a ""a good man"" who ""wants to run a good ship.""

MCCORMICK SEIZES ON PENNSYLVANIA SENATE RACE GAP, LAYING BORDER BLAME ON CASEY

The Senate race comes as the federal election spotlights Pennsylvania once again as a key battleground state that will likely determine the outcome of the presidential election. Former President Donald Trump narrowly won the state in his successful 2016 election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while President Biden declared victory in the Keystone State in the 2020 election.

As the pair squared off for the first of two debates ahead of Nov. 5, Fox News Digital compiled the top five moments of Thursday's event.

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

Casey and McCormick both weighed in on the federal election, including Casey lauding Harris following his staunch support of Biden before the president ultimately dropped out of the 2024 race as concerns about his mental acuity and age mounted over the summer.

""From your perspective, who is the better candidate for Pennsylvania? Biden or Harris?"" moderator and ABC27 anchor Dennis Owens asked Casey.

""I think Vice President Harris, who's running a strong campaign, I think she'll carry Pennsylvania. It's going to be very close, just like the Senate race will be close. But she's running a strong campaign. But the people of our state have to make two basic decisions - in addition to other statewide races. They have decided in the presidential race, and they have to decide our race, and this race is very clear,"" Casey responded.

When asked whether he believes Biden or Harris would be a better president for Pennsylvania voters, Casey brushed off delivering a direct answer.

""Oh, I don't know, Dennis. I mean, we'll never know the answer to that, but the voters are gonna make a decision,"" he said.

McCormick, on the other hand, was asked if he could offer one example where he does not agree with Trump after slamming Casey during the debate for overwhelmingly voting with Biden over the last three and a half years.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS, TRUMP LOCKED IN TIGHT RACE IN BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

""[Trump] recently said that he wanted to get rid of the ban on SALT taxes, which Sen. Casey supported, too"" McCormick responded. ""Listen, that's a that's a tax break for millionaires in New York and California at the expense of PA taxpayers. So I wouldn't support that.""

""But listen, Senator Casey stood next to Joe Biden when he could hardly finish a sentence. We saw this on the debate stage, he said 'he's ready to go,'"" McCormick continued, referring to Casey's support of Biden remaining in the presidential race until Biden ultimately dropped out. ""Then Sen. Casey said, 'Kamala Harris is great. You're going to love her when you get to know her.' This is a woman who, in the last few years, says she wanted to ban fracking, legalize illegal immigration, give them federal benefits, take away our guns, defund the police. This is her position, so she's flip-flopped on everything, and Bob Casey standing there by her.""

Both candidates accused the other of ""lies"" throughout the debate, including McCormick touting a new website called CaseyLies.com, and Casey accusing McCormick of misrepresenting himself as a Pennsylvanian.

""For your viewers tonight, I have a website that's been established today, it's just been launched, CaseyLies.com. You can go and see the actual facts by third-party sources of all the things he's saying. There will be lies throughout. But you should ask yourself, 'Why is a senator with an 18-year track record, who should be able to run on his record, running his entire campaign with a negative set of attacks on me, most of them lies?'"" McCormick said towards the start of the debate.

McCormick claimed that Casey often launched ""lies"" at him during the debate because he ""doesn't have a track record"" in the Senate to run on.

Casey shot back during the debate that McCormick has misrepresented himself as a full-fledged Pennsylvanian.

""We've heard a couple of times tonight about telling lies, but probably the biggest lie told in this whole election, that probably most Pennsylvanians have never heard a bigger lie, was the lie when my opponent said he lived in Pennsylvania, when he was living in Connecticut. The Associated Press on August the 14th, 2023, did a story that proved that he was living in Connecticut,"" Casey said.

McCormick defended that he was born in Pennsylvania and has spent ""the majority of my life"" there, but also lived in Connecticut for years when he served as CEO of Bridgewater Associates.

PENNSYLVANIA SURVEY FINDS HARRIS LEADING TRUMP NARROWLY, IDENTIFIES HER 'BIGGEST WEAKNESS,' POLLSTER SAYS

The economy is among the top concerns for voters in Pennsylvania, as well as the nation at large, with both candidates outlining how they would tackle spiraling inflation if re-elected or elected to the Senate, and what they believe is behind the rise in consumers' costs.

""Prices are too high, especially when you go to the grocery store to buy food or household items, items that people need every week, or at least every other week. And these big conglomerates, these big corporations, rig those prices and jack them up to levels we've never seen, all while they're getting record profits,"" Casey said, while defending his efforts targeting corporations he has accused of ""greedflation.""

So-called greedflation is understood as corporations allegedly exploiting inflation woes by increasing prices on consumers to produce greater profits.

""We can take it on by passing a price gouging bill to go after those companies, hold them accountable,"" Casey said.

The Democratic senator also addressed his campaign against ""shrinkflation,"" which he explained as corporations shrinking products for consumers while not lowering prices.

""We did a report on shrinkflation, which covered a lot of companies around the country. And if that's happening with regard to a Pennsylvania company or any other company around the country, they should be held accountable. When they take a product, shrink the contents of the product, or what's in a bag, and don't shrink the price, that's deceptive. That's ripping people off,"" he said, adding that such companies should be held legally accountable.

McCormick shot back that higher costs on Americans in recent years is due to ""out of control spending"" at the hands of Casey and other Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris and President Biden.

""When you've spent your entire life in public service, elected office, 30 years, you're like a hammer looking for a nail. The cause of inflation is the policies, the out-of-control spending of Biden, Harris and Casey. Bob Casey voted 100% of the time for that $5 trillion of new spending. The experts at the time, Larry Summers, the San Francisco Fed, said this would create inflation,"" McCormick said.

""Bob Casey doesn't understand how the economy works. That's why he's trying to do all this economic voodoo stuff with price controls,"" he later charged.

Casey and McCormick were both grilled about their current abortion stances during the debate, as abortion once again sits atop many voters' list of election concerns following the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Casey positioned himself as a pro-life Democrat earlier in his career, but he voted to codify abortion protections nationwide following the overturning of Roe.

""In 2022, when the Supreme Court overturned a 49-year right, it overturned Roe v. Wade, I think everyone had to make a decision, including senators. I made a decision to support the Women's Health Protection Act. I don't support Republican efforts to ban abortion across the country,"" Casey said.

BATTLEGROUND STATE DEM DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM DEFUND MOVEMENT, BUT POLITICAL RECORD SHOWS DIFFERENT STORY

McCormick was questioned about his remarks in 2022 that he supports rare exceptions for abortion, such as when the health of the mother is at risk, and has since said that he supports additional exceptions for abortion.

""This is an extremely polarizing issue. As you know, I have six daughters, so this is something we spend time talking about. I believe this should be a state's right. I believe states should decide. Pennsylvania has had a law. It's been supported by Democrats and Republicans, like was signed into law by the Senator's father, Governor Casey. I support the three exceptions. I would not favor an abortion ban of any kind,"" McCormick responded.

Casey recently came under fire from a Pennsylvania sheriff who slammed the Democratic senator's border policies for the influx of fentanyl into the U.S., which the dad said had led to his son's death.

""We can't bring back the people we've lost. But we can get rid of the weak politicians like Bob Casey who let it happen,"" Blair County Sheriff Jim Ott said in a recent McCormick campaign ad.

Casey was asked about the sheriff's remarks during his debate Thursday.

""Mr. Casey, the Blair County Sheriff, blames you for the fentanyl death of his son, saying you have not done enough to secure the border. What is your response to that,"" Owens asked.

""I met so many families across the state, and whether it's a sheriff in Blair County or a mom in Allegheny County, Janet that I met, who talked about her daughter, Brianna, this is an awful, awful tragedy for those families. That's why we need to invest in the strategies that we know work. [McCormick] won't do that, because he's weak in the face of the political pressure from his own party. . . . We can solve this problem by investing in the technology, hiring thousands more Border Patrol, so we can inspect every single vehicle coming across the border,"" he said.

Amid the immigration debate, McCormick blamed the Biden-Harris administration and Casey for the immigration crisis at the southern border.

""The border crisis is the direct result of the weakness of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And Bob Casey supported them every second. What chutzpah to run an ad on how tough he is on the border, when he voted against funding for the Border Patrol. He ran an ad in front of the wall that he voted against. He voted for sanctuary cities, he voted for federal benefits for illegal immigrants. And the fentanyl crisis that's come across our border is the direct result of the weakness of Bob Casey not standing up to these terrible cartels,"" McCormick argued.

The pair have agreed to another debate, next taking the same stage in Philadelphia on Oct. 15."

Former Trump staffer and ""The View"" co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin will join former GOP lawmaker Liz Cheney and other anti-Trump Republicans for an event in Pennsylvania next week warning of the dangers of re-electing former President Donald Trump.

Former Trump administration staffer Cassidy Hutchison - who testified against her former boss in the Jan. 6 Committee hearings - as well as Trump's former deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews will be part of the event that is meant to help deliver the swing state to Vice President Kamala Harris in November.

The panel will ""offer a warning about the threat Donald Trump poses to democracy and the rule of law,"" a source connected to the event recently told CNN.

WORKING CLASS WILL COME HOME TO HARRIS, RALLYGOERS IN POSTINDUSTRIAL PENNSYLVANIANS SAY

The aim of the chat is to convince voters of ""the need for independents, moderates, and Republicans to stop him from getting back in office,"" the source added.

The women-led program will be hosted by liberal super-PAC Democracy First in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania on Oct. 9, and is reportedly the first of many that will feature the four women speaking to voters in multiple battleground states.

Cheney, Hutchison, and Matthews have endorsed Harris for president. Griffin has not, though the media personality is a staunch critic of Trump on ""The View"" and in her role as a CNN political commentator.

The event comes as Trump and Harris are neck and neck in battleground states, with the race being especially close in Pennsylvania.

'ABUSE OF POWER': HOUSE GOP OPENS PROBE INTO UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

Recent Fox News polling in Pennsylvania finds Harris only two points ahead of Trump among registered voters in the state, while they are tied at 49% among likely voters.

""Pennsylvania is not breaking open and shouldn't be expected to,"" says Democratic Pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts Fox News surveys alongside Republican Daron Shaw. ""Both candidates have a little way to go to consolidate their bases and whoever does a better job there could determine who wins the state.""

According to the survey, the economy is the top issue for Pennsylvanians, with 71% of voters having a negative view of it. Trump has a six-point advantage over Harris on the issue, while she is viewed far more favorably on abortion.

"New poll reveals Trump has significant lead on immigration, border security in key battleground state",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-poll-reveals-trump-significant-lead-immigration-border-security-key-battleground-state,2024-10-04T08:09:41Z,"Economist Steve Moore comments on the border crisis and illegal immigration on 'Fox Report.'

Former President Donald Trump holds a firm lead in a key state over Vice President Kamala Harris on the question of how to handle immigration -- as the border crisis remains a top issue for voters.

A new poll released this week from Marquette Law School finds Harris leading Trump overall in Wisconsin by 52-48%.

But when it comes to immigration and border security, Trump dominates. Of voters, 49% favor Trump while just 37% favor Harris, with 8% saying they'd be about the same, and 6% saying neither are good on the issue.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

Trump holds a similar 12 point lead on handling the war between Israel-Hamas, while Harris has an 11 point gap on handling Medicare & Social Security and a 17 point lead on abortion.

Of the issues polled, immigration was near the top of the issues, with 15% of voters saying it was their most important issue, the same number who said abortion, and only behind the economy -- which was top issue for 37% of voters.

The poll is the latest indicator that Harris still has a fair way to go in convincing some voters that she is the better candidate on a topic that has dominated the headlines and remains a top issue for voters. Wisconsin, along with states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Arizona could be election deciders in the election on Nov 5.

Harris was put in charge of handling root causes of migration to the southern border in early 2021 as border numbers began to skyrocket. She was eventually dubbed the ""border czar"" by media outlets and critics -- although the White House rejected that title.

HARRIS SHIFTS KEY POSITIONS ON BORDER, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AS CAMPAIGN PROMISES 'PRAGMATIC' APPROACH

Republicans have hammered Harris on the border, saying it was the rolling back of Trump-era policies that led to the record numbers at the border. They have also pointed to her embrace of left-wing positions in her 2019 presidential bid. Since then, her campaign says her views have been shaped by the current administration, including on decriminalizing illegal crossings and closing immigration detention centers.

""Harris can never be forgiven for her erasing our border, and she must never be allowed to become president of the United States,"" Trump said in Wisconsin on Sunday.

Harris has sought to present herself as better situated to handle the border. Her campaign has noted a recent drop in border encounters since President Biden signed a presidential proclamation in June limiting asylum entries. She has also thrown her support behind a bipartisan border security bill that would place similar limits on asylum and provide additional funding and detention beds.

Conservatives said that the bill would enshrine high border numbers, but Harris accused Trump of blocking the bill for political purposes. She did so again on a trip to the southern border in Arizona last week.

""He picked up the phone and calls some friends in Congress and said, stop the bill. Because, you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem,"" she said. ""And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games."""

A Milwaukee man has been accused of swiping items from the same Walgreens store three times during a week's span. The items were mostly cleaning and sanitary items, like soaps, toilet paper, razors, lotions and other household goods.

John Dzwonkowski, 38, now faces two counts of felony retail theft, according to police records and Fox 6.

A criminal complaint indicates that Milwaukee police were first contacted on Sept. 18 at a store on Howell Avenue.

Officers spoke that morning with the store manager who told them that a ""thief"" entered the store around 7:40 a.m. and began ""removing soaps, cosmetics and toilet paper and placing the items into a backpack. The defendant then walked out of the store without paying for the merchandise.""

The complaint states that the stolen items were approximately $178 in retail value.

Officers were called to the same Walgreens location just two days later after another complaint of theft, this time with the defendant ""removing razors, lotions and other cosmetic items and placing them into two bags,"" the complaint says. The stolen merchandise this time was valued at $435.

Kamala Harris teams up with Liz Cheney in the birthplace of the Republican Party,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-liz-cheney-birthplace-republican-party,2024-10-04T01:40:14Z,"RIPON, WI - As she turns up the volume on her efforts to court disgruntled Republicans in her battle with former President Trump for the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday teamed up with the most visible anti-Trump Republican in the town that claims to be the birthplace of the GOP.

Harris campaigned in battleground Wisconsin with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, a one-time rising conservative star in the GOP who, in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, has vowed to do everything she can to prevent Trump from returning to power.

""I have never voted for a Democrat but this year I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,"" Cheney told the audience, as she formally endorsed the Democratic presidential nominee. ""As a conservative, as a patriot, as a mother, as someone who reveres our Constitution, I am honored to join her in this urgent cause.""

Harris praised Cheney as a leader who ""puts country above party and above self - a true patriot.""

WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS WHO ADVISED REAGAN AND BUSH BACK HARRIS OVER TRUMP

The campaign event took place in Ripon, Wisconsin, where a one-room schoolhouse was designated a national historic landmark due to its role in holding a series of meetings in 1854 that led to the formation of the Republican Party.

The younger Cheney was once rising in the ranks of House Republican leadership.

But she was the most high-profile of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-president Trump in early 2021 on a charge of inciting the deadly Jan. 6th attack on the Capitol, which was waged by right-wing extremists and other Trump supporters who aimed to disrupt congressional certification of President Biden's Electoral College victory in the 2020 election.

TRUMP UPS HIS ANTE IN THE 2024 FUNDRAISING FIGHT WITH HARRIS

The conservative lawmaker and defense hawk immediately came under verbal attack from Trump and his allies, and was eventually ousted from her number-three House GOP leadership position.

Cheney, who has been vocal in emphasizing the importance of defending the nation's democratic process and of putting country before party, was one of only two Republicans who served on a special select committee organized by House Democrats that investigated the riot at the Capitol.

In 2022, she was ousted in the GOP congressional primary in Wyoming by a candidate that was backed by Trump.

At a speaking event in early September at Duke University in swing state North Carolina, Cheney announced that she would be voting for Harris in the presidential election. Cheney's father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, also endorsed Harris.

Cheney on Thursday warned that ""our republic faces a threat unlike any we have faced before. A former president who attempted to stay in power by unraveling the foundations of our republic.

She argued that Trump ""can never be trusted with power again"" and emphasized that ""in this election, putting patriotism ahead of partisanship is not an aspiration, it is our duty.""

""What Jan. 6 shows us is there is not an ounce, not an ounce, of compassion in Donald Trump. He is petty. He is vindictive. He is cruel. And Donald Trump is not fit to lead this good and great nation,"" Cheney claimed.

WHAT THE LATEST POLL IN BATTLEGROUND WISCONSIN SHOWS

Harris, speaking after Cheney, highlighted that ""anyone who recklessly tramples on our democratic values as Donald Trump has, anyone who has actively and violently obstructed the will of the people and the peaceful transfer of power, as Donald Trump has....must never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States.""

And Harris emphasized that ""I take seriously my pledge to be a president for all Americans.

Cheney was not always a fan of Harris.

The Trump campaign on Thursday repeatedly pointed to a social media post by Cheney during the 2000 election where she argued that ""@KamalaHarris has a more liberal voting record than Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Her radical leftist views-raising taxes, banning gun sales, taxpayer $ for abortion & illegal immigrant health care, eliminating private health insurance-would be devastating for America.""

Trump, speaking with Fox News' Bill Melugin during a rally in Michigan on Thursday, said that Cheney was ""terrible"" and ""a stupid warhawk. All she wants to do is shoot missiles at people.""

On Cheney's backing of Harris, Trump argued ""I think they hurt each other. I think they're so bad, both of them.""

The Cheneys are part of a growing list of prominent Republicans who are supporting Harris.

Two other high-profile anti-Trump Republicans -- former Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan - had speaking roles at the Democratic National Convention, which was held six weeks ago in Chicago.

And Harris is backed by more than 200 alumni who served in both Bush administrations or worked for the late Sen. John McCain and Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2008 and 2012 GOP presidential nominee. She's also supported by more than 100 Republican former national security officials and other prominent Republicans.

Ripon is not the only town that claims to be the birthplace of the GOP. Exeter, New Hampshire also has some bragging rites, as it was the site of meetings in 1853 - a year ahead of the Ripon gatherings - by disenchanted political leaders who discussed the formation of a new party of Republicans.

But officials in Ripon said the group in Exeter never actually formed a political organization, or chose officials, as they did in Wisconsin.

Wisconsin is one of seven crucial battleground states with razor-thin margins that decided Biden's 2020 White House victory and are likely to determine if Harris or Trump wins the 2024 presidential election.

With less than five weeks until Election Day in November, Harris and Trump are locked in a margin-of-error race in the key swing states.

While Trump retains vast sway over the GOP, even a small sliver of Republicans supporting Harris could make an important impact in what will likely be a race within the margins in the battleground states."

James Carville harshly criticized the Harris-Walz campaign for not doing more to combat the claim by vice presidential hopeful JD Vance that former President Donald Trump ""saved Obamacare"" during Tuesday night's debate.

The Democratic strategist unloaded on the Harris/Walz campaign for what he believes to be an ineffective response to Vance's comments that Trump ""salvaged"" the Affordable Care Act (ACA) while he was president.

""Why isn't Harris herself out today talking about that,"" Carville seethed on the Politics War Room podcast. ""Get off your a--. Move, move, move!""

Carville noted that health care is a huge issue and the ACA is ""a law that is important to people.""

JAMES CARVILLE PREDICTS ELECTION 'PLOT TWIST' AHEAD OF NOVEMBER: 'SPRINT TO THE FINISH'

He also called Vance's claim ""an out and out lie,"" repeatedly asking why Harris herself wasn't out in the media talking about it.

""What the f--- are y'all doing in the Harris campaign, get her out there now, now!"" he said. ""They ought to have Obama and Nancy Pelosi and they ought to do a Zoom call with the national media. I mean kick the crap out of this now, use everything.""

""[Trump] did everything in his power to destroy it and this is not an issue that people don't care about,"" Carville said. ""It's not a nitpicking thing and I got to tell you, the White House response and I think by and large, to a large extent, the press response is not at all measured to the gravity of this lie, of the importance of this.

""Why haven't they just gone crazy over Vance saying that Donald Trump saved Obamacare?"" Carville said. ""That's pants-on-fire, 5-star 20 Pinocchio B.S. and it's a great issue for us.""

Tim Walz attempts to clarify remarks he made about being in Tiananmen Square during the 1989 pro-democracy protests during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Vice presidential candidate Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., has been called out so many times for false claims, one news outlet warned it may unravel his public image.

CBS debate moderators confronted the governor during his vice presidential debate with Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, Tuesday regarding Walz's claim that he had been in Hong Kong in May 1989 during the Tiananmen Square protests, when he actually traveled to Asia in August, a few months later.

Politico observed this is part of a history of factual inaccuracies Walz has told about his past, in an article headlined, ""Tim Walz has a tendency to misspeak. It may haunt the campaign.""

""Since being tapped as Kamala Harris' running mate, the folksy, plain-speaking Minnesota governor has had to explain a growing number of inaccurate statements -- and at times embellishments -- about his past,"" Politico's Meredith Lee Hill and Mia McCarthy wrote. ""They range from comments about his military service to his visit to Hong Kong more than three decades ago to clarifying that his family didn't specifically use in vitro fertilization.""

BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT TELLS DR. PHIL HE SAW 'PANIC' ON WALZ'S FACE DURING KEY DEBATE MOMENT

""It's unclear whether Walz's verbal errors will undercut his credibility with voters. But the need to continually clean up those claims could politically hurt Walz and Harris, who are locked in a tight race with Donald Trump and JD Vance,"" the reporters added.

""And in some cases, key members of Harris' circle weren't aware of some of the inaccurate statements until they became public despite the vetting process, according to four people familiar with the conversations who were granted anonymity to discuss the matter.""

The writers said, ""Walz's misstatements could contradict the image that the campaign has painted of him as an upstanding, everyday Midwest guy.""

During the debate, Walz responded to a question about his Tiananmen Square claim by speaking about how he ""grew up in a small rural Nebraska town, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies 'til the streetlights come on,"" then described joining the National Guard and becoming a teacher. He glossed over his trips to China but acknowledged, ""I've not been perfect, I'm a knucklehead at times.""

When confronted again by one of the moderators for not answering the question, he conceded he ""misspoke"" about the Tiananmen timeline.

The day after the debate, Walz told reporters during a campaign stop in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, ""Yeah, look, I have my dates wrong. I was in Hong Kong in China in 1989... I speak like everybody else speaks. I need to be clearer.""

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

A spokesperson for the campaign defended Walz's record to Politico, noting he ""cares deeply about democracy.""

""As the governor has said, he sometimes misspeaks. He speaks like a normal person and speaks passionately about issues he cares deeply about, including democracy and stopping gun violence in our school,"" the Harris-Walz campaign said, adding former President Trump and Vance ""repeatedly lie and mislead about their plan to ban abortion nationwide"" and other topics."

Former first lady Melania Trump is drawing heat from pro-life advocates over an excerpt in her memoir where she suggests a woman's right to choose an abortion is a ""fundamental right of individual liberty,"" according to a report Wednesday.

Melania Trump wife of Republican presidential candidate and former President Trump, wrote the memoir entitled ""Melania"" that is scheduled to come out on Oct. 8, per the Amazon release date. In the book, according to a preview by The Guardian, Melania expresses a viewpoint that has historically been at odds with the Republican Party's platform.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,"" Melania reportedly wrote.

TRUMP RISKS LOSING SOME PRO-LIFE VOTERS UNLESS HE CHANGES 'HIS TUNE' ON ABORTION, ACTIVIST WARNS

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.

""Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

The excerpts quickly drew the ire of pro-life advocates who have already been disgruntled by some of Trump's seemingly ambiguous comments regarding abortion.

""Melania Trump's support of abortion is anti-feminist and clearly outside the teaching of our Catholic faith. She is wrong,"" wrote Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America advocacy group.

PRO-LIFERS BLAST TRUMP 'BETRAYAL' WITH SHIFTING ABORTION STANCE, ANSWER ON FLORIDA AMENDMENT 4

Lila Rose, founder of leading pro-life advocacy group Live Action, also responded to a promotional video Melania posted for her memoir in which she states, ""Individual freedom is a fundamental principle that I safeguard... what does my body my choice really mean?""

""Who is this Melania Trump, or Kamala Harris? Functionally the same exact position on abortion,"" Rose wrote on X.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

President of pro-life advocacy group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Marjorie Dannenfelser, wrote on X: ""The women of America are capable of great strength and creativity. They are naturally inclined to speak for those who are powerless. Abortion is not the source of their freedom and liberation.""

In August, Trump sparked confusion among pro-life supporters about where he stood on an amendment that would upend Florida's ban on abortions after six weeks' gestation. Trump, after saying ""I think the six-week is too short, there has to be more time,"" to an NBC reporter when asked how he would vote, later walked it back and said he would vote against the amendment.

Other spouses of Republican presidents, such as Pat Nixon, Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Laura Bush, have been recorded either during or after their husbands' tenure in office expressing pro-choice views.

Melania reveals in her new memoir that she is pro-choice, according to reports. The former first lady doubled down on what she wrote in a video posted to social media on Thursday and said, ""Without a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth.

The other co-hosts also had their theories about the former first lady's stance, given that former President Trump expressed support for the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin agreed that it was a ""strategic"" move.

""I think she hates him. Okay, so we can all agree that. That's a given. I also think that she wants to take him out. She does not want to be the first lady anymore. She doesn't want to be the first lady. She destroyed the Rose Garden. Who hates Christmas? Melania Trump hates Christmas. She doesn't want to decorate for Christmas.

Body language expert tells Dr. Phil he saw 'panic' on Walz's face during key debate moment,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/body-language-expert-tells-dr-phil-he-saw-panic-walzs-face-during-key-debate-moment,2024-10-03T09:42:56Z,"Body language expert Carole Lieberman, M.D., weighs in on Vance-Walz VP Debate.

Body language expert Scott Rouse called out Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., for panicking and trying to avoid answering a question about his presence at Tiananmen Square during the vice presidential debate Tuesday.

One of the debate's most surprising moments came when the CBS debate moderators confronted the governor about his claim that he had been in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protests, when he actually traveled to Asia in August 1989, a few months later.

Dr. Phil, who previously asked Rouse to analyze body language in September's presidential debate, asked him what to look for when reviewing this clip of Walz.

""I'm going to look for the things that tell us we know he wasn't there, and this, I'll put all my money on this, we're going to see fear, we're going to see panic, we're going to see shame, and the grief muscle as well,"" he said, adding, ""Everything's in this one.""

The host then showed CBS' Margaret Brennan confronting Walz about the Tiananmen claim, noting that reports indicate ""you actually didn't travel to Asia until August of that year, can you explain that discrepancy?""

Walz began his response by talking about growing up in rural Nebraska. Rouse said his body language spoke volumes, ""As that head goes sideways, that's panic. Because he's not sure how he's going to defend this. He knows the question's coming, so he's got something ready, but it's not coming out the way he thought about it, so he's got inner dialogue going on, he's thinking about it. That's why I see that head turn, those eyes get really, really wide. I know what that looks like, that's what's happening.""

Rouse noted what he called the upside-down horseshoe shape of the ""grief muscle"" as well as other signs on Walz's face.

""And the rest of this, this is panic, we see his eyes doing this, that's panic,"" Rouse said, drawing on the screen. He added further that Walz's lower face and head indicated he was in ""panic mode.""

He then called attention to what he said was Walz's biggest hand gesture of the night, ""This is the one that's come out further from his body than anything else, because he's trying to make sure- 'I want you to believe me! You gotta believe me!' That's what we're seeing, the panic here. Wide eyes, grief muscle, and everything's far out.""

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

Dr. Phil said a quick and direct answer followed by an explanation immediately seems more trustworthy than starting an answer with a long explanation.

""Don't you want to hear the answer up front?"" Dr. Phil asked the audience. ""And the question was, 'You said you were in Tiananmen Square during that showdown. And were you or weren't you?'"" He then mocked Walz's answer about growing up in a small Nebraska town.

Rouse replied that this tactic of dumping unrelated information is a well-known ploy to change the conversation.

""We call that 'chaff and redirect,'"" the expert said. ""He gives out a lot more information, hoping that your brain will follow that information and not ask any more questions and forget what you're talking about. That's why when you're asking a question, they go, 'Well, listen, here's what really happened. When I get up in the morning, I eat toast every day' and they start talking about stuff that has nothing to do with what the answer is.""

Dr. Phil then proposed a way Walz could have better answered the question.

""Would it have been better off if he'd have said, 'No, I wasn't, and I said I was. Let me explain. I took student groups over there probably 30 or 40 times, 35 years ago.

MORNING GLORY: The VP debate is an example of Kamala Harris's horrible judgment when it comes to picking staff,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-vp-debate-example-kamala-harriss-horrible-judgment-when-comes-picking-staff,2024-10-03T09:09:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The debate between the candidates for vice president -- GOP nominee Ohio Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz -- was dominated by Vance, and all but a handful of hardened partisan pundits agree on that conclusion.

Walz wobbled and panicked from the first question -- which everyone in the world knew would be about Iran's ballistic missile attack on Israel earlier in the day. Yet Walz still fumbled his response, and it got worse from there until the CBS moderators invoked the unwritten mercy rule for left-wing moderators watching the Democrat melt and tossed Walz some softballs on J6 at the debate's close, by which time the internet was howling and laughing at the Minnesota governor.

There were three important takeaways:

NEW YORK POST CALLS OUT CBS FOR 'RIDICULOUS' FACT-CHECK OF JD VANCE: 'SHAMEFUL MOMENT'

First, Vance is a superb and calm debater and a reassuring figure on the national stage.

Second, Walz is not, and he represents the one big decision Vice President Kamala Harris has had to make since President Joe Biden dropped out. It was a terrible decision. Imagine her Cabinet and White House staff if somehow, she wins.

Third, legacy media is irretrievably broken and cannot be reclaimed from its lurch into rote leftism and extreme partisanship, or even pulled back to a minimum level of seriousness on big occasions.

Do executives at these networks -- ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC -- not see what has happened? Americans don't trust the news divisions at the legacy networks. It's as if those divisions are run by a combination of fresh-from-campus-demonstration interns and hardened partisans from the Obama years.

The CBS debate was not, however, as overtly biased against Vance as ABC's earlier debate was against Trump, but it was still very, very biased against the center-right and conservative audience. Viewers saw the question set veer quickly from a world crisis and the border crisis to get to the left's favorite issue of abortion.

With the world tuning in only hours after Iran launched 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, the moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan did open with an obligatory round of questions on that crisis. But, after 10 minutes, they plowed on to a quick exchange on immigration and the Biden-Harris massive fail on the relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene's savaging of North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Virginia in order to get to ... abortion, which had been discussed at length in the ABC debate and about which there are zero mysteries.

Three rounds of questions on abortion, really? And three rounds marked by the rote framing favored by the hard left? Predictable but still shocking.

The debate ended in a morass of childcare questions and then the obligatory ""Wasn't January 6th terrible?"" questions.

What a farce. Not one question on China's vast military build-up and its threat against Taiwan and the Philippines. Not one question on the Chinese Communist Party spies shot through our country, including the office of New York's current and past governor. Not one question on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Yes, there was a quick dash through the consequences of more than 10 million illegal immigrants flowing across the southern border under the Biden-Harris regime, but also a quick cut-off when Vance began what was an obviously embarrassing factcheck of the CBS factcheck on the ""legal status"" of the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio. ""We have a lot to get to,"" was the trigger for cutting off anything uncomfortable.

Walz was asked about his lying about his trips to China -- sort of. It was left hanging. A knuckleheaded answer for a knuckleheaded team of debate organizers. Chinese President Xi Jinping is a sort of Voldemort for the networks -- never to be named -- perhaps because ABC and CBS all have corporate ties to companies that must do business there?

Look, whatever votes were moved by the debate moved toward the GOP because Vance hammered that the costs of everything from food to gas skyrocketed under Biden-Harris, gave a quick tutorial on why construction costs have soared and thus the price of houses, and repeatedly reminded the audience of Harris's failure in her job as ""border czar,"" while also stressing the need for more domestic energy production. Tim Walz provided comic relief.

The loser wasn't just Walz though. It was also CBS, which joined ABC in a legacy media hall of shame. When we get back to debates in four years, the good news is the ""debate commission"" is already dead and that, by 2028, the idea of the big networks hosting debates unchecked by center-right moderators will be as well. The candidates will call on C-SPAN and find some fair moderators. Siri could have done a better job in our past two debates this year.

What has to be dawning in the C Suites of networks -- if they are at all self-aware -- is that their product and their talent are awful, and their audiences have already left or will soon leave. Tuesday night was just the most recent example of why."
"Why Vance easily beat Walz in debate, softening his image in the process",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/why-vance-easily-beat-walz-debate-softening-his-image-process,2024-10-03T07:12:39Z,"A panel of Republicans, Independents, and Democrats react in real-time to claims made by Trump running mate JD Vance in reference to 2020's election results during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Credit: CBS)

And there's no question that JD Vance easily won the vice presidential debate. Tim Walz did better than anticipated - perhaps those expectations were deliberately set low - but despite some strong counterpunching, he frequently stumbled.

Each man had a mission: to defend his running mate and rough up the opposing presidential candidate.

But Vance had a second goal beyond talking up Donald Trump, and that was softening his own image. He made a concerted effort to project empathy, to appear reasonable, to be open to opposing viewpoints.

VOTERS REACT TO GOV TIM WALZ DODGING TIANANMEN SQUARE QUESTION: 'I'M A KNUCKLEHEAD AT TIMES'

There is a caricature of the Ohio senator as a hard-right ideologue with little sympathy for women, as reflected by the famous childless cat ladies comment. But when the subject of abortion came up, he went out of his way to sound sympathetic to the pro-choice side:

""I know a lot of Americans don't agree with everything that I've ever said on this topic. And, you know, I grew up in a working-class family in a neighborhood where I knew a lot of young women who had unplanned pregnancies and decided to terminate those pregnancies because they feel like they didn't have any other options. And, you know, one of them is actually very dear to me. And I know she's watching tonight and I love you.

""And she told me something a couple of years ago that she felt like if she hadn't had that abortion, that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship. And I think that what I take from that as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable, is that my party? We've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they frankly just don't trust us.""

(Vance's website describes him as ""100 percent pro-life."")

Walz countered with specific stories of women who died or whose health was damaged because they lived in states that tightly restrict abortion.

The Minnesota governor hit his talking points, but regularly took a long time to get to his main argument. A question about Kamala Harris' plan to build 3 million housing units produced a detour about how Walz has only bought one home.

Walz often spoke in a clipped shorthand - the ACA, Springfield, Vance creating stories - without explaining, for instance, that he meant the false tale of Haitian migrants eating pets.

The CBS moderators, Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, edged into ABC territory by fact-checking only Vance, despite saying they would try to avoid that. After the senator referred to illegal immigrants in the Ohio town, Brennan said Springfield ""does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected."" That's a point Walz should have made, but didn't.

Many questions were framed from the left. ""Senator Vance,"" said Brennan, ""you oppose most gun legislation that Democrats claim would curb gun violence. You oppose red flag gun laws and legislation to ban certain semi-automatic rifles, including AR-15s.""

Walz's worst moment was one he should have anticipated, a story in the New York Times and elsewhere saying he was not in China for the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests as he had claimed, but got to Hong Kong months later. The governor began with a word-salad answer about growing up in Nebraska before retreating to ""I've not been perfect. And I'm a knucklehead at times.""

Pressed again, he said he had misspoken.

Vance's worst moment was about Jan. 6. O'Donnell began, ""You have said you would not have certified the last presidential election and would have asked the states to submit alternative electors that has been called unconstitutional and illegal.""

POLITICS HIJACKS HURRICANE DEVASTATION IN THE SOUTH, BIDEN CALLS TRUMP A LIAR

The senator countered that Trump ""said that on January the 6th, the protesters ought to protest peacefully. And on January the 20th, what happened? Joe Biden became the president. Donald Trump left the White House.""

This time Walz was ready. Trump ""lost this election and he said he did. 140 police officers were beaten at the Capitol that day, some with the American flag. Several later died.""

He turned to Vance and said: ""Did he lose the 2020 election?""

When Vance tried the ""focused on the future"" line again, Walz called that ""a damning non-answer.""

But Vance largely came off as a Bush-style compassionate conservative. He must figure that win or lose, he'll be running for president in 2028 and needed to combat all the negative coverage.

Walz looked like a man who was happy to survive his turn on the national stage. The debate would have looked very different if Harris had picked Josh Shapiro, given that she's tied with Trump in Pennsylvania.

The Harris campaign has bubble-wrapped Tim Walz, not allowing him to do a single solo interview. JD Vance is constantly doing interviews, podcasts and press conferences, the best kind of preparation for a big debate. And that, in the end, may have been the difference."

Stevie Nicks' first single in four years is an ""anthem"" to abortion rights and the 2022 Dobbs decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

The former Fleetwood Mac singer released the music video for ""The Lighthouse"" on Thursday, though she explained in a statement that the song was years in the making.

""I wrote this song a few months after Roe v. Wade was overturned,"" she said. ""It seemed like overnight, people were saying, 'What can we, as a collective force, do about this...' For me, it was to write a song. It took a while because I was on the road.""

Her statement continued, ""Then early one morning, I was watching the news on TV and a certain newscaster said something that felt like she was talking to me -- explaining what the loss of Roe v. Wade would come to mean. I wrote the song the next morning and recorded it that night. That was Sept. 6, 2022. I have been working on it ever since.""

Lyrics for the song included, ""All the rights that you had yesterday are taken away / And now you're afraid / You should be afraid/ Because everything I fought for long ago in a dream is gone.""

The music video also spliced images and clips of several women's marches.

Nicks emphasized in her statement upon the song's release how important it was to her and other women.

""It seemed like overnight, people were saying, 'What can we, as a collective force, do about this...' For me, it was to write a song,"" Nicks said. ""I have often said to myself, 'This may be the most important thing I ever do.' To stand up for the women of the United States and their daughters and granddaughters -- and the men that love them.

Nicks has been outspoken about her support for abortion rights, previously calling it ""my generation's fight."" In 2020, she discussed her own abortion and said it was necessary to keep the band going in 1979.

""I would have had to walk away,"" Nicks said. ""And I knew that the music we were going to bring to the world was going to heal so many people's hearts and make people so happy.""

"Politico: Vance's beard a sign of 'aggression' to women, Walz's 'saucer' eyes showed his 'passion'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/politico-vances-beard-sign-aggression-women-walzs-saucer-eyes-showed-his-passion,2024-10-03T00:07:43Z,"Fox News contributor Joe Concha joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss why he believes the CBS moderators were biased against JD Vance and his reaction to an ABC anchor comparing Tim Walz's performance to President Biden's.

Female voters who watched the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate on Tuesday may have viewed Ohio Sen. JD Vance's beard as a sign of toxic masculinity, according to one body language expert.

Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, faced off against Democratic vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at the Tuesday night debate, sparring for 90 minutes on a wide range of issues including immigration, the economy and abortion.

Former FBI agent and body language expert Joe Navarro analyzed each candidate's body language at the event for Politico Magazine, giving his opinion about how they presented themselves on stage.

The first thing Navarro noticed was Vance's facial hair. He claimed the ""masculine"" trait could turn off female voters.

VANCE OOZED CONFIDENCE COMPARED TO JITTERY WALZ, BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT SAYS: 'CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP'

""As POLITICO Magazine has noted before, Vance is the first White House wannabe to wear facial hair in 80 years. Our appearance is fundamental to our body language, and research indicates that voters see beards as (surprise, surprise) more masculine,"" Navarro wrote. ""That can be positive to some, reading as strength and competence. But to others, especially women, it can be negative, conveying aggression and opposition to feminist ideals.""

Navarro isn't the only media commentator to associate the Republican ticket with negative perceptions of masculinity. Since the Harris-Walz ticket emerged, several journalists, including MSNBC contributor Katty Kay, have argued that Republicans appeal to men with a more ""macho,"" what they consider, outdated version of masculinity.

MSNBC host Jen Psaki and The Washington Post's Catherine Rampell have also made the case that the Democratic ticket appeals to men who are more ""supportive"" of women.

While critiquing Vance's beard, Navarro praised Walz for his bugged-eyed expression throughout the debate, saying it ""showed his passion"" on the issues.

""When Walz felt especially passionate about something, he'd open his eyes wide as saucers. Eye-popping can sometimes be a sign of surprise, but for Walz, it simply revealed his emotional intensity,"" Navarro wrote. ""Early humans would have made such facial gestures to communicate strong emotions, like 'danger is close.' For Walz, it gave extra weight to his feelings and held our gaze.""

CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE

The body language expert spoke positively about how Vance used his hands to convey emotion and leadership during the debate, but claimed a ""little frown"" by the Republican at one point showed where his ""weaknesses lie.""

""When Walz brought up Project 2025, Vance exhibited a little tell that carried a big message: a slight squinting of the eyes and a small frown. Clearly, this was a sore subject,"" Navarro wrote.

""We have to guard against such behaviors in high-stakes interchanges like negotiations or, say, vice-presidential debates -- they reveal to your opponent what topics you want to avoid and where your weaknesses lie,"" he wrote.

At the same time, Navarro gave credit to Walz for frowning to show his disapproval while Vance was speaking.

""During a disagreement over democracy, he furrowed his glabella forcefully at what Vance was saying. Then he held his eyebrows like that, in tension, for some time. While Vance had the floor, this was a way for Walz to silently say, 'No way, that's not right, and I am going to challenge you on this,'"" he wrote.

The only negative assessment of Walz was about his finger-wagging at the camera.

""[H]e pointed at the camera with his index finger, like Uncle Sam in those old 'I Want You' posters. It was a bold, almost accusatory gesture -- which made it great for the poster, but can come across as almost hostile. Our brains immediately perceive a point as 'calling us out' -- in other words, as threatening. Walz wanted our attention there, and he certainly got it,"" Navarro wrote.

Both candidates displayed ""Midwestern politeness"" by tilting their heads and turning their bodies toward the other while speaking, the expert said."

Former Harris advisor complains about Walz's 'niceties' towards Vance: 'Why should they vote for you?',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/former-harris-advisor-complains-about-walzs-niceties-towards-vance-why-should-vote-you,2024-10-02T21:21:30Z,"MSNBC host Symone Sanders-Townsend argued that cordiality and demonstrating common ground between Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio failed to demonstrate differences to the American electorate.

MSNBC host Symone Sanders-Townsend criticized Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., for being too agreeable with his opponent Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, during the vice presidential debate on Tuesday.

The showdown between Walz and Vance was noticeably cordial throughout the evening, despite their ideological differeances. Sanders-Townsend, who served as chief spokesperson and senior adviser for Vice President Kamala Harris before joining MSNBC in 2022, suggested that if Walz and Vance have so much in common, it's a mystery why voters wouldn't support the Republican ticket.

""Debates are about performance, and they are about policy. And why this debate was very important is that there are many Americans out there, not just moderate Republicans, there are base Democratic voters that are saying they want to and need to hear more. Now, I think it is very fair for people to want to criticize those base Democratic voters who say, 'Well, what more do you need?' You can do that. But that is their lived reality, and so if you are trying to win their votes, you have to meet them where they are,"" she said. ""There were so many niceties on that debate stage tonight, I am just kind of like, well, if you agree so much with J.D. Vance, why should they vote for you?""

She went on to argue that both candidates were strategically putting on a dishonest performance.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

""I fully believe that Gov. Walz went out there tonight and did what was practiced in debate prep, did what the strategy was that the team put together. That was not the Gov. Walz that we -- that I had seen out on the campaign trail. That's not the Gov.Walz that I had seen during the veepstakes, right?"" she said. ""That was not the J.D. Vance that I know to be true. I mean, goodness! J.D. Vance was on that stage, he was sorry about Amber Thurman, he was -- he was sorry about -- he was sorry about a lot of stuff. He -- 'We get things wrong.' But do you agree with the policy?""

Sanders-Townsend, who also hosts a weekend show on MSNBC, also took aim at the CBS moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margret Brennan.

""That's not the Margaret and Norah that I know! Margaret don't do that on Sunday morning,"" she said.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

After the debate, Walz was criticized for coming off as nervous and not as polished as Vance.

""I think JD Vance strategically went in to do 'Midwestern nice' to disarm Tim Walz. And Tim Walz kind of took the bait so he wasn't in fighting mode. There were some fact checks he could have done that he dropped the ball on,"" ""The View"" host Alyssa Farrah Griffin said.

""Vance was far nimbler than the nervous Tim Walz, especially in the first half of the debate.

Despite calls from both sides of the aisle to lower the political temperature following the two assassination attempts against former President Trump, MSNBC host Joy Reid recently claimed that Democratic voters want someone to give him a ""knuckle sandwich.""

Reid employed the violent imagery during MSNBC's vice presidential debate coverage on Tuesday night, telling a network panel that the Democratic base really want someone to engage in a ""fistfight"" with the former president.

""Democrats want to see someone get up there and give a knuckle sandwich to Donald Trump,"" Reid said to the panel, which included fellow MSNBC anchors Nicolle Wallace, Lawrence O'Donnell, Rachel Maddow and others.

A VISIBLY SHAKY WALZ SAYS THE WORLD NEEDS 'STEADY LEADERSHIP'

Reid began her point by stating that Gov. Walz's, D-Minn., vice presidential debate performance seemed tailored to a ""small, narrow group"" of swing voters, who want ""more substance"" from candidates.

""Tim Walz was very detailed and he spoke the way a governor speaks about really specific issues like gun violence, like health care. He was substantive and knowledgeable, so if you are that person who the thing that is keeping you on the fence is you need more details, he gave you more details.""

She continued, explaining that the base of the party prefers to see a brawl between the two candidates, and their preferred leader taking it directly to Trump with heavy blows.

""No. 2, I don't think that small narrow group of people wanted to see a fist fight. And so, I think that the people who want the fist fight are the base of the Democratic Party.""

Reid noted that it isn't the Democratic base that ""needs this debate,"" but those swing voters who do. She argued that Walz delivered in connecting to these people.

""I think the reason that Tim Walz was effective in the way he did it - he wasn't angry, he was disappointed. And that's actually in some ways stronger,"" she said, elsewhere adding, ""Tim Walz gave you that specificity that I think is going to get those people to feel more comfortable"" voting for the Democratic ticket.

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

Several X users blasted Reid for using the violent imagery against Trump only weeks after he was nearly killed by a second would-be assassin at his golf course in Florida.

Popular conservative account Libs of TikTok criticized the host, stating, ""2 ass*ss*nation attempts and Iran plotting to try to get Trump and Democrats are still calling for violence.""

Conservative commentator Paul Szypula chimed in, stating, ""Joy Reid is an angry person filled with hate. She needs help.""

""Steve Bannon's War Room"" co-host Natalie Winters remarked, ""Wow, @JoyAnnReid just said the quiet part out loud. Democrats want a 'fist fight' and someone to 'give a knuckle sandwich to Trump.'""

Jones visited Steak 'N Egger restaurant in Muskegon after Tuesday night's CBS News Vice Presidential Debate, where many watchers gave Vance the advantage over Walz.

""[Walz] did terrible in many respects, but he is just honest and truthful also. He doesn't know what he's talking about and he kind of admitted it,"" one voter said.

Another voter said Walz appeared ""too nervous.""

""[Walz is] phony. He's too plastic. He doesn't know the topics like Vance.""

A few voters at the diner, however, defended Walz's performance and argued the Democrat won the pair's only debate showdown.

""[Walz is] very articulate. He knows his facts,"" one woman said. ""JD Vance totally switched the script last night. He told untruths. He flipped the switch. He lied throughout the whole entire debate last night. What he said was untrue - his stance on abortion, his stance on housing, his stance on the finance - everything was was not true.""

The woman conceded that Vance's ""experience on public stages"" may have impacted the number of voters and pundits giving the senator the win.

Tuesday's debate covered a variety of subjects ranging from immigration to climate change to abortion as the two lesser known politicians sought to make their introductions to American voters before Election Day.

One Michigan voter said she is voting for Vice President Kamala Harris because she likes the idea that ""we get to vote every four years instead of, 'if you vote me in, you won't ever have to vote again.'""

Another woman voiced her support for Trump ""because he's for America, and he's for me. And he's for the unborn child.""

""If you are for the person who cannot defend themselves, then you are for the rest of us,"" she said. ""And if you don't care about those that are not able to defend themselves, you certainly aren't going to be in charge of us or care for us.""

"WATCH: Voters react in real time to key Vance-Walz debate moments on immigration, democracy, abortion",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/watch-voters-react-real-time-key-vance-walz-debate-moments-immigration-democracy-abortion,2024-10-02T16:27:52Z,"Fox News Digital ranks the top five memorable moments from the 2024 Vice Presidential Debate between Senator JD Vance and Governor Tim Walz.

A Fox News Digital focus group of Republicans, Democrats and independents reacted to key moments from the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate between Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday night, offering real-time responses to the candidates' statements.

In a focus group hosted by Lee Carter, participants across the political spectrum used dials showing their favorable, unfavorable or neutral responses to Vance and Walz. Their reactions gave insights into how the voters who will help decide the election felt about the demeanor, character and policies of the two men, one of whom will be the next vice president.

Here are some of the most significant voter reactions from Tuesday night's focus group.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

Vance's argument that the U.S. needed to ""stop the bleeding"" at the border during Tuesday's debate elicited a mixed response from voters.

Vance received mixed responses when he said, ""Before we talk about deportations, we have to stop the bleeding... we have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies.""

While Republican views of Vance's answers had an immediate positive response, Democratic viewers of the debate went in an opposite direction, the dials showed. Independents, meanwhile, hovered around a neutral response to Vance's answer.

Voters began to see Vance's response in a more positive light when he touched on former President Trump's border policies, arguing that the next administration should return to handling the border similar to how Trump did during his four years in office.

Democrats and independents reacted moderately-to-highly favorable to Walz's rejoinder on the migrant crisis and his criticism of the Trump administration.

Walz touted the bipartisan immigration bill that Trump pushed to kill earlier this year and defended Kamala Harris' record in California on the issue. Republicans were unfavorable to Walz but independents and Democrats gave him high marks throughout his answer.

""Pass the bill, she'll sign it,"" Walz said.

Republican, Democrat and independent voters reacted differently when Vance stated that he and Trump support ""clean air, clean water"" when climate change was brought up at the debate.

""Look, a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns. I think it's important for us, first of all, to say, Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water. We want the environment to be cleaner and safer,"" Vance said.

The Fox News Debate Dial showed support among independents and Democrats dipping downward when Vance made that statement. Support among Republicans remained fairly consistent.

But support among independent viewers began to rise again when Vance referenced how Democrats bring up carbon emissions when discussing climate change.

""This idea that carbon emissions drives all of the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true just for the sake of argument. So we're not arguing about weird science. Let's just say that's true,"" Vance said. ""Well, if you believe that, what would you -- would you want to do? The answer is that you'd want to restore as much American manufacturing as possible, and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world.""

One of Walz's most difficult moments at the debate received poor to middling reviews across the board from the focus group.

Moderators confronted Walz on his prior claim that he was present at the Tiananmen Square protests in Hong Kong in 1989, when he didn't travel to Asia until later that year. Walz gave a meandering answer that showed sub-par responses from Democrats, Republicans and independents almost throughout his entire comment, which didn't directly address the discrepancy.

At one point, he admitted he could be a ""knucklehead."" He eventually admitted he'd misspoke.

Walz's support among Republicans dipped to its lowest point - under 10% - when he said former President Donald Trump would have benefited from participating in one of his China trips, arguing Trump would never have befriended Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Despite CBS announcing that it would not allow live fact-checking during the debate, moderator Margaret Brennan interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming public resources in Springfield, Ohio.

Independent and Republican voters disapproved of the interjection, but independent voters dipped significantly when Vance began explaining his stance.

Independents were mixed, while Republicans were highly favorable of Vance saying he was ""wrong"" about Trump in the past when confronted about his past criticism of his running mate.

""Sometimes, of course, I've disagreed with the president, but I've also been extremely open about the fact that I was wrong about Donald Trump. I was wrong, first of all, because I believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record,"" Vance said.

When Walz was asked whether he supports abortion up until the ninth month as Minnesota is one of the least restrictive states for abortion, he responded, ""That's not what the bill says.""

While Republican voters dipped significantly as Walz spoke, independent and Democratic voters stayed mostly in the approval zone.

""What we did is restore Roe v. Wade, we made sure that we put women in charge of their health care,"" Walz said.

Independents dipped slightly in approval while Democratic voters shot up during his statement. The two eventually evened out and stayed in the approval zone.

""This is a basic human right,"" he later said.

The independent voters stayed slightly under the Democratic approval line, as Republicans significantly disapproved.

Vance received a positive reaction across the board from Democrats, Republicans and Independents when he told Walz he was sorry his son was once a witness to a shooting.

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting, and I'm sorry about that,"" the senator told Walz.

Independents gave Vance an immediate low rating when he said he was focused on the future after Walz asked him if Trump lost the 2020 election.

Republicans on the Fox News Debate Dial had been unimpressed with Walz's line of questioning and the dial went down, with the approval staying generally the same with Vance's answers, but the dials for independents and Democrats took a sharp dive as Vance brushed off the question. It dove the sharpest among independents.

Liberal media pundits repeatedly played and discussed the clip in the debate's aftermath, saying it was one of Walz's strongest moments in a night that Vance otherwise controlled.

Trump says Walz 'embarrassed himself' compared to Vance's 'brilliance' at VP debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-walz-embarrassed-himself-compared-vances-brilliance-vp-debate,2024-10-02T16:05:42Z,"EXCLUSIVE: Former President Trump said Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz ""embarrassed himself"" during Tuesday night's vice presidential debate, while Sen. JD Vance's steady presentation ""reconfirmed"" his choice to make the senator from Ohio his running mate.

Trump spoke exclusively with Fox News Digital on Wednesday morning, hours after Vance, R-Ohio, and Walz faced off in the CBS News vice presidential debate in New York City. The two sparred on issues like foreign policy, border security, abortion and climate change, while introducing themselves and their records to the American people.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

""JD was fantastic last night -- it just reconfirmed my choice,"" Trump told Fox News Digital. ""There was a brilliance to what he did.""

""On the other hand, Tim Walz proved to be a man that doesn't have it in any way shape or form for the office that he is seeking, though I would put him a large number of steps above Kamala,"" Trump said.

The former president and Republican presidential nominee said Walz ""embarrassed himself and the Democrat Party last night but was made to look even worse by JD's brilliant performance.""

""This is what the country needs; smart people, not people that can't put two sentences together,"" Trump said. ""We have to take our country back.""

Vice presidential debates are traditionally seen as second-tier, but with Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris unlikely to debate again before voters cast their ballots on Nov. 5, the stakes were raised for their running mates as they attempted to tackle the most important issues facing the nation.

CBS News anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan moderated the debate in New York City Tuesday night, which was filled with more substantive policy discussion than personal jabs. Tuesday began with nearly 50,000 unionized dockworkers going on strike from Maine to Texas and ended with Iran launching its largest attack on Israel in history, firing nearly 250 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State.

The first question for Walz and Vance was whether they would support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran.

A visibly shaky Walz had a rough start to the debate, pausing and stumbling over his words as he spoke about the need for ""steady leadership"" from the White House. Instead of answering the question, Walz took a shot at Trump.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz said, pointing to Trump's debate performance against Harris last month. ""It's clear, and the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago. A nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment.""

But Vance, in his first answer, defended Trump, saying he ""delivered stability to the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence.""

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""People were afraid of stepping out of line,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States' global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.""

As for a preemptive strike, Vance said, ""It is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe. And we should support our allies wherever they are, when they're fighting the bad guys.""

Walz fired back. He slammed the Trump administration for pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, saying Iran is ""closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership,"" adding Harris is providing ""steady leadership.""

""You blame Donald Trump, but who has been the vice president for the last 3¬Ω years? And the answer is, your running mate, not mine,"" Vance said.

Vance, again defending Trump, saying he ""consistently made the world more secure.""

""Gov. Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump has already done it once before.""

Vance also urged voters to ask themselves, ""When was the last time that an American president didn't have a major conflict break out?""

""The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was president,"" Vance said.

The debate shifted to the ongoing crisis at the southern border, a top issue for voters.

Vance said he has already been to the border more than ""border czar"" Kamala Harris, while touting Trump's plan to secure the border.

But Walz blasted Trump for his alleged efforts to get Republicans to vote against a border bill.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

""As soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this, Donald Trump said no, told [lawmakers] to vote against it, because it gives him a campaign issue,"" Walz said. ""What would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things?""

On the same topic, moderators asked Vance whether he and Trump would support family separation as part of Trump's proposed ""mass deportation"" should he be elected.

""We have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost,"" Vance explained. ""Some of them have been sex trafficking. Some of them, hopefully, are at homes with their families.

""Some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules. The real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris' wide open southern border. And I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, she said she was going to do this. Real leadership would be saying, 'You know what, I screwed up. We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border policies.' I wish that she would do that. It would be good for all of us.""

As for the issue of abortion, another top issue for voters this cycle, Walz maintained that he and Harris are pro-choice, while Vance said Republicans need to ""do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they, frankly, just don't trust us.""

""And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us, as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies,"" Vance said. ""I want to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family. And I think there's so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options right now."""
Majority of NY Times columnists agree JD Vance won debate: 'Much more forceful speaker',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/majority-ny-times-columnists-agree-jd-vance-won-debate-forceful-speaker,2024-10-02T14:38:02Z,"GOP, Democrat, and Independent voters react in real-time to Ohio Senator JD Vance's claims that he and former President Trump care about the environment during Tuesday night's CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Credit: CBS)

A majority of the 13 columnists and contributors polled by The New York Times agreed that JD Vance won the debate against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday night.

Multiple New York Times columnists, including Binyamin Appelbaum, said that Vance was overall effective in his presentation on the debate stage. Seven of the columnists and contributors said that Vance defeated Walz in the debate, with two saying that the face-off was a draw and three writers concluding that Walz won.

""He made Trumpism sound polite, calm and coherent,"" Appelbaum said of Vance.

GOP LAWMAKERS, LEADERS REACT TO VANCE, WALZ DEBATE: 'SPITTING COLD, HARD TRUTH'

""Vance was far nimbler than the nervous Tim Walz, especially in the first half of the debate. But as the debate went on, Vance stumbled on two issues -- abortion and the 2020 election -- where his rhetorical skill could not salvage the very unappealing material he was working with,"" Josh Barro, author of the newsletter Very Serious, wrote.

""Walz won,"" Times columnist Charles M. Blow wrote. ""You could tell that he was a teacher, because he clearly did his homework. Anyone afraid that Vance would roll over him could breathe easily.""

Newsletter writer Matt Labash said that ""Nobody truly dominated.""

""But I'm giving the slight edge to Walz, since Vance embarrassingly soft-pedaled Jan. 6 and Trump posted this to Truth Social during the debate: 'More Notes! Why Can't Walz just remember what he has to say? Low IQ!' Reminding us that Vance's boss should watch more Hallmark Channel, less Newsmax.""

VANCE, WALZ FACE OFF ON BORDER, CLIMATE CHANGE AND ABORTION DURING VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Other writers said that the debate outcome was more even.

Contributing Times Opinion writer Jane Coaston wrote that ""Vance seemed smoother and more practiced, but 'won' is a very strong term here.""

Times columnist Gail Collins said that the debate was a ""draw"" because ""Walz was so bad in much of his delivery. Vance was a much more forceful speaker while spewing lies on everything from abortion to Biden's foreign policy.""

Contributing Times opinion writer Peter Wehner said that Vance proved he was ""sharp and in command and ... an excellent debater.""

""At times he tried too hard to appear likable; I came away more convinced that he's a hollow man, radioactive and incendiary one day, conciliatory and agreeable the next,"" Wehner said. ""But the 'good Vance' did a lot to repair his tattered image.""

Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital, ""Senator JD Vance completely dominated the debate and showed why we need to return President Trump to the White House."" He added that Trump's vice presidential nominee ""gave clear answers how the Trump-Vance ticket will turn around our economy, secure our southern border, make our streets safe once again, and restore peace in the Middle East.""

Cheung continued by saying that Vance ""exposed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz for being failed, radical leftists who are all slogans with zero substance.""

""He called out Kamala Harris for destroying our southern border. He called out Harris for creating the record inflation making life unaffordable for millions of Americans. And he called out Harris for enabling Iran, leading to the current attacks on Israel,"" the spokesman added.

Media critics pan Walz's 'unsteady' debate performance: 'Clear lack of preparation and execution',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/media-critics-pan-walzs-debate-performance-clear-lack-preparation-execution,2024-10-02T09:07:34Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Members of the legacy media appear to agree that Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz underperformed at the CBS News Vice Presidential debate.

""I think there was a clear lack of preparation and execution on Walz's part,"" CNN anchor Abby Phillip said.

ABC News' Linsey Davis called out Walz's ""uncomfortable, cringey moments,"" linking his debate performance to President Biden's disastrous showing at the CNN debate.

""It kind of reminded me of the June 27 debate when Kamala Harris said that night of Joe Biden 'It was a slow start but a strong finish.' And that's how I felt that Tim Walz kind of did tonight,"" Davis said.

""Dems are fortunate presidential debates tend to matter a lot more than VP debates,"" Cook Political Report senior editor Dave Wasserman reacted on X.

JD VANCE REMINDS CBS MODERATORS OF DEBATE RULES AFTER THEY TRY TO FACT-CHECK HIM

""Where is the Tim Walz who went viral going after 'weird' Republicans? Not showing up on that debate stage so far tonight..."" New Yorker staff writer Susan Glasser posted.

""Gov. Walz is not prosecuting the case rather its a nicefest. If you agree with Vance on so much then why should we vote for you?"" MSNBC host Symone Sanders Townsend asked the governor. ""Sen. Vance is giving revisionist history on Trump's agenda & what they would do & b/c the moderators are not fact checking...it sounds sane.""

""Walz's answers are smart and substantive. But I hate to say it, the delivery is a bit off -- he's just not as engaging as he often is. Hoping he gets a little more energetic and less nervous as this goes on,"" liberal columnist Jill Filipovic said.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

Others made it clear that Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio was the clear winner of the night.

""I would rate that the most successful Republican debate performance of this century, eclipsing Romney in the first debate with Obama in 2012,"" New York Times columnist Ross Douthat said.

""Vance is going home tonight with Walz's wallet. Vance didn't even have to snatch it, Walz just handed it over, along with a bunch of unearned compliments to Vance's fine character,"" The Atlantic's David Frum concluded.

""Vance is winning the debate. He is clearly the best debater of the 4 candidates running for president or vice president. His abortion answer/pivot was masterful,"" former CNN editor-at-large Chris Cillizza said. ""Walz has been fine -- but uneven. His answer on the lie that he was in China during Tiananmen Square was AWFUL.""

""Malpractice that Walz didn't have a sharp, succinct answer to the Tiananmen Square question ready to go,"" The Atlantic writer Tim Alberta similarly noted.

""I say this with love: Democrats are too dependent on friendly treatment from the moderators,"" Washington Post columnist Megan McArdle reacted to Alberta's comment.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

Some critics knocked Walz's lack of media exposure leading to his fumbling performance.

""I think the lack of interviews he has done with national media, with local media, it showed,"" said CNN anchor Dana Bash, the only journalist who has interviewed Walz since he joined the Democratic ticket.

""I think that Walz did seem unsteady,"" ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl said. ""And frankly, what I saw is somebody who has not faced questions on a national stage since he became the Democratic nominee. He was simply out of practice. I mean, I don't know why they've done it, but they've kept him out of the limelight. They've kept him away from reporters. They haven't had him do any interviews. And he was clearly unsteady through much of that debate. In contrast, J.D. Vance was very smooth.""

""Hate to say it but Walz would have benefitted from doing a few Sunday morning shows, as Vance has been,"" Financial Times associate editor Edward Luce said.

MSNBC's Rachel Maddow perhaps offered a more charitable take on the debate.

""I wouldn't describe them as evenly matched because they are so different, so different in style and so different on substance,"" Maddow told her MSNBC colleagues. ""I think the big picture takeaway in this is that one of these candidates is much slicker than the other, much more practiced, kind of professional debate style speaker, and the other candidate won."""
Top 5 moments from only VP debate between Vance and Walz before election,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-5-moments-from-only-vp-debate-between-vance-walz-before-election,2024-10-02T08:11:29Z,"Fox News Digital ranks the top five memorable moments from the 2024 Vice Presidential Debate between Senator JD Vance and Governor Tim Walz.

Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., met face to face on Tuesday night in New York City for the only vice presidential debate before the election.

The event covered a variety of subjects ranging from immigration to climate change to abortion as the two lesser known politicians sought to make their introductions to American voters before election day.

Here are the top moments from the debate:

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

After CBS News' Margaret Brennan offered an impromptu fact-check in response to Vance describing cities being overwhelmed by illegal immigration, noting that many Haitians in Springfield, Ohio have been granted a legal status, Vance hit back at her for violating the terms of the debate.

""Margaret, the rules were that you are not going to fact-check. And since you're fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" he said. ""So there's an application called the CBP one app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand.""

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

Vance told Walz that he was sorry to hear that his son had been witness to a shooting, in a moment of civility that was particularly frequent during the vice presidential debate. This civility has also been less and less common during presidential debates, which have proven contentious in recent election cycles.

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting, and I'm sorry about that,"" the senator told Walz.

JD VANCE REMINDS CBS MODERATORS OF DEBATE RULES AFTER THEY TRY TO FACT-CHECK HIM

""The American citizens have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border. It is a disgrace, Tim,"" Vance said during the debate.

""And I actually think I agree with you,"" the Ohio senator said, adding, ""I think you want to solve this problem.""

""But I don't think that Kamala Harris does.""

Walz claimed there would be ""a registry of pregnancies"" under what he said was Trump and Vance's Project 2025. The Project 2025 is an endeavor of conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation.

""It's going to make it more difficult, if not impossible, to get contraception and limit access, if not eliminate access, to infertility treatments,"" he said.

But Vance denied this claim. ""No, certainly we won't,"" he pushed back at the statement.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

Walz referred back to his notes in one answer on Tuesday night, after frequently scribbling down observations during the debate.

""Economists can't be trusted. Science can't be trusted. National security folks can't be trusted,"" he listed, referencing Vance's skepticism of those heralded as experts. ""Look, if you're going to be president, you don't have all the answers. Donald Trump believes he does.""

Even Trump poked fun at the noticeable amount of notes that the Minnesota governor was taking, writing on Truth Social, ""Walz is taking so many notes - Never seen a Candidate take more! He needs the notes to keep his brain intact."""

Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance took the same stage for their first and only vice presidential debate this election cycle on Tuesday evening, when the pair had a handful of fiery clashes over top voter concerns.

The CBS News Vice Presidential Debate showcased the two vice presidential candidates' platforms on issues such as the ongoing war raging in the Middle East, abortion laws and their respective tickets' economic records. Amid the 90-minute debate, Vance and Walz had a handful of clashes, including moderators turning off Vance's microphone.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

The CBS debate's rules included leaving microphones on for both candidates no matter who was speaking, breaking from the two presidential debates this cycle that muted microphones when a candidate was not speaking. The outlet, however, reserved the right to turn the microphones off if they felt it was warranted.

Moderators Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell did mute the pair Tuesday when Vance spoke up to complain that the moderators were trying to fact-check him on his remarks regarding illegal immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.

""The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border. It is a disgrace,"" Vance said referring to about immigration issues in a city in his home state.

After Vance and Walz both delivered responses regarding immigration, Brennan told viewers that Springfield ""does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status.""

Vance took issues with the on-air ""fact-check"" before he was muted.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS ADMITS FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP WAS BECAUSE CNN LET HIS STATEMENTS 'HANG' AT FIRST DEBATE

""The rules were that you were not going to fact-check, and since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" Vance said. ""So there's an application called the CBP. One app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand. That is not a person coming in. Applying for a green card and waiting for ten years.""

Moderators tried to quiet Vance before cutting his and Walz's mics.

""Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Margaret Brennan said. ""We have so much we want to get to.""

Walz was forced to answer questions regarding his travel to China during Tuesday night's debate.

Walz has said he was in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets, however, are now reporting that Walz actually did not travel to China until August of that year.

CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan asked Walz to explain the discrepancy.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""Look, I grew up in a small rural Nebraska town, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service,"" a visibly shaky Walz said. ""I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher.""

""I came back home and then started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams. We would take baseball teams. We would take dancers. And we would go back and forth to China,"" Walz said, noting the trips were ""to try and learn.""

""Look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community, and I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect,"" Walz continued.

""And I'm a knucklehead at times.""

Brennan pushed back, reminding Walz of the question and again asking him to explain the discrepancy.

""All I said on this was, as I got there that summer and misspoke on this,"" Walz said. ""So, I will just -- that's what I've said. So, I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests, went in and, from that, I learned a lot of what needed to be in in governance.""

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Walz claimed during the debate that a woman in Georgia likely died due to the state's ""restrictive"" abortion laws after Roe v. Wade was overturned, sparking a clash with Vance.

""There's a young woman named Amber Thurman. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurmond died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights, as basic as the right to control your own body, is determined on geography,"" Walz said during the debate while sparring with Vance on abortion laws.

""There's a very real chance that if Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe v. Wade,"" he said.

Walz's remarks come after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits after the women received chemically induced abortions in 2022.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

Vance shot back that a Minnesota abortion law does not require doctors to save a baby who survives an abortion.

""First of all, governor, I agree with you, Amber Thurman should still be alive, and there are a lot of people who should still be alive. And I certainly wish that she was. And maybe you're free to disagree with me on this and explain this to me. But as I read the Minnesota law that you signed into law, the statute that you signed into law, it says that a doctor who presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide lifesaving care to a baby who survives a botched late term abortion,"" he said.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

""That's not true,"" Walz said.

""Choice or not option that is fundamentally barbaric,"" Vance continued.

The pair also sparred over immigration a handful of times throughout the debate, including Vance slamming Vice President Kamala Harris for her handling of immigration.

""First of all, the gross majority of what we need to do to the southern border is just empowering law enforcement to do their job,"" Vance said during a discussion on the Haitian migrant surge in Springfield, Ohio, and immigration overall.

""I've been to the southern border more than our 'border czar' Kamala Harris has been. And it's actually heartbreaking because the Border Patrol agents, they just want to be empowered to do their job.""

Vance continued by saying that, ""of course, additional resources would help,"" but that the issue is mostly about the Biden administration not empowering law enforcement to say ""if you try to come across the border illegally, you've got to stay in Mexico"" and ""go back through proper channels.""

VANCE RIPS WALZ ON ECONOMY, SAYS HE'S FORCED TO 'PRETEND' TRUMP DIDN'T LOWER INFLATION

""Now, Gov. Walz brought up the community of Springfield, and he's very worried about the things that I've said in Springfield,"" Vance said. ""Look, in Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed. You've got hospitals that are overwhelmed. You've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.

Walz repeatedly argued Trump shut down a Senate immigration bill earlier this year that he believes would have made strengthened border security.

""It is law enforcement that asked for the bill,"" Walz said. ""They helped craft it. They're the ones that supported it. It was because they know we need to do this. Look, this issue of continuing to bring this up, of not dealing with it, of blaming migrants for everything.

""On housing, we could talk a little bit about Wall Street speculators buying up housing and making them less affordable, but it becomes a blame. Look, this bill also gives the money necessary to adjudicate. I agree it should not take seven years for an asylum claim to be done.""

""This bill gets it done in 90 days. Then, you start to make a difference in this, and you start to adhere to what we know, American principles. I don't talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about to the least amongst us, you do unto me. I think that's true of most Americans. They simply want order to it. This bill does it. It's funded. It's supported by the people who do it, and it lets us keep our dignity about how we treat other people.""

The pair of vice presidential candidates also sparred over the threat of censorship on Tuesday, as Walz pressed Vance on the 2020 election and Jan. 6, 2021.

""It's really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th, as we have done for 250 years in this country. We are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election,"" Vance said after Walz cited Jan. 6, when Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol.

""We have to remember that for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections. Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time, and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board. But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had, I don't buy that, governor,"" Vance continued.

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

Walz countered that ""Jan. 6 was not Facebook ads.""

""This idea that there's censorship to stop people from doing, threatening to kill someone, threatening to do something, that's not that's not censorship. Censorship is book banning. We've seen that. We've seen that brought up,"" he continued.

Walz continued that Trump has repeatedly claimed he won the 2020 presidential election.

""Did he lose the 2020 election?"" Walz asked Vance of Trump during the last election cycle.

""Tim, I'm focused on the future,"" Vance replied. ""Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 Covid situation?""

""That is a damning non-answer,"" Walz said. ""I'm pretty shocked by this. He lost the election. This is not a debate, it's not anything anywhere other than in Donald Trump's world.""

""It's a damning non-answer for you to not talk about censorship,"" Vance shot back.

Reactions from conservatives on social media poured in during and following the first and only vice presidential debate on Tuesday night with the majority praising JD Vance for his performance.

""This was a massacre,"" Outkick founder Clay Travis posted on X. ""JD Vance absolutely destroyed Tim Walz.""

""JD Vance just won big,"" conservative commentator Charlie Kirk posted on X along with a video montage of facial reactions by the two candidates. ""And it wasn't even close.""

""Tonight's debate underscored that the Harris-Walz ticket is the most radical in our nation's history,"" Jessica Anderson, President of Sentinel Action Fund, said in a statement.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

""As Governor, Walz implemented his far-left agenda in Minnesota, with soft-on-crime policies, authoritarian COVID lockdowns, and support for limitless abortion. As Vice President, he will expand his extremism beyond Minnesota as the unapologetic wingman for Kamala Harris.""

""Vance absolutely crushed it tonight and secured a very bright future in the GOP,"" American Principles Project President Terry Schilling posted on X.

The Harris campaign released a statement following the debate expressing why it believes that Walz, not Vance, had the strongest night.

""Tonight, Governor Walz showed exactly why Vice President Harris picked him: he is a leader who cares about the issues that matter most to the American people,"" Harris-Walz Campaign Chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a statement. ""In the debate, Americans got to see a real contrast: a straight talker focused on sharing real solutions, and a slick politician who spent the whole night defending Donald Trump's division and failures.""

""On every single issue - the economy, health care, foreign policy, reproductive freedom, gun violence - Governor Walz won. He spoke passionately about the Vice President's vision for a new way forward for the country. And in what was the most critical moment of the entire debate, which came in its final exchange, he stood up for our Constitution, while JD Vance admitted he'd put Trump ahead of the country.""

O'Malley Dillon continued, ""The choice facing the American people in November was on full display tonight: between charting a new way forward, or going backwards. Vice President Harris believes that the American people deserve to see her and Trump on the debate stage one more time. She will be in Atlanta on October 23 - Donald Trump should step up and face the voters.""

The Trump campaign said in a statement that Vance ""unequivocally won tonight's debate in dominating fashion"" in what was ""the best debate performance from any Vice-Presidential candidate in history.""

""Senator Vance spoke the truth, eloquently prosecuted the case against Kamala Harris' failed record, and effectively held Governor Tim Walz accountable for his lies on behalf of the Harris-Biden Administration,"" Trump senior advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said. ""Senator Vance also perfectly articulated the Trump-Vance vision to make America safe again with their plan to launch the largest mass deportation operation in history; to make America strong again with a peace through strength foreign policy agenda; and to make America wealthy again by cutting taxes, unleashing American energy dominance, and ending inflation.""

New Jersey Democrat proposes bill to create travel advisories to inform pregnant women of state abortion laws,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-jersey-democrat-proposes-bill-create-travel-advisories-inform-pregnant-women-state-abortion-laws,2024-10-02T07:37:38Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

A New Jersey Democrat introduced legislation establishing travel advisories informing women of restrictive abortion laws in other states they may be visiting.

The bill, proposed by state Sen. John Burzichelli, would require New Jersey's health and state departments to launch a website that would list color codes for states depending on how restrictive their abortion laws are, according to NJ Spotlight News.

""If you're an individual, a woman, traveling across this country for business -- or if you're thinking about going to school in Mississippi [for instance] -- it will help you to know what kind of medical services are available to you should you need emergency care of some kind,"" Burzichelli told the outlet.

The color codes under the ""Reproductive Health Travel Advisory"" are blue, yellow and red.

GEORGIA JUDGE OVERTURNS STATE'S SIX-WEEK 'HEARTBEAT' ABORTION LAW, CALLS IT 'UNCONSTITUTIONAL'

Blue would mean women can exercise normal caution and access to abortion would be available without fear of civil or criminal prosecution, and yellow would mean women should exercise increased caution as abortion restrictions could result in civil or criminal prosecution. Red would mean women are urged to reconsider travel because abortion access is extremely restricted and could result in medical issues and civil or criminal prosecution.

""Right now, there's no single place to go to say, 'OK I have to travel. I have to go to Texas and then move over and go to Tennessee,'"" Burzichelli said. ""You don't have that info at your fingertips. You can find it, but it's a hodge-podge.""

""You, as an American female, do not have equal rights across all 50 states,"" he added. ""And it's important for you to know what rights you don't have when you go somewhere, because something unexpected could happen.""

JUDGE BLOCKS NY AG LETITIA JAMES FROM TRYING TO SILENCE PREGNANCY CENTERS THAT PROMOTE ABORTION PILL REVERSAL

The proposal comes after the U.S. Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in 2022, returning the power to make laws on abortion access back to the states.

Following the ruling, a number of Republican-controlled states enacted laws restricting abortion access, with some exceptions such as in cases of medical emergencies, while some Democrat-controlled states have approved advanced protections of abortion access.

""It's hard to imagine we're even talking about this in 2024 in America,"" Burzichelli said. ""To think that we have to think about even doing this just speaks volumes about where we are at the moment,""

New Jersey expanded access to abortion, enacting statutory protection for abortion as a fundamental right, and the state's highest court ruled the ""fundamental right of a woman to control her body and destiny"" is protected under the state's constitution, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights.

The state also welcomes women who travel from other states for an abortion because their own states have bans in place. Additionally, the Garden State protects them from being extradited after the procedure."
Vance vs. Walz debate: Top takeaways from VP candidates' face-off,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/vance-vs-walz-debate-top-takeaways-from-vp-candidates-face-off,2024-10-02T05:50:19Z,"In recent weeks, Tim Walz' team tried to lower expectations for his debate with rival JD Vance. Now we know why.

Democratic vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Walz did not turn in a disastrous performance on the debate stage, but he was clearly outclassed by Ohio Sen. Vance. Trump supporters who have questioned the young Ohio senator's qualifications for the nation's second-highest office, or asked why the former president chose him to be his running mate, slept better on Tuesday night. He was sharp, appealing, and policy-savvy. Most important, Vance totally upended the media's unflattering characterization of him by being sympathetic, respectful and likeable.

Vance had the advantage of having held dozens of press interviews in recent weeks; he was ready and tested. By contrast, Walz has done almost no unscripted encounters with the media since he became the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate; his inability to go beyond talking points and delve deep into policy was not surprising.

VANCE, WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENDS WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TOUTING 'NEW' FUTURE

Walz spent much of the debate talking about programs he claimed to have successfully enacted in Minnesota, like paid family leave. What he was supposed to do on Tuesday night was make the case for running mate Vice President Kamala Harris.

Over and over during the nearly two hour debate, Vance asked the most salient question, also posed by Trump during his debate. Harris has been in the White House for the past three and a half years - why hasn't she moved forward on the policies she now claims will solve the nation's problems?

As with the ABC presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, the CBS News moderators embarrassed themselves by clearly favoring the Democrat contestant. Moreover, CBS' Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell affected a grating school-marmish tone, overly eager to chaperone what was an extremely orderly debate.

Their questions featured well-worn Democrat priorities (climate change, abortion) and they largely avoided topics that could have played well for Vance, like crime. O'Donnell challenged the senator on Trump formerly calling climate change a ""hoax"" and then asserted gratuitously that ""the overwhelming consensus is that the climate is changing.""

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

Moreover, having said they would not fact-check the candidates, the two women intervened more than once to question a response from Vance, while doing so only one time with Walz.

Unhappily for the Minnesota governor, that one probing question was calamitous. Asked why he had falsely claimed to be in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Walz launched into a word salad that would have made Kamala Harris proud, talking about his experiences traveling in China. Asked again to answer why he had been untruthful, Walz misfired and looked stunned. In effect, he was caught out in a lie. Since he has a history of spinning falsehoods about his past, and especially about his military rank, this was not helpful.

Vance, like Walz, was meant to argue the case for his running mate, and that he did. When the moderators and Walz derided Trump's claim during the presidential debate that he had the ""concept of a plan"" on health care, Vance said that Trump did not have a plan - he had a record. More than once during the evening he reminded the audience that during Trump's presidency inflation was low, the border was closed and the world was at peace.

KAMALA HARRIS MAKES A DESPERATE MOVE ON A CRITICAL ISSUE TO SAVE A SINKING CAMPAIGN

When moderator Margaret Brennan pushed Vance to explain why Trump had abandoned the Iran nuclear deal, thus purportedly allowing the terror state to speed up its efforts to build a nuclear weapon, Vance noted that for the past three-plus years Harris and Biden have been in charge. He rightly pointed out that they helped rebuild Iran's ability to wage war by not enforcing the Trump sanctions, thus allowing the mullahs to grow their income by $100 billion. With Iran just having attacked Israel with 180 missiles, Vance's referencing the Reagan-Trump doctrine of peace through strength resonated.

While Walz repeated Harris' vague promises about making life better for middle class families, Vance reminded the audience that take-home pay had risen under Trump and inflation was low, while under Harris, prices on everything from food to housing had shot up more than 20%. When Walz claimed economists backed Harris' plan over Trump's, Vance responded that Trump didn't have Ph.D.s on his team, he had common sense.

When Walz accused Trump of wanting to enact tariffs on imports, which would serve as a new tax on Americans, Vance congratulated President Joe Biden on keeping the former president's tariffs on China in place, defusing the issue.

Over and over during the nearly two hour debate, Vance asked the most salient question, also posed by Trump during his debate. Harris has been in the White House for the past three and a half years - why hasn't she moved forward on the policies she now claims will solve the nation's problems?

Vance clearly won the dispute over the border, noting that Harris had bragged for three years about undoing all the restrictions that Trump put in place. When Brennan challenged Vance on how Trump would handle separating families while carrying out deportations, Vance referred to the horrifying report that the Department of Homeland Security has lost track of more than 320,000 children brought across the border illegally - a damning and heartbreaking situation that has resulted from Harris' open border.

Not surprisingly, the debate got heated on the subject of abortion. Vance criticized the Minnesota law signed by Walz that does not require the doctor to do everything necessary for the care of a baby that survives a late-term abortion. Walz disputed the characterization, but Vance is correct. Walz, meanwhile, charged Vance with having earlier backed a 15-week national abortion ban. Vance explained that he shares Trump's view that the states are now charged with setting the regulations.

The candidates sparred on other topics, and took expected swipes at each other's running mates, but both maintained their composure and even agreed that on some issues, like school safety, they could likely find some common ground. Especially given the Harris-Walz strategy of avoiding scrutiny and trying to hide their progressive agendas, it was an unusually useful event for America's voters.

The winner of the night, without a doubt, was JD Vance. Will it matter? After all, many argue that no one votes for the V.P. But voters tell pollsters they do not enough about Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.

Ohio Sen. JD Vance's argument that the U.S. needed to ""stop the bleeding"" at the border during Tuesday's debate elicited a mixed response from voters,

""Before we talk about deportations, we have to stop the bleeding,"" Vance argued during Tuesday's debate. ""We have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies.""

According to Fox News debate dials, which measure how Republican, Democrat, and Independent voters are responding to particular answers by candidates during the debate, the response by Vance received mixed responses.

While Republican views of Vance's answers had an immediate positive response, Democratic viewers of the debate went in an opposite direction, the dials showed. Independents, meanwhile, hovered around 50% approval with Vance's answer.

Voters began to see Vance's response in a more positive light when he touched on former President Donald Trump's border policies, arguing that the next administration should return to handling the border similar to how Trump did during his four years in office.

Voters also responded well to Vance's remarks on deportation, where the Ohio Senator argued in favor of focusing on those who have committed crimes in addition to crossing the border illegally.

While Republican voters dipped significantly as Walz spoke, independent and Democratic voters stayed mostly in the approval zone.

JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walz's performances at the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

The largely civil and arguably quite informative debate between Democratic nominee Gov. Tim Walz and Republican nominee Sen. JD Vance on Tuesday night has underscored one thing. We need another presidential debate.

Both Walz and Vance stuck to familiar positions on the issues on the debate stage, whether it was on the economy, health care, energy or immigration. No new ground was broken, no dramatic changes in policy were unveiled.

Still, the debate, in my estimation, was very important for a fundamental reason: it was civil, it was informative, and it included a surprisingly high degree of bipartisanship that has been noticeably absent from the 2024 presidential race.

It is certain that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump watched the debate. And both, I am sure, concluded that their respective running mates did an excellent job in both underscoring their core positions as well as attacking their rivals.

VANCE, WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENDS WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TOUTING 'NEW' FUTURE

But most importantly, on Tuesday night there was a comment that I think both candidates underscored in their own way: That we can do better as Americans, we can solve our problems and provide leadership as people who disagree, and sometimes vigorously, but have a broader purpose beyond our narrow partisan concerns.

The nearly two-hour event underscored this key point: you can't just run on joy and you can't just run on bitterness about what has happened in the past.

This is not simply a homily. It's much more. It is a large-scale call for a different kind of politics, even if implicitly made by both candidates, it is a recognition of the extraordinary challenges we face, both domestically and internationally, in the wake of Iran's attack on Israel. And most of all, it underscores to me why both presidential candidates need to quickly accept the invitation of various news networks for another debate or more debates in the final 35 days of this campaign.

It's virtually certain that no minds were changed on Tuesday night.

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

To be sure, the pundits will be vetting what the candidates said or didn't say about immigration and abortion. Two topics on which they disagree vehemently. But the two vice presidential candidates were largely repeating and underscoring what their respective nominees have said and believe.

The key now is for the media to focus on what the American people want and require as this extraordinary race comes down to the finish line. The two presidential campaigns need to face off, at least once, if not more times, to discuss and debate their positions on the issues with a greater degree of specificity and precision than they have done previously.

The 2024 presidential race is now an effective statistical tie. This is especially true when one looks at the seven key swing states in this election. There is a degree of uncertainty about precisely where the candidates stand on the important issues facing our country after a raucous presidential debate last month that was more personally divisive than it was informative.

JD VANCE REMINDS CBS MODERATORS OF DEBATE RULES AFTER THEY TRY TO FACT-CHECK HIM

For us to make an informed choice as Americans, we need to replicate what happened on Tuesday night with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The two presidential candidates need to tell us, in programmatic terms, what they will do on the economy, immigration, crime, health care, energy and, of course, on foreign affairs, a critical topic which did not get anywhere near the attention it deserved and required.

The level of dissatisfaction of the American electorate with the candidates and with the political process cannot be overestimated. We saw what the American people deserve but have not received until now in this presidential election.

The nearly two-hour event underscored this key point: you can't just run on joy and you can't just run on bitterness about what has happened in the past.

Both vice presidential candidates were likable on Tuesday night. Vance had heretofore not been seen that way. On the debate stage, it was hard not to empathize with him, even if you disagreed with him. Likewise, Walz delivered as a likable everyman figure.

I came away from the presidential debate last month not wanting to have dinner with either Trump or Harris. After the V.P. debate, I wanted to get to know both candidates better.

My takeaway from Tuesday night is that, for virtually the first time in this election cycle, Vance and Walz quietly acknowledged that the electorate requires something more before Election Day. It's up to Trump and Harris to give it to them--in person--at least one more time, if not more."

JD Vance addresses the Iran Nuclear Deal during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Democrat vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz faced off Tuesday night in their first -- and only -- debate, sparring over issues from foreign policy to border security; abortion to climate change; and introducing themselves and their records to the American people with just five weeks to Election Day.

Vice presidential debates are traditionally seen as second-tier, but with former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris unlikely to debate again before voters cast their ballots on Nov. 5th, the stakes were raised for their running mates as they attempted to tackle the most important issues facing the nation.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

CBS News anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan moderated the debate in New York City Tuesday night, which was filled with more substantive policy discussion than personal jabs, on a day that began with nearly 50,000 unionized dock workers going on strike from Maine to Texas and ended with Iran launching its largest attack on Israel in history, firing nearly 250 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State.

The first question for Walz and Vance was whether they would support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran.

A visibly shaky Walz had a tough start to the debate, pausing and stumbling over his words as he spoke about the need for ""steady leadership"" from the White House. Instead of answering the question, Walz took a shot at Trump.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz said, pointing to Trump's debate performance against Harris last month. ""It's clear, and the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago, a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment.""

But Vance, in his first answer, defended Trump, saying he ""delivered stability to the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence.""

""People were afraid of stepping out of line,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.""

As for a preemptive strike, Vance said ""it is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe.""

""And we should support our allies wherever they are, when they're fighting the bad guys,"" Vance said.

Walz fired back, slamming the Trump administration for pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, saying Iran is ""closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership,"" while saying Harris is providing ""steady leadership.""

But Vance fired back.

""You blame Donald Trump, but who has been the vice president for the last three and a half years? And the answer is, your running mate -- not mine,"" Vance said.

Vance, again defending Trump, said he ""consistently made the world more secure.""

""Gov. Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump has already done it once before.""

Vance also urged voters to ask themselves ""when was the last time that an American president didn't have a major conflict break out?""

""The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was president,"" Vance said.

The debate shifted to the ongoing crisis at the southern border -- a top issue for voters.

Vance said he has already been to the border more than ""border czar"" Kamala Harris, while touting Trump's plan to secure the border.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

But Walz blasted Trump for his alleged efforts to get Republicans to vote against a border bill.

""As soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this, Donald Trump said no. told [lawmakers] to vote against it, because it gives him a campaign issue,"" Walz said. ""What would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things?""

On the same topic, moderators asked Vance whether he and Trump would support family separation as part of Trump's proposed ""mass deportation"" should he be elected.

""We have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost,"" Vance explained. ""Some of them have been sex trafficking; some of them, hopefully are at homes with their families; some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules,"" Vance said. ""The real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris's wide open southern border. And I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, she said she was going to do this. Real leadership would be saying, you know what, I screwed up. We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border policies. I wish that she would do that. It would be good for all of us.""

Walz pushed back, saying children have not been used as ""drug mules,"" and defending Harris, saying she was attorney general in California and ""prosecuted transnational gangs for human trafficking and drugs.""

Walz also hit Vance over claims he had made about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, saying he had demonized them.

""Look in Springfield Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans,"" Vance said.

At that point, moderators tried to correct Vance--but the GOP vice presidential nominee pushed back, reminding that the moderators said they would not fact-check the candidates.

The moderators said that many Haitian residents in Springfield, Ohio have legal temporary status. Vance jumped in to ""say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process and tying it to a Harris-backed process, the moderators spoke over him, sarcastically thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Tim Walz attempted to argue with him.

""We have so much we have to get to, thank you so much for explaining the legal process,"" Margaret Brennan said before asking her co-moderator to ask the next question.

As for the issue of abortion, another top issue for voters this cycle, Walz maintained that he and Harris are pro-choice, while Vance said Republicans need to ""do so much better of a job at earning the American People's Trust back on this issue, where they frankly, just don't trust us.""

""And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies,"" Vance said. ""I want to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family. And I think there's so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options right now.""

Vance echoed Trump's view of abortion--supporting the Supreme Court's decision to return the issue of abortion back to the states, while supporting exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: TRUMP MAINTAINS LEAD ON 2 TOP ISSUES AHEAD OF VP DEBATE

""The proper way to handle this, as messy as democracy sometimes is, is to let voters make these decisions,"" Vance said. ""Let the individual states make their abortion policy. And I think that's what makes the most sense in a very big a very diverse. And let's be honest, sometimes a very, very messy and divided country.""

Meanwhile, the moderators switched to questions of leadership -- with the moderators pressing Walz on whether he was actually in China for the Tiananmen Square protests, like he claimed.

A visibly nervous Walz attempted to explain the discrepancy, ultimately saying he ""misspoke"" and was not there until later that year.

And the question for Vance was about his past criticisms of Trump.

Vance said, at the time, he disliked Trump because he ""believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record.""

""Donald Trump delivered for the American people rising wages, rising take-home pay, an economy that worked for normal Americans, a secure southern border. A lot of things, frankly, that I didn't think he'd be able to deliver on. And yeah, when you screw up, when you misspeak, when you get something wrong and you change your mind, you ought to be honest with the American people about it,"" Vance said.

Meanwhile, Vance offered his sympathies to Walz during the section of the debate focused on gun violence, when he learned that Walz's son had witnessed a shooting.

Walz said his 17-year-old son ""witnessed a shooting at a community center playing volleyball.""

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting. I'm sorry about that -- Christ, have mercy,"" Vance said.

The two spoke about school shootings and their plans to solve gun violence.

""We have to make the doors locked better. We have to make the doors stronger. We've got to make the windows stronger, and of course, we've got to increase school resource officers. Because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience,"" Vance said.

Walz said the conversation was a good start but had to go further.

""Even though they have a high gun ownership rate in the country, there are reasonable things that we can do to make a difference. It's not infringing on your Second Amendment. And the idea to have some of these weapons out there, it just doesn't make any sense,"" he said.

And on another top issue this cycle: democracy.

Vance was pushed on his past comments, in which he said he would not have voted to certify the 2020 election results on Jan. 6, 2021.

Vance fired back at the assertion that Trump could pose a ""threat to democracy,"" saying that he believes ""we actually do have a threat to democracy in this country.""

""But unfortunately, it's not the threat to democracy that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz want to talk about. It is the threat of censorship. It's Americans casting aside lifelong friendships because of disagreements over politics. It's big technology companies silencing their fellow citizens,"" Vance said.

Walz redirected the discussion back to Jan. 6, 2021, blasting Trump and Republicans for allegedly denying the events of that day.

""I will tell you this, that when this is over, we need to shake hands this election and the winner needs to be the winner. This has got to stop. It's tearing our country apart,"" Walz said.

But Vance replied, saying it is ""really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th.""

""As we have done for 250 years in this country, we are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election. And of course, I hope that we win, and I think we're going to win,"" Vance said. ""But if Tim Walz is the next vice president, he'll have my prayers. He'll have my best wishes and he'll have my help whenever he wants it.""

But Vance reminded Americans that ""for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections.""

""Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time, and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board,"" Vance said. ""But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had, I don't buy that, governor.""

As the debate came to a close, Vance and Walz both promised voters a new direction for the United States.

""Kamala Harris is bringing us a new way forward,"" Walz said. ""She's bringing us a politics of joy. She's bringing real solutions for the middle class. And she's centering you at the heart of that, all the while asking everyone, join this movement. Make your voices heard.""

Vance also gave a message of change to the voters.

""We need change. We need a new direction. We need a president who has already done this once before and did it well. Please vote for Donald Trump,"" Vance said. ""And whether you vote for me or vote for Tim Walz, I just want to say I'm so proud to be doing this and I'm rooting for you.

Walz came into the debate with better poll numbers than Vance.

According to the latest Fox News national poll, Walz was slightly above water with a 43% favorable rating and a 40% unfavorable rating. Vance stood in negative territory, at 38%-50% favorable/unfavorable.

Heading into the debate, Vance had been very talkative, sitting for scores of interviews and taking plenty of questions from reporters on the campaign trail.

Both running mates get right back on the campaign trail on Wednesday in two of the key seven battleground states that will likely determine whether Harris or Trump succeed President Biden in the White House.

Vance holds campaign events in Auburn Hills and Marne, Michigan. And Walz takes part in a campaign bus tour swing through parts of central Pennsylvania which kicks off at the airport in Harrisburg, the state capital."
Walz repeats Georgia abortion death falsehood decried by doctors as 'fearmongering',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/walz-repeats-georgia-abortion-death-falsehood-decried-doctors-fearmongering,2024-10-02T03:19:45Z,"Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., discusses abortion access during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz claimed during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate that a woman in Georgia likely died due to the state's ""restrictive"" abortion laws following the overturning of Roe, despite doctors previously denouncing such a narrative as ""fearmongering.""

""There's a young woman named Amber Thurman. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurmond died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights, as basic as the right to control your own body, is determined on geography,"" Walz said during the debate while sparring with Vance on abortion laws.

""There's a very real chance that if Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe versus Wade,"" he said.

Walz joined Ohio Sen. JD Vance in New York City on Tuesday evening where the pair squared off on key voter issues this election cycle, including the economy, immigration and abortion.

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Walz's remarks come after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits after the women received chemically induced abortions in 2022. Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

Members of the Democratic Party, including Vice President Kamala Harris, have cited their deaths as evidence for the need to expand abortion access following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.

""Good policy, logical policy, moral policy, humane policy is about saying a healthcare provider will only start providing that care when you're about to die?"" Harris said during an Atlanta campaign event last month, while citing Thurman's death.

OB-GYNs have since criticized the narrative as a misleading story that is being pushed by the media and Democrats.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

""I was not surprised to see this pro-abortion media try to point the blame at Georgia's pro-life laws, but, in fact, Georgia's laws allow doctors to intervene to save the life of the woman,"" Charlotte Lozier Institute Vice President and Director of Medical Affairs Dr. Ingrid Skop recently told Fox News Digital.

""I think the focus of the Democratic Party upon abortion as an issue is only because the American people do not understand the laws. Many times, women are hurt by abortions. It is not necessary for women to live their best life. And, of course, it's the fearmongering and lies that have led us to this place where we are today, where people even think there would be a reason to point at the law.""

Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., and state Rep. Mark Newton have also come out to say they don't believe Georgia laws had anything to do with Thurman's death, but was instead caused by alleged complications from abortion pills, as doctors may have waited too long to intercede.

HARRIS CALLS FOR ELIMINATING FILIBUSTER TO PASS 'ROE' ABORTION BILL INTO FEDERAL LAW

""We never deny a woman an abortion because it's going to harm her in some way. She will always be protected,"" McCormick said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital.

""You have every right to an abortion, even with that heartbeat law,"" he continued. ""So, let's make that very clear right now. When they say there's no exceptions, there's never any law in any state where there's no exceptions. That doesn't exist. That's simply not the way it works. The mother's life is always protected. With that said, it doesn't mean it's easy to get an abortion just because you have a complication or because something goes wrong.""

Republican lawmakers and top voices reacted as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance faced-off in New York City.

""Senator JD Vance spitting the cold hard TRUTH on the debate stage,"" Trump 2024 national press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X. ""Total domination and we are only 20 minutes in.""

The debate in New York City on CBS News was Walz and Vance's only debate prior to the monumental election on Nov. 5.

""Tim Walz is as radical as they come on the issue of immigration,"" Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., wrote on X. ""As governor of Minnesota, he supported free health care, free college tuition, and driver's licenses for illegal immigrants. Innocent Americans have been assaulted & murdered because of this border crisis.""

The debate began with CBS News moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan asking the candidates about their Middle East policy after Iran attacked Israel with a massive missile barrage.

""Tim Walz's answer on Israel was incomprehensible. Like Kamala--Walz has no idea what he is talking about,"" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X. ""Kamala and Walz would make the chaos in the Middle East worse.""

""Iran rained missiles down on Israel TODAY, 1,350 days into Kamala Harris' tenure as Vice President, so naturally Tim Walz says it's Donald Trump's fault,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Tim Murtaugh wrote on X.

""JD knocks it out of the park with first question!!! Tim Walz implodes on first question in presentation, communication, and substance,"" Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., wrote on X.

Republican voices highlighted the Kamala Harris campaign's immigration policy. Immigration is a top issue for American voters this year, as a record number say the situation at the southern border is a major problem or an outright emergency, according to the latest Fox News national survey.

""Law enforcement has been attacked. Deadly fentanyl has taken the lives of thousands of Americans,"" Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott wrote on X. ""Kamala Harris & Tim Walz support open border policies. They will make the border crisis WORSE.""

Disgraced ex-CBS New anchor Dan Rather says old network looking to avoid 'blowback' ABC received,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/dan-rather-says-ex-employer-looking-avoid-blowback-abc-received-fact-checking,2024-10-02T01:18:17Z,"""Saturday Night Live"" had some fun at the expense of ABC News and its anchor David Muir for their ""biased"" presidential debate earlier this month.

Former CBS News anchor Dan Rather scolded his former employer for declining to fact-check during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate, saying the network is ""trying to avoid the blowback ABC got"" for fact-checking former President Trump.

Rather stepped down from his role as CBS' evening news anchor in 2005 and eventually left the network the following year after reporting a discredited story about then-President George W. Bush. He took to Substack Monday ahead of his old employer hosting the CBS Vice Presidential Debate between Sen. JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walz, which will be moderated by Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell.

""There are few guarantees in life, but odds are that more than one lie will be told by Donald Trump's protege and running mate, JD Vance. If there's one thing Vance has learned from Trump, it's that lying to get ahead is OK. If you get caught, just double down and lie some more. Who's going to fact check you? Well, apparently not CBS News,"" Rather wrote.

ABC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: MODERATORS DAVID MUIR AND LINSEY DAVIS FACT-CHECK TRUMP 5 TIMES, 0 FOR HARRIS

Rather said he was ""reluctant"" to criticize CBS News, where he worked for 45 years, but he feels it is necessary. His call for fact-checking come after ABC News was widely criticized for correcting Trump multiple times but failing to fact-check Vice President Kamala Harris during the recent presidential debate.

""With that as background, it is necessary to report and comment on the fact that CBS News has decided not to fact-check the candidates in real time. I would love to know what went into this decision, because it feels spineless, especially after ABC's Linsey Davis and David Muir effectively and correctly fact-checked Trump during the debate with Kamala Harris,"" Rather wrote.

""CBS says it is up to the candidates to fact-check, though 'the moderators will facilitate those opportunities' during rebuttal time,"" he continued. ""While both fact-checking (ABC during the Harris-Trump debate) and not fact-checking (CNN during the Biden-Trump debate) have drawn criticism this year, for the most part, the criticism was unsurprisingly partisan.""

Rather noted that CBS News would fact-check the candidates online, but dismissed viewers for being able to follow along in real time.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH ABORTION FACT-CHECK AGAINST TRUMP: 'COMPLETELY INTERJECTS HERSELF'

""Simply put, this 'rule,' imposed by CBS, incentivizes lying. It invites the participants to bend the truth, since their opponent then has to spend his rebuttal time calling out the lie, rather than giving an opposing view. And the calling out of a lie by an opponent rather than an impartial moderator is less credible,"" Rather wrote.

""It seems clear that CBS is trying to avoid the blowback ABC got after the presidential debate. A journalist, much less a news organization, should not be afraid to take heat,"" Rather continued. ""Their responsibility is to call out lies. If they don't do that on live television, during the most consequential election in modern history, they are the lesser for it. But the biggest loser is the American electorate.""

CBS News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Biden has 'privately complained' about how quickly Democrats have moved on from him: Report,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-has-privately-complained-about-how-quickly-democrats-have-moved-from-him-report,2024-10-01T18:29:04Z,"President Biden had some fun on ""The View"" by pretending to squash former President Trump like a bug and said his former rival has no ""redeeming value.""

A new report disclosed that President Biden is feeling left out in the cold by the Democratic Party after going all in on Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign.

According to the Monday NBC News report, Biden has mentioned to his allies his feeling that his accomplishments and legacy as president are being forgotten by the party, especially as Harris has tried to distance herself away from her boss' policies and forge her own political identity after replacing him on the Democratic presidential ticket.

""President Joe Biden has privately complained to allies that his name and his accomplishments have virtually disappeared from the national conversation and about how quickly the party that he has served for more than five decades appears to have moved on from him, according to six people familiar with his comments,"" the piece reported.

PELOSI DEMURS ON IF 'EVERYTHING IS OK' BETWEEN HER AND BIDEN: 'YOU'D HAVE TO ASK HIM'

According to these sources, the president has commented on Harris not mentioning him during recent campaign speeches, noting that he believes she should acknowledge his economic accomplishments while touting her own vision on the issue.

""Biden has noted at times that Vice President Kamala Harris... hasn't been mentioning him in her campaign speeches lately, including when she talks about an economy he believes his policies set on a positive trajectory, these people said,"" according to NBC.

Additionally, the sources told NBC that Biden ""was particularly stung"" by Harris' recent line during her debate with former President Trump in which she drew a stark distinction between her and her boss.

""Clearly, I am not Joe Biden. And I am certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country,"" the vice president said during the debate, drawing a stark contrast between her and Biden's policies, as Trump was trying to grill her over the current administration's record.

Those familiar with Biden's feelings on the matter acknowledged that he still wants Harris to win and ""that he plans to do whatever he can to help her,"" the report noted.

An anonymous senior Harris campaign official said that Biden ""always just says to her, 'The most important thing is that you win.'"" The official added, ""We have to tell people who she is and what she would do.""

They also noted, ""There wasn't a real interest in hearing about [Biden's] accomplishments when he was running. That's still the case.""

However, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates denied the claims made by these sources, telling the outlet, ""These uninformed claims are the polar opposite of the truth.""

""President Biden welcomes the strong response the American people are having to Vice President Harris' leadership and to policies that move us into the future, away from dangerous agendas from the past like MAGAnomics and abortion bans,"" Bates added.

The spokesperson doubled down on his rejection of these claims, telling Fox News Digital they are ""not"" true.

The sources have said that Biden understands the political reasoning behind shifting away from his record, though they noted it still ""frustrates him at times.""

""But while Biden is attuned to political realities, he also has expressed a range of emotions about his exit from the race -- from feeling his legacy rests on a Harris victory to anguishing over his imprint's vanishing from the national stage, according to the people familiar with his private comments,"" the article stated.

One source described his mixed emotions on the issue, stating, ""It's very complex.""

Another Harris campaign official defended Harris' pivot away from Biden, telling NBC, ""She has to become her own person. She needs to do that to win.""

Despite Biden's acceptance of Harris' candidacy, he maintains that he would have beaten Trump in November if he was still in the race. He told the co-hosts of ""The View"" last week that he was ""confident"" he could have beaten Trump and said he didn't sense an ""overwhelming reluctance"" about his re-election effort from fellow Democrats.

""I was confident I would beat Trump -- he's a loser,"" he declared.

DAVID MARCUS: The Vance vs. Walz debate is best scored using boxing rules,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-vance-vs-walz-debate-best-scored-using-boxing-rules,2024-10-01T17:53:41Z,"DEBATE DAY: Live coverage begins today at 8 p.m. ET for the Fox News Simulcast of the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate.

The first rule of deciding who won a major political debate is that nobody wins a major political debate. There is no final score as the buzzer sounds, no final wink to be tiddled, it is a purely subjective matter. And that will be true of the vice-presidential debate between Republican nominee JD Vance and Democratic nominee Tim Walz.

That having been said, I've recently adopted a method of scoring debates from the world of pugilistics, that I think actually gives a pretty decent assessment of what most American voters see.

My advice in picking a winner is to borrow the scoring system of a boxing match. The basic rules are relatively simple. In each round the boxer who wins the 3 minutes gets 10 points, the loser gets 9, unless there is a knockdown or it is overwhelming, in which case the round is scored 10-8. A tie is 10-10.

Obviously, a knockout ends the fight.

HEIGHTENED 'SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPORTANCE' AS VANCE, WALZ FACE OFF IN VP DEBATE

I first tried this approach last month with the Trump vs. Harris debate. And I wound up with Trump winning 157 to 150. It wasn't the only reason I thought and wrote that night that Trump won the debate, despite overwhelming media insistence that girl boss Kamala had kicked ass. But it was part of it.

And with polling showing no significant bump for Harris since their face-off and the fact that we've even seen some Trump swing state surge since their debate, my ostentatious declaration of a Trump victory looks a little less crazy today.

The legacy news media, who wanted any excuse to hand Harris a W anyway, viewed the t√™te-√†-t√™te as a kind of Lifetime movie in which Harris had finally spoken truth to power, but I find in most of America that narrative doesn't have a whole lot of purchase. The voters want answers.

THE WHO, WHAT, WHERE, AND WHEN OF TUESDAY'S JD VANCE-TIM WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

That's where boxing scoring comes in. If openings, closings, and each question, are the ""rounds"" of the debate, you wind up with about 15. See what I'm saying? The incremental 10-9 or 10-8 scores of each, mirror the nuance of how swayable voters watch the event.

The basic philosophy behind boxing scoring is that the primary job is to survive the round, so if you manage that, you get an automatic 8 points, winning the round, and can only bump that up by at most 2.

One could argue there is a fundamental unfairness here, that if I am 40 percent better at landing punches in a round than my opponent, I only get a 10 percent point advantage in scoring, but that is also the beauty of the system. Fights aren't just about math.

This actually tracks very well with how political debates work.

The audience, which is to say the voters, do tend to see each question or issue as one round, and if Walz can get a 10-8 on abortion, or Vance can on the border, that goes a long way towards the kind of 7 point win I gave Trump over Harris.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION

Another way to think of this is that 90 percent of Americans likely already know who they are voting for, only 10 percent can be swayed, and boxing's unique scoring system almost perfectly corresponds to this.

Eighty to 90 percent we are just scoring as a wash.

There is, of course, the chance of a knockout, but these days, that chance seems remote. Back when Reagan said ""There you go again,"" or Obama, in retrospect wrongly, told Romney the 1980s wanted their foreign policy back over fears regarding Russia, the possibility of something near consensus on the question existed.

Those days are no longer with us, if they aren't over forever.

Nobody really wins a debate, but we can still score them, we can still pay close attention to who is and isn't actually answering the questions, and that has a lot of value.

So give a shot, grab a pad and paper, if you still have those, and just jot down your score for each question, 10-10, 10-9 or 10-8. Like a Ouija board your political leanings might push the pen a bit, but even so, you might be surprised by the results.

As Mike Tyson once put it, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. Let's keep a close eye on the flying rhetorical hands of Tim Walz and JD Vance."
Fox News Power Rankings: Trump maintains lead on 2 top issues ahead of VP debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/power-rankings-trump-maintains-lead-two-top-issues-ahead-vp-debate,2024-10-01T13:08:36Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance are hours away from the first and only vice presidential debate.

As the latest Fox News Power Rankings reveal, Vance starts the evening with a lead on the economy and immigration, while Walz has an advantage on abortion.

Vice presidential hopefuls do not attract as much attention as their bosses when they debate, but as Fox News' Arnon Mishkin argued Monday, they have changed the direction of at least six elections in the last 50 years.

In most cases, these debates are won on policy. Voters are not as familiar with these nominees as they are with former President Donald Trump or even Vice President Kamala Harris, and they do not need to make their choice.

The smart play for these vice presidential candidates is to focus on the major issues at stake and how their administrations would solve them.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: HARRIS TICKS UP AND SENATE REPUBLICANS TAKE CHARGE

That is especially true for Walz on the economy and immigration, since the Harris campaign continues to lag on those issues. Vance, meanwhile, has struggled with poor favorability ratings, so his challenge is to hammer the popular parts of the Trump agenda and avoid wading into the culture war trenches.

There are also style points up for grabs. Many voters will only ever see this debate in short clips on social media, so acting like a policy wonk is less likely than ever to get the job done.

Trump continues to hold an advantage on two of the top three issues in this campaign. He leads on the economy by nine points and immigration by 11.

Those numbers have barely budged since Harris and Trump debated. In August, when the Power Rankings last looked at the major issues, the former president led on the economy by eight and immigration by 13.

Harris is far out in front on abortion. She leads by 17 points on that issue, also a negligible movement since the last tracker (Harris +18).

This tracker includes polls from Fox News, Quinnipiac, CNN/SSRS, NBC News and the New York Times/Siena.

Trump lost a point in the horse race after his debate with Harris while the vice president gained one; these modest shifts mirrored those after the first debate in 2020.

Together, these results suggest that the cause of Trump's slight decline was style rather than substance.

Conversely, while Harris won the debate and held on to her advantage on abortion, she has not consistently closed the issues gap, particularly on immigration.

That is not ideal for her, given the economy (38%) and immigration (17%) are two of the top three issues for voters. A recent Fox News national survey showed those issues and abortion (16%) were the only three that a double-digit percentage of voters called their ""most important"" issue in deciding their vote.

According to the same survey, Harris has strong leads in issues outside the top three. That includes health care, helping the middle class and climate change. These are ""bread and butter"" issues that the left has relied on to drag out base voters in previous elections.

The Democratic candidate also has a lead in uniting the country and, as consistent with previous trackers, having the right temperament for the job.

The candidates are evenly divided on national security. Neither has an advantage in handling a crisis that puts the country at risk, being commander in chief or decisions about using nuclear weapons. Trump's temperament deficit should give Harris an opportunity to lead on some of these qualities, but that has not materialized.

ARNON MISHKIN: JD VANCE IS AN EXCELLENT DEBATER AND PRACTICES FOR THE DEBATE EVERY SUNDAY

Finally, voters prefer Trump on foreign policy. He has a six-point lead in handling the Israel/Hamas war and an eight-point lead on the Ukraine/Russia war.

Tuesday is debate night. Walz and Vance will face off at an event hosted by CBS News in New York City. Fox News will simulcast the debate with special coverage anchored by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum at 8:20 p.m. ET.

Fox News Media has proposed a second Harris-Trump debate to be moderated by MacCallum and Baier in October.

Montana GOP Senate candidate Sheehy says he was in Afghanistan while Jon Tester was 'eating lobbyist steak',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/montana-gop-senate-candidate-sheehy-says-he-afghanistan-while-jon-tester-eating-lobbyist-steak,2024-10-01T09:53:21Z,"Montana Senate candidate Tim Sheehy joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the importance of the race and what issues matter most to voters as he fights to oust Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.

Montana U.S. Senate candidate Tim Sheehy, a Republican, ripped his opponent, incumbent Democrat Sen. Jon Tester, for his ties to lobbyists during a debate on Monday.

Tester is seeking to hold onto his Senate seat to continue representing the red state of Montana in a race that could determine which party controls the upper chamber of Congress, and recent polling shows that Sheehy is leading just weeks before Election Day.

During the debate on Monday, Sheehy knocked his Democrat opponent for his relationship with lobbyists in Washington, D.C.

""Sen. Tester knows all about backroom meetings, he's been taking them for 20 years ... While I was fighting in Afghanistan, he was eating lobbyist steak in D.C.,"" said Sheehy, a former U.S. Navy SEAL.

'WHOEVER GETS ELECTED': VULNERABLE DEM TESTER DIGS IN HEELS ON NOT ENDORSING HARRIS

Lobbyists have donated more heavily to Tester during this election cycle than to any other member of Congress, according to the non-partisan group OpenSecrets.

Tester is the last remaining Democrat to hold high office in Montana, where Republicans, including former President Trump, supported Sheehy's campaign with the hope that he could defeat the vulnerable Democrat and help the GOP win back control of the Senate.

Republicans need to gain only two seats in next month's election to win the Senate majority. GOP West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice is considered a lock in his state's Senate race against Democrat Glenn Elliott, meaning the Senate majority could run through Montana.

Trump won Montana by about 17 percentage points in 2020 and, given that the state is overwhelmingly Republican, Sheehy has often sought to tie Tester to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as the Republican candidate looks to take advantage of public dissatisfaction over the administration's struggles to address the influx of illegal immigration at the Southern Border.

JON TESTER CASTS DOUBT ON UNFAVORABLE POLL IN MONTANA SENATE RACE: 'GIVE ME A BREAK'

""Democrats on the Hill refused to hold the administration accountable for the largest mass migration in the history of this country,"" Sheehy said.

Tester, however, has declined to endorse Harris and has attempted to distance himself from her on the campaign trail, and he skipped the Democratic National Convention in August, when she was named the party's nominee for president after Biden dropped out.

The Democrat has also criticized some of the administration's policy decisions. This includes his opposition to the move for tighter pollution rules for coal plants and his calls for more to be done on immigration.

""Look, I'll be the first person to tell you that President Biden has not done a good job on the southern border,"" Tester said Monday.

Sheehy and Tester also addressed abortion, in which the Democrat said he wants to reinstate Roe v. Wade after the landmark ruling was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court two years ago, returning the power to make laws regarding abortion back to the states.

The Republican acknowledged that remarks he made last year about Native Americans were ""insensitive,"" but refused his opponent's request to apologize. Sheehy had told a group of laughing supporters about bonding ""with all the Indians ... while they're drunk at 8 a.m.,"" while working cattle at a ranch on the Crow Indian Reservation.

""Yeah, insensitive,"" Sheehy said. ""I come from the military as many of our tribal members do. You know, we make insensitive jokes and probably off-color jokes sometimes.""

Tester pressed his opponent, ""Tim, the statement you made degrades Native Americans across this country. You're a big guy, just apologize.""

""Will you apologize for opening the border?"" Sheehy shot back."
"Georgia judge overturns state's six-week 'heartbeat' abortion law, calls it 'unconstitutional'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-judge-overturns-states-six-week-heartbeat-abortion-law-calls-unconstitutional,2024-09-30T23:06:03Z,"Former Obama campaign manager reacts to new 2024 polling and the role women and swing voters will play in the Harris-Trump matchup.

A judge in Fulton County, Georgia, has overturned the state's ""Heartbeat Law"" on abortion, which made it illegal to terminate a pregnancy after six weeks.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney issued the order on Monday, saying abortions must be regulated the way they were before the ""Heartbeat Law"" went into effect, meaning abortions could be allowed until the 22-week mark.

""The authors of our Constitutions, state and federal, entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning,"" McBurney wrote in his final order. ""A review of our higher courts' interpretations of 'liberty' demonstrates that liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.

""That power is not, however, unlimited,"" the judge added. ""When a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then - and only then - may society intervene.""

GEORGIA SUPREME COURT REJECTS CHALLENGE TO ABORTION LAW

McBurney continued, saying a law that prevents abortions after six weeks was inconsistent with those rights as well as the proper balance that a viability rule establishes between a woman's rights and society's interests in protecting and caring for unborn infants.

He then declared the ""Life Act"" as ""unconstitutional.""

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed the ""Heartbeat"" abortion bill, also known as the Living Infants Fairness and Equality Act,"" into law in 2019. The law made abortions after the six-week mark illegal.

GEORGIA GOV. BRIAN KEMP SIGNS CONTROVERSIAL 'HEARTBEAT' BILL INTO LAW

There were exceptions written into the law, including rape and incest, as long as a police report was filed. Another exception to the law allowed for abortions after six weeks if the mother's life was at risk or if a serious medical condition rendered a fetus inviable.

The law signed by Kemp was blocked by a federal judge in October 2019 -- before it went into effect -- and ruled it violated the right to abortion established by Roe. v. Wade in 1973.

The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, which cleared the way for Georgia's law on abortion to go into effect.

GEORGIA ABORTION LAW: A LOOK BACK AT WHAT HOLLYWOOD PRODUCTION COMPANIES HAVE SAID ABOUT FILMING IN THE STATE

McBurney, in November 2022, ruled the law was ""unequivocally unconstitutional"" because it was enacted in 2019 when Roe v. Wade allowed abortions after six weeks.

But in October 2023, the Georgia Supreme Court rejected the ruling in a 6-1 decision, saying McBurney was wrong.

""When the United States Supreme Court overrules its own precedent interpreting the United States Constitution, we are then obligated to apply the Court's new interpretation of the Constitution's meaning on matters of federal constitutional law,"" Justice Verda Colvin wrote for the majority.

McBurney's ruling on Monday stated that the state, county, municipal and other local authorities are ""enjoined"" from seeking to enforce the six-week abortion law."
Biden's old backyard now a key Pennsylvania battleground filled with 'purple' votes,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bidens-old-backyard-now-key-pa-battleground-filled-purple-votes,2024-09-30T20:05:23Z,"SCRANTON, Pa. -- While northeastern Pennsylvania's Lackawanna County has been a Democratic stronghold in state and federal elections, voters on the streets of the old coal mining region say the area runs ""purple"" and will likely be a nail-bitter of an election.

""It's not as blue as people think. It's more purple underneath because people are afraid to say anything around here because they think that there's going to be retaliation. That's an old thing that goes back generations around here,"" David Kveragas told Fox News Digital from a pizza shop on the main drag of Scranton as a storm sloshed rain across the Wyoming Valley last week.

Lackawanna County is home to cities and towns such as Scranton, Carbondale and Throop, mixing cityscapes backdropped by factories of a bygone era, and dotted with suburbs and expansive farms. The county has long voted blue in state and national elections, last throwing its support behind a Republican in 1984 during President Ronald Reagan's blowout election when he won each state except Washington, D.C., and Minnesota -- the home state of Reagan's competitor that year, Walter Mondale.

The county has trended right in recent elections, however, teeing up a heightened election battle that will likely help determine how the key battleground state will swing come Nov. 5.

ECONOMY, BORDER, ABORTION DIVIDE BIDEN'S HOMETOWN AS SCRANTON LOOKS BACK ON NATIVE SON'S FIRST TERM

Between 2000 and 2012, Democratic presidential nominees earned between 56% and 63% of the vote, U.S. News and World Report found. That standard fell below 50% in 2016, when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton unsuccessfully ran against former President Donald Trump, but still carried a win for the Democratic Party's ticket even with the lessened support.

President Biden was born and raised in Scranton until the age of 10, when his family moved to Delaware. Biden's hometown status likely helped boost his popularity among locals in the 2020 election, winning 53.58% of the vote to Trump's 45.23% that year.

As the election cycle comes down to its final five weeks, Fox News Digital spoke to voters on the streets of Scranton to ask about their top election concerns and who they will cast their ballot for come November. Fox News Digital received a mixed bag of responses, with some voters proudly declaring Vice President Kamala Harris' support of abortion access earned their vote, while Trump supporters said voters only need to look at their pay stubs from the 2016-2020 era compared to today to determine their ballot choice.

""If you are a minority and a woman, what is the better choice? I'm not here to knock Trump or any candidate. But as a woman of Puerto Rican descent, I feel it's really important for us to really sit and discuss the pros and cons of each candidate. But especially as a woman,"" a local mom named Adrianna, who is supporting Harris in the election, told Fox News Digital.

BIDEN CLAIMS TO SEE THE ECONOMY THROUGH THE EYES OF SCRANTON, NOT WALL STREET

Adrianna is a mom to a young boy and said that inflation issues and childcare issues have rocked her day-to-day life as she has tried to find a daycare for her son for more than a year. When asked if she believes Harris will correct inflation if elected as president after serving as vice president for three and a half years, she responded, ""I hope so.""

""If you are a minority and a woman, what is the better choice?"" - Pennsylvania mom Adrianna

Adrianna said that while inflation concerns her, abortion is her top voting issue.

""I believe nobody should tell a woman what to do with her body, especially -- not to sound sexist -- but a man. I think that should be an individual decision that a woman should make,"" she said.

For Trump supporters, the economy, inflation, national security and immigration came in as top concerns for voters.

""The price of gas is a big issue with me. I do a lot of driving. And I remember back in the day, you know, when you got $20, it'd fill up your gas tank. It's just going up and up,"" Trump supporter John Soentgerath told Fox News Digital.

""With all due respect to my Democratic friends, I have a lot of them, [under] this previous administration there has been less take-home pay. The prices of gas [is] up, food. And I like to eat like anybody else. You tell me any mother or father that doesn't want to put food on the table for their kids, give them treats, ice cream, goodies and things of that nature,"" Soentgerath added.

Larry West of Scranton told Fox News Digital from a bus stop near The Marketplace at Steamtown that Trump earned his vote for his national security platform as wars continue raging in Ukraine and Israel, saying Harris appears ""weak"" on foreign affairs.

Kveragas told Fox News Digital that he is an independent who ""voted against Hillary"" in 2016, before becoming a Trump supporter while evaluating the 45th president's record in office.

HARRIS SUPPORTERS IN PENNSYLVANIA SAY WORKING CLASS WILL SUPPORT HER

""He straightened out the economy. He got the border under control. He cut regulations. He did pretty much everything you would want a -- a realistic person would want -- a president to do. So with this election, it's primarily the economy, obviously. My retirement was up 40% under Trump. I lost the 40%, plus another 20% under Biden. So things are terrible there. The border, which we're being overrun. Obviously, it's not just a matter of jobs. It's a matter of housing and crime fighting, fentanyl, which has run rampant. Fentanyl is killing more people than guns,"" Kveragas said.

On the flip side, a Harris supporter who identified himself as Michael told Fox Digital that ""women's rights"" is his top priority this election cycle.

""I believe that every woman should have a choice to make their own decision,"" he said.

Michael explained that the economy and inflation have also affected his life, saying that he works two jobs to pay the bills and that expenses were much cheaper a decade ago. When asked if he feels Harris is better equipped to handle the economy over Trump, Michael argued that while Trump is a ""businessman,"" he will ""ruin the country.""

""Donald Trump, he is a businessman, yes. But he's going to ruin the country. He's going to ruin it. And Kamala Harris, you know, she is more steady-handed. She doesn't think with an iron fist, and we don't need that. We're not trying to go to war with China. [We're trying to] actually progress in this life. That's the only thing that we do in this life is to share information and progress,"" Michael said.

GOP GAINS VOTER ADVANTAGE IN PENNSYLVANIA SWING COUNTY NEAR BIDEN'S BIRTHPLACE

Trump's and Harris' campaigns have respectively heaped loads of attention on the Keystone State this year, with both candidates repeatedly visiting the massive state, from its rural areas in the rolling hills to industrial cities in the coal and rust belts that run across the state.

Fox News Digital spoke to both a Trump campaign volunteer and a Harris campaign volunteer, who both work to register Lackawanna voters, door knock and motivate residents to cast a ballot.

Susanne Green is a Trump campaign volunteer and former Democratic voter who began supporting Trump and Republicans in the last decade.

BIDEN'S HOMETOWN SPEAKS OUT ON BIDENOMICS

""I grew up in a Democrat household. Here in the valley in Lackawanna County, we believed in 'Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you could do for your country,'"" Green told Fox Digital, quoting President Kennedy's powerful inaugural address in 1961. ""And it really does choke me up some because it's truthful.""

Green said that her politics have not changed, but that the Democratic Party has morphed into something she can no longer identify with.

""I haven't changed. The Democrat Party changed. I was a Democrat. I registered as a Democrat when I turned 18, and I voted Democrat in every election until 2016, when I really saw that that wasn't the direction that our country needed. Our country really needs to really get back to patriotism and believing that our country is great,"" she said.

ARMED SERVICES REPUBLICANS, WHITE HOUSE PUSH BACK AGAINST CLAIMS THAT ZELENSKYY'S PA VISIT WAS 'POLITICAL'

Green said that when she speaks to locals about the election to motivate them to vote, many Democratic voters will balk at the GOP's abortion platform. Green said she explains to such voters, most notably suburban women, that Republicans for Choice has long been a powerful vote in the party and that the GOP is not working to place a wholesale ban on abortion.

""I think we can all agree, or most of us can agree, that it should be legal and rare,"" Green said in a hat tip to the famous Bill Clinton formulation that abortions be ""safe, legal and rare,"" a sentiment that has since been purged from the party's platform in favor of more lax abortion access.

""That's how most women that I talk to in my experience over my whole lifetime have said that we wanted abortion to stay legal, but rare.""

Andrew Cutillo, a Harris campaign volunteer in Lackawanna County, spoke to Fox News Digital via a phone call this week and said that he has supported Harris since her campaign launch this summer and touted the VP as someone who can ""intuitively"" connect with Northeastern Pennsylvania voters based on her middle class upbringing.

""Kamala Harris is someone who, you know, intuitively understands what it's like to grow up or live in Northeast Pennsylvania and Scranton, Pennsylvania, as she grew up middle class. Her kind of focus has been on building a strong middle class,"" Cutillo said. ""Her focus is on supporting families and understanding what families and communities need, that they can live their lives, that they can not worry about paying grocery bills, not worry about paying all the expenses that come with just trying to raise your family.""

Cutillo added that when he's out door-knocking or speaking with traditionally Republican voters, including his own dad, people have pulled away from Trump because they are ""concerned for democracy,"" and view Harris as a potential president who would ""govern for the people who don't agree with her, too.""

He said despite the fevered political focus on Scranton and Pennsylvania at large this election cycle, Republican and Democratic neighbors in Northeastern Pennsylvania have and will remain friends no matter how the election shakes out despite any portrayal of ""divisiveness"" in the battleground state.

Voters in the area remarked that they have been inundated with campaign efforts, with West saying he's ignored some of the door knockers.

""I'm flooded with ads, flooded. They have knocked on the door. But I didn't answer the door because I saw what it was. But we are definitely bombarded with ads,"" West said.

Soentgerath said that he's seen ""a big push from both sides. And again, with all due respect to either side, the bottom line is, if you want change, get up, go to work and pull that lever on Nov. 5.""

While Michael remarked that while he hasn't seen ""too much out here yet,"" he noted he has seen more Trump ads than Harris ads.

""So that just means we need to work harder,"" Michael said.

Tony Monopoli is a Scranton native who has since moved to another key battleground state, Georgia, and told Fox News Digital that he is supporting Harris in the election. Monopoli was visiting Scranton with his brothers and spoke to Fox News Digital outside of the Lackawanna County Courthouse, where there is a veterans memorial.

""I think her plans to support small businesses by offering a $50,000 tax credit for small business owners is a big deal. I think her plan to offer $25,000 in first-time homebuyers' assistance is a big deal, given the cost of homes today. And also, the $6,000 child tax credit for the first year of a child's life is a big deal,"" he explained of his support of Harris.

Fox Digital asked Monopoli if he's seen more or less campaigning efforts from either candidate in Pennsylvania vs. Georgia, where both candidates are also heavily campaigning for votes.

""I'd say it's about the same,"" he said. Remarking that he hasn't ""really seen any different"" in either area.

Pennsylvania will again serve as a key battleground state this election cycle as former President Donald Trump and President Biden are anticipated to face a rematch in a state that narrowly voted for Trump in 2016, and elected Biden in 2020 at a 1.17% margin.

For Soentgerath, he encouraged voters to do their own homework before casting their ballots, leaning on his concerns over the economy, he said voters should simply review their pay stubs from just a few years ago to help determine their vote.

The Axios article noted that if Trump secures votes from the Sunbelt States across the southern portion of the U.S., he would only need to win either Michigan, Wisconsin or Pennsylvania to declare victory. While Harris' easiest path to victory is locking down Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

Gavin Newsom's latest attempts to continue to expand benefits for illegal migrants in the state of California.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom tossed out a slew of bills over the weekend, bucking several of his Democratic Party's more progressive initiatives on things like standards for transgender care, regulating gas stoves and providing additional benefits for noncitizens.

Newsom, who has had to review more than 1,000 bills over the last few months ahead of Monday's legislative deadline, vetoed AB 2442, AB 2513 and SB 227.

AB 2442, which would have expedited medical licenses for applicants seeking to perform transgender surgical procedures and abortions, was declined by Newsom on Friday.

NEWSOM'S DEEPFAKE ELECTION LAWS ARE ALREADY BEING CHALLENGED IN FEDERAL COURT

""As the number of applicants who qualify for expedited licensure grows through legislation, the benefits of mandated prioritization may start to diminish, at the expense of potential negative impacts to other applicants,"" Newsom said in his veto letter. ""Additionally, the increase in staff needed to ensure expedited applications may lead to licensing fee increases.""

AB 2513 - a bill that would have required gas stoves to be sold with a warning label on them for potential toxins emitted - was also a hotly debated bill in the legislature but ultimately shot down by Newsom and dubbed a ""static approach"" that would fail to allow for timely updates to labeling content according to the most up-to-date scientific knowledge.

""While I appreciate the author's intent to provide consumers with information about the products they purchase, I am concerned that this bill codifies highly prescriptive labeling content that could only be changed by a future statutory amendment,"" Newsom said in the veto letter.

800-PLUS BILLS LEFT ON NEWSOM'S DESK ILLUSTRATE CALIFORNIA'S OVERRGULATION PROBLEM: EXPERTS

Among the progressive bills shot down was also SB 227, which would've required the Employment Development Department (EDD) to create an Excluded Workers Program to provide unemployment-style benefits to noncitizens.

Newsom said that while ""California has taken taken important steps to advance inclusion and equity for undocumented workers and mixed-status families who contribute significantly to California's economy and local communities,"" Congress must uphold its duty to create solutions that offer a legitimate pathway to citizenship for long-term residents who have made significant contributions.

NEWSOM VETOES BILL THAT WOULD LET NONCITIZEN STUDENTS WORK AT STATE'S PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES

""We can have a fair immigration system that works for families, U.S. workers, and employers, and also have a safe border,"" Newsom said. ""However, this bill sets impractical timelines, has operational issues, and requires funding that was not included in the budget.""

Also on Sunday, Newsom vetoed a bill to create safety measures for large artificial intelligence models, which would have been the first such law in the nation.

Some high-profile bipartisan bills aren't immune to being tossed out, either. Last week, Newsom vetoed a bipartisan accountability legislation that would've required more accountability and data reporting on the state's spiraling homelessness crisis.

Already, Newsom has signed a package of public safety bills aimed at reducing organized retail theft. He's also vetoed a number of progressive bills, including several that would have expanded aid to illegal immigrants through housing loans and permitted employment through the University of California (UC) system, and a reparations package for Black residents.

Promising to tackle the mental health crisis among young people, the blue state governor also signed a historic bill restricting cellphones in schools.

Newsom often vetoes bills if they appear redundant or the cost would further burden the state's budget shortfall, according to a CalMatters analysis. Last year, Newsom vetoed 156 bills and signed 890, reflecting a veto rate of about 15%, similar to the previous year. His veto rate in 2021 was under 8%."

Former President Trump has narrowed Vice President Kamala Harris' small lead in the battleground states of Michigan and Wisconsin, new polling by the New York Times/Siena College finds.

Among likely voters in Michigan, Harris received 48% support, while Trump garnered 47%, locking the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees in an essential tie well within the poll's margin of error. Harris polled at 49% among likely voters in Wisconsin, while Trump received 47% support in the same state where polls usually overestimate backing for Democrats, according to the Times.

The Times pointed to the economy, which remains the most important issue for voters, as Trump's strength on economic issues helps him edge away at Harris' slim lead in the two northern battlegrounds.

The new poll contrasts with August's New York Times/Siena College survey, which has Harris leading Trump by four percentage points, 50% to 46% among likely voters, in the battlegrounds of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania as well. That poll was the first conducted as the race reshaped with Harris becoming the presidential nominee following President Biden's July departure from the contest.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS, TRUMP IN CLOSE RACE IN NORTH CAROLINA

Now with less than 40 days until the Nov. 5 election, New York Times/Siena College polling places Harris ahead of Trump by nine percentage points in Nebraska's Second Congressional District, whose sole electoral vote could be critical in the Electoral College. The Times says Harris could receive exactly 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House if she picks up that district - given the vice president also wins Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and Trump is victorious in the Sun Belt battleground states.

Though Ohio does not fall into the battleground state category for the presidential race, it's home to one of the nation's most competitive Senate contests between Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown and GOP challenger Bernie Moreno. New York Times/Siena College polling has Trump six points ahead of Harris in Ohio, whereas Brown leads Moreno by four points.

Meanwhile, Biden carried Michigan by three points in 2020, while Trump won that Wolverine State in 2016 by three-tenths of a point.

Abortion was placed as the second most important issue among Michigan and Wisconsin voters.

The new poll found 18% of voters in the two states listed abortion as their top issue, noting an uptick since May when 13% of voters in Michigan and Wisconsin marked it as their determining cause. On abortion, Harris leads Trump by 20 points in Michigan, but now only by 13 points in Wisconsin. Harris had a 22-point lead over Trump in August on the abortion issue in the Badger State."
Inside Democrats' campaign to redefine the word 'freedom',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/inside-democrats-campaign-redefine-word-freedom,2024-09-28T12:07:51Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Democratic presidential candidate current Vice President Kamala Harris used the word ""freedom"" 11 times in a campaign speech this week, emphasizing, as she does repeatedly, the ""freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body.""

It's the latest example of how, according to ABC News and The New Yorker, Democrats are attempting to take ownership of the word ""freedom."" The New Yorker explains: ""Democrats' years-long efforts to reclaim the word are cresting in this year's Presidential race.""

It really takes some nerve for Democrats to try to revamp as ""freedom"" their usual proposals on not just abortion and voting, but also gun control, climate and LGBT issues. In reality, Democrats aim to restrict our First and Second Amendment rights and more.

CNN HOST KASIE HUNT SAYS HARRIS IS 'REPUBLICAN' AND TRUMP IS 'LIBERAL' ON THEIR ECONOMIC POLICIES

Harris has made ""freedom"" the theme of her campaign. She says the word frequently in her speeches. Her campaign's song is ""Freedom"" by Beyonc√©. The word ""freedom"" appears 24 times in her campaign website's issues section. Freedom was emphasized in her first campaign video and in her speech at the Democrats' convention.

""In this election, many fundamental freedoms are at stake,"" Harris's campaign website says. Harris and running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz ""will always fight for the freedom to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis,"" according to their campaign website.

Harris's presidential campaign website's policy section makes no mention of our most important freedoms, enshrined in the First Amendment -- the ""free exercise"" of religion, ""freedom of speech, or of the press"" (former President Donald Trump's campaign does). Someone should tell the Democrats that those are first in the Bill of Rights for a reason.

Walz has said he sees ""no guarantee for free speech"" related to misinformation and hate speech. But such speech is constitutionally protected, otherwise the government would be in the position of regulating what is acceptable speech and it could suppress dissent or label information it doesn't like as ""misinformation.""

The better approach is to allow for free speech, but to have open debate and condemn hateful speech. We've seen the alternative play out: The Biden-Harris White House pressured Big Tech companies to censor Americans because of their views on COVID-19. In 2019, Harris called on then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to suspend Trump's account.

Americans likely won't have the freedom to use correct pronouns if Harris wins election. The Biden-Harris administration wants to make it a civil rights violation if someone uses scientifically accurate pronouns contrary to a gender-confused person's preferences.

For Democrats, ""reproductive freedom"" is the freedom they most want to defend. The verbal forced marriage of ""reproductive"" and ""freedom"" is another stretch. Try as they might, reproduction, including via in-vitro fertilization, can't be divorced from its many consequences -- such as producing children. That's just science.

In the presidential debate, Harris used the word ""freedom"" only in reference to abortion. ""I will be a president that will protect our fundamental rights and freedoms including the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do,"" Harris said (she's fine with the government telling you what to do on a host of other issues).

But the freedom to abort an unborn child is not real freedom. In a truly free society, one person cannot be free to take another's liberty. An unborn child is not part of a woman's body or her property -- it is a separate human being with its own rights. In taking the life of an unborn child, a woman is taking away the most basic of all rights.

Twisting the word further, Harris says she wants to defend the ""freedom to vote."" But that's no more true of Democrats than Republicans. Both sides want to enact election laws that favor their party. But Republicans want to make our election system more secure.

In fact, Democrats have taken their own voters' freedom this presidential election. It's the Democratic Party that ousted its incumbent, prevented a real primary challenge, and has fought any independent challenger. Nor have Democrats given Republicans the freedom to vote. Democrats, along with other lawfare, have pushed claims to kick Trump off the ballot.

Harris says she'll also defend ""the freedom to love who you love openly."" The reality is she'll take parents' rights.

Her first campaign video shows crowds waving pride flags as Harris says ""we choose freedom."" But the LGBT community is far from closeted - pride parades often feature half-naked adults in public in front of children.

Conservatives want the freedom to protect their children from ideologies that are counter to their beliefs, including sexually explicit books that are inappropriate for children. Democrats misleadingly call these efforts ""book bans,"" but by this logic, movie ratings are ""movie bans"" because young children aren't supposed to see R-rated movies.

Women won't be free under a Harris administration. She won't defend women's rights to keep biological men out of their bathrooms, locker rooms, sports or sororities.

Harris would restrict the Second Amendment, yet her campaign casts gun control in the light of freedom: ""As President, she won't stop fighting so that Americans have the freedom to live safe from gun violence in our schools, communities, and places of worship.""

Americans likely won't have the freedom to use correct pronouns if Harris wins election. The Biden-Harris administration wants to make it a civil rights violation if someone uses scientifically accurate pronouns contrary to a gender-confused person's preferences.

Harris's promises of freedom and joy (another of her themes) sound as vacuous as former President Barack Obama's campaign of ""hope and change."" The Democrats want to impose more government control on Americans, including with expensive and ineffective economic and environmental policies.

Republicans also want clean air, but acknowledge that more environmental regulation costs Americans money in higher energy, housing and other costs. Being energy-independent prevents funding foreign authoritarian governments.

Yes, Democrats believe in the ""freedoms"" of abortion, being LGBT, and voting without ID -- but they don't believe in First and Second Amendment rights, a woman's right to not have men in female-only spaces, parents' rights or energy independence."
Mark Cuban spars with Riley Gaines over Harris' handling of the border crisis,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mark-cuban-spars-riley-gaines-over-harris-handling-border-crisis,2024-09-27T23:59:56Z,"Billionaire investor Mark Cuban unpacks the dueling economic plans pitched by Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump on 'Your World.'

Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban used his X platform Friday to respond to 24-year-old former college swimmer and conservative activist Riley Gaines over criticisms of Vice President Kamala Harris' handling of the southern border.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) released data to lawmakers Friday revealing that tens of thousands of illegal immigrants with sex offenses and homicide convictions have crossed the border into the U.S. under the Biden-Harris administration. These include 13,099 convicted of homicide and 15,811 of sexual assault.

Cuban, who has been a staunch advocate for Harris, Joe Biden in 2020 and Hillary Clinton in 2016, has defended the VP's record on the border. Cuban even said he thinks the actions she has taken to reduce the flow of illegal migrants across the southern border ""have actually worked"" in a recent CNBC interview.

Gaines called out Cuban for his praise of the vice president in a post on X Friday.

""We might have different standards for what qualifies as a 'good job,' but I don't think the illegal entrance of 15,000+ rapists, 13,000+ murderers, and 320,000 missing children fits the bill,"" Gaines, the host of OutKick's ""Gaines for Girls"" podcast wrote.

Gaines' reference to the 320,000 missing children is from another report from the Department of Homeland Security released Aug. 21 that revealed the Biden-Harris administration has lost track of that number of migrant children who crossed the border without parents.

Cuban responded to Gaines in his own X post just 90 minutes later. Cuban admitted the current administration ""waited too long to fix the border."" But he then criticized Trump for his promise to carry out the largest mass deportation in American history if elected.

""I have said many times they waited too long to fix the border. The good news is that the latest crossing numbers are lower than Jan 21 and staying near 1,500 a day,"" Cuban wrote, along with screenshots of two articles covering a statistical reduction in illegal border crossings.

""And the VP has been clear she will sign the bi-partisan border bill. It's a fair argument to criticize them for waiting too long. But you also have to acknowledge that they are now having success. Which leads to the question of deportations. The Republican nominee says he is going to deport the 21 million people here illegally. He hasn't said how he will do it.""

TRUMP'S MEAL FOR ALABAMA-GEORGIA FOOTBALL GAME INCLUDES NEARLY 800 CALORIES FROM MCDONALD'S ALONE

Cuban referenced a border bill that Senate Democrats failed to pass through Congress in May when all but one Republican senator, along with six Democrats, voted to block it.

Democrats argued the bill was intended to reduce border crossings, raise the standard for migrants to qualify for asylum and empower officials to rapidly send away those who fail to meet that standard. It would give the president power to shut down the border if migration levels exceed certain thresholds. But concerns about the bill were raised with earlier drafts having the border provisions attached to funding for Ukraine and Israel.

Gaines responded to Cuban's defense of his praise for Harris in another X post Friday evening, discrediting the statistics Cuban offered and slamming the border bill.

""They're flying in illegal immigrants and dropping them into the heartland of America, often in places we don't even know about,"" Gaines wrote. ""The bi-partisan border bill is a Trojan horse. The first time it was voted on it included funding for Ukraine. She campaigns on securing the border acknowledging (indirectly) the problems that have been created under the Biden Harris Admin. she's been in the White House for 3.5 years. Why not take action now?""

Gaines also called out Cuban for not addressing the 320,000 missing children statistic she mentioned in her first post.

Cuban had not responded to Gaines again at the time of publication.

Cuban's defense of Harris and Democrats has ramped up in recent weeks. He has done several interviews endorsing the VP in the upcoming election, making statements that have raised eyebrows from conservative voters. Cuban has suggested Trump is ""a socialist"" and even said he believes the mainstream media ""leans right"" in a recent CNBC interview.

Earlier this year, when Biden was still the presumptive Democratic nominee, Cuban went so far as to say he would vote for Biden over Trump even if Biden was ""being given his last rites.""

""If they were having his last wake, and it was him versus Trump, and he was being given last rites, I would still vote for Joe Biden,"" Cuban told Bloomberg News in March.

However, Cuban has also said he supported Trump at the outset of his first candidacy in 2015.

""In 2015, I was like, 'He's great. He's not a typical Stepford candidate. I thought that was a positive,"" Cuban told Vivek Ramaswamy in an interview on X Aug. 7.

Gaines has been an advocate for Trump in this election cycle. Gaines even spoke at one of Trump's rallies in Glendale, Arizona, Aug. 23. There, Gaines made a speech in which she claimed she was voting for Trump ""because I'm a woman.""

""They don't believe in school choice; they don't believe in parental rights or the safeguarding of children; they don't believe in freedom unless it's the freedom to have an abortion or chemically and surgically castrate children,"" she said.

""You have one ticket that knows what a woman is and has vowed to take decisive action at protecting our sex-based rights, compared to the other ticket that thinks men can become pregnant, and that tampons belong in boys' bathrooms.""

Harris will make a rare visit to the southern border in Arizona as she seeks to blunt criticism from former President Trump on the matter and renews her call for the bipartisan border bill. Conservatives were not swayed by the visit.

""Border Czar Kamala Harris has had nearly four years to protect America and failed,"" RJ Hauman, president of the National Immigration Center for Enforcement (NICE), told Fox News Digital in response to the data. ""She is allowing tens of thousands of murderers and rapists to roam free. She puts criminals first and the safety and security of you and your family last."""
"Fox News Poll: Harris, Trump in close race in North Carolina",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-harris-trump-close-race-north-carolina,2024-09-27T22:07:39Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Harris has a 2 percentage-point edge over former President Trump in the latest Fox News survey of North Carolina registered voters (50% Harris, 48% Trump). Last month, Trump was ahead by 1 point (50% to 49%), for a 3-point shift in the presidential race.

Among likely voters, the race flips with Trump on top by just a single point, 50% to 49%.

When third-party candidates are included, Harris is up 1 point among registered voters (3% support third party), while Trump is up 2 points among likely voters (3% to others).

NORTH CAROLINA GOP FOCUSING ON 'HAND-TO-HAND POLITICAL COMBAT' TO RAMP UP GROUND GAME IN BATTLEGROUND STATE

The results among both registered and likely voters are within the margin of error.

Harris's strongest support comes from Black voters, urban voters, and college-educated women, while for Trump it is Whites without a college degree (particularly men without degrees), rural voters, and White evangelicals.

Most Democrats (98%) and Republicans (96%) back their party's candidate, while the small group of independents favors Harris by 7 points.

Slightly more Harris supporters (92%) than Trump supporters (89%) are certain of their choice.

Harris is viewed more positively than Trump among Tar Heel voters -- 50% have a favorable view of her vs. 49% unfavorable for a +1 net positive rating. Trump's rating is negative by 7 points (46% favorable, 53% unfavorable).

Just 30% say the economy is in either excellent (7%) or good (23%) condition, while another 70% say either fair (30%) or poor (40%). This negativity is a far cry from November 2019 (late into Trump's term as president) when 54% were positive and 44% negative.

By 7 points, voters are more likely to think Trump can better handle the economy and about the same number give him the edge on making the country safe (+6). He does best on immigration and border security, where he leads Harris by 15 points, down from a 19-point lead in August.

4 MARK ROBINSON CAMPAIGN STAFFERS RESIGN IN WAKE OF REPORT ON PORN WEBSITE POSTS

Harris does best on the issue of abortion, where she is preferred by 16 points. Voters also give her the edge on helping the middle class (+7), protecting democracy (+6), and fighting for people like you (+5).

The candidates tie on who can bring needed change.

""The race here will be close, but Trump still holds the edge on the issues that matter most to North Carolina voters,"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""So long as they think Trump is more likely to make the country more prosperous and safer, he's the odds-on favorite.""

At least 8 in 10 Black voters think Harris is better equipped to handle these issues and actions, except when it comes to immigration, where Trump eats into Harris' lead with 25% saying he would better handle immigration vs. 73% for Harris.

The survey also finds the gap in the gubernatorial race in North Carolina has widened. Democrat Josh Stein (56%) has a 16-point lead over Republican Mark Robinson (40%), a 5-point increase since last month (54% Stein, 43% Robinson).

The survey was conducted after news of alleged inflammatory comments Robinson made on a porn website.

""It is unlikely the toxic nature of the Republican gubernatorial candidate will cause Trump voters to switch to Harris, but it could affect turnout,"" says Anderson. ""It complicates things for the Trump campaign to have to actively avoid the GOP candidate, and there could be some Trump-leaning independents who are so turned off by Robinson they decide it's not worth voting.""

Trump endorsed Robinson in March but has yet to comment on whether he'll pull his support.

Some 14% of Stein supporters split their ticket and back Trump in the presidential race, while just 4% of Robinson supporters back Harris.

A few more things...

-- By 17 points, those who say they will vote early in North Carolina back Harris. Among the smaller group of Election Day voters, Trump leads by 20 points.

--The views of the vice-presidential candidates play out the same as the presidential, with Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz receiving a net positive rating of 5 (46% favorable vs. 41% unfavorable) and Ohio Republican Sen. JD Vance net negative by 6 (41-47%).

--Views of President Joe Biden are net negative by 15 points (42% favorable, 57% unfavorable).

"Fox News Poll: Harris, Trump locked in tight race in battleground Pennsylvania",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-harris-trump-locked-tight-race-battleground-pennsylvania,2024-09-27T22:07:19Z,"Fox News contributor Joe Concha on the media pressing Vice President Harris on her lack of interviews and Sen. Joe Manchin refusing to endorse Harris due to her support for ending the filibuster.

Vice President Harris and former President Trump are locked in a tight race in Pennsylvania, mostly unchanged since July. This despite the array of newsworthy events since then, including the Democratic National Convention, a presidential debate, and a second Trump assassination attempt.

The new Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters finds Harris narrowly ahead of Trump by 2 points (50-48%) among registered voters, while the race is tied at 49% each among likely voters.

The July results, conducted shortly after President Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris, but before she was conclusively the nominee, were deadlocked at 49% each. But even in March, when Biden was the presumed nominee, the contest was close to even.

WORKING CLASS WILL COME HOME TO HARRIS, RALLYGOERS IN POSTINDUSTRIAL PENNSYLVANIANS SAY

Since July, Harris has widened her lead among women (by 9 points), nonwhite voters (+8), and voters under age 30 (+17). Her support has held steady among two other sources of strength: college graduates and urban voters.

Ninety-two percent of Harris supporters are certain of their vote versus 86% of Trump supporters.

Trump's best groups include men, Whites without a college degree, independents, and rural voters. He has nearly doubled his lead among men and the small group of independents since July.

'ABUSE OF POWER': HOUSE GOP OPENS PROBE INTO UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

Another reason the race is close is Trump has minimized Harris' edge among suburban voters (+2). This is mostly due to the large gender gap among suburban voters: suburban men support Trump by 14 points (suburban women go for Harris by 17). Meanwhile, Harris has successfully peeled off disaffected Republicans: she has 1 in 4 non-MAGA Republicans backing her.

In 2016, Trump beat Hillary Clinton by less than a point in the Keystone State, while Biden's victory was by just over a point in 2020.

In the expanded ballot (includes third-party candidates) Harris has a 2-point edge among registered voters while Trump is ahead by 1 point among likely voters.

All results for the Harris-Trump head-to-heads and expanded ballot are within the error margin .

""Pennsylvania is not breaking open and shouldn't be expected to,"" says Democratic Pollster Chris Anderson who conducts Fox News surveys alongside Republican Daron Shaw. ""Both candidates have a little way to go to consolidate their bases and whoever does a better job there could determine who wins the state.""

The economy is the top issue for voters this election and most Pennsylvanians have a negative view of the economy (71%).

More voters think Trump can better handle the economy than Harris by 6 points. Still, that's half the advantage he had on the issue in April (+12 points over Biden).

Trump does best on immigration and border security (+17) and is also more trusted to make the country safer (+5).

Harris is seen as better able to handle abortion by 21 points. She also gets the nod on helping the middle class (by 8 points), protecting Democracy (+7), and fighting for people like you (+5).

Neither has a clear edge in bringing needed change (Harris +3)

Harris enjoys better favorable ratings than the former president -- 48% favorable vs. 51% unfavorable for a 3-point net negative rating. Trump is underwater by 9 points (45% vs. 54%). It plays out the same way among the vice-presidential candidates: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's rating is even (44% vs. 44%) while Ohio Sen. JD Vance is in negative territory by 13 points (39% vs. 52%).

Biden's favorable rating is underwater by 16 points (42% vs. 58%).

In the Pennsylvania Senate race, Democratic candidate Bob Casey has a 9-point lead over Republican challenger David McCormick (53% to 44% among both registered and likely voters). McCormick has narrowed the gap by 4 points since July when he was down by 13 (55-42%).

The reversal can mostly be attributed to a 13-point shift among men and a decrease in support for Casey among independents. In July, men supported Casey by 6 points while today they back McCormick by 7 points, while independents supported Casey by 18 points in the summer and it's a 5-point spread now.

Some 10% of Casey backers split their ticket and back Trump in the presidential race while just 4% of McCormick supporters go for Harris.

A few more things...

-- Gov. Josh Shapiro is popular, as 62% approve of the job he's doing while a third disapprove (36%). Most Democrats (92%) and over half of independents (53%) approve of him while two-thirds of Republicans (65%) disapprove.

-- A majority of Pennsylvanians favor the use of fracking for oil and gas production, including 8 in 10 Republicans, 6 in 10 independents, and 4 in 10 Democrats.

Vice President Harris stops in battleground Arizona on Friday to hold a campaign event along the U.S. southern border with Mexico as the Democrat presidential nominee works to turn the issue of immigration and border security from a negative into a positive.

Harris has faced frequent attacks from her Republican opponent, former President Trump, and his allies who argue she's weak on border security, an issue that many Republicans see as the vice president's political Achilles' heel. Harris has faced intense criticism over the surge of migrants across the nation's southern border during the first three years of President Biden's administration.

The Trump campaign, on the eve of Harris' first border visit as a presidential nominee, called it a ""political ploy.""

But Harris, with a stop in Douglas, Arizona, aims to show that she's better prepared than Trump to tackle the combustible issue of immigration and what Republicans have spotlighted as the crisis at the southern border.

HARRIS LEANS IN ON BORDER SECURITY AND TRUMP RELISHES THE FIGHT

The vice president is expected to speak about how she is pushing what she describes as the toughest bipartisan border security plan in a generation, a measure that includes new border agents and technologies to stop fentanyl trafficking.

And she's expected to reiterate her argument that Trump ""has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk.""

CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE 2024 ELECTION

She has repeatedly pointed to a border security bill with some bipartisan support that had been making its way through Congress this year before Republicans turned against the measure after prompting from Trump.

Harris has said that the former president ""tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election"" and has pledged that ""as the president, I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed.""

Since replacing Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket more than two months ago, Harris has described herself as a former ""border state prosecutor"" who took on international gangs and criminal organizations behind illegal drug, gun and human trafficking across the border.

The description comes as Harris and her campaign have also spotlighted a tougher stance on border security while still pushing for a pathway to citizenship for some migrants.

""We need a comprehensive plan,"" Harris said Wednesday in an interview with MSNBC. ""That includes what we need to do to fortify not only our border but deal with the fact that we also need to create pathways for people to earn citizenship.""

Biden tasked Harris in 2021 with leading the diplomatic outreach to tackle the ""root causes"" of migration in Central American countries. It led to her being dubbed the ""border czar"" both by the media and some Republicans, although the White House has rejected that description. And the vice president has been pilloried over her role as ""Biden's border czar"" by Trump and his allies.

Trump, as he runs to win back his old job in the White House, is calling for a major crackdown at the U.S.-Mexico border and has suggested using police and the military to carry out mass deportations of undocumented migrants.

Speaking at a campaign event in North Carolina on Wednesday, Trump said Harris was traveling to the southern border for ""political reasons.""

""When Kamala speaks about the border, her credibility is less than zero,"" Trump said. ""I hope you're going to remember that on Friday. When she tells you about the border, ask her just one simple question: 'Why didn't you do it four years ago?'""

And Trump has said the policies of the Biden-Harris administration have allowed millions of people to enter the U.S. illegally.

In June, after the collapse of the bipartisan border security bill, Biden announced rules that bar migrants from being granted asylum when U.S. officials say the U.S.-Mexico border is overwhelmed. Following the implementation of the new rules through executive orders, arrests for illegal border crossings have plummeted.

Polls indicate that immigration and abortion are two of the top issues on the minds of American voters, following the economy and inflation.

And public opinion surveys, including those from Fox News, indicate that by double digits Americans believe Trump would do a better job than Harris handling the issue.

Trump last visited the border during a stop last month in Arizona, which is one of the seven crucial battleground states that will likely determine the winner of the presidential election.

OB-GYNs decry the 'fearmongering' about Georgia's abortion laws: 'The lies are hurting women',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/ob-gyns-decry-fearmongering-about-georgias-abortion-laws-the-lies-hurting-women,2024-09-27T09:06:13Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Charlotte Lozier Institute Vice President and Director of Medical Affairs Dr. Ingrid Skop is calling out the ""fearmongering"" and ""lies"" of the media that are hurting women who don't understand new abortion laws.

A recent piece from ProPublica blamed the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, following chemically induced abortions in 2022, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits.

Since the story's publication, many members of the Democratic Party, including Vice President Kamala Harris, have been attacking Georgia's laws by suggesting they prevented the women in these cases from receiving lifesaving care.

Skop is one of multiple OB-GYNs Fox News spoke to who have criticized what they see as a misleading story being pushed by the media and Democrats.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

""I was not surprised to see this pro-abortion media try to point the blame at Georgia's pro-life laws, but, in fact, Georgia's laws allow doctors to intervene to save the life of the woman,"" Skop told Fox News Digital.

She continued, ""I think the focus of the Democratic Party upon abortion as an issue is only because the American people do not understand the laws. Many times, women are hurt by abortions. It is not necessary for women to live their best life. And, of course, it's the fearmongering and lies that have led us to this place where we are today, where people even think there would be a reason to point at the law.""

Skop emphasized that Georgia's abortion laws, as well as those of every other state, are ""very, very clear"" that an abortion can be done to save the life of the mother. Further, she said the laws do not apply to abortion procedures such as dilation and curettage (D&C) if the unborn baby is already dead, as was the case for Thurman.

""The law states again that a miscarriage is an exception. It also states that an ectopic pregnancy is an exception. So we should never be reading of women not getting miscarriage care or not getting ectopic pregnancies treated because they are clearly an exception in every pro-life state's laws,"" Skop said.

Skop said that it's the distortions of the laws that have done harm to women, not the laws themselves, leaving women like Miller unsure about seeking life-saving care and doctors unsure about giving it.

""The lies about pro-life laws are hurting women. The pro-life laws are not hurting women, but the lies are hurting women. Because in many cases, the women do not understand. And we've seen that sometimes even the doctors don't understand. They're not reading the law. They're listening to the pro-abortion media,"" Skop said.

Dr. Christina Francis, CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), made similar comments on ""Fox & Friends Saturday.""

""We are seeing the direct results of spreading lies and misinformation about these laws. Women are being harmed by that because they are delaying in seeking care.

Kamala Harris isn't alone: Vulnerable Dems want current filibuster gone,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-isnt-alone-vulnerable-dems-want-current-filibuster-gone,2024-09-27T08:15:22Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Harris' controversial filibuster comment isn't out of line with a group of vulnerable Democrat senators vying to keep their seats in the upper chamber who are also willing to do away with the legislative filibuster.

In fact, Sens. Jon Tester, D-Mont., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, Bob Casey, D-Pa., Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., all voted to change the rules in 2022 to allow a bill that would loosen federal voting requirements to be passed by a simple majority, which Democrats had in the Senate.

""I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe,"" Harris, a former senator, told Wisconsin Public Radio this week, referencing changing Senate rules to codify the precedent set in Roe v. Wade into law and protect the ability to get an abortion federally.

SENATE PASSES FUNDING BILL WITHOUT SAVE ACT, AVOIDING POTENTIAL SHUTDOWN

Immediately afterward, Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.Va., said he would not endorse her for president: ""I'm not endorsing her,"" he told Fox News.

The legislative filibuster requires 60 votes to end debate on a bill and advance to a final vote. If a measure is unable to meet this threshold on a cloture vote, it cannot move forward for final passage consideration.

In 2022, both moderate Sens. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., and Manchin bucked Democrats to join Republicans in preventing the rule change that would have allowed Democrats to pass the voting requirements bill with the party's razor-thin majority. The senators were both Democrats at the time but subsequently left the party to become independents. They each later announced they wouldn't seek re-election.

Ahead of the filibuster standoff, Brown told one outlet in 2020, ""We've got to eliminate the filibuster.""

Rosen remarked to another in 2021 that she supported suspending the filibuster's rules ""in the case of protecting democracy,"" such as passing the voting requirements bill.

GOP SENATORS EYE COMPREHENSIVE CHINA STRATEGY TO CURB CCP INFLUENCE

Also in 2021, Casey said the threshold was ""an arcane Senate procedure"" and added, ""If the choice comes down to the filibuster or democracy, I know which side I'm on.""

Tester told MSNBC during the same summer that if the filibuster continued being ""weaponized,"" he would be left with few choices.

Baldwin backed scrapping the legislative filibuster as far back as 2013, co-sponsoring a bill to do so at the time and reinstitute a ""talking filibuster."" Under this change, the 60-vote threshold or legislative filibuster would be eliminated and those who want to filibuster a measure would be required to speak on the chamber floor. If and when those lawmakers stop speaking, a final vote by simple majority would take place.

A spokesperson told Fox News Digital earlier in the year that ""Senator Tester does not support ending the filibuster.""

But Tester told Fox News Digital on Wednesday, ""Talking filibuster, that's what I want, period.""

The talking filibuster would effectively eliminate the current legislative filibuster.

TOP SECRET SERVICE AGENT IN PITTSBURGH SAYS HE WAS KEPT IN DARK ON 'CREDIBLE' THREAT AHEAD OF BUTLER RALLY

Casey also reiterated his interest in voting on the 60-vote rule to Fox News Digital in the spring.

Baldwin on Wednesday told Fox News Digital she agreed with Harris' recent comment and still backs returning to the talking filibuster.

In response to their interest in a talking filibuster, Manchin told Fox News Digital, ""There's only one filibuster, 60-vote threshold.""

Both Brown and Rosen ignored questions about whether they agreed with Harris' comment from Fox News Digital on Wednesday.

Representatives for Casey, Rosen and Brown did not respond to questions from Fox News Digital regarding whether they agreed with Harris or if their positions had changed.

JOE MANCHIN SAYS HE WON'T ENDORSE HARRIS OVER SUPPORT FOR ELIMINATING FILIBUSTER

Tester is considered the most vulnerable Democrat seeking re-election as top political handicappers predict a Republican win and polls show the Montana senator losing traction.

The Ohio race is considered a toss-up by the Cook Political Report as Brown competes to keep his seat.

Baldwin, Casey and Rosen's races in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Nevada are rated ""Lean Democrat.""

In 2021, voters were somewhat divided on the filibuster and many were unsure what they thought about it. According to an April 2021 Fox News Poll, 27% supported eliminating the filibuster while 29% opposed doing so. However, 39% didn't have an opinion at all.

In the aftermath of the dispute over Senate rules in early 2022, even fewer voters reported having an opinion. In a July 2022 Fox News Poll, those who supported eliminating the filibuster and those who opposed it were tied at 26% each, while nearly half, at 47%, said they didn't have an opinion."
Judge blocks NY AG Letitia James from trying to silence pregnancy centers that promote abortion pill reversal,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-blocks-ny-ag-letitia-james-silence-pregnancy-centers-promote-abortion-pill-reversal,2024-09-26T22:59:50Z,"New York Attorney General Letitia James addressed a crowed rallied outside the Supreme Court in support of the FDA's approval of an abortion pill during oral arguments on Tuesday.

A federal judge this week issued New York Attorney General Letitia James a preliminary injunction that bars her from taking action against pregnancy clinics that promote abortion pill reversal on the grounds it would restrict protected free speech.

The ruling came amid a lawsuit by the Thomas More Society on behalf of two pro-life ministries, Summit Life Outreach Center and the Evergreen Association. The lawsuit argues that James has targeted pregnancy centers with threats of prosecution for sharing information about abortion pill reversal, which she has said is unproven.

""These small nonprofits, which exist to compassionately serve women and offer them alternatives to abortion, deserve to have their speech elevated -- not chilled,"" Peter Breen, Thomas More Society's executive vice president and head of litigation, said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""This court order makes clear Ms. James cannot censor pro-life speech purely because she dislikes it.""

HARRIS CALLS FOR ELIMINATING FILIBUSTER TO PASS 'ROE' ABORTION BILL INTO FEDERAL LAW

Fox News Digital has reached out to James' office.

In his order, Judge John Sinatra Jr., a Trump appointee, wrote that James is barred from preventing the clinics from promoting abortion pill reversal on their websites and social media platforms.

Medicinal abortion involves taking mifepristone and following it with treatment of misoprostol days later, but pregnancy clinics have advised that those who change their minds and want to continue the pregnancy can do so by abandoning the second drug and instead taking doses of progesterone.

In May, James filed lawsuits against 11 pregnancy centers that promoted the abortion pill reversal procedure, accusing them of engaging in fraud, deceptive business practices and false advertising. She claimed the groups were ""spreading dangerous misinformation by advertising ... without any medical and scientific proof.""

DEMS LOOK TO FORCE VOTES ON EMERGENCY ABORTION AS ABORTION PILL DEATHS MAKE HEADLINES

Despite not being named in James' lawsuit, Summit Life Outreach Center and the Evergreen Association said her targeting of other pregnancy centers had put them at risk.

Barbara Bidak, the executive director of Summit Life Outreach Center, said her staff works ""tirelessly to provide life-affirming options for women in need.""

""We're incredibly pleased a federal judge has now made clear that Attorney General Letitia James' legal attacks on our state's pro-life ministries unconstitutionally chills our First Amendment right to share the lifesaving message of Abortion Pill Reversal -- which gives pregnant moms in the middle of a chemical abortion a second chance to choose life.""

Breen said the pro-life ministries have a constitutional right to share information about abortion pill reversal, and that ""their message is saving thousands of lives.""

The Thomas More Society is representing the 11 clinics in a separate case. Last month, a federal judge in that case ruled the clinics were protected by the First Amendment.

""Based on a careful application of the preliminary injunction factors, especially as they relate to Plaintiffs' First Amendment Free Speech claim, motion for a preliminary injunction is granted,"" the judge wrote.

Fox News Poll: Voters' choice has flipped in Arizona since last month,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-voters-choice-flipped-arizona-since-last-month,2024-09-26T22:06:37Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Former President Donald Trump is narrowly ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential contest in Arizona, as the Democratic nominee loses ground among women, Hispanics, and young voters.

A new Fox News survey of Arizona voters finds Harris trails Trump by 3 percentage points among likely voters in both the two-way matchup (48-51%) and the expanded ballot that includes third-party candidates (47-50%, with 3% backing other candidates). While 9 in 10 say their vote choice is locked in, both Harris and Trump have a handful of supporters saying they may change their mind.

In August, Harris was up by 1 point in the horserace among registered voters (50-49%), while she's down by 2 points today (48-50%). All of these matchups are within the margin of error.

The 3-point shift among registered voters is mainly due to movement among young voters, women, and Hispanics.

Since August, Harris' 18-point lead among Hispanics has narrowed to 11 points and her 14-point edge among women is down to 8 points. What was a 13-point advantage for Harris among voters under age 30 is now a 12-point deficit, a 25-point shift. These changes are notable, even given that estimates among subgroups are more volatile.

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: THE EDGE IS CLEAR ON THIS KEY ISSUE

Trump tops Harris among Whites without a college degree, rural voters, and independents. He has a narrow edge among suburbanites because more suburban men back him than suburban women favor Harris. And, by just a touch, more of his 2020 voters stick with him than Biden's 2020 voters back Harris.

Harris has strong support among those ages 65 and over, voters with a college degree, and urban voters, and still receives majority backing among women and Hispanics. Plus, one in four non-MAGA Republicans favors Harris over Trump.

By a 51-46% margin, Trump leads among new voters, defined as those who haven't voted in the four most recent elections.

""Arizona is looking tougher for Harris than a month ago,"" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts Fox News surveys with Republican Daron Shaw. ""If young voters and Hispanics don't make a U-turn, it's hard to see how she walks away with a win.""

More Arizona voters trust Trump than Harris to handle immigration (by 15 points) and the economy (+8). Those are significant leads, and they match where things stood last month -- but compared to his June leads over President Joe Biden, Trump's advantage is down 5 points on immigration and down 7 points on the economy.

Trump is also seen as being better at making the country safe by 7 points.

There's little difference between the candidates on who will better protect democracy (Harris +3), help the middle class (Harris +2), fight for people like you (Harris +2), and bring needed change (Trump +1).

Harris leads Trump by 15 points on handling abortion, down from her 22-point lead last month.

More than 7 in 10 Arizona voters favor the state's proposed constitutional amendment establishing the right to an abortion, including more than two-thirds of independents and half of Republicans.

The two candidates are about equal in personal favorable ratings. Harris gets net negative marks by 3 points (48% favorable, 51% unfavorable), while Trump's are negative by 5 points (47%-52%). For the vice-presidential candidates, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's ratings are negative by just 1 point (42-43%) with 15% unable to rate him. Ohio Sen. JD Vance's favorable rating is underwater by 7 points (40-47%) and 12% have no opinion.

Trump won Arizona in 2016 by about 3.5 percentage points, while Biden's 2020 victory was by less than half a percentage point.

In the Senate race, Democrat Ruben Gallego tops Republican Kari Lake by more than 10 percentage points: 55-42% among likely voters and 56-42% among registered voters. Gallego is preferred across most demographic groups, but women voters are a big part of what gives him the advantage as they back him over Lake by a 23-point margin. He also receives the support of 6 in 10 independents and nearly 2 in 10 Republicans.

FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS CITE HIGH PRICES AS BIGGEST MOTIVATOR TO VOTE

Some 15% of Gallego supporters split their ticket and back Trump in the presidential race. Some of the biggest ticket splitting is among independents, who are 16 points more likely to back Gallego than Harris, and Republicans (10 points more for Gallego). Among those voters favoring Lake, only 3% go for Harris.

Poll-pourri

Early voters are more likely to back Harris by 11 points, while Trump is favored by 30 points among the smaller group of Election Day voters.

Biden's personal favorability is negative by 21 points, 39% favorable vs. 60% unfavorable. That's a big decline from four years ago when his ratings were positive by 2 points (June 2020).

In a head-to-head matchup, Vice President Kamala Harris tops former President Donald Trump by three percentage points in a Fox News survey of Georgia voters.

Harris receives 51% support to Trump's 48% among both registered and likely voters. While her advantage may be narrow (inside the margin of error), it is steady. Last month, she was up 50-48% among registered voters.

Roughly 1 in 10 of each candidate's supporters say they may change their mind.

More Georgians see Harris as the candidate who will help the middle class and protect democracy by a 7-point margin on each. She is also seen as the candidate more likely to fight ""for people like you"" by 6 points. Harris' largest lead is on handling the issue of abortion, where she is favored by 18 points.

Trump's largest lead is on handling immigration (+15 points).

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: THE EDGE IS CLEAR ON THIS KEY ISSUE

The two candidates are rated more closely on bringing needed change (Harris by 4 points), making the country safe (Trump +3), and handling the economy (Trump +4). His advantage on the economy today is half what it was last month.

Large majorities of Black voters trust Harris over Trump on each issue and trait, with as many as 85% saying she will ""fight for people like you.""

Among independents, 6 in 10 see Harris as helping the middle class, while nearly as many say Trump is better able to handle the economy.

""Georgia is looking like a true battleground with a slight lean toward Harris,"" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts Fox News polls with Republican Daron Shaw. ""More voters see her fighting for them and standing up for the middle class, and she has almost neutralized Trump's advantage on the economy.""

Party loyalty is also a factor. By a 4-percentage point margin, more Democrats back Harris than Republicans back Trump. One in five non-MAGA Republicans supports Harris.

Independents favor Harris over Trump by 13 points.

Trump won Georgia by 5 percentage points in 2016, but Biden took the state in 2020 by less than half a point.

By a wide 30-point margin, Georgia voters like the job Gov. Brian Kemp is doing, 64% approve vs. 34% disapprove (August 2024).

""The pathway for Trump is pretty obvious,"" says Shaw. ""He has to make nice with Governor Kemp and non-MAGA Republicans -- and if he does that, he probably has the edge.""

Harris gets her best numbers from Black voters, urban voters, those under age 30, and women.

Majorities of Whites without a college degree, rural voters, men, and voters ages 65 and over support Trump.

New voters split 50-50% (those who haven't voted in the four most recent general elections).

Married voters go for Trump by 15 points, while those who are unmarried favor Harris by 21.

Most voters who say they will cast their ballot early prefer Harris, while Trump is favored among those planning to vote on Election Day.

FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS CITE HIGH PRICES AS BIGGEST MOTIVATOR TO VOTE

Meanwhile, Harris is generally more popular than Trump. By a 3-point margin the vice president receives net positive ratings, as 51% have a favorable view of her and 48% unfavorable. Trump's ratings are net negative by 6 points (47% vs. 53%).

The same goes for the vice-presidential candidates. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is in positive territory by 1 point (43-42%), while Ohio Sen. JD Vance is underwater by 3 (43-46%).

A Georgia voter told CNN during a recent interview that she was considering voting Republican for the first time in her life, as Vice President Kamala Harris attempts to duplicate President Biden's 2020 support in the state.

""I've been a Democrat my entire adult life,"" Chant√° Villano-Willis, a resident of a majority Black community in Cobb County, told CNN. ""This has actually been the first year where I was considering voting Republican.""

She said of her mother, ""(She) never thought she'd see a Black person president in her life. She did. Now, Kamala Harris is (running) for president. My mother says she doesn't care what she does, let's just get her in there. And I simply don't feel the same.""

CNN's John King spoke to a group of voters throughout Georgia about their intentions in November. The state helped propel President Biden to victory in 2020.

However, Willis said that she agreed with Harris on abortion and argued that sometimes Trump talked down to Black people.

Kim Cavaliere, a Gwinnett County resident who leans Democrat but voted third party in the previous two elections, told CNN she wasn't pleased with either choice.

""But did she convince me she has what it takes? No,"" Cavaliere said of Harris, despite conceding the vice president won her debate against Trump. ""Right now, I am not settling and am not pleased with the choices.""

Christine Nguyen, who plans to vote for Harris and owns a small business in Decatur, told CNN that the economy could be a problem for Harris' chances.

""That comes up very often,"" she told King. ""I hear it a lot, even in my family of entrepreneurs, it comes up every now and then, right, that Trump just knows business better, that he's, you know, more savvy. ... But I think at the end of the day, it's what you value and, like, what your beliefs are in terms of your ethics.""

She said Harris' connection to the Biden administration could hurt her chances.

""It definitely has hurt our business in the past couple of months, seeing the prices go up for our supplies, and us not being able to adjust the prices accordingly,"" Nguyen said. ""I think that could highly impact her chances, because she has been part of the administration in the past four years."""
'Against our daughters': Cruz challenger hit with blistering 7-figure ad over transgender sports bill vote,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/against-our-daughters-cruz-challenger-hit-blistering-7-figure-ad-over-transgender-sports-bill-vote,2024-09-26T16:28:42Z,"FIRST ON FOX: A conservative super PAC is blanketing the airwaves with a new advertisement slamming Texas Democratic Senate candidate Rep. Colin Allred, who is locked in a high-profile race against Republican incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz.

The pro-Cruz Truth and Courage PAC is rolling out a $3 million dollar ad buy in Texas hitting the Democratic congressman over his previous support of allowing biological males to compete in sports against female opponents.

""Texas girls are tough,"" the 30-second version of the ad says, as it shows young women training for various sporting events. ""But they're facing a new opponent they can't beat by digging deeper.""

""Colin Allred could have stopped men from competing in women's sports, but instead, he voted against our daughters,"" the ad continues before it shows a man resembling Allred with the name ""Allred"" on his jersey, tackling one of the girls.

CRUZ INTERRUPTED BY ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATOR WHO YELLED, 'F---ING JEWS' DURING HEARING ON 'HATE'

""What kind of man does that?""

There is also a 60-second version of the ad that shows him in a couple of photos with then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. As the ad shows the photos, the narrator says Allred ""voted against the Protection of Women and Girls Act of 2023. He stood with woke progressives and radical Democrats, not our daughters.""

The ad, which will also run in Spanish, cites Allred's vote in Congress against The Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2023, which passed the House on a party line vote with President Biden saying he would veto it if it got to his desk.

""This is a disgusting, false attack, and another example of how Ted Cruz only wants to divide Texans,"" Allred campaign spokesperson Josh Stewart told Fox News Digital.

""He'll say anything to distract from his dangerous abortion ban that is putting women's lives at risk, trying to raise the retirement age for Social Security and Medicare and fleeing to Cancun during a deadly winter storm.""

Cruz won his last Senate race by about three points in 2018, and some experts believe that this year's race could be close again.

While the Real Clear Politics polling average shows Cruz with a five-point lead in the race, there are some troubling signs for the Republican incumbent, including recent polls showing Cruz with a lead close to within the margin of error.

It has a reported margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are virtually tied in three crucial battleground states, according to new statewide surveys from Marist College.

The Marist Poll released Thursday finds that Harris and Trump are tied at 49% among likely voters in North Carolina who were asked which candidate they were leaning toward. Of those polled who have made up their minds, 91% said they strongly support their choice.

The race is tight in Arizona as well, where Trump polls just one point ahead of Harris, 50% to 49%, according to the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. The same goes for Georgia, where 50% of likely voters are leaning towards Trump and 49% say they are more inclined to vote for Harris.

The Marist Polls were conducted from Sept. 19-24, surveying 4,643 registered voters across all three states who report they are definitely voting in this year's election.

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: THE EDGE IS CLEAR ON THIS KEY ISSUE

There are 43 Electoral College votes up for grabs between Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina. Trump, a Republican, won all three in his 2016 victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, but lost Arizona and Georgia to President Biden in his 2020 defeat. North Carolina, a swing state that Trump won twice, has an incumbent Democratic governor and appears more competitive this year as the Republican candidate for governor, Mark Robinson, is mired in scandal over posts he allegedly made on a porn website and polls poorly against state Attorney General Josh Stein, the Democratic candidate.

""North Carolina, with its 16 electoral votes, is both the Harris and Trump campaigns' backup plan after the hard-fought battle over Pennsylvania,"" said Dr. Lee M. Miringoff, Director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. ""North Carolina is so close that the five regions in the state line up now almost exactly as they did four years ago. It's as if the Biden years and the 2024 campaign haven't happened.""

Harris and Trump are tied at 48% among North Carolina independents who are likely to vote. Biden carried Tar Heel independents by four points in 2020, according to the 2020 Presidential Exit Poll. Harris leads Trump among Black voters 86% to 13%, but underperforms compared to Biden, who earned 92% of the Black vote in North Carolina in 2020. Trump has an advantage over Harris with white voters, 59% to 40%, though Harris has improved with this demographic over Biden, who won 33% of the white vote in 2020.

The top issues for North Carolina voters are inflation (32%), preserving democracy (28%), immigration (14%) and abortion (11%), according to the poll.

HARRIS AND TRUMP DEADLOCKED IN PENNSYLVANIA AS FORMER PRESIDENT TRAILS IN OTHER 'BLUE WALL' STATES: POLL

Over in Arizona, Harris edges Trump among independents 51% to 47%. Biden won Arizona independents by 9 points four years ago, 53% to Trump's 44%. Again, Trump leads Harris among white voters 51% to 48%, while the Latino vote is competitive, with 51% leaning towards Trump and 49% towards Harris.

The top issues for Arizona voters are preserving democracy (27%), inflation (26%), immigration (21%) and abortion (14%), the survey said.

""Arizona's 11 electoral votes are up for grabs, but the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate (Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz.) has a double-digit lead,"" said Miringoff. ""Voters in the state, like elsewhere, are willing to split their ticket this time unlike the straight party voting that occurred in 2016 and 2020.""

Harris also leads Trump among Georgia independents by five percentage points, 51% to 46%. Similar to Arizona, Biden won Georgia independents by 9 points in what was the first presidential election win for Peach State Democrats since 1992. Trump heavily contested the 2020 results in Georgia and continues to make unproven allegations of widespread voter fraud that have been rejected by Georgia officials, including Republican Gov. Brian Kemp.

""Georgia was ground zero for election controversies in 2020. Yet, the overwhelming majority of Georgians express confidence that elections will be fair and accurate,"" said Miringoff. ""Interestingly, most Democrats and Republicans share this view despite the results last time.""

Georgia voters rank inflation as the top issue (34%), followed by preserving democracy (24%), immigration (13%) and abortion (11%).

A Fox News national poll taken after the first debate between Harris and Trump spotlighted that 39% of voters surveyed said the economy was their most pressing issue, far ahead of immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues tested were in single digits.

""An increasing number say grocery prices and housing costs are tough for their family,"" the Fox News poll notes.

Trump led Harris on the economy by 5 points in the Fox News poll.

""The issue profile of this election continues to favor Trump,"" said Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Democrat Chris Anderson.

But Shaw added that Trump's ""edge on economic issues has decreased, probably due to Harris' messaging on housing costs and taxes, both of which target the middle class and appear to be paying off.""

Morning Glory: Why is Kamala Harris skipping the Al Smith Dinner in New York City?,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-why-kamala-harris-skipping-al-smith-dinner-new-york-city,2024-09-26T09:20:40Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris should reverse her decision to skip the biggest Catholic-sponsored fund-raiser for the poor and the vulnerable in the country's biggest city and not just for her own political benefit. She should do so stat. The event is October 17, so there is plenty of time to change her mind but it should not be a poll-driven choice. It's the right thing to do.

Cardinal Francis Spellman founded and hosted the the first Al Smith dinner honoring New York's legendary political figure, the first ever Catholic nominated to be president by either major party. Smith was nominated by Democrats to become president in 1928 and lost in spectacular fashion to Herbert Hoover. Hoover garnered 444 Electoral College votes by winning 40 states to Smith's 87 votes and 8 states.

Smith had been elected governor of New York four times before his second presidential run in 1928 which got him the Democratic nomination that year. Smith had been turned back in 1924 in his first run for the nomination and his quest for a second Democratic nomination was blunted by FDR who got the Democratic nod in 1932 and blew out Hoover as Hoover had blown out Smith four years earlier. After leaving politics, Smith oversaw the construction of the Empire State Building, helped lead the early anti-Nazi movement in the states, and overcame his personal enmity for FDR to help with the war effort. This great figure in American political history died in 1944.

Cardinal Spellman inaugurated a dinner honoring Smith in 1946 as a fundraiser to benefit New York's most vulnerable women and children. Since 1960, the nominees of both major parties have attended the dinner with one exception: Walter Mondale skipped the dinner in 1984. The dinners are jovial, light-hearted affairs and, during the presidential campaigns, both major party candidates gently mock themselves and their opponents. Is it a surprise that Mondale declined to try and entertain opposite President Ronald Reagan? Taking on an incumbent president is a tall order even when there is a Cardinal serving as de facto referee, especially when that president is ""the Great Communicator.""

Kamala Harris has said ""No."" As of this writing she won't go to the Al Smith dinner. The ever-available ""scheduling conflicts"" has been cited as her reason. Think on it a bit. Why wouldn't she go?

It's a capital ""C"" Catholic and a small ""c"" catholic affair. Like all giant fundraisers it begins late and often goes on too long and getting home can be a problem, but the national media turns out in great numbers as does New York's business and Catholic elite. It's the Metropolitan Museum Gala minus the Hollywood and Broadway celebrities and a red carpet. The Al Smith dinner is held in midtown and has already sold out. White tails are expected for the men on the dais.

Every four years the ""earned media"" for the candidate who can be funny about themselves along with a deft light jab or two at their opponent is immense. And there we have the first of the hurdles preventing Vice President Harris's from attending.

There is a major reason and two minor reasons for Harris to skip this ritual.

First, Kamala Harris doesn't do ""light humor."" She doesn't actually ""do"" humor at all. Her timing is awful and even with Oprah as her wingman she crashed in last week's special event. At one point Oprah turned directly toward camera during the seemingly endless closing soliloquy by the Vice President and appeared to be giving a stoney-faced glare at the stage manager in the hope that he or she would do the big wrap motion for the Veep. Kamala drafted Hollywood superstars and the country's most successful communicator for that event and still stumbled her way into a fiasco. The chances of an even worse performance with Donald Trump two seats down probably seemed too great and accepting the invite just too risky when she made her initial decision to reject the invite.

She may also be leery of an overtly Catholic celebration that would have her seated next to Cardinal Timothy Dolan. Given Harris's extreme views on abortion -- no limits at all on abortion and opposition to ""Born Alive"" acts at the state and federal level -- Harris has got to be afraid of her hard-left supporters' objections to appearing in public with a ""Prince of the Church,"" a church that is as pro-life as any organization or faith. The left wing of the Democrats are busy demonizing Israel right now, but the Catholic Church is their second favorite target.

KAMALA HARRIS TO SIT FOR INTERVIEW WITH MSNBC DAYS AFTER HOST DEFENDED VP DODGING ON POLICY

""We're disappointed,"" Cardinal Dolan commented on Harris's rebuff. ""We're not used to this. We don't know how to handle it.

""This hasn't happened in 40 years, since Walter Mondale turned down the invitation, and remember he lost 49 out of 50 states,"" the Cardinal added, and noted that both Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and New York Governor Kathy Hochul were trying to get the Vice President to change her mind.

Don't count on it. Because of reason three: Kamala Harris cannot afford one more face plant. The ice is already breaking under her, forcing her into the MSNBC studios for a taped and almost certainly heavily edited ""interview"" with Stephanie Ruhle.

That's a safe place for the Veep but it won't register on any electoral scoreboard. It is MSNBC for goodness sakes. The last real center-right much less conservative host on that network left long ago. Harris is so insecure about her ability to field questions she's only going to talk to Oprah and MSNBC hosts. She's fears live extemporaneous remarks, (and even a teleprompter wouldn't make her into what she isn't.)

But she should try. If she can't show up for a fundraiser in Manhattan, how does she expect people to believe she can deal with the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping much less Russia's Putin or Iran's Khamenei?

Change your mind Madame Vice President. Cross this very low hurdle even though you won't have two moderators to help you over it."
"Experts preview Vance-Walz debate, say usually 'forgettable' VP bout 'might be different' this time",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/experts-preview-vance-walz-debate-say-usually-forgettable-bout-might-different-time,2024-09-26T08:13:04Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Next week's highly anticipated vice presidential debate between Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Democrat Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, while sure to generate buzz, is unlikely to make much difference in pushing undecided voters toward either presidential candidate, former President Trump or Vice President Harris, insiders agree.

Even so, experts who spoke to Fox News Digital did say there could be some indirect impact that can't be completely discounted in a very close race.

""The VP debate is usually pretty [low-profile], they usually don't get as much attention as the presidential debates,"" Christopher Devine, author of ""Do Running Mates Matter?: The Influence of Vice Presidential Candidates in Presidential Elections,"" told Fox News Digital in an interview.

Devine suggested that while the upcoming debate will probably result in some viral moments, it won't have the same level of interest or influence on voters as the 2008 VP debate when Sarah Palin on Republican John McCain's ticket stole the spotlight in her matchup with then-Sen. Joe Biden.

VANCE SAYS HE WILL KEEP CALLING HAITIAN MIGRANTS 'ILLEGAL ALIENS' DESPITE PAROLE STATUS

""But the running mate does have what we call an indirect effect on vote choice in that it influences what people think of the presidential candidate, knowing that Donald Trump could have picked anybody and chose JD Vance or that Kamala Harris could have picked anyone and chose Tim Walz, and how they perform on the debate stage,"" Devine added.

Tevi Troy, a presidential historian and a former George W. Bush Cabinet member, agreed but said their performances will reflect more of an impact on the public's view of themselves.

""Many VP debates are completely forgettable,"" Troy told Fox News Digital.

JD VANCE DEBATE PREP STRATEGY INCLUDES TAPPING PROMINENT LAWMAKER TO PLAY WALZ

""This year might be different, and it might be different because of the whole Harris-Walz hide-the-ball campaign where she didn't run for the nomination, so she wasn't scrutinized,"" he continued. ""Then she's been very reluctant to have any unscripted interviews since then, and when she does, it's usually with a very friendly reporter, and even in the debate against Trump, there's a perception that the moderators were harder on him than they were on her.""

""There have been a number of instances where Walz has [been] asked about her views, and he kind of ducks what her views are because if they say what she's been in the past, which is pretty liberal, [one of the] most liberal U.S. senators, then that's not popular and not helpful to her political prospects,"" Troy added. ""But Vance also has a number of things from his past that have surfaced, that have led to bad stories, like the cat-lady thing, for example, and Walz has not been shy about willing to go after Vance and criticize.""

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS TOPS TRUMP BY 2 POINTS

With no further presidential debates in the works before November, the running mates will likely be making the final head-to-head case to voters for their respective campaigns.

Each candidate is sure to jab the other, with Vance likely zeroing in on Walz's progressive policies in Minnesota and Walz likely to paint Vance as extreme, citing earlier statements on abortion prior to joining the Trump ticket.

John Leguizamo says Trump is gaining support among religious Latinos because they're 'homophobic',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/john-leguizamo-says-trump-gaining-support-among-religious-latinos-because-theyre-homophobic,2024-09-26T01:45:53Z,"Small business owners Shana Gray, Ryan Sprankle and Rafael Arroyo share the impact inflation has had on their companies and weigh VP Harris and former President Trump's economic policies.

Actor and comedian John Leguizamo said that religious Latinos who support former President Trump were ""homophobic.""

During an interview with TMZ, Leguizamo was asked about Vice President Kamala Harris polling lower with Latino voters than President Biden had when he was the 2024 presidential nominee. The ""John Wick"" and ""Encanto"" actor said Harris needed to be more ""aggressive"" and ""court"" Latinos, suggesting the VP needed a big-name celebrity to endorse her and encourage younger people in this demographic to vote.

When asked about Latinos in the Sun Belt trending toward Trump, Leguizamo suggested Harris would have a difficult time winning over religious Latinos due to their views on abortion and LGBTQ issues.

""Latino people are not a monolith,"" said Leguizamo. ""No group is, right? So, religious Latinos, they are anti-abortion and homophobic,"" he said, adding that these voters might be swayed on jobs and housing instead.

CNN DATA GURU SAYS HARRIS IS 'STRUGGLING AMONG VOTERS OF COLOR' IN THE SUN BELT: 'REALLY INTERESTING'

""You might get them, because the thing Latinos care most about is jobs and housing,"" he continued.

""So if you're talking about start[ing] businesses, Latino women are No. 1 start-up businesses in America. And we Latinos poll very large [sic] on keeping the housing market going...and Kamala Harris brought up those points and she's gotta keep hitting those points,"" he said.

Leguizamo also suggested Latinos who support Trump on immigration don't have ""sympathy or empathy"" for those coming into America seeking asylum or those who cross the border illegally.

""I think a lot of immigrants who came here are competitive with other immigrants coming in for some weird reason and have no sympathy or empathy for people looking for a better life,"" he said.

""Nobody wants to come to the border that way...you only do that if you have no other option. If you're running away from violence, starving to death,"" he continued. ""They're only coming here to work. To get a job -- no American would risk their life for a job.""

HISPANIC VOTERS IN NEVADA SAY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAKING SOME CONSIDER VOTING TRUMP

In an interview with Salon last May, the politically outspoken actor said that Latino Americans don't understand that Trump was responsible for ""damaging"" the economy.

""Because Latinos, they're blaming him [Biden] for the economy, which they shouldn't be because COVID was the culprit and Trump not handling COVID was the culprit in damaging our economy,"" he told the outlet.

Leguizamo also compared Latinos who support Trump to roaches supporting insecticide.

""Latin people for Republicans are like roaches for Raid. Let's just get real,"" Leguizamo said on an episode of ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" in October of 2020. ""I think there's a level of self-hate or just lack of care for the rest of your Latin brothers and sisters who are in cages, who are being demonized by this president.""

Hispanic voters give Trump a 42% to 37% advantage over Harris regarding immigration policy, Reuters/Ipsos polling from late August shows. These voters also prefer Trump's platform on the economy by 45% to 36%, but they give Harris a double-digit advantage on the issues of health care and climate change, according to the poll.

Actress Jennifer Lawrence spoke to People Magazine about how abortion access is the key issue driving her support for Vice President Kamala Harris.

Lawrence, an Oscar-winning actress, rose to fame as the protagonist in the film adaptation of ""The Hunger Games"" franchise, has frequently spoken out about her feminist views. This election, she told People Magazine, is one where ""abortion is literally on the ballot.""

""I'm voting for Kamala Harris because I think she's an amazing candidate and I know that she will do whatever she can to protect reproductive rights,"" she told the celebrity news outlet. ""That's the most important thing, is to not let somebody into the White House who is going to ban abortion.""

Lawrence has continued her career of storytelling by both producing and promoting films through her production company, Excellent Cadaver. She spoke about two upcoming documentary films her company will release in 2024, one of which is Zurawski v Texas.

"Senate passes funding bill without SAVE Act, avoiding potential shutdown",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-passes-funding-bill-without-save-act-avoiding-potential-shutdown,2024-09-25T22:39:19Z,"Fox News' Chad Pergram on the House rejecting a GOP spending bill that would also require proof of citizenship to vote and what the next steps are.

The Senate passed a short-term spending bill on Wednesday, avoiding a partial government shutdown at the end of the month and allowing lawmakers up for re-election to head home early to campaign.

By a vote of 78 to 18, senators approved a spending bill that will keep funding steady until Dec. 20, known as a continuing resolution (CR).

It passed in the House hours before being taken to the floor in the upper chamber, with representatives approving the spending bill 341 to 82.

132 Republican House members voted in favor of it. The bill saw 82 votes against it, all of which were cast by Republicans.

Lawmakers avoided a partial shutdown with only days to spare, despite a GOP demand that the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act be included. Several Republicans in Congress had insisted the SAVE Act be attached to the spending bill, including some in the Senate.

The SAVE Act would require proof of citizenship in order to register to vote.

A short-term bill that included that measure failed in the House of Representatives when Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., brought it for a vote last week, effectively killing hopes for a CR with the SAVE Act attached.

The House voted down the stopgap bill 202 to 220, with several Republicans voting against it and two voting ""present."" Three vulnerable Democrats voted in favor of it.

A CR with the SAVE Act had also been backed by former President Donald Trump, who urged Republicans not to accept a spending deal that did not include it. But while Trump encouraged it, Republicans both publicly and privately worried that their party would be blamed for a shutdown.

JOE MANCHIN SAYS HE WON'T ENDORSE HARRIS OVER SUPPORT FOR ELIMINATING FILIBUSTER

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., even laid the groundwork for blaming the GOP for a potential shutdown in recent floor remarks, labeling the possibility as a ""Trump shutdown.""

""Democrats and Americans don't want a Trump shutdown,"" he claimed.

Republicans decided not to prolong the fight over the CR and potentially risk a government shutdown, which is attributed by some in part to incoming severe weather that would make it difficult for senators to get back to their home states and looming competitive elections that they want to get on the campaign trail for.

While the CR will keep the government in full operation past the initial appropriations deadline, it sets up another potential standoff before Christmas and a GOP-dreaded omnibus measure that squeezes several necessary legislative items into one massive bill."

Sens. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., and Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., led the introduction of several pieces of legislation in the Senate, all focused on targeting different aspects of China's involvement in America, including at universities and in the U.S. agricultural sector.

""The CCP is the single greatest threat to America's national security and financial independence,"" Ricketts told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""A CCP-led world would mean coercion instead of choice, tyranny instead of liberty, and dictatorship instead of democracy. The only way to combat this threat is with a strong, strategic, all-of-government approach. These bills move us closer to that.""

"Georgia doctors speak out to challenge misinformation on state's abortion law, death of Amber Thurman",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-doctors-speak-out-challenge-misinformation-states-abortion-law-death-amber-thurman,2024-09-25T18:10:39Z,"EXCLUSIVE: Two Georgia lawmakers who are also doctors experienced in emergency medicine are speaking out against what they say is media ""fearmongering"" about the Peach State's abortion laws in light of recent reporting on the tragic deaths of two women from the state.

ProPublica's reporting on the death of Amber Nicole Thurman last week sparked controversy over Georgia's heartbeat law, which states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

Thurman died in Georgia after taking abortion pills and suffering complications. According to ProPublica reporting, doctors at Piedmont Henry Hospital waited a prolonged period of time before performing the necessary dilation and curettage (D&C) procedure to remove the dead fetus, which is not an abortion, out of reportedly being in fear of facing legal backlash due to the state's abortion law.

HARRIS CALLS FOR ELIMINATING FILIBUSTER TO PASS 'ROE' ABORTION BILL INTO FEDERAL LAW

But Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., and state Rep. Mark Newton don't believe the law had anything to do with Thurman's death, but rather the complications allegedly caused by the abortion pills, as doctors may have waited too long to intercede.

""We never deny a woman an abortion because it's going to harm her in some way. She will always be protected,"" McCormick, who previously served as emergency department head in a Navy deployment in Afghanistan, said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

""You have every right to an abortion, even with that heartbeat law,"" he continued. ""So, let's make that very clear right now. When they say there's no exceptions, there's never any law in any state where there's no exceptions. That doesn't exist. That's simply not the way it works. The mother's life is always protected. With that said, it doesn't mean it's easy to get an abortion just because you have a complication or because something goes wrong.""

Once a baby's heart has stopped, McCormick said, there are no restrictions on performing a D&C to ensure the safety of the mother.

NEW POLL INDICATES WHETHER HARRIS OR TRUMP HAS THE EDGE IN THIS KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE

""In my understanding, is, this baby was already in demise. There was no reason that it had anything to do with whether she could have a D&C or not. That's actually irrelevant to the baby's life because the baby's already gone,"" McCormick said. ""If the heartbeat stopped it's not about this law. Remember, it has nothing to do with this law at that point. It has everything to do with doing the best care for the woman.""

Newton, a board-certified emergency physician, added that there are complex decisions doctors face regarding the risks of surgery versus the risks of not performing it, especially in life-threatening emergencies.

""I do not think there's anything in Georgia's law, unless someone had a complete misunderstanding or just failed to be aware of what Georgia's law was, has nothing to do with the timing of the decision-making,"" Newton said. ""This situation in which the woman presented was clearly a medical or a life-threatening emergency""

Georgia's law should not affect the timing of medical decisions, he said, adding that cases involving septic shock due to complications from a miscarriage or abortion present high mortality risks, and physicians often have to make quick decisions to stabilize patients for surgery, which typically happens immediately in emergency situations.

Arizona Independent Senator Krysten Sinema criticized Vice President Kamala Harris after the presidential nominee voiced her support for eliminating the Senate filibuster in an effort to pass a law restoring abortio protections nationwide.

""To state the supremely obvious, eliminating the filibuster to codify Roe v Wade also enables a future Congress to ban all abortion nationwide,"" Sinema, who left the Democratic Party in 2022, wrote on X.

""What an absolutely terrible, shortsighted idea,"" she added.

JOE MANCHIN SAYS HE WON'T ENDORSE HARRIS OVER SUPPORT FOR ELIMINATION FILIBUSTER

Sen. Joe Manchin (I-W.V.), a strong supporter of the filibuster, echoed Sinema's comments, saying that the filibuster is the ""Holy Grail of democracy.""

""Shame on her,"" Manchin said at the Capitol, CNN reported. ""She knows the filibuster is the Holy Grail of democracy. It's the only thing that keeps us talking and working together. If she gets rid of that, then this would be the House on steroids.""

Sinema's sharp criticism came after Harris voiced her thoughts about ending the filibuster on Wisconsin Public Radio (WPR).

The filibuster is a Senate rule that allows a minority to block legislation pending a supermajority vote, so ending it would make it easier to pass laws related to abortion rights.

""I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe,"" Harris said during a WPR interview Tuesday. ""And get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do.""

In the interview Harris also said it was ""it is well within our reach"" to keep a Democratic Senate majority and ""take back the House.""

""I would also emphasize that while the presidential election is extremely important and dispositive of where we go moving forward, it also is about what we need to do to hold onto the Senate and win seats in the House,"" Harris said.

Harris, who has made abortion access a central issue in her campaign, said in 2022 that Congress needed to codify Roe v Wade into law and, ""if the filibuster gets in the way, the Senate needs to make an exception to get it done.""

""With just two more seats in the Senate, we can codify Roe v. Wade, we can put the protection of Roe into law,"" Harris said in September 2022. ""With two more seats in the United States Senate, we can pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Two more seats.""

""You know, our President, Joe Biden, he's been clear. He's kinda done with those archaic Senate rules that are standing in the way of those two issues,"" Harris said of the Senate filibuster in 2022. ""He's made that clear and has said that he will not allow that to obstruct those two issues. And, you know, for me, as vice president, I'm also president of the Senate.... I cannot wait to cast the deciding vote to break the filibuster on voting rights and reproductive rights. I cannot wait! Fifty-nine days.""

JOHN CORNYN FLEXES FUNDRAISING CHOPS AS BATTLE TO SUCCEED MITCH MCCONNELL RAMPS UP

Manchin has devoted his last several years to protecting the filibuster, which prevents most measures from proceeding to a vote if they cannot clear a procedural hurdle with 60 votes. He has previously described it as crucial to democracy and said if Democrats successfully did away with it, it would be ""the saddest day in the history of the United States of America.""

The West Virginia senator and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., both of whom decided not to seek re-election, were largely credited with preventing Democrats from taking down the filibuster with their slim majority in 2021. Both senators subsequently left the Democrat Party and registered as independents, despite still caucusing with Democrats in the Senate.

In a statement released on Tuesday, Manchin said, ""This threshold stabilizes our democracy, promotes bipartisan cooperation and protects our nation from partisan whiplash and dysfunction. I have always said: 'if you can't change your mind, you can't change anything' and I am hopeful that the Vice President remains open to doing just that.""

Manchin further specified to Fox News that he wouldn't be backing former President Trump in the election either. ""I'm not endorsing anyone,"" he said.

Dems look to force votes on emergency abortion as abortion pill deaths make headlines,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-look-force-votes-emergency-abortion-abortion-pill-deaths-make-headlines,2024-09-24T18:55:07Z,"Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich has the latest on the vice president's efforts to highlight the death of a Georgia woman who took an abortion pill on 'Special Report.'

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Senate President Pro tempore Patty Murray, D-Wash., and others revealed on Tuesday their plans to force votes on abortion-related bills in the wake of two pregnant women's deaths after taking abortion pills.

In floor remarks, Schumer said, ""What happened in Georgia is a direct example of how abortion bans continue to exacerbate the racial disparities in maternal death. Amber's doctors didn't perform the medical procedures they knew she needed because of Georgia's law.""

""It was the law overruling their good medical judgment. She went into septic shock and her heart stopped - all while doctors did everything except the medically-sound treatment she needed,"" he said, in reference to ProPublica's reporting on the deaths of Candi Miller and Amber Nicole Thurman.

Both of the women died in Georgia after taking abortion pills and suffering complications. In Thurman's case, according to ProPublica, doctors waited a prolonged period of time before performing the necessary dilation and curettage (D&C) procedure, which is not an abortion. Miller was found unresponsive by her family after suffering from the pill's complication.

""Today, as you heard from the leader, we're going to try and pass this resolution, and we're going to see if the Senate can come together with one voice and tell women, 'women, we want to put your health first,'"" Murray said at a press conference.

The Washington Democrat will attempt on Tuesday afternoon to advance her resolution to affirm ""the basic right to emergency health care, including abortion care"" for a vote by unanimous consent. However, this is expected to be objected to by a Republican.

ACCUSATIONS OF IMPROPER TAX BREAKS FLY IN CRUCIAL SENATE RACE: 'RULES DON'T APPLY'

The Democrats' plan to seek forced votes on abortion items comes in response to the deaths of Miller and Thurman, which have caused a dispute over what is to blame.

""Amber Thurman and Candi Miller are two Black mothers who lost their lives in Georgia due to the state's Draconian abortion ban. Women who could have survived if they had been able to get the health care they needed. These are the consequences of Trump abortion bans,"" Murray claimed earlier this month.

Roe v. Wade was overturned in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision in 2022, which turned the authority to determine limitations on abortion back to the states. Former President Trump's appointment of Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett is largely credited for giving conservative justices the majority and pushing the decision over the edge.

ENIGMATIC VOTER GROUP COULD SPLIT TICKET FOR TRUMP, DEM SENATE CANDIDATE IN ARIZONA

Other Democrats have echoed Murray's sentiment, including Vice President Kamala Harris, blaming the overturn of Roe v. Wade for the women's deaths.

Some conservative leaders and groups have pushed back on Democrats' characterization of the women's deaths, including top pro-life organization Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.

SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement, ""Pro-life laws are clear, yet politicians and the media are sowing confusion at women's expense. Across the nation, pro-life laws allow doctors to provide emergency care, and doctors who fail to provide necessary medical care should be held accountable.""

""Pro-abortion Democrats and the abortion industry fearmonger and exploit tragedies resulting from abortions themselves, like the deaths of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller - leaving women confused about the law and scared to get care in emergency situations. These lies have real consequences, and we urge pro-abortion Democrats to value women's safety over limitless abortion,"" she said.

During a Senate Finance Committee hearing on ""Threats to Reproductive Health Care,"" Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., questioned Dr. Christina Francis, an obstetrician and gynecologist, and CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, on the safety of the abortion pill.

""Obviously, we have recent cases of Candi Miller dying from a chemical abortion. FDA has changed the rules of late, to be able to say, 'don't give us information about consequences. Don't even report that. Don't turn it in.' You don't have to get to a doctor to be able to get access to a chemical abortions. There's been lots of conversations I've heard from my Democratic colleagues saying chemical abortions are as safe as Tylenol. Can you tell me a little bit more about chemical abortions?"" he asked.

""Incomplete abortion, where all of the tissue, from all of the fetal tissue and placental tissue don't pass after taking these drugs, occurs in 5 to 10 percent of women. That may sound like a small number, but when you look at the number of chemical abortions that are done in this country every year, that's a significant number of women that are experiencing this complication,"" Francis responded.

She further warned that abortion pills are not on par with Tylenol, remarking, ""These are not safe drugs, and women deserve to have accurate information about that."""
Harris calls for eliminating filibuster to pass 'Roe' abortion bill into federal law,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-calls-eliminating-filibuster-pass-roe-abortion-bill-federal-law,2024-09-24T17:49:14Z,"Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich has the latest on the vice president's efforts to highlight the death of a Georgia woman who took an abortion pill on 'Special Report.'

Vice President Kamala Harris said she backs eliminating the 60-vote filibuster requirement in order to reinstate Roe v. Wade, which would federalize abortion access nationwide, during a Wisconsin Public Radio (WPR) interview Tuesday.

The filibuster is a Senate rule that allows a minority to block legislation pending a supermajority vote, so ending it would make it easier to pass laws related to abortion rights.

""I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe,"" Harris said on the ""Wisconsin Today"" show. ""And get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do.""

YOUNG SWING STATE VOTERS DELIVER ADVICE FOR KAMALA HARRIS: 'THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE TRANSPARENCY'

The vice president's comments come amid her fourth campaign visit to the battleground state.

Harris also said in the WPR interview that, ""It is well within our reach"" to keep a Democratic Senate majorirty and ""take back the House.""

""I would also emphasize that while the presidential election is extremely important and dispositive of where we go moving forward, it also is about what we need to do to hold onto the Senate and win seats in the House,"" Harris said.

NEW POLL INDICATES WHETHER HARRIS OR TRUMP HAS THE EDGE IN THIS KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE

While Harris first said she would support ending the filibuster to reinstate Roe v. Wade era abortion protection in 2022, she has since made abortion a major issue in her Democratic bid for presidency this election cycle. She also supported ending the filibuster to pass the progressive Green New Deal climate legislation in 2019.

""With just two more seats in the Senate, we can codify Roe v. Wade, we can put the protections of Roe in law,"" Harris said in September 2022. ""With two more seats in the United States Senate, we can pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Two more seats.""

""You know, our President, Joe Biden, he's been clear. He's kinda done with those archaic Senate rules that are standing in the way of those two issues,"" Harris said of the Senate filibuster. ""He's made that clear and has said that he will not allow that to obstruct those two issues. And, you know, for me, as vice president, I'm also president of the Senate....

Josh Shapiro blasted for signing missile alongside Zelenskyy in Biden's hometown: 'Party of war',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/josh-shapiro-blasted-signing-missile-alongside-zelenskyy-bidens-hometown-party-war,2024-09-24T16:38:56Z,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy provides an update on the war in Ukraine to Fox News anchor Bret Baier on 'Special Report.'

Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was lambasted online after he took time to autograph a missile over the weekend that is potentially bound for Russian assets in the Ukraine war.

Shapiro, considered the runner-up to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, posted a video of him signing the missile at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP), in President Biden's hometown.

""We must all do our part in the fight for freedom - from the workers in Scranton who make Pennsylvania the arsenal of democracy to the brave Ukrainian soldiers protecting their country,"" Shapiro captioned his video.

""We stand with Ukraine in their just defense of their homeland in the face of Russian aggression.""

However, response from the right was brisk - with conservative commentator David Harris Jr. saying the situation showed ""Democrats are now the party of war, and they're proud of it. Sad.""

""The U.S. should be negotiating peace not fueling war,"" added Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.

""I am 100% against this and so are most Americans,"" she wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. ""The U.S. is funding the Ukraine Gov at $1 billion/month to keep it running and funding most of the war by providing weapons, ammo, and equipment.""

ECONOMY, BORDER, ABORTION DIVIDE BIDEN'S HOMETOWN AFTER NATIVE SON'S FIRST TERM

Other critics contrasted the autograph with Shapiro's criticisms of former President Trump.

""Zelenskyy just essentially endorsed Kamala in Pennsylvania while with Josh Shapiro autographing ammunition,"" wrote Philadelphia commentator Joey Mannarino on X.

""He called Trump and Vance 'radical'. He also said Trump has no idea how to end the war. How is this not some sort of violation from a man who we are funding?""

Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa. - locked in a tight re-election race with businessman David McCormick - was seen shaking hands with Zelenskyy as Shapiro wrote a message on the missile.

Other critics pointed out that chaos was erupting elsewhere in the commonwealth while Shapiro, Zelenskyy and Casey were touring the ordnance plant.

SCRANTON OPENS UP ABOUT 'BIDENOMICS'

Philadelphia native Jack Posobiec, a right-wing commentator and senior editor at Human Events, shared video of that city enveloped in illegal ""car meets"" and the responding police activity.

At least three people were arrested and a police official told WCAU they have photos of numerous others who took over Center City, set off fireworks, did donuts with their cars, injured police officers and caused mayhem into the wee hours of the morning, disrupting neighbors.

Video posted to X also appeared to show an Apple Store in Center City being looted Monday night.

""This was going on in Philadelphia while Josh Shapiro was taking selfies with artillery shells and Zelensky,"" Posobiec said on X.

In an official statement, Shapiro said Pennsylvania is the ""birthplace of American freedom"" and Pennsylvanians therefore stand with Ukrainians in their fight against ""naked aggression.""

He also noted Pennsylvania will sign an agreement with the Ukrainian state of Zaporizhizhia that will ""foster collaboration for years to come.""

In regard to the agreement, Pennsylvania Secretary of Community & Economic Development Rick Siger told WHTM that the pact will ""help support the future economic revitalization of Ukraine, while boosting our economy and creating jobs for Pennsylvanians.""

DAVID MARCUS: It's been 25 years since 'The West Wing' ruined American politics,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/its-been-25-years-since-the-west-wing-ruined-american-politics,2024-09-24T14:59:03Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

On Monday, the cast of the TV show ""The West Wing"" appeared at the White House, with President Joe Biden posting a photo saying ""Always a pleasure welcoming President Bartlet and his staff back to the White House.""

It was like seeing two fake presidents at once, and neither the fast-fading current commander in chief nor the make-believe one have been anything but terrible for American politics.

In life there are many things that are fun, or tasty, or stimulating that really aren't very good for you. It is now clear that ""The West Wing,"" Aaron Sorkin's seminal drama set in the White House was one of them.

ROB LOWE COMPARES FILMING 'THE WEST WING' TO A 'SUPER UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIP'

What Sorkin, and a supremely talented cast, tapped into back in 1999 was a new way of looking at politics in which the two major parties were no longer seeking common goals through different approaches and policies.

Too many of us are still stuck in Aaron Sorkin's black and white world of politics, still enemies of our own fellow citizens.

Instead, each party was first and foremost a team, one of which represented moral goodness and progress, and almost always won, while the other was regressive, and even sometimes tinted with evil.

The pretend Democratic president, Jeb Bartlet and his tireless, plucky staff are unquestionably the heroes of the show, and in a way, were like a shadow presidency during the rocky eight years of George W. Bush, which it more or less coincided with.

This was how it was supposed to be, with the good, decent people in charge, not the Donald Rumsfelds or Dick Cheneys of the world, and miraculously, unlike real life, there was usually a solution to the crisis or problem if only the Bartlett administration did the right thing and stuck to its moral, neoliberal worldview.

Even lying could be justified for these fictional high priests of the Democratic Party.

In an incredibly prescient example of this, Good 'Ol Jeb Bartlet, it turned out, was hiding the fact that he had multiple sclerosis from the American people during his first election. Season two ends with him being asked if he will run again, despite the lie. Sound familiar?

Well, he ran again. And won.

BIDEN ADDRESSES UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY FOR LAST TIME AS DICTATORS, DESPOTS COME TO NEW YORK

Yes, he accepted Congressional censure and there were other mild punishments, but the clear message from Sorkin was that telling the truth is irrelevant, it only matters that the good guys win and the bad guys lose.

The political realignment we have seen this century, with the Democrats lurching to the left, especially on social issues, is in part a product of this quasi-religious view of the parties. New orthodoxies emerged around gay marriage and trans treatment for kids, abortion, became something to be celebrated, not to be kept safe, legal and, rare.

Two years before ""The West Wing"" launched, in 1997, the movie ""Wag the Dog"" came out, written by Hillary Henken as well as David Mamet, in whose shadow Sorkin has long labored. What is telling in this behind the scenes look at covering up an election scandal, starring Robert De Niro, is we are never told which party the president he works for represents. It's irrelevant.

In a way, ""Wag the Dog"" is far more realistic than ""The West Wing"" in this respect. Political operatives are driven by a desire to win. That's also what they are paid for. Their job is to attain power, not ""do what's right,"" even if they believe the two are one and the same.

Today, for many Americans, politics is not about what is effective, but is more like an identity.

Most of the voters I have met across the country couldn't even dream of voting for someone of the opposite party, the mere notion hits them on an emotional level.

One could argue that the West Wing was a 7-year ad for the eventual presidency of Barack Obama, the series even ended with the election of the first non-white president. Since then, especially with the arrival of Donald Trump on the scene, this personal and emotional relationship with politics and politicians has persisted.

But in my conversations with voters this year, unlike the two previous presidential cycles, I see more cracks in the West Wing worldview of the political universe.

In Ohio, recently, I met Nick, a knife maker in his 30s from Maine on his way to a convention in Indiana. He told me ""We agree on 85 percent of things, but instead of doing anything about them, we focus on the other things."" He's far from the only American I've met who just wants nothing to do with party membership being a big, intimate part of his life.

The last actual presidential candidate that Nick voted for was John McCain, in 2008, just two years after the West Wing went off the air, now he always writes in Willie Hugh Nelson.

If either of our parties can move beyond the destructive us vs them politics of the last 25 years, exemplified by the West Wing, there are voters who might be interested again, voters who can win elections.

But for now, too many of us are still stuck in Sorkin's black and white world of politics, still enemies of our own fellow citizens, and still frustrated that everything doesn't simply work out how it should because of our high morals and good intentions."
CNN data guru says Harris is 'struggling among voters of color' in the Sun Belt: 'Really interesting',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-data-guru-says-harris-struggling-among-voters-color-sun-belt-really-interesting,2024-09-24T10:12:27Z,"CNN's data reporter Harry Enten told host Jake Tapper Vice President Kamala Harris is struggling with Black and Hispanic voters compared to former President Biden in 2020.

Vice President Kamala Harris is ""struggling"" with Black and Latino voters in the Sun Belt compared to former President Biden in 2020, CNN data guru Harry Enten said Monday.

On ""The Lead with Jake Tapper,"" CNN's senior political data reporter noted that, according to NYT/Sienna polling, former President Trump has a slight advantage over Harris in the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, the former two of which Biden won.

What's more, Harris is trailing Biden's numbers with Hispanic and Black voters in the region.

""I think this is really interesting,"" Enten said, showing a breakdown of support for Harris today compared to support for Biden in 2020 in the three Sun Belt states.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS CLOSES GAP WITH TRUMP IN SUN BELT STATES

""Hispanic voters, four years ago, Joe Biden won that vote 66% in the Sun Belt,"" he said. ""Look at where we are now, Kamala Harris at just 52%, so Kamala Harris struggling among Hispanic voters. Donald Trump doing considerably better than he did 4 years ago.""

""How about Black voters?"" Enten continued. ""Kamala Harris, again, leading here by a significant margin, right? She's getting 83% of that vote, but that is significantly short of Joe Biden's 92%.""

""So the bottom line is, in the Sun Belt, which is much more diverse than the northern battleground states up in the Great Lakes, Kamala Harris is struggling among voters of color,"" he added.

Enten also highlighted how, among Sun Belt voters, 31% are most concerned about the economy/inflation, 16% about immigration, and another 16% about abortion. He observed that the first two of these issues are ""great for Donald Trump.""

FOX NEWS POLL: 87% CONSIDER SITUATION AT SOUTHERN BORDER A PROBLEM

Tapper asked what would happen if Harris maintained her hold on the less diverse blue wall states up north while Trump maintains his advantage in the Sun Belt.

""Oh my goodness, look how close this race is. 276 electoral votes to Donald Trump's 262 because she carries these Great Lake battleground states, even if she loses in North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona,"" Enten replied. ""But the bottom line is this, Mr. Tapper, this race is way too close to call based upon the polling that I currently see."""
Piling on: A tsunami of anti-Trump pieces offer a stark contrast with Kamala's upbeat coverage,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/piling-on-tsunami-anti-trump-pieces-offer-stark-contrast-kamalas-upbeat-coverage,2024-09-24T07:11:51Z,"Fox News national correspondent Griff Jenkins discusses the impact of former President Trump and vice presidential candidate JD Vance's efforts to 'create' focus on migrant crisis in Springfield, Ohio.

In just the last few days, there's been a tremendous media pile-on against Donald Trump.

Whether you think that's warranted or not - much of it is based on his own words - we are back to a Trump-centric universe. Kamala Harris is making little or no news, despite such spectacles as the Oprah show, and Trump, as usual, is back to driving each news cycle.

I have been telling people since 2015 that negative stories are good for Trump because the ensuing debate then unfolds on his terms. In fact, he deliberately uses provocative or inflammatory language as catnip for the press, knowing that even if he's denounced that will drive coverage for at least a couple of days.

The vice president generally gets such favorable press that many people assume she's got this race wrapped up. When an NBC poll shows her leading Trump by 5 points, she's said to have the momentum, although national surveys are basically meaningless.

SCANDALS, FAILED ASSASSINATIONS AND POLITICAL RHETORIC: BOTH SIDES GO HIGH AND LOW

And a New York Times poll shows Trump leading in the key Sunbelt states that the Harris camp hoped to pick off. He has a 5-point lead in Arizona, a 4-point lead in Georgia and a 2-point lead in North Carolina.

That's within striking distance and in some cases a statistical tie. But the Times piece says that many voters believe Trump ""improved their lives when he was president - and worry that a Kamala Harris White House would not.""

That's the thing. Trump's already had four years in the Oval Office. And while there was no shortage of chaos - two impeachments, January 6th - plenty of folks remember a strong economy. And they want more details about whether Harris would take the country in a more liberal direction, even as she puts her rhetorical focus on the middle class and small business (as well as abortion rights).

Plus, it's hard to run as a change candidate when you're part of the incumbent administration and large numbers see the country as being on the wrong track.

Virtually everyone in America has a set-in-stone view of the former president. His MAGA loyalists have been with him since he said in his first campaign that ""I could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue"" and not lose support.

That takes on a more ominous tone now that Trump has barely escaped assassinaton twice - and, after the Florida golf course attempt, blamed the attacks on ""danger to democracy"" language by Harris and the Democrats. Many in the media have made Hitler comparisons, and the truth is both sides have used incendiary language.

Sometimes Trump just resorts to trolling - ""I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!"" - to get chattering classes chattering, even though he much wanted her endorsement.

Let's look at the coverage in recent days:

TRUMP INDICATES HE WON'T MAKE ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN 2028 IF UNSUCCESSFUL THIS TIME

The Washington Post describes ""Donald Trump's imaginary world,"" where ""Americans can't venture out to buy a loaf of bread without getting shot, mugged or raped. Immigrants in a small Ohio town eat their neighbors' cats and dogs. World War III and economic collapse are just around the corner. And kids head off to school only to return at day's end having undergone gender reassignment surgery.

""The former president's imaginary world is a dark, dystopian place, described by Trump in his rallies, interviews, social media posts and debate appearances to paint an alarming picture of America under the Biden-Harris administration.

It is a distorted, warped and, at times, absurdist portrait of a nation where the insurrectionists who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to deadly effect were merely peaceful protesters, and where unlucky boaters are faced with the unappealing choice between electrocution or a shark attack. His extreme caricatures also serve as another way for Trump to traffic in lies and misinformation, using an alternate reality of his own making to create an often terrifying -- and, he seems to hope -- politically devastating landscape for his political opponents.""

Trump also accused Tim Walz speaking positively about ""execution"" after a baby is born-though Washington Post's Fact-Checker says the governor never said that, and that fewer than 1 percent of abortions are performed after 21 weeks of pregnancy.

In the New York Times, conservative writer David French uses self-described ""Black Nazi"" and pro-slavery GOP candidate Mark Robinson, who's running for North Carolina governor, to slam Trump.

French says he's endorsed Kamala ""because I believe that a Harris victory gives Republicans 'a chance to build something decent' from the ruins of a Trump defeat.

""After enduring weeks of lies about the Haitian immigrants who live in Springfield, Ohio, and an entire news cycle devoted to covering Trump's connection with Laura Loomer, one of the most overtly racist figures in MAGA America (she once spoke at a conference of white nationalists and declared, 'I consider myself to be a white advocate, and I openly campaigned for the United States Congress as a white advocate') -- I'm hardening my view. Trump loses now or the Republicans are lost for a generation. Maybe more...

""This has changed the composition of the party. While many decent people remain -- and represent the hope for future reform -- Trump's Republican Party has become a magnet for eccentrics and conspiracy theorists of all stripes.""

64 DAYS: KAMALA HARRIS HAS YET TO DO FORMAL PRESS CONFERENCE SINCE EMERGING AS DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE

Back at the Washington Post, the Trump campaign is described as imploding:

""In a single 24-hour span at the end of last month, for example, he amplified a crude joke about Harris performing a sex act; falsely accused her of staging a coup against President Joe Biden; promoted tributes to the QAnon conspiracy theory; hawked digital trading cards; and became embroiled in a public feud with staff and officials at Arlington National Cemetery.

""The Swift attack was especially concerning to Trump's advisers, who are worried about attracting female voters.""

And there are his constant tributes to ""the late, great Hannibal Lecter,"" the movie serial killer.

""Some campaign advisers are eager to move on from Trump's and Vance's unverifiable claims about Haitian immigrants eating cats and dogs -- a potentially detrimental news cycle that has stretched into its second week -- but also acknowledge that Trump rarely retreats, even when it might be politically advantageous to do so.""

The piece describes Corey Lewandowski, Trump's first campaign manager, as playing a divisive role, to which he responded: ""Same old nonsense that has already been written by the Washington Compost. Your obsession with my volunteer efforts just demonstrates your continued hatred of Donald J. Trump and prove you will stop at nothing to try and prevent him from becoming the 47th President of the United States.""

Post op-ed columnist Ruth Marcus says Trump is ""crossing a hazardous new line"" by saying it will be the fault of Jewish people, insufficiently grateful for his pro-Israel policies, if he loses the election:

""They threaten, if he does lose, and especially if he continues this line of argument, to unleash the fury of disappointed Trump supporters on Jews. It does not take much to imagine the backlash, and the violence, that could ensue. We Jews know something about being scapegoated...

Trump has long had an unnerving habit of bringing up the fact of people's Judaism -- sometimes mistakenly -- on occasions when it seems irrelevant at best. 'Who would have thought my top guys are Jews?' Trump observed to aides Jared Kushner, Stephen Miller and Jason Miller aboard Air Force One, according to the New York Times's Maggie Haberman. (In fact, Jason Miller, as he told Trump, is not Jewish.)""

By contrast, a Times piece on Harris' record as a prosecutor soberly finds ""a coherent record that is for the most part consistent. Ms. Harris seemed particularly focused on protecting the most vulnerable victims by cracking down on violent offenders while seeking alternatives to incarceration for less serious criminals.""

It's not that each individual story isn't based on reported facts. But the tsunami of anti-Trump pieces is a reminder of how relentlessly negative his coverage is - his supporters just don't trust the media - when compared to the general praise for the Democratic nominee.

Gun rights, medical marijuana use, regulation of e-cigarettes and gender transition medical procedures for minors are just a few of the issues awaiting the Supreme Court when it comes back to work from its summer recess two weeks from today.

Last term, the court decided a series of politically charged cases like former President Trump's presidential immunity case, a challenge to the government's regulation of the abortion pill and free speech in the digital age.

The high court will kick off the 2024 term on Oct. 7 as it also navigates pressure from Democratic lawmakers for Congress to impose a new code of ethics and term limits.

Here are some cases to watch:

LEGAL EXPERTS WARN THAT LATEST SUPREME COURT LEAKS ARE 'ENORMOUSLY DESTRUCTIVE'

In a challenge to the Biden administration's regulation on so-called ""ghost guns,"" the Supreme Court will decide whether the federal rule is constitutional.

The rule in question was issued in 2022 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to regulate ""buy build shoot"" kits that are available online or in stores that allow any individual to assemble a working firearm without a background check or the usual serial numbers required by the federal government.

The Biden administration argued the rule is necessary to respond to rising numbers of untraceable guns. The Justice Department had argued in court that local law enforcement agencies seized more than 19,000 ghost guns at crime scenes in 2021, a more than tenfold increase in just five years.

However, gun rights groups say the rule is ""unconstitutional and abusive.""

In this case, a truck driver, Douglas Horn is suing a medical marijuana company after he took one of its CBD products for chronic pain.

But after he failed a drug test and lost his job, he sued the company using the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) - a federal statute used to fight organized crime. The justices will decide whether Horn can continue his suit.

ALASKA MAN ARRESTED FOR THREATS AGAINST 6 SUPREME COURT JUSTICES

In this case, two veterans sued after they were repeatedly denied medical care for post-traumatic stress disorder after the Department of Veteran's Affairs said they did not qualify for care. The case could expand benefits for thousands of veterans.

This case will decide whether to allow the FDA to deny approval for fruit-flavored e-cigarettes. The FDA asked the high court to overturn a ruling that overruled the agency's denial, warning that the decision has ""far-reaching consequences for public health.""

The agency has authorized the marketing of four e-cigarette products in the U.S., including the first menthol-flavored vaping product. But the FDA has routinely denied applications for fruit-flavored products, claiming the risks of addicting children outweigh any benefits for the rest of the population.

This case will review the Biden administration's ""equal protection"" challenge to Tennessee's ban on puberty blockers and transgender surgeries for minors.

APACHE TRIBE TAKES FIGHT WITH FEDS OVER SACRED LAND TO SUPREME COURT

Judge temporarily halts Tennessee law banning adults from helping minors get abortion without parental consent,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-temporarily-halts-tennessee-law-banning-adults-from-helping-minors-get-abortion-without-parental-consent,2024-09-23T05:45:05Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here.

A federal judge temporarily blocked Tennessee's law that prohibits adults from aiding minors in obtaining abortions without parental approval.

U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger said in a Friday ruling that the state cannot ""make it a crime to communicate freely"" about legal abortion options even in a state that bans abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions.

The law will now be placed on hold as the case moves through court.

""The Tennessee General Assembly apparently determined that, when the topic at hand is 'abortion trafficking,' the best interests of the pregnant child are not merely a secondary consideration, but unworthy of particularized consideration at all,"" Trauger wrote.

TENNESSEE SUED OVER LAW BANNING ADULTS FROM HELPING MINORS GET ABORTIONS WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Tennessee's Republican-controlled Legislature passed legislation that was then signed by GOP Gov. Bill Lee making it illegal for an adult who ""intentionally recruits, harbors, or transports"" a pregnant minor within the state to obtain an abortion without consent from the child's parents.

Anyone convicted of breaking the law would be charged with a Class A misdemeanor, which requires nearly one year in jail. The law does not include exemptions for minors who may have been raped by their parents, but a biological father who raped his daughter and caused her pregnancy cannot pursue civil action.

The Tennessee law, which took effect July 1, mimicked Idaho's ""abortion trafficking"" law that was enacted last year, the first state to enact such legislation. But a federal judge has since temporarily blocked Idaho's law as the case moves through court.

Shortly before Tennessee's law was set to take effect, Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn and Nashville attorney Rachel Welty filed a lawsuit challenging the statute on the second anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's June 24, 2022, decision overturning Roe v. Wade, returning the power to make laws regarding abortion back to the states.

TRUMP MAKES PLAY FOR WOMEN'S VOTE, VOWS TO ENSURE 'POWERFUL EXCEPTIONS' FOR ABORTION

Trauger's ruling sided with the argument from Welty and Behn that the law was ""unconstitutionally vague,"" particularly pointing out that the word ""recruits"" is undefined in the law.

The judge also raised concerns about the First Amendment restrictions that she argues the law would impose.

""The freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment is not simply a special protection that the Constitution grants to a few, high-profile speakers so that those speakers can hear themselves talk; it is a protection available to everyone, for the interconnected benefit of everyone, because messages do not gain their fullest power by being uttered, but by being spread,"" Trauger wrote.

Behn called Friday's ruling a ""monumental victory"" for free speech and the fight for abortion access.

""This ruling doesn't just protect Tennesseans -- it safeguards the freedom to discuss abortion care across state lines, ensuring that we can continue to offer support, share accurate information, and stand up for the rights of those seeking essential health care everywhere,"" she told The Associated Press.

Abortions are banned in Tennessee at all stages of pregnancy, with exemptions in cases of molar pregnancies, ectopic pregnancies or to save the life of the mother. Doctors must use their ""reasonable medical"" judgment in determining whether performing an abortion can save the life of the mother or prevent major injury.

A group of women is currently suing in a separate case to clarify the state's abortion ban."
Trump indicates he won't make another presidential run in 2028 if unsuccessful this time,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-indicates-wont-make-another-presidential-run-2028-unsuccessful-this-time,2024-09-22T23:42:31Z,"Nationally syndicated political reporter Salena Zito discusses Donald Trump and Kamala Harris' ongoing fight for Pennsylvania voters.

Former President Trump indicated during an interview Sunday that he would not make a run for the Oval Office in 2028 if his current bid falls short in November.

Trump was a guest on Sinclair Broadcast Group's ""Full Measure,"" hosted by Sharyl Attkisson, which aired Sunday morning.

At the end of the interview, Attkisson asked Trump if he was not successful in his bid for president in November, could he see himself running again in four years?

""No, I don't. No, I don't. I think that that will be, that will be it. I don't see that at all,"" the former president answered. ""I think that hopefully we're gonna be successful.""

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: THE EDGE IS CLEAR ON THIS KEY ISSUE

Trump, 78, is on his third run for president, having beaten Hillary Clinton for the Commander in Chief seat in 2016, and losing to President Biden in 2020. He now faces Vice President Kamala Harris for a second, four-year term in office.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the Trump campaign for clarification on the former president's comments. The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on Trump's statements.

With over six weeks to go until Election Day on Nov. 5, and early voting and absentee balloting underway in a growing number of states, a number of public opinion polls agree that the race in key battleground states that will decide the 2024 Presidential election is within the margin-of-error.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS IN THE HARRIS-TRUMP 2024 SHOWDOWN

The polls also show Harris has a healthy advantage among voters when it comes to the issue of abortion, while Trump has an equally large margin in dealing with the border and immigration.

When it comes to the economy, the polls show the issue remains the top issue on the minds of American voters as they prepare to cast their ballot in November.

A Fox News national poll also in the field entirely post-debate spotlighted that 39% of voters surveyed said the economy was their most pressing issue, far ahead of immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues tested were in single digits.

Trump spoke with Attkisson about several issues, including his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which he said he did ""an amazing job"" handling.

""I never got the credit for it. Remember that more people died under Biden-Harris than died under Trump,"" he said. ""And they had a much easier time because when it came in here, nobody knew what it was. It came from the Wuhan labs, which I always said. But nobody really knew what it was, where it came from...nothing. They knew nothing, and we got hit.""

Trump also said he got credit with the military and knocking out ISIS, saying, ""we rebuilt the military.""

TRUMP VOWS TOUGH APPROACH TO SANCTUARY POLICIES

After speaking about his accomplishments, Attkisson asked him what he does to stay healthy.

""I used to play golf a little bit...but it seems to be quite a dangerous sport, in retrospect,"" Trump said, referring to a recent incident in which a man hid in the bushes with a gun before being shot at by Secret Service and fleeing. The man was later arrested, and the matter is being handled as an assassination attempt on Trump.

""I try and eat properly,"" Trump told Attkisson, getting back to her question.

The host told Trump she though he ate hamburgers and drank soda, which the former president acknowledged he did.

""But proper hamburgers,"" he said. ""But I like, perhaps, all the wrong food. But then I say, 'does anybody know what the right food is?""

He continued, saying people lectured him for years on what to eat, and they're gone because they passed away.

""And here I am,"" Trump said. ""So, I'm not sure I wanna make too many changes.""

DAVID MARCUS: Project 2025 lies make it to Hershey before the truth can get its pants on,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-democrat-media-lies-about-project-2025-inundating-country,2024-09-22T15:42:08Z,"HERSHEY, Pa. - I hear it everywhere I go, in every corner and crevice of the country that I have covered during this election, menacing talk about Project 2025. Never mind that Donald Trump has nothing to do with Project 2025, never mind that the canard that he does is a coordinated lie between Democrats and the media, the fact is, it is working.

In this town of 15,000 known for chocolate, I met Mark and his service dog. He is retired military and told me, ""Nobody does research, people just believe what they are told,"" adding, ""I'm Gen X, we had actual libraries, we had to look things up with the the...""

TRUMP, HARRIS LOCKED IN TIGHT RACE IN CRITICAL BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA, POLLS FIND

""Dewey Decimal System?"" I chimed in.

""Exactly, thanks,"" he replied. ""Now people just accept whatever Google spits out at them.""

Mark might have a point, because typically, in fact almost always, voters who bring up Project 2025 to me have no real understanding of what it is or what's in it.

It may be the case that, aside from a handful of wonks at the Heritage Foundation where this Frankenstein monster of a policy project came to life, nobody on earth knows what's in it.

""I've heard it's like a list of rights that Republicans want to take away, like on abortion,"" a woman in Virginia recently told me. When I pressed for specifics, she admitted she was only relying on generalizations from the Democrats and the media.

But, far more important than what is or isn't in the 900-page policy tome, which is mostly a set of Human Resources guidelines, is that it has absolutely, positively nothing to do with Donald Trump and never has.

At every turn since Project 2025 became a major campaign issue, Trump has disavowed it, said it will have no impact on his presidency, and frankly, that he doesn't even know what is in it.

So on what basis do Democrats and their feckless media allies continue to try to tie this albatross around The Donald's neck? Only through the worst kind of half-truths and prevarications our democratic system has to offer.

JD Vance wrote the forward! Trump's critics insist, and he did, in 2022, not only long before anyone thought he would be Trump's vice presidential nominee, but at a time when many people thought Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, not Trump, would be the presidential nominee.

Then we are told that dozens of former Trump officials are involved with the project, and yes, Heritage is a think tank, it doesn't have a college draft or use Indeed dot com to hire, it is staffed with, gasp, former political policy officials.

You can't shake a stick at liberal think tanks like Center for American Progress without pointing at a former Obama or Biden staffers, but nobody says Kamala Harris is planning to hand over the keys of the federal government to them.

No, Trump's alleged connection and fealty to Project 2025 is simply a flat out lie, and probably the best argument why he should not accept a second debate with Kamala Harris, especially on CNN which pushes this particular prevarication daily.

In the first debate, when Harris brought up the nonsense claims about Trump and the project, neither of the moderators broke in to fact-check it, as they did over and over and over with Trump. It is almost as though the ABC anchors were in on it.

This desperate and constant lying about Project 2025 from the Harris campaign and the other Harris campaign known as the liberal press has come about precisely because Harris is incapable of making a positive argument for her candidacy.

Fighting price gouging fell flat. On a host of issues, she refuses to say where she stands, except that it is closer to the center than where she used to stand, and she refuses to do serious interviews to clarify her positions.

So, what does that leave in the campaign arsenal? Basically, vice presidential nominee Tim Walz fixing old cars while lying about Project 2025.

Sadly, from what I can tell in my travels and conversations it is working, something that rankles Gen X Joe who is voting for Trump. ""It's just like the white supremacists, and everything else,"" he told me, ""Trump denounces it over and over and it's never good enough.""

It was Mark Twain who said that a lie travels the world before the truth can get its pants on. If so, the Project 2025 is the heart print boxers shorts of the 2024 election, and time is running out to clothe the issue in the truth."
"Trump makes play for women's vote, vows to ensure 'powerful exceptions' for abortion",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-makes-play-womens-vote-vows-ensure-powerful-exceptions-abortion-place,2024-09-21T16:35:18Z,"Fox News chief Washington correspondent Mike Emanuel has the latest on the revised abortion messaging, on 'Special Report.'

Former President Trump vowed to ""protect women at a level never seen before"" if elected, and to ensure that ""powerful exceptions"" for abortion are adopted across the nation, in a social media post early Saturday.

Trump, in the lengthy late-night missive to his Truth Social in all capitalized letters, said ""women are poorer than they were four years ago, are less healthy than they were four years ago, are less safe on the streets than they were four years ago, are more depressed and unhappy than they were four years ago, and are less optimistic and confident in the future than they were four years ago.""

TRUMP VOWS HE 'WILL NOT BLOCK' ABORTION PILLS OR MEDICATION IF ELECTED, SAYS HE BELIEVES IN 'EXCEPTIONS'

""I will fix all of that, and fast, and at long last this national nightmare will be over,"" he said. ""Women will be happy, healthy, confident and free!""

Polls have consistently shown Trump running strongly, against Vice President Kamala Harris in most demographic groups, but struggling with women. Much of that has been attributed to the fact that the three justices he picked for the Supreme Court helped overturn Roe v. Wade, which had enshrined abortion protections under federal law.

In his post, Trump wrote that women ""will no longer be thinking about abortion, because it is now where it always had to be, with the states, and a vote of the people -- and with powerful exceptions, like those that Ronald Reagan insisted on for rape, incest, and the life of the mother -- but not allowing for Democrat demanded late term abortion in the 7th, 8th, or 9th month, or even execution of a baby after birth.""

""I will protect women at a level never seen before,"" he said. ""They will finally be healthy, hopeful, safe and secure.""

Trump added: ""Their lives will be happy, beautiful, and great again!""

The former president's play for the female vote comes after Vice President Harris campaigned in Georgia, delivering a speech about the consequences of, what her campaign calls ""extreme Trump Abortion Bans.""

""After Vice President Harris spent the week speaking about the consequences of Trump Abortion Bans and the stakes of this election for women's lives, Donald Trump snapped -- taking to his phone late at night to rant and rave about women,"" Harris-Walz 2024 Spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in response to Trump's Truth Social post. ""After ripping away our reproductive freedom, now he's trying to tell us how to think.""

Chitika said ""Trump thinks he can control women -- he's wrong.""

The Harris campaign said he is ""terrified that women across the country will vote like our lives and freedoms depend on it, because they do.""

""Women aren't stupid. We see Trump's Project 2025 agenda for what it is: an extreme plan to ban abortion nationwide and threaten access to IVF and birth control,"" Chitika said. ""We'll vote like it this November.""

JD VANCE VOWS TRUMP WOULD NOT IMPOSE FEDERAL ABORTION BAN, VETO IT IF COMES ACROSS DESK

But Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital that Harris and President Joe Biden have put women's lives in danger, and noted the names of women who have been killed by illegal immigrants.

""President Trump is right. Kamala may want to be the first woman president, but she's made the lives of women worse -- more dangerous and more unaffordable,"" Leavitt said. ""If Kamala cared about protecting women, she would close the border and stop allowing rapists and murderers to flow into our country to prey on young women and girls. Kamala has never said the names of Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nunguaray, and Rachel Morin. President Trump has honored their lives and consoled their grieving families.""

Leavitt added: ""If women want safety, security and prosperity for our families, there's only one option on the ballot -- President Trump.""

As for Project 2025, a blueprint for a Republican administration crafted by the Heritage Foundation, Leavitt repeated Trump's assertion that he did not commission it and has no plans to implement it if elected.

""President Trump has repeatedly said he has nothing to do with Project 2025,"" Leavitt said, adding that ""Kamala's campaign is lying because they are losing.""

Harris continues to claim that Trump will install a national abortion ban that would allow for no exceptions, despite Trump repeatedly saying that he would never support a national abortion ban, and believes in exceptions for abortion, including rape, incest, and life of the mother.

Harris has refused to say whether she supports any abortion restrictions up to birth.

Trump has vowed that he ""will not block"" abortion pills or abortion medication for women, should he be elected president."
Russia pushes sex-at-work scheme as population crisis escalates,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-pushes-sex-at-work-scheme-population-crisis-escalates,2024-09-21T13:24:10Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The Kremlin's top doctor this week encouraged all Russians to engage in a ""sex-at-work"" scheme in a move to back President Vladimir Putin's attempts to counter a growing population crisis.

Despite cash incentives, tax breaks, a nationwide push to discourage abortions and Putin's years-long attempt to encourage procreation across the country, Russia saw its lowest birth rate in the last quarter-century for the first six months of 2024, reports said following UN findings on worldwide population rates.

Speaking during a Eurasian Women's Forum on Wednesday, Putin encouraged women's role in the workplace, but he also reiterated his push for higher birthrates.

""Proper conditions are being created for women to succeed professionally while remaining guardians of the hearth and lynchpins of large families with many children,"" he said, according to report by Newsweek.

The Kremlin chief reportedly said that women can cope with the load of being both a career-woman and a mother because they ""possess a secret that men are unable to fathom.""

When pressed by a female reporter about when women are supposed to find the time to manage a family, Russia's Health minister Dr. Yevgeny Shestopalov said, ""Being very busy at work is not a valid reason, but a lame excuse.""

""There are people who work 12 to 14 hours - when do they make babies?"" Shestopalov was asked, according to a report by Metro.

""You can engage in procreation during breaks,"" he replied before adding, ""Life flies by too quickly.""

Female Russian lawmakers, including politicians Anna Kuznetsova and Zhanna Ryabtseva joined in on the push by encouraging women to maximize their childbearing years by starting families once they turn 18.

One Russian Member of Parliament, Tatyana Butskaya, even encouraged employers to monitor the birth rates of their female staff members, reported Sky News Australia.

Women in Moscow between the ages of 18 and 40 are also being encouraged to receive fertility testing.

""This new push for more Russian babies is consistent with the Russian government's previous initiatives to improve demographics and increase the size of the future workforce,"" former DIA intelligence officer and author of ""Putin's Playbook,"" Rebekah Koffler, told Fox News Digital. ""While the Kremlin portrays Russia's declining birth rates in Russia as 'disastrous,' in reality Russia's demographics is not much different from those of most industrial countries.""

The UN estimates that Russia's population, which currently sits around 140.8 million, will fall by 10 million by 2054.

With just over six weeks to go until Election Day on Nov. 5 and early voting and absentee balloting underway in a growing number of states, a slew of public opinion polls agree on a couple of key points.

One - the race in the key battlegrounds that will decide the 2024 White House election between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump is within the margin-of-error.

Three - the economy remains the top issue on the minds of American voters as they prepare to cast their ballot in the presidential election.

""The economy tops voters' minds,"" reads the headline from a new AP/NORC national poll, which was conducted entirely after last week's first and potentially only debate between the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees.

Nearly eight in ten questioned in the survey said the economy was one of their top issues, far ahead of everything else.

A Fox News national poll also in the field entirely post-debate spotlighted that 39% of voters surveyed said the economy was their most pressing issue, far ahead of immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues tested were in single digits.

The economy reigns supreme in pretty much every other survey.

While the nation's economic recovery from the pandemic-inflicted recession continues, inflation remains a leading concern among Americans.

""An increasing number say grocery prices and housing costs are tough for their family,"" the Fox News poll notes.

When it comes to which presidential candidate can better handle the economy, Trump continues to have the edge - but his margins over Harris differ dramatically depending on the poll.

The former president's up 13 points over the vice president in a post-debate survey from the New York Times and Siena College, and favored by 7 points in an ABC News Ipsos survey also conducted after the showdown.

But Trump's advantage over Harris on the economy stands at only 5 points in the Fox News poll, and just 2 points in the AP/NORC survey.

""The issue profile of this election continues to favor Trump,"" said Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Democrat Chris Anderson.

But Shaw added that Trump's ""edge on economic issues has decreased, probably due to Harris' messaging on housing costs and taxes, both of which target the middle class and appear to be paying off.""

Boosting Trump when it comes to the economy are apparent fond memories of his tenure in the White House.

Voters questioned in the Fox News poll by a 17 point margin said Trump's policies on the economy were more helpful than harmful. But by 24 points, they said that President Biden's economic policies have been more hurtful than helpful.

""The perception that Trump's policies helped more than Biden's creates some heavy baggage for Harris in this campaign and shows why 'turning the page' is a central theme she's tried to stress,"" Anderson said.

Social media erupted after First Lady Jill Biden presented at what may be one of President Biden's final Cabinet meetings in the White House.

Biden convened his Cabinet on Friday for the first time since Oct. 2, 2023 - this time with the first lady joining him to speak about the White House Initiative on Women's Health Research.

The president explained Jill Biden's presence there, saying, ""Here and across previous administrations, first ladies have attended these meetings for specific reasons. This is the first time Jill has joined us, and it goes to show how important the issue is, which she is about to speak to.""

He concluded by handing off to his wife, saying, ""It's all yours, kid.""

FLASHBACK: BIDEN'S CABINET DOUBLES DOWN ON SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT FOLLOWING DEBATE

The New York Post reported that Jill Biden, seated at the head of the Cabinet Room's board table, ""read from a binder about maternal health initiatives for four-and-a-half minutes after her husband spoke for just two minutes off the top of the meeting.""

The president traditionally sits at the center of the table with Cabinet members seated in order of the founding of their departments. The last sitting first lady to attend her husband's Cabinet meeting appears to be Hillary Clinton.

The amount of influence the first lady has over Joe Biden, and therefore his administration, has been a frequent source of controversy, and numerous commentators took to social media to criticize her presence at the meeting.

The New York Post said that Jill Biden is ""considered by insiders to be the most influential first lady since Edith Wilson, who tightly controlled access to her husband, President Woodrow Wilson, after he suffered a debilitating stroke in October 1919.""

Digital strategist Greg Price referenced this comparison, saying, ""She's literally Edith Wilson except right out in the open in a 24/7 news cycle and nobody in the media cares.""

""Wow. A visibly exhausted Joe Biden just held a full Cabinet meeting for the first time in 11 months and immediately turned the mic over to his wife, Jill,"" previous adviser to former President Donald Trump Steve Cortes said. He went on to ask, ""Who is running the country?""

Political commentator Kate Hyde observed, ""Jill Biden is kicking off the first cabinet meeting the White House has had in almost a year and we're expected to act like this is normal.""

""Jill Biden is the head of the table at the cabinet meeting. No one voted for her to be there... this must be part of her deal to have Joe drop out of the race,"" podcaster Tim Young speculated. ""She has no reason to be there.""

""It's insane that the world's #1 nuclear superpower just sort of stumbled its way into a power vacuum,"" The Hill columnist T. Becket Adams mused. ""It's even more insane that the vacuum has been filled by the former ruler's wife, who holds no legal governing authority.""

""If the only response these critics have are conspiracy theories that devalue historic progress researching women's health - including terrible diseases - then that says a lot about why more and more American women feel that the right couldn't care less about them, including as it pushes radical abortion bans,"" he added, while also making a dig about Hawley running out of the Capitol on Jan. 6."

Democrats roundly condemned political violence after news that a suspect had been arrested for threatening to hurt and kill six of the Supreme Court's nine Justices and some of their family members.

""Threats and acts of violence are unacceptable. Period,"" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told the Washington Post. ""As President Biden and Vice President Harris have always said, violence has absolutely no place in our country. Violent rhetoric and threats are unacceptable,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates said. ""There's absolutely no place for political violence in this country - full stop,"" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.

It remains unknown exactly which justices 76-year-old Alaska resident Panos Anastasiou intended to attack.

However, a complaint filed against him Wednesday indicated that his threats included anti-Black slurs, and there is only one Black Supreme Court Justice - Clarence Thomas, who typically votes with the Court's conservative majority. Additionally, the complaint laid out that Anastasiou's threats included extreme remarks about a former president described by Anastasiou as a ""convicted criminal."" Former President Donald Trump became the first former president to be convicted of a felony, earlier this year.

ALASKA MAN ARRESTED FOR THREATS AGAINST SIX SUPREME COURT JUSTICES

Democrats have repeatedly slammed the Supreme Court as illegitimate. In a foretelling speech from Duke Law School on Monday, Kannon Shanmugam, who is widely considered one of the nation's top appellate litigators and has argued 35 cases in front of the Supreme Court, said that ""attacks on the legitimacy of the courts are contributing to the threat of violence against judges in general.""

""Enough is enough. When will the media press Democrats like Sen. Schumer, Sen. Durbin, Sen. Whitehouse, VP Harris and others to stop their baseless attacks on the Supreme Court that have created actual threats to the safety of our Justices?"" questioned GOP Florida Sen. Rick Scott following news of Anastasiou's arrest. ""Hey, look, someone who took Chuck Schumer seriously,"" said Trent England, the founder and executive director of conservative nonprofit Save Our States. Other critics pointed to how Anastasiou was a frequent donor to Democrats.

ROE V. WADE ABORTION DECISION: DEMOCRATS CALL SUPREME COURT 'ILLEGITIMATE'

Trump's ability to shakeup the Supreme Court with new Justices has not sat well with Democrats.

In a fiery speech in front of the Supreme Court after a preliminary draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade was leaked in spring 2020, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., put conservative Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, both nominated by Trump, in his crosshairs: ""I want to tell you, Gorsuch. I want to tell you, Kavanaugh. You have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price,"" Schumer exclaimed outside the steps of the Supreme Court in 2020. ""You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.""

""The Supreme Court is not well. And the people know it,"" a cohort of Democratic senators said in an August 2019 brief after the High Court took up a case about the constitutionality of a New York City law restricting legal gun owners from transporting their firearms.

In 2020, during the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett, Trump's final Supreme Court nomination that would eventually make it to the bench, then-Sen. Kamala Harris called the confirmation ""illegitimate"" and ""reckless."" Following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, Harris warned that there is ""a national movement afoot to attack hard-won and hard-fought freedoms.""

""I don't want to, at this point, use my voice in a way that is alarmist,"" she added earlier this year in an interview with the New York Times. ""But this court has made it very clear that they are willing to undo recognized rights.""

HARRIS WAS 'OPEN' TO PACKING SUPREME COURT DURING 2019 PRESIDENTIAL BID

ABC's shameless debate didn't even survive its own fact-check,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/abcs-shameless-debate-didnt-even-survive-its-own-fact-check,2024-09-20T17:53:55Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

As CBS anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan prepare for the vice-presidential debate on October 1, they have two models to choose from: CNN's attempt to avoid ""fact-checking"" the candidates or ABC's aggressively one-sided ""fact-based"" assault on the Republicans.

ABC's immoderate moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis uncorked the most flagrantly unfair and unbalanced debate in the history of modern presidential debates, going back to the Nixon-Kennedy debates of 1960. They don't care that anyone objects to their strategic decision to join in debating former President Donald Trump, giving everyone the distinct impression that this was a three-on-one conversation.

Muir appeared on the Disney-syndicated chat show ""Live with Kelly and Mark"" and dismissed all criticism of ABC's shoddy performance as ""noise."" He sounded like Jimmy Kimmel when he told Republicans he didn't want them watching his late-night show. ABC isn't here to please Republicans, only Democrats.

REPUBLICAN SENATOR DEMANDS ABC NEWS TURN OVER DEBATE COMMUNICATIONS WITH HARRIS CAMPAIGN: 'BIASED AGENDA'

""All of the noise that you hear afterward about you know, 'Which candidate won the debate, did the moderators win or lose?'"" Muir said. ""That's just noise. You all know that. The most important thing to remember is you all have the power.""

Voters don't have the power to tilt the election discussion in one direction. Conspiracy theories bubbled up from an alleged anonymous whistleblower about Vice President Kamala Harris getting questions in advance. ABC hired former Democratic Party chair Donna Brazile as a contributor, and in 2016, when she was a contributor at CNN, she sent Hillary Clinton's campaign some topics for a town hall discussion in advance, and CNN let her go.

It could be enlightening to drag ABC before a congressional probe and ask how this incredibly biased debate was organized. But Harris didn't need to have these questions in advance. Team Kamala could know there would be an inflation question, an immigration question, an abortion question, an Israel question, and maybe another mention of her flip-flop on fracking. There were no surprises, and the questions were vague enough that she repeatedly dodged a direct answer and uncorked her prepared speeches, and the moderators naturally allowed it.

Davis gave a revealing interview to the Los Angeles Times, explaining they didn't want to be like CNN. ""People were concerned that statements were allowed to just hang and not [be] disputed by the candidate Biden, at the time, or the moderators,"" she said. Those ""people"" are Democrats.

Davis told Times media reporter Stephen Battaglio that she had to turn off her social media accounts to shut out people who accuse her of pulling for Harris. ""There is a stereotype that I am acutely aware of that I can't be unbiased covering this moment,"" she said. Then she went on the debate stage and proved it. Davis, like Muir, had no time for people charging her with blatant favoritism.

Davis also cited her mentor, ABC News veteran Carole Simpson, a woman of color best known for moderating a 1992 presidential debate where she sneered at President George H.W. Bush for calling himself the ""education president."" Simpson openly called Hillary Clinton's election to the Senate in 2000 an ""exhilarating moment"" and in 2007, proclaimed it was time for Hillary to be elected the first woman president. That says a lot.

So how did Team ABC decide to tilt toward only ""fact-checking"" Trump? Davis said she and Muir had studied hours of campaign rallies and interviews to prepare for the debate, so they were ""ready to counter the candidates' most egregious statements."" For example, she fully anticipated fighting back on Trump's supposedly ""erroneous"" claim that the Democrats favor abortion at any time for any reason.

""That was an obvious thing to get on the record,"" Davis said. ABC's partisans should have studied what Trump typically cites, that then-Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said in a radio interview about keeping a baby that was born alive ""comfortable"" as they decided whether to kill it (or perhaps let it die unassisted). A state legislator had proposed a bill that she admitted would allow abortion up until birth.

They could have reviewed the 2020 Democratic Party platform, which proclaimed, ""We believe unequivocally, like the majority of Americans, that every woman should be able to access high-quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion ... Democrats oppose and will fight to overturn federal and state laws that create barriers to reproductive health and rights.""

Davis gave a revealing interview to the Los Angeles Times, explaining they didn't want to be like CNN. ""People were concerned that statements were allowed to just hang and not [be] disputed by the candidate Biden, at the time, or the moderators,"" she said. Those ""people"" are Democrats.

They will fight to overturn barriers, with no exceptions. Liberal ""fact-checkers"" have attacked Trump and many other Republicans (like Montana Senate candidate Tim Sheehy) for ""lying"" about Democrats supporting abortion on demand, when the facts are there, in black and white. They claim Republicans are debunked because late-term abortions are ""rare."" That's not a factual rebuttal.

On the Sunday after the debate, ABC ""This Week"" host Martha Raddatz, who has specialized in foreign policy, pushed a belated fact-check on Harris's claim that there were no American service members in war zones. ""Our fact-checkers found that to be false,"" Raddatz told Gov. Maura Healey, D-Mass. ""There are currently 900 U.S. military personnel in Syria, 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq. All have been under regular threat from drones and missiles for months. We also have action in the Red Sea. Also, every single day, the Navy SEALs, Delta Forces special operators can be part of any sort of deadly raid."" Muir and Davis didn't prepare for that one.

Battaglio apparently had no questions about whether they studied Harris's record for ""fact-checks."" They obviously needed no preparation on that front, since they never touched her. Let's guess that shameless zero occurred because, on the left, any attempt to fact-check a Democrat opposing Trump is objectionable, because it suggests that a Democrat's falsehoods might be made equivalent to Trump's. Every anti-Trump journalist acts on the belief that any measure of neutrality is an atrocity."
Harris-Trump Showdown: Presidential nominees hit key battleground states as election approaches,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-trump-showdown-presidential-nominees-key-battleground-states-election-approaches,2024-09-20T16:50:16Z,"Virginia Gov. Glen Youngkin joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the 2024 election as early voting starts in the key swing state.

With just over six weeks to go until Election Day on November 5, and early and absentee voting now underway in an increasing number of states, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump are not letting up as they campaign in the key battleground states.

After a stop Thursday evening in Michigan, Harris heads to Georgia on Friday afternoon for a reproductive rights event before heading to a rally later in the day in Wisconsin.

Trump, who campaigned in Michigan earlier in the week, returns to the campaign trail on Saturday with a rally in North Carolina.

TRUMP MAKES A BOLD PREDICTION ABOUT THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

Those four states, along with Pennsylvania, Arizona and Nevada, had razor-thin margins that decided President Biden's 2020 election victory over Trump. And those seven swing states will likely determine whether Harris or Trump wins the 2024 election and succeeds Biden in the White House.

Harris will keep the spotlight on the combustible issue of abortion during her Atlanta area stop. The issue has been a winning one for the Democrats at the ballot box since the conservative majority on the Supreme Court in a blockbuster decision two years ago overturned the landmark nearly half-century-old Roe v. Wade ruling, which had legalized abortion nationwide.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS SHOW IN THE HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN

""Trump Abortion Bans have criminalized reproductive care,"" Harris said on social media Thursday night after spotlighting the issue during a live-streamed forum in Michigan with one of her best known surrogates, Oprah Winfrey.

Biden narrowly edged Trump in Georgia four years ago to become the first Democrat to carry the state in a presidential election in over a quarter-century.

Harris returns to Georgia after making a campaign swing in the southeastern part of the state earlier this month.

Trump, amid strained relations with Gov. Brian Kemp, the state's popular two-term conservative governor, hasn't returned to Georgia since holding a large rally in Atlanta on August 5.

DOES TRUMP OR HARRIS HAVE THE EDGE IN THESE KEY BATTLEGROUNDS?

The latest public opinion polls in Georgia conducted entirely after the first and potentially only debate between Harris and Trump indicate the former president holding a slight lower-single digit edge over the vice president.

Harris later on Friday headlines a rally in Madison, Wisconsin, for her fourth visit to the Midwestern battleground since replacing Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket over two months ago.

The most recent surveys in Wisconsin also show a margin-of-error race, with Harris holding a razor-thin lower single digit edge over Trump.

Wisconsin, along with Michigan and Pennsylvania, is part of the Democrats' so-called Blue Wall of Rust Belt states that the party reliably won in presidential elections for a quarter-century until Trump narrowly captured all three states en route to a White House victory in 2016. But four years ago, Biden edged Trump in all three states to win the presidency.

The state is a must-win for the GOP presidential nominee, and his campaign is now spending big bucks to run ads in North Carolina. The latest polls suggest a coin-toss race, with the former president holding the slightest edge.

Trump's visit comes two days after a bombshell report rocked the state's governor's race, with allegations that GOP nominee and controversial Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson posted disturbing and inflammatory statements on a forum of a pornographic website. Robinson has denied the allegations.

A source familiar with Trump's rally Saturday in Wilmington, North Carolina, told Fox News that Robinson would not be attending the event."

NFL Hall of Fame coach Tony Dungy questions Kamala Harris' faith-based tweet about abortion rights,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nfl-hall-fame-coach-tony-dungy-questions-kamala-harris-faith-based-tweet-about-abortion-rights,2024-09-19T22:59:55Z,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Legendary NFL coach Tony Dungy challenged a tweet from Vice President Kamala Harris about abortion rights.

Harris has been unapologetic about her stance on abortion rights for women, and she continued with a post on X Thursday.

""One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree: The government, and certainly Donald Trump, should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,"" she said.

Dungy, the first Black head coach to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in the modern era and second all-time, is a man of faith and questioned Harris.

""Dear VP Harris: I hear you make this statement all the time,"" Dungy wrote in a quote tweet. ""Exactly what 'faith' are you talking about when you say you don't have to abandon it to support abortion? Are you talking about the Christian faith that says all babies are made in the image of God (Gen 1:26), that God places them in the womb (Jer 1:5) and that we should not take any life unjustly (Luke 18:20)?

""Are you talking about that faith or some nebulous, general 'faith' that says we're good enough, and smart enough to make our own decisions? What 'faith' are you talking about?""

HARRIS CLAIMS TRUMP ABORTION PLATFORM MAKES 'NO EXCEPTION,' MOMENTS AFTER TRUMP SAYS THE OPPOSITE

Harris has pledged that if Congress were to pass a bill to reinstate the protections that Roe v. Wade guaranteed, she would ""proudly sign it into law"" if elected president in November.

Meanwhile, Trump commended the United States Supreme Court for overturning Roe v. Wade, which has allowed states to handle the issue.

Dungy also reposted former NFL tight end Benjamin Watson's quote tweet over a Sept. 17 Harris tweet, which said, ""A young mother from Georgia should be alive today, raising her son and pursuing her dream of attending nursing school. This is exactly what we feared when Roe vs. Wade was struck down. In more than 20 states, Trump Abortion Bans prevent doctors from providing basic medical care.""

""Amber Thurman's tragic death was caused by complications from legal abortion drugs and gross medical malpractice,"" Watson responded. ""She should have been treated immediately by physicians who instead waited too long to act. Georgia's pro-life law is not the issue. It does not criminalize doing a D&C, especially when there is no detectable fetal heart rate.

""Amber should be alive, and [Harris] should focus her attention on these facts so we can prevent the next tragedy rather than promoting politically motivated falsehoods.""

On Dungy's tweet, one commenter wrote, ""I love what you stand for coach. But how do you support someone like Trump? I have never seen post from you criticizing him.""

""I guess you didn't see my post last week when I said Donald Trump could not have read Florida Amendment 4 very carefully when he said he was going to vote 'Yes' on it,"" Dungy replied.

Trump later clarified his stance on the abortion amendment, which would protect access to abortion in the state, saying, ""I'll be voting no."" Abortion is not permitted in Florida after six weeks of pregnancy with exceptions in rare circumstances.

""President Trump has not yet said how he will vote on the ballot initiative in Florida. He simply reiterated that he believes six weeks is too short,"" Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign's press secretary, said after his NBC News interview.

Earlier this month, Harris also claimed Trump's abortion platform would make no exception ""even for rape and incest.""

""A survivor of a crime of violation to their body does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body. That is immoral, and one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,"" Harris said.

""Understand, if Donald Trump were to be re-elected, he will sign the national abortion ban.""

Trump said moments before Harris' statement he does believe ""strongly"" in exceptions for abortion.

""I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother,"" Trump said during a debate. ""I believe strongly in it. Ronald Reagan did also. Eighty-five percent of Republicans knew exceptions are very important.""

Dungy is a one-time Super Bowl-champion coach, which came after his 12-4 season in 2006 with the Indianapolis Colts.

Fox News Poll: Voters cite high prices as biggest motivator to vote,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-voters-cite-high-prices-biggest-motivator-vote,2024-09-19T22:12:05Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

As the economy remains the top overall issue for voters, a new Fox News national poll finds high prices will be the main factor driving them to cast ballots this fall, as an increasing number say grocery prices and housing costs are tough for their family.

At least 6 in 10 voters say grocery prices (66%) and housing costs (60%) are a major problem for their family. In May, those numbers were at 62% for groceries and 47% for housing costs.

The 13-point jump in housing costs being a major problem is seen across the board but mainly among men (+16 points major problem), White voters (+15), those without a college degree (+15), Republicans (+15), voters ages 65 and over (+14), Democrats (+13), and those under 45 (+13).

Nearly half of voters (48%) say gas prices are a major problem, about where it was in May.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS TOPS TRUMP BY TWO POINTS

All this leads to high prices being the single most important factor that voters say will motivate them to go out and vote this election. Four in 10 say high prices (39%) will be the main issue driving them, followed by immigration (32%), stopping the other side from winning (29%), abortion (27%), violent crime (26%), the candidate's race (9%), and the candidate's gender (7%).

For Democrats, the single most important factor will be abortion (39%) and stopping the other side from winning (37%). For both Republicans and Independents, it's immigration (50% and 27%, respectively) and high prices (49% and 40%).

The economy has been the top issue for much of the campaign and that's no different now. Thirty-nine percent say it's the economy, with immigration (16%) and abortion (15%) registering a distant second and third. All other issues tested were in single digits.

Democrats' most important issue is split between abortion (27%) and the economy (25%), while Republicans and Independents are again united with the economy first (50% and 45%, respectively) then immigration (30% and 13%).

When it comes to who can better handle these priorities, former President Donald Trump is favored on two of the top three. By 5 points, he is seen as better able to handle the economy and by 10 points immigration, while more voters trust Vice President Kamala Harris to handle abortion by 16 points.

The candidates are rated evenly when it comes to handling taxes, while voters give Harris the lead on helping the middle class by 9 points.

""The issue profile of this election continues to favor Trump,"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""But his edge on economic issues has decreased, probably due to Harris' messaging on housing costs and taxes, both of which target the middle class and appear to be paying off.""

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS CLOSES GAP WITH TRUMP IN SUN BELT STATES

Overall, Harris has a 2-point edge (within the error margin) in the head-to-head matchup against Trump (50%-48%).

""One reason the horserace is so tight is that a handful of voters who trust Trump on the economy and immigration still back Harris and a handful of those trusting Harris on abortion and climate favor Trump,"" says Dana Blanton, who runs the Fox News polling unit.

Trump's advantage on the economy is bolstered by a rosier picture of his time in office. By 17 points, more voters see his administration's policies as helpful than harmful, whereas by 24 points they see the Biden administration's policies as more hurtful.

Half of Democrats (50%) say Biden's policies are helping them, while most Republicans (87%) and over half of Independents (52%) say they are hurting. More than half of Democrats feel Trump's policies were hurtful (55%) vs. most Republicans saying helpful (86%). Independents are more mixed on their memory of Trump policies: 39% helped, 32% hurt, 29% no difference.

""The perception that Trump's policies helped more than Biden's creates some heavy baggage for Harris in this campaign and shows why 'turning the page' is a central theme she's tried to stress,"" says Anderson.

Roughly 4 in 10 voters overall (39%) think imposing tariffs on products hurts the economy while 36% says it helps. Two in 10 believe it doesn't make a difference.

While it's nowhere near the high of 84% during Biden's presidency, 7 in 10 have a negative view of the economy (70%) compared to 3 in 10 who hold a positive view (29%). That negative view includes most Republicans (90%) and Independents (77%) and nearly half of Democrats (48%).

The president's job rating stands at 42% approve, 58% disapprove, mostly unchanged since July.

Despite negative attitudes on the economy and high prices, 41% of voters think life for the next generation will be better, up from 25% when the question was last asked two years ago. The new result sits near the high of 42% recorded in August 2012.

Compared to 2022, the increase in optimism for future Americans comes mainly from those without a college degree (+21), voters with annual income under $50,000 (+20), nonwhite voters (+19), Democrats (+18), men (+18), and voters under age 30 (+16)"

Former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are in a deadlock in the state of Pennsylvania, a virtual must-win state for both candidates, according to a new poll.

A Thursday poll from the Washington Post had Harris at 48% support among likely and registered voters, while Trump sits at 47%.

A New York Times poll gave Harris a slight edge, however, with Harris sitting at 50% compared to Trump's 46%. Nationally, however, the Times' poll had Harris and Trump tied at 47%.

Both polls were conducted after last week's presidential debate, in which most debate watchers said Harris came out on top.

""Despite a strong debate performance, Vice President Harris did not gain much ground compared with our last polls of the nation and Pennsylvania. The poll is full of evidence that our respondents thought she did well in the debate -- and that Mr. Trump did poorly -- but it hasn't made a big difference,"" the paper wrote.

The Washington Post poll found that Trump maintains his lead when it comes to the top two issues of the election, the economy and immigration. Harris has also maintained her lead on the issues of defending democracy and abortion.

No Republican has carried the state in a presidential election in 40 years.

With fewer than 47 days until the November election, Vice President Harris and former President Trump are tied with likely voters in Pennsylvania, which could be the state to decide the contest on Election Day.

Trump and Harris each garnered 49% of likely voters in the Keystone State, per a new Marist Poll.

Furthermore, 90% of likely voters who said they had a candidate preference also reported strongly supporting them.

In two other so-called ""blue wall"" states, Michigan and Wisconsin, Harris topped Trump in the survey.

The vice president is up five points in Michigan, 52% to Trump's 47%. However, the margin is razor-thin in Wisconsin, where she only beat him by one point, 50% to 49%.

According to Miringoff, ""of the three so-called blue wall states, Michigan is the one where there is a difference between Harris and Trump.""

""The Michigan vote is being driven by Trump's high negatives with Vance certainly providing no help for the GOP ticket,"" Miringoff added, referencing the 53% of Michigan likely voters that view Trump unfavorably.

Inflation was the top issue for most Pennsylvanians by far, with one-third saying so. Despite it being a campaign priority for Democrats across the country, abortion was the fourth most likely to be a top issue for voters, at just 11%. It was beaten by immigration at 15%, and preserving democracy, which garnered 27%.

The top issue breakdown among Wisconsin voters was similar to that of Pennsylvania, but in Michigan, the issue of preserving Democracy proved to be the most important for the greatest number of voters.

At 30%, the most likely Michigan voters cited it as such. Inflation was close behind, at 29%. Immigration followed at 15%, while abortion received 10%.

In all three states, an at least 20-point gender gap exists between Harris and Trump, with men breaking more often for the former president and women tending to choose Harris.

Fox News Poll: Harris tops Trump by two points,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-harris-tops-trump-two-points,2024-09-18T22:05:35Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Vice President Kamala Harris edges former President Donald Trump in a head-to-head matchup, as more voters see Harris as the candidate who will help the middle class, and Hispanics and Independents swing in her direction.

The new Fox News national survey finds a 3 percentage-point shift among registered voters in the 2024 presidential contest since mid-August. Trump had a 1-point advantage last month, while Harris is ahead by 2 points today: 50-48%. For reference, in July, Trump was ahead by 1 point over President Joe Biden. Each of those differences falls within the margin of error.

This marks the first time Harris has hit 50% support, and the trial ballot result is identical among both registered and likely voters. That's unsurprising given most Americans who are willing to spend time answering a political survey are also probably going to vote.

Of course, presidential elections are decided by electoral votes from the states, not national vote totals. Hillary Clinton had a 2-point popular vote margin over Trump in 2016 but lost the Electoral College 304-227, while Biden's 4-point popular vote win in 2020 translated to a 306-232 Electoral College victory.

Since the August survey, many events occurred that could affect voter opinion: the Democratic National Convention was held, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump, former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Congresswoman Liz Cheney endorsed Harris, and the candidates faced off in a debate. A second assassination attempt on Trump happened about three-quarters of the way into the new survey.

The biggest change since last month is that Independents and Hispanics have swung Harris' way. Hispanics favored Trump by 6 points in August, but they go for Harris by 12 points today. Independents went for Trump by 8 points last month, but now prefer Harris by 12. It is important to remember that estimates among small subgroups are more volatile and tend to swing more than others, and that applies here.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS CLOSES GAP WITH TRUMP IN SUN BELT STATES

Trump gets his best numbers from voters who regularly attend worship services, non-college White men, rural voters, and men.

Harris' strongest backing comes from Black voters, urban voters, those under age 30, voters 65 and over, college graduates, and women. She's narrowly ahead in union households, a group that Biden won by low double digits. Her numbers also still trail his 2020 pre-election numbers a bit among Blacks and young voters. Democrats are optimistic these groups will ultimately back Harris, but that is certainly an unknown.

Harris holds onto almost all of 2020 Biden voters (93%) and Trump keeps nearly all his 2020 backers as well (94%). Among 2020 non-voters, Harris is up by 3 points, 51-48%.

When looking at results only among counties where the 2020 presidential vote was close (Biden and Trump within 10 points), Trump is ahead 50-48% -- and he holds the same edge across the combined battleground states (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin).

""Our best estimates are that if Trump is within 2 points of Harris nationally then he will likely win in the Electoral College,"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts Fox News surveys with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""These data showing a Trump edge in the key counties and battleground states suggest that's probably right.""

Overall, 72% of Trump supporters say they like his policies and record and another 8% like his character, but 19% say they simply dislike Harris. Views are more mixed among those backing Harris, as 42% like her policies and record, 24% like her character, while 33% say they are backing her because they dislike Trump.

Roughly 7 in 10 Harris and Trump supporters say they are ""extremely"" motivated to vote this year.

And while most of each candidate's supporters feel certain of their vote choice, about 1 voter in 10 is moveable.

Most Republicans (75%) consider themselves a supporter of MAGA, but among non-MAGA Republicans one in five backs Harris over Trump (21%).

More voters think Harris (53%) has the temperament to serve effectively as president than Trump (47%). For Trump, that is a 10-point improvement since 2017 when 37% said he had the right temperament (2017 is the most recent time the question was asked about him, and this is the first time it was asked of Harris).

Harris is seen as the candidate who will help the middle class by a 9-point margin and protect personal rights and freedoms by 6. She also bests Trump by 5 points on ""fighting for people like you"" and ""uniting the country."" There's little difference on who will make the country safe (Trump +3 points), protect free speech (Harris +1), and bring needed change (Harris +3).

Over half of Hispanic voters trust Harris over Trump on each of those measures, hitting nearly 6 in 10 on helping the middle class and fighting for people like you. She also does better among Independents on each except making the country safe, where he has a 3-point edge.

""Harris' advantage over Trump on a variety of personal traits is clearly helping her,"" says Shaw. ""It's a big deal that she's been able to fight to a draw on protecting free speech despite aggressive Republican efforts to highlight the Biden administration's censorship of right-leaning views on social media.""

More than 8 in 10 voters want the next president to make significant changes in the country, including one-third who are looking for ""drastic"" change. Trump is preferred by a wide 31-point margin among those wanting drastic change, but that narrows to just 4 points among the larger group looking for either major or drastic change.

When asked who they trust to handle top issues, voters favor Trump on immigration (+10), the Israel-Hamas war (+7), and the economy (+5). Since first asking this question in March, his advantage on the economy is down 10 points compared to his 15-point lead over Biden and down 8 points on immigration (was +18).

Harris is favored to handle election integrity (+7), health care (+11), abortion (+16), transgender issues (+16), and climate change (+17). It's noteworthy neither candidate has a real advantage on guns or taxes, both traditionally GOP issues.

As has been the case all year, the economy is the most important issue for voters this election. Thirty-nine percent say it is the priority, while fewer than half that number say immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues receive 7% or less.

Twice as many Republicans (50%) as Democrats (25%) say the economy is the top issue and 10 times as many Republicans say immigration (30% vs. 3% Democrats). Democrats are 5 times as likely to say abortion is the most important issue (27% vs. 5% GOP).

Some 70% of voters rate economic conditions negatively. That's an improvement from a record 84% who felt that way in July 2022 (a record Biden) and puts things on par with ratings early in Biden's presidency.

Trump's advantage on the economy comes from voters remembering his presidency as a sunnier time. By a 17-point margin, more say the Trump administration's policies helped rather than hurt them. When thinking about Biden, voters are more likely to say his administration's policies are hurting them by a 24-point margin.

Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have better personal favorability ratings than Trump and his vice-presidential pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Walz is the only one voters view more favorably than unfavorably (+3 points). While Harris' ratings are net negative by 2 points, her 49% favorable is her highest in over three years. Trump is underwater by 8 points and Vance by 12. About 1 in 6 are unfamiliar with Walz and Vance. Biden's rating is negative by 17 points, 41% favorable vs. 58% unfavorable.

While Democrats and Republicans have largely positive views of their candidates, each individual tested is underwater when it comes to the small subgroup of Independents.

A larger share sees Harris (55%) as being willing to say anything to get elected than feel the same about Trump (48%). Only 43% think Harris says what she believes vs. 51% for Trump.

Abortion is the single most important issue motivating Harris supporters to vote (38%), closely followed by ""stopping the other side from winning"" (36%). For Trump supporters, immigration (49%) and high prices (49%) tie as the single most important factor motivating them.

FOX NEWS POLL: 87% CONSIDER SITUATION AT SOUTHERN BORDER A PROBLEM

Overall, voters say the thing most likely to get them to turn out and vote is high prices (39%), followed by immigration (32%), stopping the other side from winning (29%), abortion (27%), violent crime (26%), the race of the candidates (9%), and the gender of the candidates (7%).

Whoever wins will be on TV a lot for the next four years. When asked what they do when Harris comes on TV, by a 50-48% margin, voters say they turn up the volume rather than change the channel. For Trump, 48% turn it up and 49% change the channel -- almost identical to views in 2016 (46% turn up, 47% change). At that time, 41% said they would turn up the volume for Hillary Clinton and 52% said change the channel.

A ""coding oversight"" in state software is calling into question the citizenship status of 100,000 registered Arizona voters, prompting the state's Democratic secretary of state to insist he will send out ballots to those affected anyway.

""I am unwilling to disenfranchise this many voters by limiting them, suddenly, and with little notice, to a federal-only ballot when none of them had actual notice of or blame for this issue,"" Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a Tuesday news conference. ""We inherited this problem, we're on it, and we're going to fix it. It's as simple as that.""

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE ARIZONA SUPREME COURT'S REINSTATEMENT OF AN 1864 NEAR-TOTAL ABORTION BAN

The mistake affects individuals who obtained their driver's licenses before October 1996 and subsequently received duplicates before registering to vote after 2004. Since 2005, Arizona has required proof of U.S. citizenship for voting in state and local elections. Without this proof, these voters would be considered ""federal only"" voters, permitting them to vote solely on presidential and congressional elections rather than the full ballot.

""We don't have any reason to believe that anyone in this gap is not an eligible voter,"" Fontes said. ""We don't have any reason to believe that they're not eligible citizens in spite of the fact that we did find one. All we know is they fit into this category and all of this requires more research.""

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKING IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE SHOW

The Maricopa County Recorder's Office filed an emergency petition requesting the Arizona Supreme Court determine whether voters affected by the data oversight should be required to prove U.S. citizenship before the November election.

Fontes said the error comes as longtime Arizona residents have been voting in elections for years under the impression that they had already provided proof of citizenship. And if the justices determine these individuals are only eligible to vote in federal races, Fontes said there will be an outreach effort to inform them.

NEW POLL INDICATES WHETHER HARRIS OR TRUMP HAS THE EDGE IN THE MOST IMPORTANT BATTLEGROUND

The error comes as Arizona Republicans and a conservative watchdog group have been pushing for stricter voting measures that require proof of U.S. citizenship to participate in state and national elections. Arizona is also a swing state that flipped blue in the 2020 presidential election.

Last month, watchdog group America First Legal sued 15 Arizona counties for allegedly refusing to remove thousands of illegal immigrants from its voter rolls. The lawsuit claims that, as of April 2024, over 35,000 registered voters in Arizona had not provided proof of citizenship, limiting them to voting only in federal races, according to the Arizona Secretary of State's Office.

For their part, U.S. House Republicans are also attempting to attach H.R. 8281, which mandates proof of citizenship for voter registration and was passed in July, to a temporary government funding bill.

Vice President Kamala Harris is continuing her campaign blitz, but a series of 'word salad' interviews have some pundits skeptical if she can sway enough undecided voters. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich warned on ""Hannity"" Tuesday that the new interviews have become a ""joke,"" stressing the ""insanity"" of Harris' position on the Israel-Hamas war.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN PLEDGES MORE MEDIA INTERVIEWS AS VOTERS STILL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HER POLICIES

NEWT GINGRICH: The American people aren't stupid. In the recent interviews, for example, with undecided voters, overwhelmingly they believe she's much more radical than Donald Trump. ... They identify her with Biden and the Biden administration so overwhelmingly, they think that she is the candidate of the past and Trump is a candidate of change, by about three-and-a-half to one. Americans want change in current policies, not continuity. Part of this may be psychological and she may not be capable of uttering a clear, coherent policy position. But whatever the reason, the more we get these word salads, the more obvious it is that she either doesn't know what she's saying or she can't articulate it, or she's trying to hide. These things all hurt her. This interview today did not help her at all. The interview in Philadelphia on the local TV station became a joke. I mean, people thought it was absurd.

If you just watch her, it's the same stuff over and over. The things she's memorized have nothing to do with the real world. And I particularly want to point out, at one point in this interview, she talks about we have to get to a truce in Gaza and release the hostages. Now, there are two problems. The first is she is the vice president. They've had 11 months to get to this truce. 11 months. They've gotten nowhere. There's no reason to believe she'd get anywhere if she was president. Why? Because the founding constitution of Hamas says not a single Jew will remain. And when people chant 'from the river to the sea,' they're chanting genocide fully as much as the Nazi Germans were about Jews in Europe. These college students need to understand that. That's a genocidal quote that Hamas means to either massacre or evict every single Jew in Israel. So her fantasy that somehow she's going to sit down with Hamas, talk reasonably with them, get them to agree to something plausible, this is insanity. This is totally out of touch with the real world.

Vice President Kamala Harris has had numerous 'word salad' interviews during her time in office. Although her campaign has been marked by few media appearances, she had her first solo interview with the national media Tuesday.

Harris spoke to the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) in Philadelphia, about a month after former President Trump spoke to the same group and made waves when he questioned Harris' race.

Beyond race-focused topics, the interview included remarks from Harris about her economic plan, abortion, support for Israel and gun control.

Later, the moderators turned to the second assassination attempt made on Trump's life over the weekend. Harris indicated that she spoke to Trump after the close call to check on him.

Harris was asked a follow-up question about her confidence in the Secret Service to protect her, with Harris responding in the affirmative.

""Not everybody has Secret Service. And there are far too many people in our country right now who are not feeling safe,"" she said. ""I mean, I look at Project 2025, and I look at, you know, the Don't Say Gay laws coming out of Florida. Members of the LGBTQ community don't feel safe right now, immigrants or people with an immigrant background don't feel safe right now. Women don't feel safe right now. And so, yes, I feel safe. I have Secret Service protection, but that doesn't change my perspective on the importance of fighting for the safety of everybody in our country.""

Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are neck-and-neck in one of the most important battleground states of the 2024 presidential election, according to a new poll.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution released on Wednesday the results of its most recent voter survey, which framed the election as a dead heat race with significant margins for fluctuation.

The poll shows approximately 46.9% of voters currently say they would vote for Trump, compared to 44.4% of voters who say they would cast their vote for Harris.

NEW POLL INDICATES WHETHER HARRIS OR TRUMP HAS THE EDGE IN THE MOST IMPORTANT BATTLEGROUND

With a margin of error of 3.1%, this makes the state election a toss-up between the two candidates.

Approximately 7% of voters reported themselves undecided, while the Libertarian Party candidate Chase Oliver and the rest of the third-party nominees polled below 1%.

The AJC poll showed inflation is the single most important issue among Georgia voters this election cycle.

Inflation is followed by economic concerns and the preservation of democracy, then immigration and abortion policy.

Harris tells NABJ she expects to 'earn' the Black vote this November,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-speaks-national-association-black-journalists-philly,2024-09-17T22:40:06Z,"Former White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway and former Pennsylvania Congressman Patrick Murphy debate Kamala Harris' platform and treatment of the media on 'The Story.'

Vice President Harris spoke to the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) in Philadelphia on Tuesday, about a month after former President Trump spoke to the same group and made waves when he questioned Harris' race.

The event marks Harris' first solo interview with the national media. It was held at NPR's Philadelphia station, WHYY, and was moderated by three Black journalists, including Eugene Daniels of Politico Playbook, WHYY's Tonya Mosely and TheGrio's Gerren Keith Gaynor. The stop marked Harris' 13th visit to the Keystone State this year.

During his July interview with the NABJ in Chicago, Trump drummed up a firestorm of criticism when he said, ""I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So, I don't know. Is she Indian or Black?""

Harris was not asked to respond to those remarks from Trump on Tuesday, but she did slam the former president for what the moderators described as racially charged rhetoric about Haitian migrants in a small Ohio town eating people's pets.

OHIO AG EYES 'CREATIVE' PATH TO GET 'MISHANDLED' SPRINGFIELD MIGRANT CRISIS IN FRONT OF FEDERAL JUDGE

""It's harmful, and it's hateful and grounded in some age-old stuff that we should not have the tolerance for,"" Harris said of the rumors being circulated by Trump. ""We've got to say that you cannot be entrusted with standing behind the seal of the president of the United States of America, engaging in that hateful rhetoric that, as usual, is designed to divide us as a country.""

When asked by one of the moderators if this case of ""irredeemable racism"" deserved some sort of federal response to help the community heal, Harris sidestepped the question.

Meanwhile, Harris also sidestepped whether she would sign or veto a bill establishing a federal committee to study reparations for the Black community. Harris said she ""thinks"" a federal reparations commission will be taken up by Congress and, therefore, she won't need to use her power as president to study the matter at the federal level.

Harris also spoke about the Black vote on Tuesday and took a far different approach than President Biden did in 2020.

""If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't Black,"" Biden said while campaigning for the presidency in 2020. Harris, however, said Tuesday that she expects to have to ""earn"" the Black vote, particularly Black men. ""I think it's very important to not operate from the assumption that Black men are in anybody's pocket.""

Beyond race-focused topics, the interview included remarks from Harris about her economic plan, abortion, support for Israel - which she said has the right to defend itself - and gun control.

""The United Sates of America absolutely has a role"" in aiding Israel's right to self-determination, Harris said during Tuesday's interview.

On gun control, Harris was resolute that she and her running mate, Democrat Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are both gun owners - something that came as news to voters during last week's presidential debate. ""We're not trying to take anybody's guns away from them, but we do need an assault weapons ban,"" she said. Previously, as a presidential candidate in 2019, Harris said she thought a mandatory gun buyback program run by the federal government was ""a good idea."" However, Harris' campaign has said she no longer supports such a program.

Harris added that she does support universal background checks for those seeking to legally obtain a firearm. When one of the moderators pointed out that most handguns are purchased illegally, Harris pointed to the need to eradicate ""gun show loophole[s].""

""We need to address each entry point in the issue,"" Harris insisted.

Later, the moderators turned to the second assassination attempt made on Trump's life over the weekend. Harris indicated that she spoke to Trump after the close call to check on him.

""I am in this election, in this race, for many reasons, including to fight for our democracy. And in a democracy, there is no place for political violence,"" Harris said.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., expressed fear over former President Trump's rhetoric following him surviving two assassination attempts in the past two months.

Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., expressed fear about former President Trump's rhetoric following the two assassination attempts he's survived in just over two months.

Warren appeared on MSNBC's ""Inside With Jen Psaki"" on Monday to discuss Trump telling his supporters to ""fight"" after nearly being assassinated twice, the second incident happening just a day prior to their conversation.

""And you hear this 'fight, fight, fight' chant, which you heard Trump do right after the shooting in Butler. We saw that once again on TRUTH Social,"" the host said to Warren, adding, ""That does scare me a little bit.""

NY TIMES REPORTER SAYS TRUMP 'INSPIRES' POLITICAL VIOLENCE AFTER SECOND ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

Psaki was referring to Trump's immediate reaction to the first attempt against his life at a rally in Pennsylvania in July, where he immediately jumped to his feet after being shot in the ear and told his supporters to ""fight, fight, fight.""

The day after the second attempt on his life, Trump posted a campaign ad to his TRUTH Social account captioned with his Pennsylvania rallying cry, ""FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT!!!!!""

Warren agreed with Psaki that Trump's rhetoric was scary. Before sharing her feelings about his behavior, she did acknowledge that she has used the term ""fight"" as political rhetoric, but insisted that hers was not an allusion to violence, whereas Trump's could be.

""So, I have to say - look, I'm a fighter. I have written books that talk about fighting,"" she began, referencing her two books, ""You Don't Get What You Don't Fight For,"" and ""This Fight is Our Fight.""

She continued, ""But I mean [fight] with words. That's all that this means. In a democracy, we need to be able to go back and forth with our words. We need to be able to disagree and to put those issues in front of the American people. That's how we inform people about our positions. That's how we get back in and make a decision that the majority of Americans want. And it's only by talking about those.""

HILLARY CLINTON SAYS TRUMP POSES 'DANGER TO OUR COUNTRY AND THE WORLD' AFTER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

She then argued that Trump doesn't get the same benefit of the doubt, stating, ""But that is very, very different from a man who incited an insurrection, a man who refers to his political rivals as vermin, a man who has said just in recent days that he wants to lock up the people who don't agree with him.""

""That is a very, very different kind of approach not just to politics, but to democracy, and one that ultimately does put our democracy at risk, puts us all at risk,"" the progressive lawmaker added.

Warren went on to say she wants both Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris to be ""fully protected,"" but insisted that people should not forget about Trump's policies amid the attempts on his life.

""We need to keep this open so people talk and people are able to make a decision. Do you want a candidate who's embracing a nationwide abortion ban? He wants to lie about it, wants to pretend, because he knows it's unpopular, but won't say that, no, he would -- he would veto an abortion ban? No, he's not going to say that,"" she said.

Warren added, ""He's still going to wink and nod at his extremist groups. Or do you want someone who just flatly puts it out there and says, give me a chance, as Kamala Harris does, and I will sign protection for access to abortion and IVF into law?"""

ABC's ""World News Tonight"" anchor David Muir may have driven away some viewers after the Disney-owned network irked conservatives during last week's presidential debate.

Muir and co-moderator Linsey Davis fact-checked former President Trump five times without ever correcting Vice President Kamala Harris, prompting a plethora of conservatives to suggest the debate wasn't fair. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America even called for a correction after Davis made an abortion claim made during the debate during one of the fact-checks on Trump that the group said was ""100% inaccurate.""

Muir's ""World News Tonight"" averaged 6.7 million viewers on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, the three episodes following the debate, after averaging 7.6 million in 2024 leading up to the debate.

The 12% drop in viewers for ""World News Tonight"" is more significant than slight declines ""CBS Evening News"" and ""NBC Nightly News"" saw when comparing the three episodes following ABC's debate to the year-to-date totals, although Muir's newscast remained the No. 1 broadcast evening newscast.

ABC'S DAVID MUIR DISMISSES POST-DEBATE 'NOISE' ABOUT MODERATORS

While it's unclear if Trump supporters have tuned out ABC's newscast on the heels of the debate, the former president has blasted it as ""one-sided."" Trump told Fox News that he believed Harris should have been fact-checked on a variety of claims.

""Every one of them should have been questioned by David Muir, who I've lost a lot of respect for. Everyone's lost respect for him,"" Trump said last week.

""It was so ... one-sided,"" he continued. ""It was one against three.""

Davis admitted in a post-debate interview that her fact-checking of Trump was influenced by the CNN debate that went disastrously for President Biden in June.

""People were concerned that statements were allowed to just hang and not [be] disputed by the candidate Biden, at the time, or the moderators,"" Davis told the Los Angeles Times last week.

ABC HOST PRESSES KAMALA HARRIS ALLY ON VP'S FALSE CLAIM ABOUT ACTIVE US TROOPS: 'WHY WOULD SHE SAY THAT?'

On Sunday, ABC News' Martha Raddatz even noted on Sunday that Harris was wrong when she said there is ""not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world.""

""Our fact-checkers found that to be false,"" Raddatz said.

""There are currently 900 U.S. military personnel in Syria, 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq. All have been under regular threat from drones and missiles for months. We also have action in the Red Sea,"" Raddatz continued. ""Also, every single day, the Navy SEALs, Delta Forces special operators can be part of any sort of deadly raid.""

Muir and Davis failed to correct Harris in front of the debate's massive audience of nearly 70 million people.

Muir said he felt it was the ""duty"" of him and Davis to discuss issues Americans cared about, citing their questions about the economy, the border crisis, reproductive rights, Afghanistan and the peaceful transfer of power.

""These are all really important issues, the issues of our time, really, and I always say as a moderator, what the candidates decide to do with that time - you can ask the questions, but they'll answer with whatever they choose to answer with, and you have to be ready for whatever might come your way, even the most unexpected of moments,"" he said, to chuckling from the audience.

Muir said he disappeared at the end of the summer because of the weight of the debate and the amount of time necessary to prepare for the event. He praised the ""extraordinary"" team that helped him get ready.

Muir and Davis were criticized by conservatives for fact-checking Trump during the debate five separate times while never fact-checking Vice President Kamala Harris once. Trump, whose uneven performance at the debate received criticism, fretted afterward that it was ""three on one.""

While conservatives fumed, liberal media pundits widely praised Muir and Davis, contrasting them with the more passive performance of CNN's Dana Bash and Jake Tapper when they moderated the debate in June between Trump and President Biden. Biden's frail, dismal showing at the CNN debate led directly to him exiting the 2024 race and being replaced by Harris.

Authorities in West Palm Beach, Florida, received calls of shots fired at Trump International Golf Club at about 1:30 p.m. Sunday, with the Trump campaign issuing a statement after 2 p.m. that the 45th president was ""safe following gunshots in his vicinity.""

About two hours after Jeffries posted about stopping ""extreme MAGA Republicans,"" he condemned the attack against Trump, posting at 5:33 p.m., ""Political violence has no place in a democratic society.""

Trump spoke to Fox Digital on Monday morning and blamed rhetoric from Democrats, namely President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, for the attack on his life.

""[The suspect] believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it,"" Trump said in the interview. ""Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country -- both from the inside and out.""

""It is called the enemy from within. They are the real threat,"" Trump added.

WITNESS SAW TRUMP ASSASSINATION SUSPECT FLEE BUSHES, TOOK PHOTO OF GETAWAY CAR

Trump went on to say that his ABC News debate last week was ""so biased and so out of control,"" citing Harris' comments claiming Trump supports Project 2025 and a national abortion ban. Jeffries also cited Project 2025 and the alleged plans for a national abortion ban in his X post Sunday.

""Harris was the one lying about Project 2025, she lied about abortion, she lied about everything,"" Trump said. ""She was correcting me.""

Project 2025 was authored by conservative think tank, the Heritage Foundation, with Trump repeatedly saying on the campaign trail that he had no role in crafting what was billed as a blueprint for a future Republican administration. Trump has also repeatedly said that he would not impose a national abortion ban if re-elected, doubling down that abortion issues should be left to individual states.

Authorities confirmed that the suspect arrested Sunday at the golf club is 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh, a Hawaiian resident who has posted prolifically on social media about Trump and politics, Fox Digital found.

Routh currently resides in Hawaii after spending the majority of his life in North Carolina, where he worked in construction, including owning a company called United Roofing, a background check conducted by Fox Digital shows.

The suspect's alleged social media accounts on Sunday afternoon showed he repeatedly posted about Trump, the war in Ukraine, the 2020 election and other world events.

The account also weighed in on Trump's assassination attempt in July, calling on Vice President Kamala Harris to visit those injured at the Pennsylvania Trump rally, because ""Trump will never do anything for them.""

""You and Biden should visit the injured people in the hospital from the Trump rally and attend the funeral of the murdered fireman. Trump will never do anything for them....show the world what compassion and humanity is all about,"" he said in a reply message to Harris' account on July 17.

In another X post published on April 22, Routh appeared to quote a commonly used phrase by the Harris campaign, declaring, ""DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose.""

""Your campaign should be called something like KADAF. Keep America democratic and free. Trumps should be MASA ...make Americans slaves again master. DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose. We cannot afford to fail. The world is counting on us to show the way,"" the account posted ahead of Biden dropping out of the race in July and Harris ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket.

During Trump's interview with Fox Digital, he cited rhetoric from Democrats describing him as a ""threat to democracy"" as a likely motivation for the attacks against him in recent weeks. He argued that while Democrats such as Biden and Harris call him a ""threat to democracy,"" they described themselves as ""unity"" leaders.

RYAN ROUTH, ARMED MAN ARRESTED AT TRUMP GOLF COURSE, POSTED PROLIFICALLY ABOUT TRUMP, POLITICS

""They are the opposite,"" Trump said. ""These are people that want to destroy our country.""

The X account appearing to belong to Routh also repeatedly issued messages related to the war in Ukraine, posting to X that he was ready to fly to Ukraine to fight Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""I am flying to Ukraine to fight. We need to launch a media campaign to encourage every human around the globe to meet in Ukraine and join in the fight. We need hundreds of thousands of civilians to make the cost of war high for putin and a flood of fighters,"" he posted on Feb. 17, 2022.

Following repeated messages declaring his intention to fight on behalf of Ukraine, he posted in April that he was in Kyiv.

""I am here in kyiv and want to use Independence Park to create a tent city of all the foreigners here in support to get thousands more foreign civilians to come and support Ukraine,"" the account posted.

Routh also has a lengthy rap sheet stretching out decades, most notably in North Carolina, where he racked up dozens of arrests for car infractions, such as driving without insurance, driving without a license and driving with an expired registration.

DONALD TRUMP SAFE AFTER SHOTS FIRED OUTSIDE PALM BEACH GOLF CLUB

In 2002, Routh made local headlines when he was arrested at his roofing company's office following a three-hour standoff with police, the Greensboro News & Record reported at the time. Routh had been pulled over by police during a traffic stop and put his hand on a gun during the stop, sparking him to drive to United Roofing and barricade himself in the building. He was ultimately arrested without incident.

Fast-forward to Sunday afternoon, Routh was arrested after allegedly pointing a rifle through a chain-link fence, aiming it toward where Trump was playing golf, authorities said.

Routh fled the scene in his car but was arrested on I-95.

He appeared in federal court Monday morning wearing shackles and jail scrubs. He was seen laughing and smiling ahead of his first court appearance.

He faces charges of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Authorities said he could be hit with additional charges.

Shortly following the attempt, Trump reassured supporters he was ""safe and well,"" while vowing to ""never surrender.""

""There were gunshots in my vicinity but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!"" he posted in a campaign message. ""Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Jeffries' office regarding his X post and Trump's comments blaming Democratic rhetoric for the attempt Sunday but did not immediately receive a reply."
Disney honcho Dana Walden dismisses notion her close friendship with Kamala Harris affected debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/disney-honcho-dana-walden-dismisses-notion-her-close-friendship-kamala-harris-affected-debate,2024-09-16T16:59:58Z,"Former President Trump speaks about the first presidential debate against Vice President Kamala Harris from Rancho Palos, California.

Disney honcho Dana Walden on Sunday dismissed concerns that her close friendship with Vice President Kamala Harris resulted in a biased ABC Presidential Debate.

Walden, a senior Disney executive whose portfolio includes ABC News, is one of Harris' ""extraordinary friends,"" according to a report in the New York Times. Walden and Harris have known each other since 1994, while their husbands, Matt Walden and Doug Emhoff, have known each other since the 1980s.

There has been a harsh spotlight on ABC on the heels of last week's debate, when former President Trump was repeatedly fact-checked while Harris was not. When Walden attended the Emmy Awards, a reporter from Variety asked her about attacks from the ""far-right"" who have said her close friendship with Harris affected the debate.

""You know I really don't want to dignify it with much of a response,"" Walden said.

DAVID MUIR'S ABC NEWSCAST WAS 100% POSITIVE ABOUT HARRIS, 93% NEGATIVE ABOUT TRUMP AHEAD OF DEBATE: STUDY

""I have the highest regard for everyone at ABC News. It's the most professional organization, the most top-notch journalists,"" she continued. ""It doesn't really dignify much of a response.""

Moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis fact-checked Trump five times without ever correcting Harris. Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt wrote that the ""journalistic reputations of Muir and Davis are the most scarred by the fiasco,"" but ""the damage will extend to both the ABC and Disney brands"" because the moderators failed to ask more critical questions of Harris.

Media Research Center founder Brent Bozell said on ""The Brent Bozell Show"" podcast that Harris had a clear advantage that should have been apparent after his researchers found that ABC's evening newscast has been more ""positive towards Harris and the most hostile to Trump"" compared to evening newscasts on NBC and CBS.

""Whoever recommended that [Trump] do that debate on ABC should be fired. It was about the worst decision that could have been made,"" Bozell said on Wednesday when discussing what he feels are the Disney-owned network's biases.

CNN PANEL CLASHES AFTER DEMOCRATIC GUEST SUGGESTS DEBATE MODERATORS WERE 'HARSHER' ON TRUMP

Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America sent a letter to ABC News president Almin Karamehmedovic, along with Muir and Davis, urging the network to issue a correction about a ""100% inaccurate"" abortion claim made during the debate during one of the fact-checks on Trump.

Walden has donated to dozens of Democrats and has contributed to Harris' political campaigns since at least 2003.

Last month, Walden was described as a ""Hollywood winner"" in the rapid ascension of Harris to de facto Democratic nominee, according to a Puck report. Harris has extensive ties to the entertainment community, but few ""go as far back with Harris as Walden does, nor do they enjoy the perch and purview Walden does at Disney,"" the report said.

ABC previously told the New York Times that Walden, who is Disney's highest-ranking television executive, does not weigh in on editorial decisions.

BILL MAHER MAKES THIS BOLD 2024 PREDICTION AFTER TRUMP-HARRIS DEBATE

Walden is among the insider candidates who could take over as the next Disney CEO when Bob Iger's contract expires in 2026, according to reports, and her coziness with a possible future president likely doesn't hurt her stock.

"Trump blames Biden-Harris 'rhetoric' for latest assassination attempt, says he will 'save the country'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blames-biden-harris-rhetoric-latest-assassination-attempt-says-he-save-country,2024-09-16T14:19:32Z,"EXCLUSIVE: Former President Trump said President Biden and Vice President Harris' ""rhetoric"" is what is causing him to be ""shot at,"" following the second assassination attempt against him since July, while telling Fox News Digital that the suspected gunman ""acted"" on ""highly inflammatory language"" of Democrats.

Trump spoke exclusively with Fox News Digital Monday morning, just a day after he was rushed off of the golf course at Trump International in West Palm Beach, Fla., after the Secret Service discovered a gunman in the bushes.

WHO IS RYAN WESLEY ROUTH: ALLEGED GUNMAN AT TRUMP GOLF CLUB

The suspected gunman, Ryan Wesley Routh, had an AK-47 style rifle pointing through the chain-link fence out toward the green; a go-pro camera; and two backpacks. He ran from the scene but was pulled over and arrested on I-95.

Authorities are treating the episode as an apparent assassination attempt against Trump.

Trump was safe following the second assassination attempt against him since July.

""He believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it,"" Trump said of the gunman in an interview with Fox News Digital. ""Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country -- both from the inside and out.""

Trump pointed to Biden and Harris' past comments casting Trump as a ""threat to democracy,"" while telling Americans they are ""unity"" leaders.

""They are the opposite,"" Trump said. ""These are people that want to destroy our country.""

He added: ""It is called the enemy from within. They are the real threat.""

A background check on the name given by officials, Ryan Wesley Routh, revealed that he currently lives in Hawaii and has faced dozens of run-ins with police, stretching back to at least the 1990s.

Routh previously echoed Biden and Harris' anti-Trump comments, that ""Democracy is on the ballot"" on his social media pages this year, and that Democrats ""cannot lose.""

TRUMP SAFE AFTER 'GUNSHOTS IN HIS VICINITY,' CAMPAIGN SAYS

Routh posted about politics often and donated to only Democrat candidates and causes.

""They do it with a combination of rhetoric and lawsuits they wrap me up in,"" Trump said. ""These are the things that dangerous fools, like the shooter, listen to -- that is the rhetoric they listen to, and the same with the first one.""

Democrats, meanwhile, have repeatedly blamed Trump for raising the temperature and have accused him of being a ""threat to democracy,"" particularly due to his handling of the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.

The White House, Harris' campaign, and the office of Minnesota Gov. Time Walz, Harris' running mate, did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.

Trump also said Biden and Harris' policies are ""destroying"" the country ""by allowing millions of very dangerous migrants to pour into it and destroying our country and cities.""

""On the outside, we are weak and feeble and not respected by the world anymore,"" Trump said.

Meanwhile, reflecting back on the debate against Harris last week, Trump slammed the media.

""The media is made up of fools that will spew [Democrats'] garbage and spew their sick philosophies and will protect them at all costs, and they can't believe they get away with it,"" Trump said. ""Democrats are totally protected by the media.""

Trump said the debate on ABC News last week ""was so biased and so out of control.""

""Harris was the one lying about Project 2025, she lied about abortion, she lied about everything,"" Trump said. ""She was correcting me.""

""It was three against one,"" he said. ""I was surprised at David Muir. I thought he was a high-quality person, but he is just a sleeze like the rest of them.""

But with just 50 days until Election Day, Trump warned Democrats to watch their rhetoric.

""They use highly inflammatory language,"" he said. ""I can use it too -- far better than they can -- but I don't."""

""There is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world, the first time this century,"" Harris claimed during the debate.

ABC News' David Muir and Linsey Davis hosted the first presidential debate between Harris and Donald Trump on Tuesday. Davis and Muir fact-checked Donald Trump multiple times during the debate but failed to fact-check Harris at all.

""Our fact-checkers found that to be false,"" Raddatz said during the interview on Sunday. ""There are currently 900 U.S. military personnel in Syria, 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq. All have been under regular threat from drones and missiles for months. We also have action in the Red Sea. Also, every single day, the Navy SEALs, Delta Forces special operators can be part of any sort of deadly raid.""

We are in a world where there are all sorts of conflicts, and it's all the more reason we need somebody who's serious and who supports the military,"" Healey responded.

Raddatz jumped in again and repeated what Harris had said.

""You say she demonstrated her ability to be commander in chief, but did she not know about these people in Syria and Iraq? Why would she say that?"" Raddatz said.

Healey argued that Donald Trump ""stands with Vladimir Putin.""

""She already did, Martha,"" Healey said. ""What she said is, 'let's go back to Roe.'""

ABC's Davis admitted in a post-debate interview that her fact-checking of Trump was influenced by the CNN debate that went disastrously for President Biden in June.

Oregon DMV admits to wrongfully registering hundreds of non-citizens to vote,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/oregon-dmv-admits-wrongfully-registering-hundreds-non-citizens-vote,2024-09-15T18:23:41Z,"Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has more on efforts to ensure the integrity of the 2024 presidential election on 'Fox News Live.'

The Oregon DMV admitted on Friday to wrongfully registering at least 306 non-citizens to vote in U.S. elections.

The DMV says the wrongful registrations have occurred since 2021 and were the result of a program that automatically registered anyone who obtained a driver's license or state ID. State officials say they expect to find more wrongful registrations ahead of Election Day.

Oregon has allowed non-citizens to obtain diver's licenses since 2019. Of the 306 people identified, just two have cast ballots in an election since 2021.

Oregon Secretary of State LaVonne Griffin-Valade says the 306 people ""will be notified by mail that they will not receive a ballot unless they demonstrate that they are eligible to vote.""

HARRIS REPEATS DEBUNKED CLAIM TRUMP WANTS TO 'BAN' ABORTION

Griffin-Valade defended the state's automatic voter registration program despite the lapse. Gov. Tina Kotek also argued the discovery will ""not impact"" the 2024 election.

""While this error is regrettable, the secretary and the Elections Division stand by automatic voter registration and its many benefits,"" Griffin-Valade said.

""The error in data entry which may have affected the voter eligibility of some Oregonian's voter registration was discovered because the Oregon DMV and the secretary of state were doing their due diligence ahead of the 2024 election,"" Kotek said in another statement. ""My office will continue to closely monitor the situation. This situation will not impact the 2024 election in any way.""

Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, who has led a purge of illegal voter registration in Ohio throughout the year, told Fox News Digital that so-called automatic voter registration is a problem across the country.

""This is why we have resisted so-called automatic voter registration in Ohio. We have multiple really convenient ways to register in Ohio, but there are people who should not be registered, like non-citizens, and there are people who simply don't want to be registered,"" LaRose said.

He also highlighted the obstacles state offices face when trying to verify voter rolls. LaRose says Ohio first checks against DMV data, but it often can't determine a registrant's status.

The second check is the federal Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database, a list of non-citizen data maintained by the Department of Homeland Security. States have to pay $1.50 for each query of the database, however, and finding the information required to properly search the data is cumbersome, LaRose says.

LaRose added that he and other election officials are seeking access to more DHS data that would allow for a more accurate audit of voter rolls, but his requests have so far been refused.

""I don't usually assume people's intentions, but it would seem they don't want us to use that information to identify non-citizens,"" LaRose told Fox."

Self-described ""true-blue Democrat"" Gloria Romero is joining the cluster of party members who have left for the GOP, and one other prominent lifelong Democrat's Trump endorsement compelled her to take the leap.

Speaking to Fox News' Pete Hegseth on Sunday, she spelled out a handful of reasons behind her exit, including the alleged ""lawfare"" against former President Trump and Democrats' ""denial of school opportunities"" for low-income children.

In a recent New York Post op-ed, Romero also spelled out her issues with Vice President Kamala Harris, slamming her tenure as California attorney general as ""unimpressive"" and adding that her ""manipulated rise"" aligns with the Democratic Party's ""giant leap toward authoritarianism and censorship.""

""The Democratic Party has just lurched to the extreme left. It's been captured by [what] many call the Hamas caucus of the Democratic Party, in order to win a swing state.""

"Data shows Texas doctors perform abortions to save life of the mother, despite claims from politicians, media",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/data-shows-texas-doctors-perform-abortions-save-life-mother-despite-claims-from-politicians-media,2024-09-15T10:08:59Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Despite claims from politicians, the media and abortion activists that female health in Texas is at risk with pro-life laws on the books, new numbers released by the state show that doctors do intervene in cases when the life of the mother is at risk.

The latest data from the Texas Health and Human Services Commission on induced terminations of pregnancies (HHSC ITOP) shows that doctors in Texas performed 113 abortions to save pregnant women's lives in the 22 months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022.

Texas has a pro-life law that went into effect shortly after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which prevents elective abortions beginning at conception with an exception for medically necessary abortions when the pregnancy causes ""a life-threatening physical condition aggravated by, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless the abortion is performed or induced."" Additionally, every state in the country with a pro-life law includes an exception for the life of the mother.

Vice President Kamala Harris and her campaign have previously claimed that doctors are hindered from performing abortions in the case of a pro-life law when the pregnancy puts a woman's life at risk.

When the Texas Supreme Court ruled in May that physicians may use ""reasonable medical judgment"" to determine whether a pregnancy requires a medically necessary abortion, Harris tweeted: ""This Texas Supreme Court ruling means women will continue to be denied access to necessary medical care, putting their health and lives at risk. To the women of Texas: Know you are not alone. @POTUS and I will continue to fight for reproductive freedom.""

When reached for comment, the Harris campaign pointed to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey in which 68% of OBGYNs said the Dobbs ruling has worsened their ability to manage pregnancy-related emergencies and 64% said the decision has worsened pregnancy-related mortality.

""The latest report reaffirms that Kamala Harris' dire claims about Texas' protective abortion laws are completely baseless,"" Amy O'Donnell, Texas Alliance for Life's communications director, said of the data in a press release. ""Texas' laws continue to save unborn babies from abortion while also protecting women's lives in those rare and tragic cases where pregnancy endangers a pregnant woman's life or health.""

ELON MUSK RIPS INTO KAMALA HARRIS FOR 'LYING' ABOUT TRUMP'S ABORTION POSITION

""Since the Court overturned Roe, no doctor has been prosecuted by a district attorney, sanctioned by the Texas Medical Board, or sued by the Attorney General, and no pregnant woman has lost her life because of the provisions of Texas' abortion laws, even with more than 360,000 live births in Texas each year,"" O'Donnell added.

Dr. Ingrid Skop, vice president and director of medical affairs at Charlotte Lozier Institute, told Fox News Digital that ""intentional media misinformation"" about Texas pro-life laws initially left many physicians confused and fearful, but that the situation has improved after the Texas Medical Board and the Texas Supreme Court issued guidance to physicians, reassuring them that they may use their ""reasonable medical judgment"" to determine when to intervene, and the risk of maternal death does not need to be ""imminent.""

""The Texas Induced Terminations of Pregnancy (ITOP) Reports also demonstrate that physicians have been intervening in the rare circumstances when an abortion is necessary to save the life of a mother,"" she said. ""In 2023, 62 abortions were performed in hospitals. 77% were performed by labor induction and only 6% by dilation and evacuation (dismemberment) abortion. 90% were performed between 13- and 25-weeks post-fertilization.""

""Similarly, the data for the first four months of 2024 demonstrates that 32 abortions have been performed,"" she added. ""Unborn life is being protected in Texas, but the state also prioritizes the life of the mother and allows physicians to provide quality care when severe complications arise.""

""Med Ed"" efforts in Texas, as well as Florida, South Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Kentucky aim to stop the abortion lobby from spreading what Kelsey Pritchard, the director of state public affairs for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, called misinformation that confuses doctors and harms women.

KAMALA HARRIS TWEET ON ABORTION RIGHTS SLAMMED BY LIBERALS: 'LITERALLY THE EMBODIMENT OF THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS'

""In Texas, specifically, with this Texas MedEd rule, they made it clear that doctors can continue to rely on their reasonable medical judgment,"" Pritchard said. ""They also made it clear that you should not wait until a woman is actually at the point where her life is in danger. If there is a foreseeable threat, then that allows doctors to act. You don't have to wait until it's a dangerous situation. I think that's a very important point in Texas and in all the pro-life states.""

Pritchard said the talking point is a tactic by Democrats to distract from their push to provide all-trimester abortion, which only 10% of Americans support, according to SBA Pro-Life data. A Gallup survey in May estimated 35 percent of Americans support abortion in all circumstances, verus 50 percent supporting it under certain circumstances. Just 12 percent in that poll were in favor of it being totally illegal.

""I think the abortion lobby has been telling this lie for a while now that if there is a pro-life law that will put women in danger and women will die because they won't be able to get emergency care,"" she said. ""That's something they've said for a long time, but we really saw it ramp up with Dobbs, and it has really become their number one talking point, their number one lie in red states, particularly.""

""Whether it's a ballot measure fight, a legislative fight or it's a candidate, a Democrat, talking about abortion, this is the number line they go to because they know that the Democrat agenda for all trimester abortion is unpopular with Americans widely,"" she added. ""They use this as the justification for: 'Oh, we can't have any limits, we can't at any point, not in the seventh, eighth, ninth month of pregnancy even, you have to be able to have abortion at all points because, you're putting women in danger.'""

In Florida, Planned Parenthood employee Laura Goodhue said Florida's six-week abortion ban would create a ""public health crisis"" in the state, while Democratic State Sen. Lauren Book said ""women and girls will die"" as a result of the law.

KAMALA HARRIS TORN APART BY PRO-LIFERS FOR HISTORIC TRIP TO ABORTION CLINIC: 'NORMALIZATION OF EVIL'

In June, the Arizona Democratic AG issued guidance clarifying that the 15-week abortion law does not impede a pregnant woman's ability to receive treatment when experiencing a miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy or another health emergency. But, pro-choice groups posted ads that claimed women's lives were at risk. President Biden himself claimed ""women's lives are in danger"" in regard to the law.

Pritchard said Democrats and the abortion lobby are the ones putting women's lives in danger by telling such ""lies.""

""That lie is what is putting women in danger, it is what has led some women to delay seeking care,"" she said. ""We've heard some of these horror stories where there are a handful of doctors that are confused about their ability to provide care, like the story of a woman who was told to wait in her car till she was bleeding profusely. That is wrong and those situations are really often created by this misinformation.""

""I would hope that pro-choice, pro-life, we could all agree that this is wrong and that women need to understand the truth, doctors need to understand the truth that lifesaving care is as available now as it has always been,"" she added."
UK government accused of cracking down on free speech: 'think before you post',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-government-accused-cracking-down-free-speech-think-before-you-post,2024-09-14T15:34:46Z,"LONDON - Britain is facing a free speech crisis as the new left-wing government, overzealous police and courts crackdown on freedom of expression.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the leader of the ruling Labour Party, and his government of barely two months have been accused of rolling back free speech protections on safety grounds and failing to root out selective enforcement of laws.

""Every Brit fundamentally has the right to free speech, but for several years now, we've seen a growing trend,"" Lois McLatchie Miller, Senior Legal Communications Officer for Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) U.K., told Fox News Digital. ""It's only now becoming widely recognized that certain groups, depending on their beliefs, seem to have their free speech curtailed much more easily than others with different viewpoints.""

NEW ONLINE 'MISINFORMATION' BILL SLAMMED AS 'BIGGEST ATTACK' ON FREEDOMS IN AUSTRALIA

Widespread riots in the streets of England last month and a heavy-handed approach in response to the social unrest reignited the debate about free speech.

The U.K. has been grappling with harsh policing of online speech for years. In 2019, ex-police officer Harry Miller was investigated over social media posts deemed transphobic for questioning whether transgender women were real women. Miller's posts were recorded by the police as a ""non-crime hate incident,"" prompting him to challenge the designation in court. In 2020, the U.K. court ruled in Miller's favor but stopped short of changing the guidelines that allow police to pursue people over comments made online.

During a speech to parliament, Reform Party leader Nigel Farage complained of the double standards in applying the law evenly. Farage wrote on X ""Establishment MPs can heckle me all they like, but the British people are angry that we are living through a two-tier policing and justice system.""

Last month, the government issued a direct reminder of such laws and warned its citizens to be mindful of posting content deemed offensive and threatening with imprisonment. The Crown Prosecution Service posted a warning to social media platform X, which was amplified by the government's official social media accounts, warning citizens, ""Think before you post!""

Remind those close to you to share responsibly or face the consequences."" The post added: ""The British government is cracking down on people who share social media posts about the U.K. riots that it judges are 'likely to start racial hatred.'""

The government simultaneously began working on measures to force social media companies to suppress perceived ""fake news"" and legal content deemed harmful, to avoid fueling social unrest. The new measures would expand the scope of Britain's Online Safety Act by targeting and making social media companies liable for ""legal but harmful"" content.

UK LOOKS TO TREAT MISOGYNY AS EXTREMIST VIOLENCE, RAISING FREE SPEECH CRACKDOWN CONCERNS

London Mayor Sadiq Khan encouraged the Stammer government to swiftly implement changes to the online safety law, saying that currently, ""it's not fit for purpose.""

""I think very swiftly the government has realized there needs to be amendments to the Online Safety Act,"" Khan said in an interview with the Guardian. ""I think what the government should do very quickly is check if it is fit for purpose. I think it's not fit for purpose.""

But concerns over free speech in the U.K. extend beyond online, with double standards applied to different viewpoints and political protests.

""This isn't 1984, but 2024.""

Last weekend, two pro-Israel counter-protesters, Mark Birbeck and Niyak Ghorbani, carrying a ""Hamas is terrorist"" sign, were arrested during the pro-Hamas march in London on suspicion of breach of peace. The counter-protesters' presence allegedly led to the march being paused, and they were arrested following a struggle with police officers.

Ghorbani is a well-known anti-Hamas Iranian dissident whom London's Metropolitan Police tried to ban from attending future anti-Israel protests as part of his bail conditions after he was arrested for opposing the protests. A court rebuked the force and ruled in April that such bail conditions were neither proportionate nor necessary. The moniker 'Two-tier Kier' is how some on social media have responded to the new prime minister's policies.

""On one hand, we see groups like environmental protesters, such as Stop Oil activists, or pro-Palestinian, and even in some cases, pro-Hamas protesters being given a wide berth to express their beliefs, sometimes using very violent language,"" Lois said. ""Yet, when we consider different types of protests, for example, Christians going out to pray near places of worship, they often face much stricter restrictions.""

For example, Dia Moodley, a Christian pastor who occasionally engages in street evangelism, was forced to sue the local police after the force forbade him from ""passing comments on any other religion or comparing them to Christianity"" and ""passing comments on beliefs held by Atheists or those who believe in evolution."" Moodley won in court earlier this year, and the police admitted that the restrictions on free speech imposed on Moodley were ""disproportionate.""

'Two-tier Kier' is how some on social media have responded to the new prime minister's policies.

Adam Smith-Connor, a Christian military veteran, meanwhile, is set to appear in court next week after being fined and criminally prosecuted over praying silently near an abortion facility. Local authorities alleged that Smith-Connor's silent prayer violated the so-called ""buffer zone,"" a designated area where individuals are allowed to express approval or disapproval of abortion.

""Silent prayer is not, and can never be, a crime. Yet, the prosecution of Adam Smith-Connor - who served in Afghanistan to uphold fundamental freedoms for everyone - shows an authoritarian move towards 'thought-policing' in the U.K. This isn't 1984, but 2024. And yet, the determination of the state to clamp down hard on even silent Christian beliefs - while protecting the free expression of others with different views - is clearly exposed,"" said McLatchie Miller.

Yet, there is a growing backlash against the government's anti-free speech stance, particularly the decision to pause the implementation and potentially scrap entirely the free speech law in higher education over safety concerns.

Over 600 academics and intellectuals, including seven Nobel laureates, signed a letter urging the government to reconsider the decision to shelve the law, the Times of London reported. The law was a flagship policy passed by the previous Conservative government to protect students' and academics' free speech rights on campus.

""The decision to halt [the act] appears to reflect the view, widespread among opponents, that there is no 'free speech problem' in U.K. universities. Nothing could be more false. Hundreds of academics and students have been hounded, censured, silenced or even sacked over the last 20 years for the expression of legal opinions,"" the letter read."
Arizona's repeal of 1864 ban on nearly all abortions goes into effect,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/arizonas-repeal-of-1864-ban-on-nearly-all-abortions-goes-into-effect,2024-09-14T12:52:34Z,"Fox News contributor Kellyanne Conway discusses the Arizona abortion ruling and weighs how the issue will factor into the 2024 presidential election.

Arizona's Civil War-era ban on nearly all abortions is officially being repealed on Saturday.

The long-dormant 1864 law, which predated Arizona's statehood, had no exceptions for rape and incest, only for the life of the mother.

The 160-year-old law went into effect after the repeal of Roe vs. Wade in 2022 but faced court challenges which prevented it from being enforced.

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE ARIZONA SUPREME COURT'S REINSTATEMENT OF AN 1864 NEAR-TOTAL ABORTION BAN

The ban was held up by the Arizona Supreme Court in April, throwing out an earlier lower-court decision that concluded doctors couldn't be charged for performing abortions in the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.

But the decision sparked backlash in the battleground Grand Canyon State, with Democratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs calling on the state legislature to repeal the ban.

Republicans hold a narrow majority in both chambers, but House Democrats were then able to garner the support of three Republicans to pass the repeal legislation in April following two previous attempts, sending the measure to the Senate for consideration. Two GOP senators joined with Democrats a week later to grant final approval and then Hobbs signed the bill in May, declaring it was just the beginning of a fight to protect reproductive health care in Arizona.

""I will continue doing everything in my power to protect reproductive freedoms, because I trust women to make the decisions that are best for them, and know politicians do not belong in the doctor's office,"" Hobbs said in a statement.

Arizona House Speaker Ben Toma, a Republican, said at the time that he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the bill's passing.

""We should not have rushed this bill through the legislative process,"" he said in a statement shared with Fox News Digital. ""The pre-Roe law has been on the books for decades and was readopted in 1977 by Democrats and Republicans in the State Legislature and signed by Democrat Gov. Raul Castro.

ARIZONA HOUSE LAWMAKERS PASS BILL TO REPEAL 1864 ABORTION BAN

""It would have been prudent and responsible to allow the courts to decide the constitutionality of the pre-Roe law. Instead, we are rushing to judgment for reasons I simply cannot understand.""

The state's internal tussle over the issue was thrust into the national spotlight in March when Arizona state Sen. Eva Burch announced on the state Senate floor that she planned to have an abortion after learning that her pregnancy was not viable.

Arizona law now allows abortions until 15 weeks. After that, there is an exception to save the life of the mother, but missing are exceptions for cases of rape or incest after the 15-week mark.

The state requires those seeking an abortion prior to the 15-week mark to have an ultrasound at least 24 hours before the procedure and to be given the opportunity to view it. Minors must have either parental consent or authorization from a state judge, except in cases of incest or when their life is at risk.

Voters will decide on whether to add the right to abortion to the state constitution when they have their say on Proposition 139 in the general election.

The measure secured a spot on the ballot after the pro-abortion group Arizona for Abortion Access, secured nearly 578,000 signatures, well over the 383,923 required from registered voters.

If voters approve the measure, abortions would be allowed until fetal viability -- the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb, typically around 24 weeks. It also would allow abortions after that time in cases where the mother's physical or mental health is in jeopardy."

(Courtesy: ABC News)

The Nebraska Supreme Court has set up a major abortion policy showdown for election day, approving two competing ballot measures to go before voters.

One ballot measure, put forward by abortion advocates, would enshrine a fundamental right to abortion ""until fetal viability."" The other measure, put forward by abortion opponents, would codify the state's current 12-week abortion ban into the state's constitution.

Current Nebraska law allows for exceptions in the case of rape, incest or the life of the mother.

Anti-abortion groups had filed a pair of lawsuits challenging the competing ballot measure, arguing it violated state policy requiring that such measures pertain to only one subject.

The lawsuits argued the ballot measure deals with abortion rights until viability, abortion rights after viability to protect a woman's health, and whether the state should be allowed to regulate abortion, amounting to three separate issues.

TRUMP AND HARRIS ON COLLISION COURSE AS 2024 CAMPAIGN ENTERS FINAL STRETCH

The state Supreme Court struck down those challenges in a Friday ruling, allowing the measure to appear on ballots.

Organizers for each ballot measure turned in more than 200,000 signatures supporting them, well over the 123,000 requirements.

The court battle comes as Democrats across the country seek to use abortion as a key issue to outplay Republicans. The effort was on full display during last week's presidential debate, with Vice President Kamala Harris blasting the end of Roe v. Wade under former President Trump.

Harris argued Trump would sign a national abortion ban into law if he is elected in November. Trump rejected that claim and instead pointed to ballot measures like the ones now playing out in Nebraska.

VOTERS GIVE HARRIS THE DEBATE WIN, BUT PRAISE TRUMP ON POLICY: SHE GOT UNDER HIS SKIN

""As far as the abortion ban, no, I'm not in favor of an abortion ban, but it doesn't matter, because this issue has now been taken over by the states,"" Trump said.

""I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother,"" he said. ""I believe strongly in it. Ronald Reagan did also. Eighty-five percent of Republicans knew exceptions are very important,"" he said.

Many states have adopted ballot measures on abortion since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in 2022. Some, like California, enshrined abortion rights more firmly into law. Others, like Louisiana, paved the way for more restrictions on abortion."

As the dust is settling from the first debate between President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the political elites are failing to understand how badly Harris failed to achieve her objectives.

Nothing better illustrates the gap between reality and our political elite (including a number of famous Republicans) than their complete misreading of what happened in the clash between the ABC News-Harris Team and the lone opponent, President Trump.

Every Trump supporter and independent witnessed the astounding dishonesty of ABC's moderators (who were actually active debaters helping Harris take on President Trump). Their reaction has been outrage and, in some cases, a condemnation of ABC and Vice President Harris.

FOUR WAYS TRUMP CAN GET TO A 96% CHANCE OF WINNING

One observer said to me ""they didn't have to give her the questions, she was clearly giving them the questions."" The fact that one of her closest friends is also in charge of ABC News just further confirmed for many Americans that the fix was in and the whole thing was rigged.

Trump's base is 48 percent of Americans who feel there is a corrupt establishment trying to control their lives and rip them off. The spectacle of ABC News so blatantly rigging the fight just confirmed everything they already believed and firmly placed Harris in the corrupt establishment wing. Walking through three airports on Thursday, I was greeted by dozens of people who were infuriated by the debate and bitterly angry at how stupid Harris thinks they are.

The fact is, authenticity beats wearing a mask. Being yourself beats trying to be the person your consultants have trained you to be. This has always been true in American politics.

Harris further hurt herself by spending a large part of her listening time making faces and looking cute. It was the behavior of a spoiled teenager, not a commander-in-chief.

The elites value style over substance. They would like everyone to behave as though they were at a Washington cocktail party.

MORNING GLORY: THE WORST DEBATE IN THE HISTORY OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES

Most Americans are not so highfalutin. Most Americans do not appreciate well-dressed, clever people treating them as if they are ignorant and incapable of realizing when they are being manipulated and lied to.

The simple fact is: Vice President Harris can't tell the truth, because an honest admission of her beliefs - and the failures of the last three-and-a-half years - would doom her campaign. The ABC team did all it could to stop President Trump from telling the truth about her. The most glaring example was the blunt intervention that there were no states in which babies could be left to die after they were born. That was an outright lie. The truth is that in Tim Walz's Minnesota at least eight babies have been left to die after botched abortions. It is a matter of public record. If you want a pro-infanticide vice president, then ""Tampon Tim"" is your guy.

President Trump's great attraction to the supporters who have been with him through thick and thin is precisely that he is not an effete, fawning, dishonest, and manipulative cretin from the governing class. Remember, they've stuck with him through the Russia hoax, a multiyear investigation, two impeachments, multiple lawsuits, and slanderous attacks by the leftwing propaganda media.

You can like him or dislike him, admire him or disdain him, but what you get is the authentic Trump.

UNDECIDED VOTERS NOT SWAYED BY LAST DEBATE, 'STILL ON THE FENCE' ABOUT THE ELECTION: REPORT

So, we had a debate between the privileged, protected elitist Princess of the Left and a down-to-earth guy who people understand. It isn't that President Trump can't function in high society and country clubs. He owns country clubs (Callista and I see him occasionally at Trump National in Washington). He can afford as many tuxedos as any politician in the country. But he is a regular guy who never hides who he really is.

The fact is, authenticity beats wearing a mask. Being yourself beats trying to be the person your consultants have trained you to be. This has always been true in American politics.

The elites completely misread the outcome of the debate because they valued style over substance. Furthermore, they expected and accepted that ABC would be dishonest, one-sided and arrogantly abrasive. As elitists, they figured that an outsider like President Trump deserved that kind of treatment.

The great Democratic political consultant Joe Napolitan warned, ""never underestimate the intelligence of the American people nor overestimate the amount of information they have.""

Vice President Kamala Harris spoke for around a half hour to a packed crowd at the McHale Athletic Center of Wilkes University in Pennsylvania on Friday, where she was interrupted at least twice by pro-Palestinian protesters.

""You're supporting a war criminal,"" one protester shouted about two-thirds of the way into her speech.

A second appeared shortly after the first was ushered out, and shouted for several minutes until he also was removed, crying out ""Free Palestine"" as he was led past the press cordon.

In response, Harris said, ""I respect your voice, but right now, I am speaking,"" before moving on with the rest of her address over the interjector's din.

Harris had been introduced by Mary Grace, a local nurse who said she was a longtime Republican who could not support former President Trump.

After thanking Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr., D-Pa., Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Wilkes-Barre Democratic mayor George Brown, all of whom preceded her remarks, she began the crux of her remarks by referencing the ABC News debate from earlier in the week.

""I take it many people here watched it,"" she said, as the reference drew applause.

""You'll remember that night I talked about issues that matter to families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in America's small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom. And keeping our nation safe and secure. But that is not what we heard from Donald Trump. Instead, it was the same old show, the same tired playbook we've heard for years with no plan, no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people. Well, folks, it's time to turn the page.""

Harris claimed Trump will give billionaires and large corporations ""massive"" tax cuts while also taking a scalpel to entitlements.

She also said the Republican wants to impose a ""Trump sales tax,"" which some observers claim to be a reference to the former president's foreign tariff plans.

Harris also spoke about national division, saying ""we are not going back"" to past years, and instead called for a ""new way forward.""

""We need a President of the United States who works for all the American people and that just stops with all the trying to divide us,"" she said.

""People are exhausted with that stuff.""

She also called herself the ""underdog"" in the race, predicting it will be tight in the crucial Commonwealth in which she spoke.

""So Pennsylvania, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom?"" Harris asked

Making the trek north on I-81 from Harrisburg, Shapiro - who many believed was the proverbial runner-up to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in Harris' running mate consideration - offered a booming endorsement shortly before the candidate came onstage.

""We have proved ... that we can 'get sh -- done'!"" Shapiro shouted, referencing his gubernatorial administration's edgy slogan of sorts.

""[We've invested] a historic amount in our public schools... when those kids go to and from schools, they deserve to live in safe communities,"" he added.

""We want everyone to know that you are valued here, whether you choose to be a lawyer or a laborer, we want you to know you belong here [in Pennsylvania].""

""Where you come from, who you love, and who you pray to - you belong and I got your back,"" Shapiro went on, adding Harris' campaign offers a similar vision.

""She and I have both been prosecutors,"" said Shapiro, who served as the separately-elected attorney general during the governorship of predecessor Tom Wolf.

""Kamala Harris has always been for the people... She stood up for our union sisters and brothers.

This time borrowing a line instead from Harris, Shapiro added of Trump's tenure in the White House, ""we are not going back to that.""

""When you go back and look at his record, it was ... less jobs and a whole lot less freedom when Donald Trump was in charge,"" he said, invoking the abortion issue and claiming women lost ""basic freedom to make decisions about their own bodies.""

Shapiro went on to point to Philadelphia, just 100 miles on the other end of the Northeast Extension from where he spoke, saying that Americans ""declared our independence from a king [there, once] and we are not going back.""

In response to Harris visiting the Commonwealth, PA Trump Team spokesman Kush Desai told Fox News Digital that Pennsylvanians are fed up with the rising costs of groceries, gas, and utilities thanks to the Harris-Biden administration's disastrous inflationary, anti-energy agenda.""

""The choice between another four years of retirees scraping by off ramen under Kamala or a return to the peace, prosperity, and stability of the Trump administration couldn't be easier for Pennsylvanians.""

At the debate in Philadelphia, Harris made reference to the approximate 800,000 Polish-Americans who reside in Pennsylvania. Outside Port Richmond and the Philadelphia area, the counties in and around where Harris rallied Friday have a sizeable such population.

In Wilkes-Barre's Luzerne County, about one-sixth of the population is Polish American, and cities like Nanticoke, Hazleton and Shamokin - in nearby Northumberland County - also host sizable communities.

In that regard, when asked, Desai said Trump is an ""especially easy choice"" for Pennsylvania's Polish-Americans, noting his ""blossoming friendship"" with Polish President Andrzej Duda and his work with Warsaw to build a stronger alliance, including within their shared NATO status.

At the debate, Harris appeared to draw a connection between the Polish-American electorate and her criticisms of how Trump would end the war in Ukraine - which borders Poland:

""Why don't you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch,"" Harris said, referring to Russian leader Vladimir Putin."

Pope Francis on Friday urged Catholic voters to ""choose the lesser evil"" between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

""You must choose the lesser evil,"" Francis told reporters in a press conference held from his papal airplane following a 12-day tour of Southeast Asia and Oceania. ""Who is the lesser evil? That lady, or that gentleman? I don't know. Everyone, in conscience, [has to] think and do this.""

But he also said, ""Not voting is ugly. It is not good. You must vote.""

WHITE HOUSE RESPONDS AFTER POPE CONDEMNS 'GENDER THEORY,' AFFIRMS BIDEN'S SUPPORT FOR TRANS COMMUNITY

Harris has said that she wants to codify Roe v. Wade into law if elected, and Trump has promised the ""largest mass deportation in American history of our country.""

The pope didn't specify which candidate, if either, he personally prefers.

On abortion, he said, ""It is an assassination. On these things we must speak clearly. No 'but' or 'however.'""

On Trump's deportation plans, the pope said: ""Not giving welcome to migrants is a sin. It is grave.""

""Whether it is the one who is chasing away migrants, or the one who that kills children, both are against life,"" he claimed.

POPE FRANCIS RESPONDS TO CONSERVATIVE CRITICS IN NEW INTERVIEW

Trump previously sparred with the pope in 2016, after the pontiff claimed that his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border was ""not Christian.""

""I'm a very good Christian,"" Trump responded at the time in a news conference, ""He's questioning my faith. I was very surprised to see it.""

Trump called questioning a person's faith ""disgraceful,"" claiming that the pope was being used as a ""pawn"" by the Mexican government.

The pope has also previously criticized President Biden's stance on abortion. Biden is a Catholic, but supports a woman's right to choose, which Francis called an ""incoherence"" in a 2022 interview, saying that he would leave it to Biden's ""conscience.""

CNN anchor Kate Bolduan asked a network panel on Friday morning how Vice President Kamala Harris can boost her performance in the polls when former President Trump is ""killing"" her on economic issues.

Bolduan spoke to CNN political commentators Van Jones and Alyssa Farah Griffin about how, though Harris did well in the debate and is giving some good messaging in areas, Trump is still beating her on one of the most important issues this election cycle.

""You've got, potentially, a good sign that Kamala Harris can talk about, kind of quote-unquote late-stage change, but you still have Donald Trump killing her when it comes to the economy,"" she said.

The anchor stated that the Harris campaign is in a ""funky place"" ahead of the November election, and mentioned polling that demonstrated Trump maintaining a key advantage in the immediate aftermath of Tuesday night's debate.

""In that snap poll after the debate, he was up 20 points on the economy even though the vast majority said she won the debate,"" Bolduan told her guests.

However, both pundits downplayed the numbers.

Jones replied by saying that 2012 GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney was seen as better than former President Obama on the economy, and Obama won. ""People thought Romney was better on the economy than Obama but people believed that Obama was going to fight for them harder.""

""People might think, 'Yeah, he might be better on the economy, but he said he'll help the billionaires, he's not gonna help me,'"" he added.

Griffin's counterpoint was that Trump is too easily distracted to capitalize on this 20-point advantage, pointing to one of his viral moments at the debate as evidence for her argument.

""The economy is objectively Donald Trump's strongest issue, but it comes down to can he actually focus on that? Aides have put him up to give speeches focused on it and he ends up diverting to all different directions - Hannibal Lecter, now we're onto eating animals,"" she said.

Jones jumped back in, stating that ""Every candidate has their strong points and their weak points.""

""Economy - weaker for her. Abortion¬≠ - weaker for him,"" he said. ""So, everybody's got strengths and weaknesses. What you want to do is mitigate your weaknesses as much as you can - which is why he's flip-flopping all over the place on abortion - and you lean into your strengths.""

Still, Bolduan wasn't convinced the Harris campaign is doing all they can on the economy, stating that campaign officials she has talked to have not had good answers about the vice president's performance on that issue.

""I just think the response I've gotten to 'Why isn't she doing better on the economy' or 'Why wasn't Biden doing better on the economy' that I've gotten from administration officials and from Democratic electeds - it has been unsatisfying to this point, which is 'They just haven't gotten our message,'"" the anchor said.

She added, ""And at some point, I'm asking, 'Where's the expiration date on that reasoning?' As at some point there has to be."""

""I think the American people are going to be shocked, astonished and appalled by what we will report to them about the failures by the Secret Service in this assassination attempt on the former president,"" HSGAC Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) Chairman Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told Fox News Digital following the briefing.

The senator refused to go into details about what he heard in the meeting, however.

""I do think that the director is attempting to try to make sure this doesn't happen again. And so I do appreciate that he's trying,"" Paul said after exiting the briefing.

He detailed that the committee's bipartisan interim report on the assassination attempt would be coming out in a few days.

In one viral moment, Davis sternly told Trump that ""there is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born,"" after Trump invoked former Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's remarks in 2019 suggesting a live baby could be killed after being born, following a ""discussion"" between the physician and the mother.

While liberals celebrated the moment, one pro-life group demanded a correction from ABC News, saying Davis' comments were ""100% inaccurate.""

Since the debate, both Muir and Davis have been slammed by critics for appearing biased towards Vice President Kamala Harris. The debate moderators fact-checked Trump five times and failed to correct Harris a single time on Tuesday evening.

Trump alleged bias by the ABC moderators as well, telling Fox & Friends on Wednesday, ""It was three to one. It was a rigged deal as I assumed it would be.""

Despite zero fact-checks for Harris, Davis insisted that her team intended to fact-check both candidates throughout the course of the night.

The LA Times stated, ""With co-moderator David Muir, Davis had studied hours of campaign rallies and interviews to prepare for the much-anticipated event at Philadelphia's National Constitution Center, and were ready to counter the candidates' most egregious statements.""

FOX NEWS MEDIA PROPOSES SECOND HARRIS-TRUMP DEBATE MODERATED BY MARTHA MACCALLUM, BRET BAIER

Davis countered accusations of bias by stating that she and Muir could not catch every misstatement, the Times reported, without noting that none of Harris' incorrect statements received rebukes.

Elsewhere in the article, the outlet noted how Davis simply ignored the criticism that she was helping Harris, reporting that she shut off her social media accounts.

""There is a stereotype that I am acutely aware of that I can't be unbiased covering this moment. And the anonymous Instagram people serve as reminders every day,"" Davis said.

"Justin Timberlake pleads guilty, gets community service after DWI arrest",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/justin-timberlake-pleads-guilty-gets-community-service-after-dwi-arrest,2024-09-13T16:25:40Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Justin Timberlake appeared in court Friday in connection to his June DWI arrest.

The former *NSYNC star pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was given community service, 25-40 hours.

Timberlake reached a plea agreement with prosecutors before the hearing. Details of the agreement weren't disclosed, but a person with knowledge of the deal said Timberlake has agreed to admit guilt to a lesser offense of ""driving while ability impaired,"" a traffic violation that carries a $300 to $500 fine and a 90-day license suspension.

JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE EXPECTED TO CUT PLEA DEAL IN DWI CASE

Timberlake arrived to court wearing black sunglasses and accessorized with a double strand pearl necklace. The musician was joined by an entourage of people - including his lawyer, Ed Burke Jr., bodyguards and his music manager, Johnny Wright.

When pulled over by authorities the morning of June 18, Timberlake ""performed poorly on all standardized field sobriety tests,"" the arresting officer claimed in documents obtained by Fox News Digital.

Timberlake had ""bloodshot and glossy"" eyes, a ""strong odor of an alcoholic beverage was emanating from his breath"" and he was ""unable to divide attention,"" according to the complaint. The ""Cry Me A River"" singer also exhibited ""slowed speech"" and was ""unsteady afoot.""

Ed Burke Jr., Timberlake's lawyer, previously claimed police made ""significant errors"" during the musician's June arrest.

WATCH: JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE DRIVING IN THE HAMPTONS AHEAD OF DWI ARREST

""The most important fact to know about this case is that Justin was not intoxicated and should not have been arrested for DWI,"" Burke said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""The police made a number of very significant errors in this case. In court today, you heard the district attorney try to fix one of those errors. But that's just one, and there are many others. Sometimes the police make mistakes, and this is just one of those instances.""

Timberlake was originally charged with one count of driving while intoxicated along with citations for failure to keep right and failure to stop at a stop sign, the district attorney's office confirmed to Fox News Digital.

The pop star told the arresting officer he had one martini and was following some friends home, according to the documents. After being arrested and taken to a police station in nearby East Hampton, he refused a breath test, according to the court papers, which listed his occupation as ""professional"" and said he's ""self-employed.""

Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) called out Timberlake's plea deal.

""MADD does not support plea deals in cases involving impaired driving, as we believe justice should be fully served for such a serious crime,"" a spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""Driving while impaired is a dangerous and reckless choice that puts lives at risk, and the consequences should reflect the gravity of that decision. Plea deals diminish the severity of impaired driving, which is a violent crime that kills and injures thousands of people every year.""

""MADD has asked for Mr. Timberlake to do the right thing by using his significant platform to raise awareness about the dangers of impaired driving and help prevent this crime,"" the statement continued. ""Though it has been reported that Mr. Timberlake will produce a PSA with MADD, we have not been formally contacted by his representatives. MADD will continue to advocate for justice and accountability in every impaired driving case, and we hope Timberlake's future decisions reflect the seriousness of this issue and contribute meaningfully to our cause.""

Timberlake addressed his drunk driving arrest days after it happened at his Chicago stop of ""The Forget The World Tomorrow Tour.""

""It's been a tough week,"" the 10-time Grammy winner told fans at the United Center during his first performance following the arrest. ""I know I'm hard to love sometimes, but you keep loving me right back.""

The ""Bye Bye Bye"" singer took some heat earlier this year when Britney Spears wrote about their relationship in her memoir. The pop star alleged the former couple had an abortion, and she addressed Timberlake's infamous ""Cry Me A River"" music video which featured a Spears look-a-like.

Spears claimed she was painted as a ""harlot who'd broken the heart of America's golden boy"" by the media.

Timberlake took the stage shortly after and seemingly responded to Spears, saying, ""I'd like to take this opportunity to apologize to absolutely f------ nobody.""

Four ways Trump can get to a 96% chance of winning,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/four-ways-trump-can-get-96-chance-winning,2024-09-13T13:04:22Z,"The 2016 election hinged on 40,000 votes in key Midwest states. This time the margin of victory, or defeat, may be even more dramatic: 10,000 to 20,000 Pennsylvanians - or the student section at a Penn State football game.

According to election guru Nate Silver, if former President Donald Trump wins the Keystone State, his chances of winning the White House are 96%. We know Trump's strengths with men - and his weaknesses with women. Thus, the entire race could hinge on his ability to persuade several thousand women in Pennsylvania to turn his way.

Easier said than done, as this election poses new challenges. For the first time, abortion has surpassed the economy as the No. 1 issue for female voters under 45 years of age. For women overall, abortion is now neck-and-neck with the economy as the preeminent issue.

HARRIS, TRUMP ENTER POST-DEBATE 'HOMESTRETCH' WITH DUELING RALLIES IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES

With this backdrop, some perspective and prudence are needed:

First, Trump should be given leeway by the right in his approach to abortion. For the past 50 years, Republicans have had the benefit of a single unifying message: overturn Roe vs Wade.

Now, the debate has changed, and even the most pro-life states and governors vary on their state-specific policies. And the political reality is that most Americans are somewhere in the middle on this difficult issue, like in Pennsylvania, where abortion is legal up to 24 weeks.

Trump delivered on his promise to appoint judges who would overturn Roe and send the issue back to the states. It's not the perfect solution, but it's a solution for the hardest question in American political life. The right should give Trump the latitude to explain these positions and assure Pennsylvanians that the issue is now in their hands.

Second, remind parents of what is at stake. Suburban moms may have little regard for Trump's style, personality and rough-and-ready approach to policy and people, but, when he was president, he fought to keep kids in the classroom during COVID-19 and nonsense out. Democrats, and their teachers union allies, have done the opposite.

Despite what many view as his personality defects, Trump ran a good country and was on the side of parents and students. The question is not who we would rather have as a classroom teacher -- Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris -- but who's more likely to wield government to interfere with our children, to try to shape them and their views in the things we do not believe or are none of their business. The answer, to us, seems obvious.

Third, expose Harris's hypocrisy on fracking -- a key industry for Pennsylvanians. Admittedly, it's hard to know what Harris is running for - but it's clear what she's running from: her record.

She previously said she would ban fracking. She said she would abolish the filibuster to pass the Green New Deal. She passed the deciding vote for the Inflation Reduction Act -- arguably the largest ""green"" pork bill ever passed. On their first day in office, the Biden-Harris administration canceled the Keystone XL Pipeline, and they've blocked oil and gas leases on large swaths of federal lands.

Trump delivered on his promise to appoint judges who would overturn Roe and send the issue back to the states. It's not the perfect solution, but it's a solution for the hardest question in American political life. The right should give Trump the latitude to explain these positions and assure Pennsylvanians that the issue is now in their hands.

This is an administration beholden to radical environmentalists; she pays lip service to fracking because she knows the political stakes. Or as Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said recently, she's ""doing what she thinks is right in order to win the election.""

Finally, let us not forget Butler, Pennsylvania, ever. In that field north of Pittsburgh, Trump made his strongest case to date. As he rose defiantly in the face of death, he demonstrated his best quality: he's a fighter for his country. Whether it's the Russia collusion hoax, the bogus lawfare, or a near assassination, he doesn't back down. That's a quality that Pennsylvanians respect, and it could make the difference.

Conservatives say a recent study showing Vice President Kamala Harris receiving significantly more favorable coverage on ABC's ""World News Tonight with David Muir"" than former President Trump should have been a clear indicator that Tuesday night's debate was going to be hostile territory.

ABC News has come under fire after Muir and co-moderator Linsey Davis repeatedly fact-checked Trump while failing to correct Harris even a single time. The ABC moderators have also been urged to issue a correction on their abortion coverage and were scolded for giving Harris a pass on her explanation for recent policy flip-flops.

Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt wrote that the ""journalistic reputations of Muir and Davis are the most scarred by the fiasco,"" but ""the damage will extend to both the ABC and Disney brands"" because the moderators failed to ask more critical questions of Harris.

CNN PANEL CLASHES AFTER DEMOCRATIC GUEST SUGGESTS DEBATE MODERATORS WERE 'HARSHER' ON TRUMP

Media Research Center founder Brent Bozell said on the NewsBusters Podcast t that Harris had a clear advantage that should have been apparent.

""Whoever recommended that [Trump] do that debate on ABC should be fired. It was about the worst decision that could have been made,"" Bozell said on Wednesday when discussing what he feels are the Disney-owned network's biases.

The debate was hardly the first time ABC News has been accused of favoring Democrats over Trump or painting the GOP nominee in a negative light. The network's daytime gabfest ""The View,"" which falls under the umbrella of ABC's news division, has been overtly anti-Trump for years and summoned Chelsea Clinton to guest-host on Thursday. The show's hosts were gleeful over the debate, with Whoopi Goldberg calling it a ""booty whooping.""

ABC's flagship late-night show, ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!,"" is also regularly critical of Trump and booked prominent anti-Trump figures Jane Fonda and George Conway as guests following the network's coverage of the debate. Kimmel even helped with a fundraiser for Biden when he was the nominee earlier this year.

When it comes to the debate moderators, Davis seemingly linked Trump to the Ku Klux Klan by noting during ABC coverage of the Democratic National Convention that the former president was scheduled to appear in the same Michigan town where the KKK held a protest earlier this year.

VOTERS GIVE HARRIS THE DEBATE WIN, BUT PRAISE TRUMP ON POLICY: SHE GOT UNDER HIS SKIN

As for Muir, the conservative Media Research Center found prior to the debate that his program, ""World News Tonight,"" has been more ""positive towards Harris and the most hostile to Trump"" compared to evening newscasts on NBC and CBS.

Bozell's MRC reviewed 100 campaign stories on ABC's ""World News Tonight"" that aired from July 21 when Harris entered the race through September 6.

""Our analysts found 25 clearly positive statements about Harris from reporters, anchors, voters or other non-partisan sources, with zero negative statements -- none. That computes to a gravity-defying 100% positive spin score for the Vice President,"" MRC NewsBusters contributing editor Rich Noyes wrote.

""As for Trump, our analysts found just five clearly positive comments, vs. 66 negative statements, for a dismal 7 percent positive -- 93% negative -- spin score,"" Noyes continued. ""During these same weeks, both the 'CBS Evening News' and 'NBC Nightly News' also delivered highly positive coverage for Harris, and mostly negative coverage for Trump, yet not as extreme as we found with ABC's 'World News Tonight.'""

Notes explained that MRC's measure of good versus bad press omitted partisan comments, ""as well as 'horse race' assessments about the candidates' poll standings and prospects."" The MRC added ""ABC's reporters and anchors either jumped in to criticize Trump themselves, or broadcast negative comments from non-partisan sources to impart a heavily negative spin to the former President's coverage.""

MRC researchers also pointed to ""other ways that ABC's flagship newscast aided the Democratic nominee"" ahead of the presidential debate.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH ABORTION FACT-CHECK AGAINST TRUMP: 'COMPLETELY INTERJECTS HERSELF'

The MRC wrote that ""World News Tonight"" hasn't used the word ""liberal"" to describe Harris, hasn't spoken to voters who oppose Harris and regularly promotes Trump controversies while ""hiding"" negative news about Harris.

Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America also sent a letter to ABC News president Almin Karamehmedovic, along with Muir and Davis, urging the network to issue a correction about a ""100% inaccurate"" abortion claim made during the debate.

Trump referred to infamous comments made by former Virginia Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam in 2019 but was promptly ""fact-checked"" by Davis. At the time, Northam suggested that in some rare instances of third-trimester abortions, a baby could be born alive and a ""discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother"" about what to do.

""There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born,"" Davis sternly responded to Trump at the debate.

TRUMP'S DEFAMATION LAWSUIT AGAINST ABC, GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS CAN MOVE FORWARD, JUDGE RULES

Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America says the ABC moderator was ""inaccurate"" and should correct the record.

""This is 100% inaccurate. Her statement tragically ignores the reality of babies who survive failed, late-term abortions but are denied basic medical care and left to die,"" Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America president Marjorie Dannenfelser wrote in a letter to ABC bigwigs.

ABC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Meanwhile, Dana Walden, a senior Disney executive whose portfolio includes ABC News, is one of Harris' ""extraordinary friends,"" according to a report in the New York Times. Walden and Harris have known each other since 1994, while their husbands, Matt Walden and Doug Emhoff, have known each other since the 1980s.

ABC told the New York Times that Walden, who is Disney's highest-ranking television executive, does not weigh in on editorial decisions. She has donated to dozens of Democrats and has contributed to Harris' political campaigns since at least 2003.

Defamation lawsuit against CNN could expose company's financial secrets as court seeks to expose net worth,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/defamation-lawsuit-against-cnn-could-expose-companys-financial-secrets,2024-09-13T09:10:33Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

CNN faces a defamation lawsuit over a 2021 story centered around the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal and a recent ruling could expose financial secrets as the court seeks to determine the cable network's net worth.

The plaintiff, Zachary Young, alleges that CNN smeared his security consulting company, Nemex Enterprises Inc., by implying it illegally profited when helping people flee Afghanistan during the Biden administration's military withdrawal from the country in 2021. A civil trial is scheduled to begin on January 6, 2025 in front of Judge William Henry in the Circuit Court for Bay County, Florida.

Last week, Henry paved the way for Young to issue a subpoena for CNN to hand over a plethora of sensitive financial information that the cable network presented to its parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.

""Essentially, this will act as a way to double check to see if CNN was being honest with the financial documents they were turning over as part of discovery; comparing what they turned over to Young's legal team vs what they told corporate,"" NewsBusters associate editor Nicholas Fondacaro wrote when covering the hearing.

CNN FACES DEFAMATION SUIT OVER AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL STORY: 'EVIDENCE OF ACTUAL MALICE'

Puck reporter Eriq Gardner wrote that the judge's decision ""sent a jolt through CNN's executives offices.""

""Young has won a green light to seek punitive damages,"" Gardner wrote.

""Accordingly, Young's attorneys will soon be receiving documents to assess CNN's net worth, so they can argue before a jury just how big a penalty Young should receive,"" he continued. ""The judge has also ordered a deposition for Jake Tapper, who will likely have to disclose his salary and contract negotiations.

Tapper's salary will be particularly interesting to now-former CNN employees who were let go during a recent round of cost-cutting headcount reductions. The network announced in July that roughly 100 staffers would be let go.

Gardner also reported that CNN's lawyer Charles Tobin ""visibly bristled at the ruling"" and told the judge that the October 11 deadline to comply ""upends"" his plans.

Young, a U.S. Navy veteran, believes CNN ""destroyed his reputation and business by branding him an illegal profiteer who exploited desperate Afghans"" during a Nov. 11, 2021, segment on CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper,"" which was shared on social media and also repackaged for CNN's website.

Tapper began the segment by informing viewers that CNN correspondent Alex Marquardt discovered ""Afghans trying to get out of the country face a black market full of promises, demands of exorbitant fees, and no guarantee of safety or success.""

Tapper tossed to Marquardt, who said ""desperate Afghans are being exploited"" and need to pay ""exorbitant, often impossible amounts"" to flee the country. Marquardt then singled out Young, putting a picture of his face on the screen and saying his company was asking for $75,000 to transport a vehicle of passengers to Pakistan for $14,500 per person to end up in the United Arab Emirates.

""Prices well beyond the reach of most Afghans,"" Marquardt told viewers.

ABC NEWS REBUKED BY PRO-LIFE GROUP, ASKED FOR CORRECTION OF ABORTION CLAIM BY DEBATE MODERATOR

""We got Young's number and called, but he didn't pick up. In a text message, he told CNN that 'Afghans trying to leave are expected to have sponsors pay for them. If someone reached out, we need to understand if they have a sponsor behind them to be able to pay evacuation costs which are highly volatile and based on environmental realities,'"" Marquardt continued. ""Young repeatedly declined to break down the cost or say if he's making money.""

No other people or companies were named other than Young.

""In another message, that person offering those evacuations, Zachary Young, he wrote, 'Availability is extremely limited and demand is high' ... he goes on to say, 'That's how economics works, unfortunately,'"" Marquardt told viewers.

Tapper responded, ""Unfortunately, hmm,"" before thanking Marquardt for the report.

Young alleged that CNN using the terms ""black market,"" ""exploit"" and ""exorbitant,"" painted him as a bad actor preying upon desperate people.

AFGHANISTAN GOLD STAR FATHER: BIDEN-HARRIS NEED TO 'OWN UP' TO THEIR MISTAKE, SAY SORRY

CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

It will be interesting to see if CNN chief media analyst Brian Stelter covers the story, as he recently returned to the network after being fired by previous management. His media newsletter didn't return until Monday and he did not post about the defamation suit on X while he was away from the network.

Earlier this year, judges with the First District Court of Appeal for the State of Florida ruled on June 12 that the Young offered enough evidence that he was able to move forward with a defamation suit against CNN for punitive damages.

""Young sufficiently proffered evidence of actual malice, express malice, and a level of conduct outrageous enough to open the door for him to seek punitive damages,"" the court document states. ""Whether Young can ultimately prevail is not the issue before us.""

The judges wrote, ""Young proffered CNN messages and emails that showed internal concern about the completeness and veracity of the reporting -- the story is 'a mess,' 'incomplete,' not 'fleshed out for digital,' 'the story is 80% emotion, 20% obscured fact,' and 'full of holes like Swiss cheese,'"" but the network aired it anyway.

""Young also proffered a message exchange he had with Marquardt just hours before publication where he advised there were factual inaccuracies in the reporting. CNN published anyway,"" the judges wrote, adding that other internal communications show CNN staffers ""had little regard"" for Young and used profanities and disparaging language when privately discussing him.

""Marquardt referred to him as 'f---ing Young' and quipped, ""it's your funeral bucko,'"" according to the court document.

""On appeal, CNN argues it did not intend to harm; its language was either opinion or ambiguous; and the internal communications were journalistic bravado that reflected a sincere belief in the reporting,"" the judges wrote."
Dems run on border bill Republicans say 'was never designed to solve the problem',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-run-border-bill-republicans-say-was-never-designed-solve-problem,2024-09-12T23:44:35Z,"Yuma, Arizona Mayor Doug Nicholls discusses how the border crisis is a top issue for Arizona voters as border crossings in the state increased under the Biden-Harris administration.

The immigration bill being used by vulnerable Democrats as evidence of their commitment to border security has been trashed by Republican senators, who claim the measure would have actually exacerbated the crisis at the southern border.

""That bill was awful. It killed itself,"" Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told Fox News Digital on Thursday of the bill that was negotiated by Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., and James Lankford, R-Okla.

""I'm not aware of anybody that Trump called,"" he added, with another GOP senator seconding this.

After former President Donald Trump himself came out against the measure, Democrats accused him of being responsible for its ultimate demise, and he further welcomed their blame. But several Republican senators said the bill was essentially dead on arrival, with or without Trump's input.

TOP HANDICAPPER GIVES GOP'S TIM SHEEHY EDGE AGAINST DEMOCRAT JON TESTER IN MONTANA RACE SHIFT

Republican senators prompted by Fox News Digital in the spring about Trump's involvement in lobbying against the border bill also denied that the former president was making calls.

On Thursday, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Fox News Digital the bill was terrible. ""Chuck Schumer drafted it. He drafted it with the objective of keeping the current open borders open in perpetuity,"" he claimed.

Cruz listed concerns with the measure, including that it ""codified catch and release. The bill provided immediate work permits to illegal aliens when they came here. The bill provided taxpayer-funded attorneys to illegal aliens. The bill gave billions of dollars to sanctuary cities and NGOs that are aiding with human-traffickers and the bill normalized 5,000 illegal immigrants a day.""

""It was never designed to solve the problem,"" he said.

As the Texas senator referenced, the bill would have expanded what are known as alternatives to detention (ATD) for those who enter the country illegally, make work permits immediately available for those who pass initial asylum screenings, provide funding for attorneys to represent some unaccompanied minors, and would have established a threshold of an average of 5,000 border crossings a day for one week before ushering in a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) emergency authority that would bar illegal immigrants from entering the country between ports of entry.

He also pointed to the fact that chief Democrat negotiator, Murphy, wrote of the bill on X that, ""The border never closes, but claims must be processed at the ports.""

TEXAS DEM'S SENATE AD FEATURES BORDER WALL HE ONCE BLASTED AS 'RACIST'

Murphy didn't respond to Republican suggestions that his bill would have made the border worse and said it was false that it would have codified catch and release or that it would not actually ever shut down the border. ""Those are not true,"" he told Fox News Digital on Thursday.

The bill faced its first procedural vote in February as part of a supplemental spending deal that also included funding for aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. The vote was 49-50, failing to garner the necessary 60 votes to move forward. A supplemental foreign aid package ultimately passed without the border measure.

""There were a lot of good things in that bill, but in the end, we did not address the one thing that I think is a legitimate argument: That's trust in this administration to implement it,"" Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told reporters on Thursday.

ROGERS ADDRESSES ABORTION AMID SLOTKIN ATTACKS: 'MICHIGAN VOTERS HAVE ALREADY DECIDED'

Lankford, along with Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, were the only Republicans to vote in favor of the negotiated bill in February.

Senate Democrats revived the bill for a second procedural vote in May, which failed again by a worse margin. Two of the three negotiators, Sinema and Lankford, voted against it in the ultimate 43-50 vote. Both Romney and Collins also voted against advancing it in the second vote.

Collins told Fox News Digital on Thursday, ""I don't think it was the be all and end all, but I think it would have helped.""

Democrats running for Senate have panned their Republican counterparts for coming out against the negotiated bill, and have used their support for it during their respective campaigns to demonstrate that they will work to address the border.

For example, Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., who is embroiled in what is considered one of the most competitive races in the country, referenced his support of the measure in an April ad that said, ""Jon Tester worked with Republicans, fighting to shut down the border, target fentanyl traffickers, and add hundreds of new border patrol agents.""

Democrats in Senate races are not the only ones using this bill to their advantage. Vice President Kamala Harris is campaigning on signing the bill into law if she is elected president in November.

As for whether Democrats' advocacy for the bill will resonate with voters, Collins told Fox News Digital it won't. ""The president did absolutely nothing by way of executive orders or of really pushing that bill for years. He created the crisis,"" she said of President Biden.

TOP 5 MOMENTS DURING TRUMP-HARRIS PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'I'M TALKING NOW'

Tillis noted that Biden and Harris ""conveniently leave out how they haven't enforced existing laws.""

He characterized Republican discussions regarding the negotiated bill, explaining, ""There were people that were saying, 'I don't mind the policy. I just don't think you'll execute.'""

Romney reiterated his disagreement with some of his conference members on the measure, suggesting they are doing their ""best to provide an excuse for a very unfortunate vote.""

According to him, Trump was ""of course"" responsible for its failure.

Lankford's office declined to provide comment to Fox News Digital."
Trump campaign declares 'clear victory' in Harris debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-campaign-declares-clear-victory-harris-debate,2024-09-12T20:59:08Z,"EXCLUSIVE: The Trump campaign is doubling down on former President Trump's debate performance this week, calling it a clear victory against Vice President Kamala Harris, despite recent reports that Harris is gaining momentum in battlegrounds Georgia and North Carolina.

""Their little reaction to the debate and performance is nothing but a sugar high, and it's artificial, and it's based entirely on the fact that she came out and she managed to deliver her memorized lines, and she put on a fine performance, which we anticipated she was going to do, because she's able to go out and memorize things and go out and put on a performance,"" senior Trump campaign adviser Tim Murtaugh told Fox News Digital in an interview Thursday.

""They placed so much emphasis on that debate, and so many millions of people tuned in to hear why she was running for president, because they had heard that she'd been in hiding most of the time, and they were expecting her to explain the rationale for what her record is and what her goals would be as president and what her plans would be. And they walked away not having heard or learned anything,"" he said.

The campaign's assessment comes as Trump himself said Thursday he will not be doing any more debates.

TRUMP ALLIES CLAIM VICTORY IN DEBATE, CRITICIZE MODERATORS AS 'PRO-KAMALA ACTIVISTS'

While debate watchers initially gave the victory to Harris after Tuesday's showdown, there are still six toss-up states on the map worth a combined 78 electoral votes. The election is still considered up for grabs for either candidate.

As of Thursday, Trump has lost his edge in Georgia and North Carolina in the latest Fox News Power Rankings, giving Harris a lead in the overall forecast for the first time.

Over the last 12 months of the Fox News Poll, between 48%-50% of registered voters have said they supported Trump. While Biden polled as low as 45% earlier this year, Harris is now only one point behind Trump at 49% in the latest Fox national survey.

Criminal indictments, a conviction, the primaries, a last-minute change in opponents and an assassination attempt did nothing to move the former president out of that three-point range.

JD VANCE VOWS TRUMP WOULD NOT IMPOSE FEDERAL ABORTION BAN, VETO IT IF COMES ACROSS DESK

But Murtaugh believes Trump had ""a strong performance"" and that he refused to let Harris ""escape her liberal record and her responsibility in the Biden-Harris administration.""

Murtaugh pointed to Harris' flip-flop record in which she's tried to distance herself from her former progressive record.

""And everyone knows what they are. It's fracking, it's the wall, it's making illegal immigration or making illegally crossing the border not illegal. She reversed herself on outlawing health insurance that people get from their employer,"" Murtaugh said. ""She reversed herself on gun confiscation. She's reversed herself on a variety of tax cuts. You know, she's actually even reversed herself on plastic straws.""

""And she also needed to try to separate herself from the Biden-Harris administration,"" Murtaugh said. ""And she absolutely did not do that. And so while the pundits might think, 'Oh, wow, what a great performance she put on,' because she went out and did her lines, in fact, the truth is, the grocery store will not let you buy food with style points.""

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS ISSUES TRACKER: TRUMP LEADS ON TWO TOP ISSUES, BUT HARRIS IS GAINING GROUND

On top issues like the economy, Trump clearly has the upper hand, according to polls. In a CNN poll conducted after the debate, 55% of voters preferred Trump's economic platform compared to Harris', trailing behind at 35%.

And while pundits and debate watchers called the victory for Harris, middle-of-the-road voters may not have been convinced, according to Reuters and the New York Times' interviews with undecided voters.

""She needed to connect with these people and convince them that she wasn't hiding and that she is a serious candidate, and she failed. You don't get another chance to make a first impression on those people,"" Murtaugh said.

Former President Trump said he will not participate in a third debate this election cycle, claiming victory after Tuesday's showdown against Vice President Kamala Harris.

The Harris campaign on Tuesday after the debate said they would be interested in having another. But Trump was lukewarm to the idea, and on Thursday afternoon, he rejected the proposal completely.

""When a prizefighter loses a fight, the first words out of his mouth are, 'I WANT A REMATCH,'"" Trump posted on his Truth Social account. ""Polls clearly show that I won the Debate against Comrade Kamala Harris, the Democrats' Radical Left Candidate, on Tuesday night, and she immediately called for a Second Debate.""

TRUMP SPARS WITH HARRIS, MODERATORS DURING HEATED PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'SHE DOESN'T HAVE A PLAN'

Trump said Harris and President ""Crooked Joe"" Biden have ""destroyed our country, with millions of criminals and mentally deranged people pouring into the USA, totally unchecked and unvetted, and with Inflation bankrupting our Middle Class.""

""Everyone knows this, and all of the other problems caused by Kamala and Joe -- it was discussed in great detail during the First Debate with Joe, and the Second Debate with Comrade Harris,"" Trump said.

Trump participated in a town hall on Sept. 4 on Fox News, after Fox News invited the former president and Harris to debate.

MORNING GLORY: THE WORST DEBATE IN THE HISTORY OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES

""She was a no-show at the Fox Debate, and refused to do NBC & CBS,"" Trump continued. ""Kamala should focus on what she should have done during the last almost four year period.""

He added: ""THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!""

Biden's disastrous debate performance against Trump in June instantly fueled questions about his physical and mental abilities to serve another four years in the White House - and spurred a rising chorus of calls from within his own party for the 81-year-old president to end his bid for a second term.

Facing increased pressure from fellow Democrats, Biden, in a blockbuster announcement on July 21, ended his re-election campaign and endorsed Harris. She faced no opposition and quickly sewed up the nomination.

Trump and Harris faced off in a heated debate Tuesday night, sparring about abortion, immigration, Israel, the economy and a range of other issues -- but Trump also battled the ABC News moderators, who were quick to challenge and ""fact check"" the 45th president, while leaving Harris' distortions untouched.

Shortly after it concluded, Trump told Fox News Digital that he thought it was his ""best debate ever, especially because it was three on one."" A CNN flash poll afterward found a majority of watchers thought Harris won the debate. The majority of a Fox News Digital focus group also gave Harris the victory, although the Democrat took criticism for continuing to sound evasive on major issues.

On the heels of Tuesday's ABC debate, FOX News Media executives sent a letter to the Harris and Trump campaigns offering to host another debate, with Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum as moderators.

Garland claims DOJ reaffirming its 'norms' despite series of controversies,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/garland-claims-doj-returning-norms-despite-series-controversies,2024-09-12T20:13:24Z,"Fox News Legal Editor Kerri Urbahn analyzes DOJ controversies.

U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland championed a returned to ""norms"" at the Department of Justice Thursday, despite controversies that have left Republicans alleging a two-tier justice system.

Speaking to department staff in Washington D.C., Garland referred to former President Donald Trump's term in the White House as a ""particularly difficult period for the department.""

""When I came back to DOJ in 2021, after a particularly difficult period for the Department, I said that my mission as Attorney General would be to reaffirm and strengthen those norms as the principles upon which the Justice Department operates,"" he said.

Garland, however, failed to mention the department failing to enforce a federal statute against the protesters who were harassing conservative justices at their homes in 2022, slow-walking the trial of the man accused of seeking to kill Justice Brett Kavanaugh while fast-tracking cases involving Trump, and writing a letter directing the National Security Division to monitor angry parents at school board meetings, said Fox News legal editor Kerri Urbahn.

Urbahn, appearing Thursday on ""America Reports,"" criticized the DOJ for providing regular updates on the aggressive Jan. 6 riot prosecutions while staying mum on anti-Israel agitators who have defaced and destroyed private and federal property. The department also slow-walked the Hunter Biden investigation until whistleblowers spoke out, Urbahn said, and then nearly allowed a ""sweetheart"" plea deal to go through.

FORMER CIA OFFICER ACCEPTED GIFTS FROM CHINA FOR TOP SECRET INFO, SENTENCED TO PRISON

""So, we took steps to better protect the Department's criminal and civil law enforcement decisions and its legal judgments from partisan or other inappropriate influences,"" Garland continued.

Garland lamented accusations that the department had been weaponized against political enemies and decried ""conspiracy theories, dangerous falsehoods [and] efforts to bully and intimidate career public servants.""

""Our norms are a promise that we will not allow this department to be used as a political weapon, and our norms are a promise that we will not allow this nation to become a country where law enforcement is treated as an apparatus of politics,"" Garland told DOJ staff.

SECRET SURVEILLANCE OF CONGRESSIONAL STAFF BY DOJ IN FOCUS AFTER WHISTLEBLOWER ADVOCATES NOTCH COURT WIN

Garland's statements appear to be a response to accusations coming from across the Republican Party that the DOJ has been weaponized against Trump in recent years.

In June, The Washington Post published an opinion piece written by Garland, which shot down assertions that the department was attempting to influence the 2024 election.

WATCH: GARLAND SAYS DOJ RETURNING TO 'NORMS' UNDER HIS WATCH

Without naming them, Garland alluded to Trump and his allies, who have repeatedly claimed the DOJ was behind the New York criminal case against the presumptive GOP nominee, who was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records by a Manhattan jury.

""We have seen an escalation of attacks that go far beyond public scrutiny, criticism, and legitimate and necessary oversight of our work. They are baseless, personal and dangerous,"" Garland wrote.

Such attacks, Garland insisted at the time, included ""threats"" to defund Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith's efforts to prosecute the former president.

Garland added at the time, ""The Justice Department makes decisions about criminal investigations based only on the facts and the law. We do not investigate people because of their last name, their political affiliation, the size of their bank account, where they come from or what they look like. We investigate and prosecute violations of federal law -- nothing more, nothing less.""

""With all due respect, attorney general, prosecuting the former president of the United States and the possible future president of the United States and your boss' political enemy is anything but normal,"" Urbahn said.

Urbahn said Smith has brought ""untested legal theories"" against Trump.

""They are basically twisting the law in ways that have never been done before in order to fit the facts to get the guy,"" Urbahn continued.

Others have pointed out what appears to be hypocrisy on the DOJ's part with recent treatment of groups lumped together as politically conservative when compared to those categorized as generally liberal.

In 2023, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Matthew Graves announced the conviction of Paula ""Paulette"" Harlow, 75, of Kingston, Massachusetts, for a ""federal conspiracy against rights"" and Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act violations for participating in a protest at an abortion clinic in 2020.

Critics immediately cried foul, noting that Graves had yet to condemn or preview possible prosecution efforts for roughly 200 anti-Israel activists -- some armed with pepper spray -- who violently rioted at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters and injured at least six Capitol Police officers in November."
"ABC News rebuked by pro-life group, asked for correction of abortion claim by debate moderator",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/abc-news-rebuked-pro-life-group-asked-correction-abortion-claim-debate-moderator,2024-09-12T18:08:21Z,"FIRST ON FOX -- A prominent pro-life group isn't happy with ABC News over its hosting of Tuesday's presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump.

Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America sent a letter to ABC News president Almin Karamehmedovic and debate moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis on Wednesday that urges them to issue a correction and meet with abortion survivors over a viral moment where Davis fact-checked Trump.

""[The] ABC News Presidential Debate featured network moderator Linsey Davis attempting to debunk former President Trump's assertion that some states allow for the killing of an infant after birth,"" Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America president Marjorie Dannenfelser wrote in the letter obtained by Fox News Digital.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH ABORTION FACT-CHECK AGAINST TRUMP: 'COMPLETELY INTERJECTS HERSELF'

During the debate, Trump referred to infamous comments made by former Virginia Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam in 2019 but was promptly ""fact-checked"" by Davis. At the time, Northam suggested that in those rare instances of third-trimester abortions, a baby could be born alive and a ""discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.""

""The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother,"" Northam said in 2019.

Trump's apparent reference to Northam at the debate drew a quick rebuke from Davis.

""There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born,"" Davis said.

Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America claims the ABC moderator was ""inaccurate"" and should correct the record.

""This is 100% inaccurate. Her statement tragically ignores the reality of babies who survive failed, late-term abortions but are denied basic medical care and left to die,"" Dannenfelser wrote.

""We are writing to request a swift correction from Ms. Davis and ABC News. It is undeniable that babies are born in this country after failed abortions, as the facts below demonstrate,"" she continued. ""A correction from the network and the debate moderators is an important first step in acknowledging this fact. We also encourage ABC to meet with abortion survivors who are a living testament to the need for born-alive protections.""

VOTERS GIVE HARRIS THE DEBATE WIN, BUT PRAISE TRUMP ON POLICY: SHE GOT UNDER HIS SKIN

The pro-life advocate then added several claims to back up the request for a correction, including ""numerous examples of babies born alive after failed abortions"" and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that ""between 2003 and 2014, around 143 babies died after being born alive following failed abortions.""

It also cited a report from the center-right outlet The Dispatch about Minnesota recording eight deaths among infants who survived abortion attempts during Tim Walz's tenure as governor.

""It's also a fact that, as a U.S. senator, Kamala Harris voted against protections for babies born alive after failed abortions. And as a member of Congress, her running mate Tim Walz even issued a public apology for 'accidentally' voting for said legislation after he previously voted against it,"" Dannenfelser wrote.

The Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life president requested an in-person meeting with ABC honchos to speak directly with abortion survivors.

Numerous fact-checks published after the debate slammed Trump for his remarks on abortion.

""Infanticide is illegal in every state, and Harris and Walz have never supported it,"" CBS News reported. NPR also cited a Kaiser Family Foundation report earlier this year that stated abortions ""after birth"" are illegal in all 50 states.

At the debate, Harris dodged a question from Davis over whether she supported any restrictions on a woman's right to an abortion.

""I absolutely support reinstating the protections of Roe v. Wade,"" Harris said. ""And as you rightly mentioned, nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion. That is not happening.""

During the 2022 primaries, Kunce, a progressive Democrat, supported transgender treatment for children. On Thursday, Kunce posted a video of Hawley on X talking about Missouri's Amendment 3 - the state's right to abortion initiative - where Hawley said that Kunce supports transgender treatments for minors.

""Josh Hawley is so afraid of sharing the ballot with an amendment to end his total abortion ban that it's broken his brain,"" Kunce posted to X in response.

Kunce won the Democratic primary in Missouri, a Republican state, last month and has his sights set on unseating Hawley, who was elected in 2019.

The move comes just days after a different political handicapper similarly decided that Republicans were favored to win the Senate seat.

Republican candidate Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL, is now expected to win the race against incumbent Tester, per the handicappers.

The Times interviewed voters in five states and asked them whether the debate changed their views on the presidential race.

""It was kind of like, 'can you take him serious?'"" Kelly said. However, Trump's opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, did not move the needle either.

""She didn't, kind of, separate herself,"" Kelly said, adding that she was ""still on the fence.""

Rep. Colin Allred, D-Texas, featured the southern border wall in a recent Senate campaign ad despite having previously claimed the wall proposed by former President Trump was ""racist.""

The Democrat was seen in a July campaign ad walking with law enforcement along a portion of the border wall as he hit Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for opposing a border measure backed by Democrats in the upper chamber.

However, Allred has had a long history of opposing the border wall and other elements of Trump and Republicans' efforts to secure the border.

In fact, at an event in 2018, Allred told attendees, ""If they build that racist wall, my generation is the one that will tear it down. You're not going to have a wall in this country.""

As a representative, he has voted against countless bills that would institute strict changes to address the crisis at the southern border. Most notably, he opposed the H.R. 2 Secure the Border Act, which had been advocated by House and Senate Republicans. The legislation is understood to propose the toughest crackdown on the southern border and illegal immigration in consideration.

He also voted for a resolution to end the national emergency declaration that then-President Trump had made for the southern border and in favor of legislation that would limit the president's ability to suspend or restrict the ability of illegal immigrants to enter the country, among other controversial measures.

""Congressman Allred is laser focused on solutions supported by both parties to fix our broken immigration system and secure our border. Ted Cruz has been in the Senate 12 years and has nothing to show for it. He tanked bipartisan legislation that would secure our border. Lyin' Ted only cares about himself, and Texans know he will never be part of a real solution,"" Allred spokesperson Josh Stewart told Fox News Digital in a statement.

TOP 5 MOMENTS DURING TRUMP-HARRIS PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'I'M TALKING NOW'

While the border bill in question was negotiated by bipartisan Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz, and James Lankford, R-Okla, Republicans have largely rejected the resulting bill and were vocal critics of the negotiations as they were taking place.

After the long-awaited release of the negotiated bill this year, Republicans promptly rejected it.

Some members of the Republican conference in the Senate have even said the measure would have made the current border crisis worse.

While some have pointed to Trump's opposition to the bill as the reason it did not succeed, one Senate Republican told Fox News Digital it would have failed either way. But they said they imagine Trump is happy to take credit.

In the most recent procedural vote on the border bill, two of the three negotiators, Sinema and Lankford, voted it down.

NRA BETS BIG ON MONTANA IN GUN RIGHTS PUSH AS TESTER TEETERS IN SENATE RACE

Another Republican criticism of the bill has been that the president currently enjoys the authority to address many of the concerns at the border right now and doesn't need additional congressional permission to fix the crisis.

Allred is not the only Democrat who has apparently changed their tune on the border wall as concerns about illegal immigration surge. Vice President Harris, who is running as the Democrat nominee for president, has also used the Trump-era border wall in campaign advertisements portraying her as strong on the southern border.

Trump's campaign slammed Harris over this, with a spokesperson previously saying that statements that Harris now supports Trump's border wall are ""preposterous and false claim(s).""

POLITICAL ANALYST ACCUSES ABC OF SOFT TREATMENT ON HARRIS' POLICY FLIP-FLOPS: 'BIGGEST FAILURE' OF NIGHT

ABC News is a left-wing, woke leftist talk network, but they're not honest. In what was the most overt, sickening display of left-wing bias during a presidential debate, the so-called moderators barely asked the vice president about any massive flip-flops, changes in position - only since she became the presumptive Democratic nominee, never once followed up on when she failed to provide a straight answer.

NBC's Chuck Todd applauded Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday for how she handled the presidential debate against former President Trump, arguing she outperformed her predecessor, President Biden.

""It is fascinating to me that how the Harris campaign has -- has decided to take Trump on, belittle him, make him small. He's not this menacing figure that -- that is threatening to destroy America the way Joe Biden was painting him or, to a lesser extent, even Hillary Clinton,"" Todd said on MSNBC's ""Andrea Mitchell Reports."" ""Like this is -- and this is borrowing a page from how Barack Obama dealt with Donald Trump. Now granted, Obama never actually faced him in a campaign, but it was -- it was a belittling. It was the whole Gary Busey shot.""

""This stuff does get under his skin,"" Todd said. ""He can't handle it. And we're seeing -- I mean, this is why I -- if I were in the LaCivita/Wiles shoes I would not put him up against her again, because the abortion contrast alone. And that's the most important thing about this debate.""

""He disagreed with J.D. Vance,"" host Andrea Mitchell said.

""It is the most important part of this debate. He gave that unforced error in that answer,"" Todd replied. ""Joe Biden could have never done what Kamala Harris did. And that's why Joe Biden couldn't win this election"" due to alleged discomfort with the abortion issue. ""What she said, talking about humanizing it, Joe Biden couldn't even bring himself to utter the words 'abortion ban' and she called them Trump abortion bans.""

Todd also underlined how Harris outperformed Biden on the debate stage.

""I think of all of the back and forth, this was the most substantive, and this was a reminder, I think, of why so many Democrats were convinced Biden didn't have what it took to win this campaign, because you needed to make reproductive rights among the front and center issues,"" the political analyst said. ""He was uncomfortable speaking about it, you could tell. I mean, I'm just thinking about just the anecdote she shared. Joe Biden never would have been able to bring himself to share that anecdote.""

ABC has been widely criticized for how it moderated the debate, in particular Linsey Davis' controversial ""fact-check"" against Trump about abortion.

Trump had spoken about abortions performed in the ninth month of pregnancy. He referred to former Virginia Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam's infamous comments on third-trimester abortions.

""The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother,"" Northam said at the time."

(Courtesy: ABC News)

During Tuesday's debate, former President Trump sought to delineate his and other Republicans' pro-life viewpoints with that of Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party, while sparring with moderator Linsey Davis.

Davis asked, 'Why should [Americans] trust"" him on the abortion issue when he has changed his view on some aspects of it at times.

In response, Trump said Democrats have been ""radical"" on the issue, while Republicans have sought to bring the issue ""back to the states"" in supporting the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

Trump claimed comments from former Virginia Gov. Ralph S. Northam seem to prove it is Democrats, not Republicans, who hold extreme views on the issue.

CLIMATE PROTESTERS INTERRUPT YOUNGKIN'S REMARKS REMEMBERING 9/11

While appearing to accidentally refer to Northam as the previous governor of West Virginia, who would be Democrat Earl Ray Tomblin, Trump said the opposition party wants to allow abortions into the ninth month of gestation and even after birth.

""Look at [Northam], not the current governor who is doing an excellent job, but the governor before him, who said, 'The baby will be born, and we will decide what to do with the baby.' In other words, we'll execute the baby,"" Trump said.

In 2019, Northam was interviewed by Washington, D.C., radio station WTOP and was asked about a bill from Delegate Kathy Tran, D-Springfield, that loosened Virginia abortion restrictions.

Northam was asked to explain a comment Tran made in a committee hearing regarding a woman being permitted to undergo an abortion while in labor.

""This is why decisions such as this should be made by providers, physicians and the mothers and fathers that are involved. When we talk about third-trimester abortions, these are done with the consent of obviously the mother, with the consent of the physician -- more than one physician, by the way -- and it's done in cases where there may be severe deformities,"" he said.

TRUMP: I HAVE BEEN A LEADER ON IVF

Northam, who was also a pediatrician in Onancock, Va., added that if a mother is in labor, the infant would ""be delivered [and] kept comfortable.""

""The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.""

In the debate, Trump said Northam's comments show Democrats are the true ""radicals"" on the abortion issue, while Republicans have fought to return the issue to states, where people can vote on the leniency or strictness of abortion policy in their area.

Trump said most Republicans support exceptions to abortion bans for life of the mother or rape or incest.

He noted Republicans' success in having abortion policy returned to state houses has actually led to several red states passing otherwise lenient abortion policies, pointing to referendums in Ohio and Kansas.

""The vote [in Ohio] was somewhat liberal,"" Trump said.

However, Davis cut in after Trump finished his response and said, ""There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born.""

Heritage Foundation religion fellow Delano Squires shared clips of both Tran and Northam speaking about the late-term abortion policy, sarcastically captioning it, ""no one supports abortion in the ninth month.""

""This is how extreme they are,"" tweeted Rob Smith, a conservative commentator.

Dozens of others on X posted the same video of Northam speaking to WTOP in attempts to debunk Davis' retort or make Trump's case."
Top five clashes of the Harris-Trump presidential debate: 'I'm talking now',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-five-clashes-harris-trump-presidential-debate-im-talking-now,2024-09-11T20:42:35Z,"The top five clashes between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Harris.

The presidential debate on Tuesday between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump saw a number of testy moments between the two candidates.

The debate, which was in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was the first and possibly only debate between Harris and Trump. The Harris campaign quickly said ""Harris is ready for a second debate,"" but Trump said on Wednesday morning during a ""Fox and Friends"" interview that he ""won the debate"" and is ""less inclined to"" do another debate with Harris.

Here are some of the top clashes of the night:

HUGE MAJORITY OF DEBATE WATCHERS SAY HARRIS TOOK HOME THE VICTORY, CNN POLL FINDS

One of the early clashes between the two was over abortion. Harris accused Trump of opening the door to ""Trump abortion bans"" due to his nomination of justices who eventually overturned Roe v Wade.

""If Donald Trump were to be re-elected, he will sign a national abortion ban,"" she said.

Trump responded by calling that a ""lie."" The two would eventually challenge each other on the topic, with Trump asking if Harris would support late-term abortions, and Harris challenging Trump to say if he would veto a federal abortion ban.

""Will she allow abortion in the eighth month? Ninth month? Seventh month?"" Trump asked.

""Why don't you ask her that question?"" Trump appealed to the moderators.

""Why don't you answer the question, would you veto?"" Harris asked Trump.

TRUMP SAYS PROJECT 2025 'GOES WAY TOO FAR' WITH ABORTION RESTRICTIONS

Harris upset former Trump when she accused him of holding boring rallies and accused him of talking about ""windmills causing cancer.""

""What you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom. And I will tell you, the one thing you will not hear him talk about is you.""

Trump soon shot back: ""People don't go to her rallies. There's no reason to go. And the people that do go, she's busing them in and paying them to be there. And then showing them in a different light. So she can't talk about that. People don't leave my rallies. We have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics.""

Trump used a quip on Tuesday evening similar to one made famous in 2020 by Harris during the vice presidential debate, in which she repeatedly told then-Vice President Mike Pence, ""I'm speaking.""

""Wait a minute, I'm talking now if you don't mind. Please,"" Trump said. ""Does that sound familiar?""

Harris smiled as she clearly got the reference.

""Remember this, she is Biden. You know, she's trying to get away from Biden. 'I don't know the gentleman,' she says. She is Biden. The worst inflation we've ever had. A horrible economy because inflation has made it so bad and she can't get away with it,"" he said.

Harris shot back: ""Clearly, I am not Joe Biden and I am certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country.""

Harris and Trump attacked one another over Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""It is well known that he admires dictators, wants to be a dictator on day one, according to himself. It is well known that he said of Putin that he can do whatever the hell he wants and go into Ukraine. It is well known that he said when Russia went into the Ukraine, it was brilliant,"" she said.

Trump pushed back, accusing Harris of being ""weak on national security"" and said she had the endorsement of Putin.

""Putin endorsed her last week, said, 'I hope she wins,' and I think he meant it because what he's gotten away with is absolutely incredible. It wouldn't have happened with me,"" he said."

Mike Rogers, addressed what promises to be a top concern of many voters in November in a new campaign ad, making his position clear.

""I know that a decision about a pregnancy is one of the most difficult and personal decisions a woman will make,"" Rogers said in a new ad, appearing seated alongside his wife, Kristi Rogers, who held his hand.

""Michigan voters have already decided the issue, and I respect that decision,"" he explained, referencing the 2022 election, in which Michigan voters chose to enact Proposal 3, an abortion rights amendment that enshrined the ""fundamental right to reproductive freedom"" into law.

The amendment also protected rights to contraception and treatments for infertility.

""In the Senate, I won't do anything to change it,"" he promised in the 15-second digital campaign ad.

TOP 5 MOMENTS DURING TRUMP-HARRIS PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'I'M TALKING NOW'

A source familiar told Fox News Digital the ad is meant to combat purported misinformation from the campaign of Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., on Rogers' stance.

They will continue to address this as necessary with campaign expenditures, the source added.

The video comes the same day as Slotkin rolled out two abortion-related ads against Rogers as part of a multi-million dollar buy running on broadcast, cable and digital platforms.

NRA BETS BIG ON MONTANA IN GUN RIGHTS PUSH AS TESTER TEETERS IN SENATE RACE

One ad slams Rogers for his espoused support for restrictions on abortion in 1994. At the time, he told the Lansing State Journal, ""I support all restrictions on abortions, since I consider it intentional taking of life. I would further support legislation restricting abortions done for choosing the sex of a baby.""

She also took aim at the Republican for reportedly expressing support in a questionnaire supposedly two decades ago for policy such as a ""human life amendment,"" establishing that babies are considered a life once they are conceived.

Slotkin's second ad features a woman named Sarah, describing having several miscarriages and an issue with her fifth pregnancy that she said required an abortion. ""I'm scared that Mike Rogers will continue to take away my rights,"" she said.

DEMS FACE TIGHT TIMELINE TO CONFIRM BIDEN-HARRIS JUDGES, SURPASS TRUMP LEGACY

However, Rogers has pushed back at suggestions that these instances would define his actions in the Senate, doing so once again in the Wednesday video. In fact, Rogers has committed consistently since launching his Senate campaign last year to abiding by the Michigan abortion law and not supporting federal legislation that would contradict it. He has further gotten behind former President Trump's stance that abortion should be left to the states.

In Michigan, abortion was the third most cited as a top issue for voters in a July Fox News Poll. The top issue for the most voters by far was the economy, with 35% saying so. This was followed by immigration at 17% and abortion at 16%.

According to a CNN poll released this month, Slotkin leads Rogers 47% to 41%. A previous AARP-commissioned poll of the race last month showed Rogers tied with her among the key demographic of voters over 50 years old, with each posting 46%. Among all voters, Slotkin slightly led her opponent, 47% to 44%.

A top political handicapper, the Cook Political Report, rated the Michigan Senate race a ""toss up,"" despite the seat's lengthy history of going Democrat."

NBC News' Dasha Burns said Wednesday that Trump's immediate reaction to the debate was telling.

""The former president going to the spin room, which, traditionally in politics, you don't do unless you feel like you didn't well enough in the debate. He's now saying, after claiming he's willing to do another debate, now saying maybe not so much. And he and his team have spent a lot of the day and a lot of last night going after the moderators, going after the network, rather than talking about their candidate's performance, which I think is pretty telling,"" she told MSNBC's Jos√© D√≠az-Balart.

Puck News' Dylan Byers said ABC did an ""incredibly commendable job.""

CNN's Bakari Sellers said Trump was so ""humiliated"" by Harris in the debate that he resorted to blaming the moderators.

Justin Baragona, a media columnist at former MSNBC host Medhi Hasan's news site, Zeteo, said Democrats were similarly blaming the CNN moderators after the Biden-Trump debate in July.

""If you're whining about the refs, you are losing,"" he wrote on social media.

Former CNN host Don Lemon also posted a video on social media on Wednesday and said, ""let's hear some love for the moderators.""

Fox News contributor Marie Harf passed along on ""Outnumbered"" that a conservative writer admitted to her, ""If we're complaining about the refs, we're losing.""

Other conservative commentators, including CNN's Scott Jennings, agreed that blaming the moderators was not a good sign for the former president.

""You can't complain about the refs when you aren't making your own jump shots. And for Trump, it is no excuse for his getting sidetracked (at least until his closing statement) and failing to make the central case that must be made: If you want change, you can't leave the same people in charge,"" he wrote in an op-ed for the LA Times.

MSNBC's Brian Lowry wrote in a column on Wednesday that Davis and Muir did a better job than CNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash did during the first debate between Biden and Trump.

""The tightrope walk of modern journalism means never pleasing everyone, and the constant peril of being accused of putting a thumb on the scales. So we have to give credit to ABC News' David Muir and Linsey Davis, who for the most part were able to deftly navigate that fine line during Tuesday's debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.

Pollster Lee Carter provides real-time debate reactions.

Dials monitoring the reaction of a Fox News focus group during Tuesday's presidential debate showed independent voters overlapping with Republicans in support of former President Trump's immigration policies.

Trump took aim at Vice President Kamala Harris during the ABC News Presidential Debate, blaming the Biden-Harris administration for ""destroying the fabric of our country"" with the influx of illegal immigration.

The former president blamed the administration for the rise in ""migrant crime,"" a sentiment that seemingly resonated with not just Republicans, but a large number of independent respondents.

The focus group comprised seven Democrats, five independents, and five Republicans, and was represented by blue, yellow, and red lines, respectively. When Trump spoke of the rising crime at the hands of illegal immigrants, the yellow line monitoring the independent reaction rose drastically in Trump's favor, overlapping with the red Republican line.

FOX NEWS VOTER PANEL SAYS HARRIS WON THE DEBATE

Lee Carter, pollster and president of Maslansky + Partners said she was shocked to see independent voters tracking with Republicans so closely on the issue.

""I was really, really surprised because the intensity of the independent support was there for Donald Trump and I didn't expect it,"" Carter said Wednesday on ""The Faulkner Focus.""

""Independents are tracking very much with Republicans. They're looking for a couple of things. They're looking for answers on immigration, they're looking for answers on the economy. They want to hear that things will get better for them and they also want change from what is happening right now,"" Carter continued. ""One of the most important things they were looking for last night from Kamala Harris is how are you going to make it different?""

VOTERS REACT TO TRUMP SAYING HE 'TOOK A BULLET TO THE HEAD' OVER LEFT RHETORIC

An independent voter from New York who joined a voter panel Wednesday told host Harris Faulkner, ""You don't have to look any further than the five boroughs to see the impact of the migrant crisis.""

""When asked directly by the moderators, Kamala didn't even make an effort to defend the administration's policies at all. She can't,"" he added. ""It's indefensible, so she pivoted...but they totally rewrote all of Trump's immigration policies year one. I would've liked to have seen an explanation for the country as to why they did that.""

Carter proceeded to highlight additional examples - including on fracking, abortion and the economy - where independents tracked with Republicans' reactions.

Faulkner said the dial results indicate the GOP ""better pay attention"" to non-affiliated voters.

""I think the independents are tracking this way with Trump's responses because it is obvious what's happening across the country in these cities,"" a GOP voter from New Jersey said.

""Every single day we're seeing destruction...crime...every single day our safety is being compromised and I think you can't hide from that and I think it's becoming more and more obvious and something needs to change.""

Independents showed dissatisfaction with Trump while he talked about the coronavirus pandemic, but both Democrats and Republicans were consistently more supportive of the former president as he discussed the pandemic and the economy.

Vice President Kamala Harris successfully baited former President Trump on several occasions at Tuesday's ABC Presidential debate, making him see red and knocking him off course, according to body language expert Susan Constantine.

Tuesday's debate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was the first time Trump and Harris shared the debate stage, with commentators opining that it was a good night for Harris while Trump has had better performances.

That was, in part, due to how Harris sparked reactions from Trump, who became more frustrated and angry as the night wore on.

IN THE TRUMP-HARRIS FACEOFF THERE WAS A CLEAR WINNER BUT DON'T BELIEVE THIS ELECTION IS OVER

Constantine tells Fox News Digital that Harris knew Trump's weak points, such as questioning crowd sizes at his rallies, and when she brought them up, he defiantly responded -- to his detriment.

""He fell for every one of her games; they were all tactics,"" Constantine says. ""So when she would poke the bear, he would growl back and she would keep poking the bear and especially when it came to, of course, the crowds.""

Harris said that people at Trump's rallies often leave early out of exhaustion and boredom. Trump responded by saying that his rallies have record-breaking crowds, whereas Harris buses people to her rallies and pays them to be there.

""She knew every single one of his weak points, and he would defend it instead of answering the question and just staying on task. He was spending most of his time hitting her back with the ball and also defending himself, which was not a good approach,"" Constantine says.

""You could see that Trump was getting really, really upset about it. At one point, he dropped his shoulders, dropped his head, and he sunk. And then you see the upper lip [move upward] very quickly. It was a micro-expression of leakage, of hatred and disgust and scorn ... he was really angry at her for saying that.""

HARRIS TELLS TRUMP HE'S 'NOT RUNNING AGAINST JOE BIDEN' DURING DEBATE

Constantine says Trump was angry for a reason, noting that Harris made a lot of derogatory remarks, and thus he was unable to regain control of the debate after being goaded by Harris, whose smiles were reflective of her knowing she had cornered the former president.

""You would see his anger, his voice inflection, his breast eyebrows pursed or his tightened lips. He was angry. In fact, you could hear a lot in his voice,"" she explains. ""His lips were pressed most of the time. He was suppressing a lot of his own feelings towards her, which was anger. All that did was fuel for Harris because she knew she got him. That's why you kept seeing the smiles. And every time she got him ... she rewarded herself with a great big perma-smile.""

Constantine says that Harris' smiles were often not genuine and were abnormally long. Harris also did this to prod Trump and smiled as a fallback plan when she didn't agree with things Trump said, according to Constantine.

BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT'S BRUTAL TAKE ON BIDEN'S DEBATE AGAINST TRUMP: 'LIKE A DEAD MAN WALKING'

""Real smiles don't last beyond the very longest four seconds. When a person holds that smile and does it throughout, that's condescending, and what she's doing is she is also dismissing what Trump is saying and [that] is covered with the perma-smile. That is inauthentic,"" Constantine explains. ""If she wants to diminish what Trump is saying, she smiles all the way through or even laughs at that in itself.""

Constantine says that there was a clear distinction between the two candidates: Trump with a more serious tone, Harris appearing happier.

In the beginning, Harris would kick her head back often and almost leave her head tilting up, which Constantine describes as a ""superiority stance."" She raised her nose up and crossed her arms evaluating.

""It was condescending and also smug. Not a good move,"" Constantine says.

Constantine says Harris was very illustrative with her hand movements and looked straight into the camera, knowing exactly how to frame her gestures.

""She spoke to the American people. She played the card musically perfect in a lot of ways. So I think that she had gotten a lot of coaching.""

Constantine says Harris went out of sync when she was tripped up about a question about whether she supports any restrictions on a woman's right to an abortion.

""She evaded that question because she couldn't really answer,"" she explains. ""So that's when her eyes go down she starts to do the 'bobblehead.' And that was a cluster of deception.""

Additionally, Constantine praised Harris for her pre-debate handshake, noting that the vice president moved into Trump's space to engage with him.

""She paused for a minute. She was almost slightly hesitant, but then she went for it... So I'm going to give her a point for that one,"" Constantine says. ""Overall ... it was certainly a boxing match. They were completely on opposite sides, of course. There was no love there on [the] Trump side, and then I think that Harris used that to her advantage and Donald Trump fell into the trap."""

Former President Donald Trump shredded ABC News for what he considered a ""rigged deal"" on the debate stage after he went head-to-head against Vice President Kamala Harris on various issues.

Trump tore into the network during ""FOX & Friends,"" calling out co-moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis for only fact-checking him and refusing to call out the vice president for her false claims.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH ABORTION FACT-CHECK AGAINST TRUMP: 'COMPLETELY INTERJECTS HERSELF'

""I think we did great. It was three to one. It was a rigged deal as I assumed it would be,"" Trump said Wednesday. ""Because when you look at the fact that they were correcting everything and not correcting with her, and we knew it, the winner was 100% good coverage for her over the last month or last year. I looked at it and only bad coverage of me no matter what. The press is so dishonest in this country. It's amazing.""

""I didn't mind because frankly, I knew that I was pretty sure that's what they would do,"" he continued. ""CNN was much more honorable. The way we had with Biden was a much more honorably-run debate, but this was incredible.""

The pair fact-checked Trump five times during the heated 90-minute event and failed to correct Harris a single time.

Aside from the lopsided number of fact-checks, many pundits said Trump received far more challenging questions and that ABC moderators gave largely Harris a pass on a variety of issues.

""So many things I said were debunked, totally debunked, like Charlottesville... I have a list of seven different things,"" Trump said. ""And she could say anything she wanted. Everything, every time I spoke, and my stuff was right, and they'd correct you. I thought it was terrible from the standpoint of ABC.""

""They're the most dishonest, in my opinion, the most dishonest news organization, and that's saying a lot because they're all essentially really dishonest,"" he continued.

Many have pointed out that Muir and Davis failed to correct Harris for saying that Trump once said there were ""very fine people"" on both sides of the Charlottesville ""Unite the Right"" rally in 2017.

FOX NEWS MEDIA PROPOSES SECOND HARRIS-TRUMP DEBATE MODERATED BY MARTHA MACCALLUM, BRET BAIER

Critics of Trump have claimed for years that he called neo-Nazis ""very fine people"" when he was actually talking about people protesting over a Robert E. Lee statue, with President Biden and his allies in the mainstream media regularly pushing the notion.

But earlier this year, left-leaning fact-checking website Snopes acknowledged that Trump never called neo-Nazis ""very fine people"" during his press conference following the ""Unite the Right"" rally.

""In a news conference after the rally protesting the planned removal of a Confederate statue, Trump did say there were 'very fine people on both sides,' referring to the protesters and the counterprotesters. He said in the same statement he wasn't talking about neo-Nazis and white nationalists, who he said should be 'condemned totally,'"" Snopes wrote.

Trump helped out ABC moderators by informing viewers that the claim by Harris has been ""debunked.""

Muir and Davis were also quick to interject with Trump on key issues dealing with crime, abortion, illegal immigration, the 2020 election and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

""I think they lost a lot of credibility,"" Trump said. ""I think it was one of my better debates, maybe my best debate I think."""

Former President Donald Trump's top allies are rushing to declare victory after his debate against Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday night.

GOP lawmakers are touting a Trump win even as they criticize ABC News moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis for their handling of the debate, accusing them of acting with bias against the ex-president.

""President Trump delivered a powerful America First message directly to the American people focusing on reining in inflation and strengthening our economy, securing our border, and peace through strength foreign policy,"" House GOP Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., said in a statement at the tail end of the debate.

""The ABC moderators were not journalists, they were pro-Kamala activists who baselessly attacked President Trump leading to a 3 on 1 debate, while allowing Kamala to lie repeatedly. President Trump won overwhelmingly and will win again on Election Day.""

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Trump ""exposed"" Harris as a ""radical"" despite her seeking to reflect more moderate positions on firearm ownership and the border at times.

""While Harris lied about her radical positions and spoke about things she would supposedly do as president, and despite the biased moderators shamelessly covering for Harris, there are two problems that Americans were reminded of in prime-time: she has a lifelong record as a Marxist, and she's the sitting Vice President who could secure the border and bring down costs today,"" Johnson said.

TRUMP SAYS PROJECT 2025 'GOES WAY TOO FAR' WITH ABORTION RESTRICTIONS

Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, similarly told Fox News host Sean Hannity, ""The moderators didn't do their job, but President Trump did do his job.""

Senate GOP Conference Chair John Barrasso, R-Wyo., wrote on X, ""President Trump tonight shared his strong vision to reverse the high prices and open borders of the Biden-Harris administration. He articulated a plan to unleash American energy and to get our country back on track.""

Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, Trump's former White House physician, said the ex-president ""just DESTROYED Kamala Harris on national television and EXPOSED her administration for the harm it caused!!""

However, not all Republicans agreed it was a clear victory for Trump. One GOP lawmaker, granted anonymity to speak freely, told Fox News Digital that Harris appeared to be getting under Trump's skin.

""She talks to us like toddlers but is doing a good job of provoking him,"" the GOP lawmaker said during the debate. ""He's right on policy but can't keep to a message."""

Democratic elected officials and political operatives heaped praise on Vice President Kamala Harris for her debate performance against former President Donald Trump on Tuesday evening.

""America got to see tonight the leader I've been proud to work alongside for three and a half years. Wasn't even close. VP Harris proved she's the best choice to lead our nation forward. We're not going back,"" President Biden posted on X early Wednesday morning after the debate wrapped up.

""Well, that was a knockout. I'm looking forward to seeing how Republicans try to spin this one,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer posted to X in another favorable message for Harris.

Trump and Harris took the same debate stage for the first time this election cycle on Tuesday evening in Philadelphia's National Constitution Center. The pair sparred over the top issues concerning voters, including the economy, immigration and abortion.

TRUMP FACT CHECKS HARRIS ON CHARLOTTESVILLE RIOT ACCUSATION: 'DEBUNKED'

Harris' Democratic allies in Congress, as well as Democratic pundits, praised Harris for how she ""destroyed"" Trump's career, and that voters bore witness to a ""serious leader who will work day in and out"" for the American people.

TRUMP SAYS HE 'PROBABLY TOOK A BULLET TO THE HEAD' DUE TO DEM RHETORIC

The Harris campaign also released a statement Tuesday evening, taking a victory lap that ""Harris commanded the stage on every single issue that matters to the American people.""

""Under the bright lights, the American people got to see the choice they will face this fall at the ballot box: between moving forward with Kamala Harris, or going backwards with Trump. That's what they saw tonight and what they should see at a second debate in October. Vice President Harris is ready for a second debate. Is Donald Trump?"" the Harris campaign posted.

Trump and Harris sparred on top issues concerning voters on Tuesday evening, including on abortion, when Harris claimed Trump's platform would install a national abortion ban that would allow for no exceptions to such a procedure.

HARRIS CLAIMS TRUMP ABORTION PLATFORM MAKES 'NO EXCEPTION,' MOMENTS AFTER TRUMP SAYS THE OPPOSITE

""Now, in over 20 states, there are Trump abortion bans, which make it criminal for a doctor or nurse to provide health care in one state. It provides prison for life. Trump abortion bans that make no exception, even for rape and incest, which understand what that means,"" Harris said Tuesday evening from Philadelphia's National Constitution Center.

""A survivor of a crime of violation to their body does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body. That is immoral, and one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body.""

Moments before, however, Trump said he believes in exceptions for abortion, similar to former President Reagan.

""I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother,"" Trump said during the debate. ""I believe strongly in it. Ronald Reagan did also. Eighty-five percent of Republicans knew exceptions are very important.""

Trump and Harris also traded barbs on the issue of crime in the United States, as Harris defended accusations that migrant crime has increased under her watch by citing Trump's legal issues.

""Yeah, it is much higher because of them,"" Trump said during the debate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania discussing crime committed by illegal immigrants in the U.S., some of which entered the country under Biden's watch.

""They allowed criminals, many, many millions of criminals,"" Trump continued, ""They allowed terrorists. They allowed common street criminals. They allowed people to come in drug dealers to come into our country. And then now in the United States and told by their countries like Venezuela, don't ever come back or we're going to kill you. Do you know that crime in Venezuela and crime in countries all over the world is way down?""

Following the debate, the Harris campaign called for a second debate in October. Trump had repeatedly called for additional debates against Harris, after only having one other presidential debate in June against President Biden.

The biggest loser in the Trump-Harris debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biggest-loser-trump-harris-debate,2024-09-11T05:52:05Z,"The biggest loser in the first (and likely only) presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump was ABC News, which hosted the face-off. The moderators, David Muir and Linsey Davis, embarrassed themselves and their network by, among other things, fact-checking Trump in real time on more than one occasion - sometimes incorrectly - while allowing Harris to spout serial lies and distortions.

Social media blew up early on in the debate with commentators on the right, in particular, calling Tuesday night's face-off the worst and most one-sided debate in history.

IN THE TRUMP-HARRIS FACE-OFF THERE WAS A CLEAR WINNER BUT DON'T BELIEVE THIS ELECTION IS OVER

Some of the non-truths Harris could (and should have been) fact-checked on:

1. Talking about Project 2025 as if it were Trump's manifesto, and saying that he will pass a nationwide abortion ban

2. Dredging up Trump's Charlottesville comment - that there were ""very fine people on both sides"" - which has been debunked

3. Saying Trump had overseen the worst unemployment since the Great Depression, which was caused by the pandemic

4. Saying Donald Trump has opposed IVF

5. Denying that Kamala Harris ever called for gun confiscation (there are videos of her doing just that)

6. Saying that Trump's tax cuts only helped rich people

7. And my special bete noir - saying that she and Biden have ""created"" 800,000 manufacturing jobs, which is simply not true.

There were others. Harris lied about her record and about Trump's and was not challenged on any of it.

LEFT WING FACT-CHECKER ADMITS TRUMP NEVER CALLED CHARLOTTESVILLE NEO-NAZIS 'VERY FINE PEOPLE' IN BLOW TO BIDEN

Perhaps that was inevitable; the liberal media is in full panic mode now that Harris' honeymoon appears to have faded and Trump has pulled even and, in some polls, moved back into the lead.

Harris' pathetic effort to avoid committing to any policies while on the campaign trail has failed; her refusal to do solo interviews and press conferences has left American voters in the dark. Consequently, the debate was important. People want to know where she stands. Unfortunately, because she deflected on most of the questions and did not flesh out the very few policies she has offered, they still have very little idea of her views.

ABC DEBATE MODERATORS SPARK FURY FOR AGGRESSIVE FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP, EASY TREATMENT OF HARRIS

That should have been the job of the moderators, but they declined to do it. Instead, they allowed her to prattle on with Biden-like platitudes. Once again, a bitterly partisan candidate is promising to bring the country together. Remember that one?

The moderators asked Harris early on whether people were better off under the Biden-Harris administration than they had been under Trump, and instead of citing areas of progress (perhaps because there are none), she launched into describing her ""opportunity economy."" This denotes her ""plan,"" which she touted frequently and which apparently rests on giving people money to buy a home, giving people money to start a business and giving people money to help them raise children.

How taxpayers will pay for all these ""opportunities"" was left unsaid. This is, of course, very Bidenesque - promise money to important voting groups like young people who have drifted away from Democrats and small business owners, who have historically lined up behind Trump.

TRUMP SPARS WITH HARRIS, MODERATORS DURING HEATED PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'SHE DOESN'T HAVE A PLAN'

Trump, on the other hand, failed to prosecute his case. While Harris appeared over-prepared and practiced, with ready-to-go gestures and studied mannerisms, Trump was clearly under-prepared. It is frustrating to his supporters, because he has the facts on his side. He actually did build a strong economy, but saw it slammed by COVID. He actually did leave the world at peace, and negotiated significant new alliances between Middle Eastern countries. He actually did demote Iran's ability to wage proxy wars through sanctions and constrained Russia's energy dominance by cancelling the Nordstream 2 Pipeline. And, he alerted the world to China's dishonest intentions and rule-breaking; none of his predecessors had tried to rein in Beijing.

But instead of forcefully arguing about his successes, he meandered. And, he forgot to smile.

TRUMP FLIPS 'I'M TALKING' SCRIPT FROM 2020 DEBATE AGAINST KAMALA HARRIS DURING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE SHOWDOWN

Rather than patiently and systematically challenging Harris with evidence that his administration had helped the middle class more than hers, Trump reverted to form, claiming once again that he actually won the 2020 election.

That was a mistake, and the liberal press was doubtless jumping for joy. His comments will breathe new life into Biden and Harris' warnings about Trump being a threat to democracy, a talking point that had all but vanished from the political discourse in recent months.

He repeatedly bashed Harris over her failure to curb illegal immigration, but failed to specify the damage done by the inflow of migrants to our cities, neglected to talk about the huge number of people killed by fentanyl because of our open border or the 320,000 children that the White House has lost track of. That was low-hanging fruit, and an opportunity missed.

He also rose to the bait more than once. When Harris slammed his rallies, saying people got bored and walked out, he couldn't resist devolving into arguing about crowd sizes...again.

Trump did manage to make some good points, noting, for instance, that despite criticism over his tariff policy, the Biden-Harris White House had left intact his fees on imports from China, because they were effective. He also pushed back on the jobs supposedly ""created"" by the current White House, calling them ""bounce-back"" jobs. He's right.

His most effective moment of the evening was asking, in his concluding statement, why she hadn't moved forward with her ""opportunity economy"" and her other plans during the past three and a half years? Why hadn't she fixed the border or created more jobs?

That's the question the moderators should have asked."

""They even have, and you can look at the governor of West Virginia [Virginia], the previous governor... not the current governor, who is doing an excellent job, but the governor before, he said, 'The baby will be born, and we will decide what to do with the baby,' in other words, we'll execute the baby.

""Would you be inclined to say yes?"" Hannity asked.

""Maybe if it was on a fair network, I would do that,"" Trump said.

The 2024 GOP presidential candidate also hit Harris for her answers to some of the debate questions.

""I always say I've been preparing all my life for these debates. You know, you can't go in like she did, she goes into a room, and she memorized lines more or less,"" he told Hannity.

Trump and Harris received positive and negative reactions to their respective debate performances.

Fox News chief political analyst Brit Hume said the former president ""had a bad night.""

""We heard so many of the old grievances that we'd long thought that Trump had learned were not winners politically,"" Hume said after the debate.

ABC Presidential Debate co-moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis fact-checked former President Trump five times during the heated 90-minute event and failed to correct Vice President Kamala Harris a single time on Tuesday evening.

Aside from the lopsided number of fact-checks, many pundits said Trump received far more challenging questions and that ABC moderators gave largely Harris a pass on a variety of issues. But the lopsided fact-checking took center stage from critics of the Disney-owned network.

""ABC is making a huge mistake trying to fact-check this live. They're only proving how biased they are,"" Fox News contributor Ari Fleischer posted on social media.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH ABORTION FACT-CHECK AGAINST TRUMP: 'COMPLETELY INTERJECTS HERSELF'

Here are fact-checks from the ABC Presidential Debate from the National Constitution Center:

1. Abortion

Trump was asked about his stance on abortion, as ABC's Davis pointed out that the former president has boasted about killing Roe v. Wade and has called himself ""the most pro-life President in American history"" but has since declared he would be great for women's reproductive rights. Trump also recently said Florida's six-week abortion ban ""is too short,"" but said he would vote against a ballot initiative that would overturn the six-week ban on abortions in the state.

""The reason why I'm doing that vote is because... they have abortion in the ninth month. They even have, and you can look at the governor of West Virginia [Viriginia], the previous governor... not the current governor, whose doing an excellent job, but the governor before, he said, 'The baby will be born, and we will decide what to do with the baby,' in other words we'll execute the baby. And that's why I did that,"" Trump said.

Davis raised eyebrows with the first fact-check of the evening.

""There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born,"" Davis said.

2. Pets

Trump said illegal immigrants are eating people's pets

""In Springfield, they're eating the dogs. The people that came in. They're eating the cats. They're eating -- they're eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what's happening in our country. And it's a shame,"" Trump said.

Muir shot back, ""I just want to clarify here, you bring up Springfield, Ohio. And ABC News did reach out to the city manager there. He told us there have been no credible reports of specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.""

Trump said he's seen it on television, but the ABC anchor wasn't amused.

""The people on television say my dog was taken and used for food. So maybe he said that and maybe that's a good thing to say for a city manager,"" Trump responded.

""I'm not taking this from television. I'm taking it from the city manager,"" Muir said.

""But the people on television say their dog was eaten by the people that went there,"" Trump said.

""Again, the Springfield city manager says there's no evidence of that,"" Muir responded.

FOX NEWS MEDIA PROPOSES SECOND HARRIS-TRUMP DEBATE MODERATED BY MARTHA MACCALLUM, BRET BAIER

3. Crime

At one point, Trump said, ""Crime in this country is through the roof,"" but Muir quickly objected.

""President Trump, as you know, the FBI says overall violent crime is coming down in this country,"" the ABC anchor responded.

""The FBI -- they were defrauding statements. They didn't include the worst cities. They didn't include the cities with the worst crime. It was a fraud. Just like their number of 818,000 jobs that they said they created turned out to be a fraud,"" Trump responded.

4. Sarcasm

Trump said he was being sarcastic when he recently said he lost the 2020 election to President Biden.

""I said that sarcastically. You know that. It was said, 'Oh we lost by a whisker.' That was said sarcastically. Look, there's so much proof. All you have to do is look at it. And they should have sent it back to the legislatures for approval. I got almost 75 million votes. The most votes any sitting president has ever gotten. I was told if I got 63, which was what I got in 2016, you can't be beaten.""

Muir shot back, ""I did watch all of these pieces of video. I didn't detect the sarcasm.""

Muir then told viewers that judges have said there was ""no widespread fraud"" and immediately asked Harris is she felt Trump was trying to intimidate voters with claims he would prosecute anyone who helped cheat an election.

5. Pelosi

There were other moments that weren't full-blown fact-checks, but were seen as hostile moments against Trump, such as when Muir snarked that a question was not about former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi when Trump evoked Pelosi during an answer.

""I showed up for a speech. I said, I think it's going to be big. I went to Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington, D.C. And the mayor put it back in writing, as you know. I said, 'You know, this is going to be a very big rally or whatever you want to call it.' And again, it wasn't done by me. It was done by others. I said I'd like to give you 10,000 National Guard or soldiers. They rejected me. Nancy Pelosi rejected me,"" Trump said.

""It would have never happened if Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington did their jobs. I wasn't responsible for security,"" he continued. ""Nancy Pelosi was responsible. She didn't do her job.""

Muir responded, ""The question was about you as president, not about Former Speaker Pelosi.""

ABC DEBATE MODERATORS SPARK FURY FOR AGGRESSIVE FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP, EASY TREATMENT OF HARRIS

There weren't any.

Many have pointed out that Muir and Davis failed to correct Harris for saying that Trump once said there were ""very fine people"" on both sides of the Charlottesville ""Unite the Right"" rally in 2017.''

Critics of Trump have claimed for years that he called neo-Nazis ""very fine people"" when he was actually talking about people protesting over a Robert E. Lee statue, with President Biden and his allies in the mainstream media regularly pushing the notion.

But earlier this year, left-leaning fact-checking website Snopes acknowledged that Trump never called neo-Nazis ""very fine people"" during his press conference following the Charlottesville ""Unite the Right"" rally in 2017.

""In a news conference after the rally protesting the planned removal of a Confederate statue, Trump did say there were 'very fine people on both sides,' referring to the protesters and the counterprotesters. He said in the same statement he wasn't talking about neo-Nazis and white nationalists, who he said should be 'condemned totally,'"" Snopes wrote.

Trump helped out ABC moderators by informing viewers that the claim by Harris has been ""debunked.""

Harris said we need to stop disparaging people and called Trump a ""disgrace"" minutes later, but ABC moderators failed to point that out. Harris also tied Trump to Project 2025, but moderators failed to point out that Trump has completely distanced himself from the polarizing plan.

Harris also mischaracterized Trump's ""bloodbath"" comment and Trump's stance on IVF without being checked, and ABC moderators failed to question Harris on gun bans and mandatory buybacks and that no active military were in a combat zone."

Reactions from conservatives and liberals came pouring in on social media following the conclusion of the first presidential debate between VP Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.

""Tonight's debate was a clear contrast between Donald Trump, who advanced policies that will address America's biggest concerns, and Kamala Harris, who had nothing but cliched talking points,"" Alfredo Ortiz, Job Creators Network President, said in a statement.

""Kamala ducked and dodged from her failed liberal record, flip-flopping on countless important issues. Kamala can run from her record but can't hide from its results.

By contrast, Trump showed himself to be a true leader, clearly explaining the policies needed to reinvigorate Main Street and the economy. In short, he was presidential, she was not.""

""My debate score: trump - 3 moderators - 9 harris - N/A,"" Fox News host Greg Gutfeld posted on X.

Many on social media criticized the performance of the ABC moderators.

""ABC should be ASHAMED of themselves,"" former Trump press secretary and Fox News host Kayleigh McEnany posted on X. ""1. Where was the question for Kamala about casting the tie breaking vote for inflation (American Rescue Plan etc.)? 2. Where was the question for Kamala about wanting taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for illegal immigrants? 3. Where was the question about Tim Walz allowing babies born alive after abortion to die in Minnesota and then removing reporting requirements NONE - they only prepped TRUMP FACT CHECKS!""

""My debate analysis won't make anyone happy,"" conservative commentator Matt Walsh posted on X. ""I think Kamala was weak and nervous, especially early. She came off as phony and rehearsed the rest of the way. But Trump missed a lot of opportunities to land a blow, rambled too much, and took the bait repeatedly throughout. I don't think this debate moves the needle much for either candidate.""

""Tonight's debate wasn't Harris versus Trump, it was Old Kamala versus New Kamala. Despite an attempt to rewrite history on her support for the most fringe radical policies on everything from the border and immigration, fracking and energy, Bidenomics, and our fundamental government principles, it's clear she still refuses to be honest with the country about where she stands,"" Sentinel Action Fund President Jessica Anderson said in a statement.

VOTERS REPORT KAMALA HARRIS IS MORE RADICAL THAN TRUMP: 'TOO LIBERAL OR PROGRESSIVE'

""Trump did not win the debate but I think he won the election with an assist to ABC because it was so in the tank for Harris that it was repulsive,"" conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt posted on X. ""Voters did see Harris dodge every question that was even slightly difficult and tried to erase her record and Biden's. Voters expected accountability on the economy, inflation and border but got an ABC buffet of lefty agenda journalism that will not cover for the failures of the past three and a half years. Democrats think they won the debate and the election. It is 2016 all over again.""

Others on social media expressed the belief that Harris won the debate.

""Biden gave one of the worst debate performances in history,"" journalist John Ralston posted on X. ""Trump: Hold my beer.""

""Trump's self-image...his political calling card is strength,"" former Obama senior adviser David Axelrod posted on X. ""He was on defense that entire first hour. KamalaHarris pushed all his hot buttons, and he unraveled.""

In a statement, the Harris campaign wrote that Trump was ""incoherent"" and ""angry"" in the debate.

""Tonight, Vice President Harris commanded the stage on every single issue that matters to the American people,"" the campaign said. ""Americans saw exactly what kind of President Kamala Harris will be: one who offers a New Way Forward for the country, who will be a president for all Americans, and who will turn the page once and for all on the darkness and division of Donald Trump. And she reminded the American people that she is the only candidate in this race ready to serve as our next Commander-in-Chief.""

The Trump campaign declared victory in their debate statement.

""President Trump delivered a masterful debate performance tonight, prosecuting Kamala Harris' abysmal record of failure that has hurt Americans for the last 4 years,"" the campaign said.

""We saw President Trump lay out his bold vision of America and how he would continue to build upon the successes of his first term by supercharging the economy, securing the border, and stopping crime from ravaging communities across the country. Conversely, Kamala's vision of America was a dark reminder of the oppressive, big government policies of Joe Biden that she wants to continue. High inflation, a porous border that allows criminals and terrorists to flood across, and being soft on crime -- that is what Kamala represents."""

(Credit: ABC News Presidential Debate)

A Fox News Digital focus group of Republicans, Democrats and Independents used dials to react live to former President Trump's comments during the 2024 presidential debate Kamala Harris Tuesday, saying that he ""took a bullet to the head"" because of leftist rhetoric.

The focus group comprised 7 Democrats, 5 Independents, and 5 Republicans, represented by blue, yellow, and red lines, respectively.

Trump's comments about taking a bullet to the head, came during discussions about alleged ""weponization"" of the Department of Justice.

The Republican nominee contended that it was Harris and the Democrats who had weaponized the DOJ, ""not me.""

HARRIS CLAIMS TRUMP ABORTION PLATFORM MAKES 'NO EXCEPTION,' MOMENTS AFTER TRUMP SAYS THE OPPOSITE

At this assertion, the focus participants showed muted responses, with Democrats slightly above.

""I probably took a bullet to the head, because of the things that they say about me. They talk about Democracy - I'm a threat to Democracy. They're a threat to Democracy,"" Trump said.

With these comments, Republican respondents responded most favorably, as indicated by the red line that shot up. Independents, meanwhile, remained unresponsive, while Democrats dipped slightly downwards.

""The fake 'Russia, Russia, Russia,' investigation that went nowhere,"" Trump continued, before being cut off by ABC News moderator David Muir.

Trump narrowly survived an assassination attempt while holding an outdoor rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on July 13, 2024. Just minutes into his speech, a gunman perched on a rooftop outside the perimeter of the rally, opened fire on the Republican nominee, and was killed by the Secret Service within seconds. A bullet struck his ear as he stood at the podium.

The gunman was later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, whose motives remain unknown."
"Kamala stays on offense, Trump went to personal attacks, ABC much tougher on former president",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-stays-offense-trump-went-personal-attacks-abc-much-tougher-former-president,2024-09-11T04:15:21Z,"'Special Report' All-Star panelists Howard Kurtz, Byron York and Francesca Chambers examine former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris' path to the presidency.

Kamala Harris and Donald Trump began with their talking points, and she threw the first punches.

Asked at the ABC debate by moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis whether the country was better off than four years ago, the VP said she was ""raised as a middle-class kid,"" wants to raise up those voters, she wants to tackle the housing shortage, and has a ""passion"" for small business. Trump's plan, she said, was to cut taxes for his billionaire friends and big corporations.

DEBATE CHALLENGE: THE PRESSURE'S ON KAMALA AS SHE AND TRUMP TRADE FLIP-FLOP CHARGES

The former president started on the high road, talking about the tariffs he imposed on China.

But he soon resorted to personal attacks. ""Everything she believed four years ago, she's a Marxist.""

And: ""She hates Israel."" If she wins, ""Israel will not exist in two years.""

Trump also said of Joe Biden, without substantiation, ""He hates her. He can't stand her.""

Trump pushed a completely debunked rumor that Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, ""they're eating the dogs, they're eating the pets."" Muir said the city manager confirmed there were no such reports.

Trump looked angrier as the debate wore on, with Harris at one point laughing at him. She pivoted between looking at him and the cameras; he barely glanced at her.

""We did a phenomenal job with the pandemic,"" Trump said, which is, well, debatable.

Harris grew most animated when asked about abortion, and declared that Trump would sign a national abortion ban.

HOW TRUMP, OR KAMALA, COULD WIN, AS ALL SIDES ZERO IN ON THE DEBATE

""You're going to hear a bunch of lies,"" the veep said. Pregnant women were being denied emergency care, a 12-year old survivor of incest was forced to carry the baby to term.

Trump said, as he did to me at Mar-a-Lago, that ""every legal scholar"" wanted the abortion issue returned to the states. That is not true.

Trump said the Democrats are the radicals because they support abortion through the ninth month, and quoted a dumb comment by the former Virginia governor about making a decision after birth, which is illegal.

""This is so rich by someone who has been found liable for sexual assault,"" Harris said, referring to the E. Jean Carroll case and rattling off various indictments.

That's because the administration has ""weaponized"" law enforcement against him, Trump said in an oft-repeated charge. He added, without substantiation, ""They're the ones who made them go after me.""

In another charge without evidence, the ex-president accused Harris of ""paying people"" to attend her rallies.

Referring to the attempted assassination, Trump said, ""I probably took a bullet to the head because of their rhetoric."" Then he said ""Russia Russia Russia"" - the kind of shorthand that may have puzzled casual viewers.

Harris also said things that weren't true. She said she made clear in 2020 that she was not against fracking, but what she actually said was that Biden would not ban fracking. She said he had threatened a ""bloodbath"" if he loses, but he actually said that about the American auto industry.

TRUMP, KAMALA AIMING FOR THE MIDDLE WITH VARYING DEGREES OF SUCCESS

ABC pressed Trump about Jan. 6, asking why he didn't make the video earlier asking protestors to go home. He said what was left out was that in his speech he had asked the demonstrators to be ""peaceful and patriotic.""

Harris countered that Trump had ""incited a violent mob"" in which 150 law enforcement officials were injured, and ""some died.""

ABC did press Harris on her past opposition to fracking and for abolishing private health insurance, but she stuck to varying versions of ""my values haven't changed.""

On another crucial issue, ABC asked twice: ""Do you want Ukraine to win this war?"" Trump would not say yes. ""I want the war to stop,"" he said. ""I think it's in the U.S.'s best interest to get this war done, negotiate a deal.""

Harris responded: ""If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now."" She said she met with Volodomyr Zelenskyy days before the invasion to share U.S. intelligence.

My scorecard:

Kamala Harris did everything she could have reasonably done to brush off Trump's attacks, make her case, and repeatedly attack him while largely maintaining her composure.

Trump turned in a strong performance and landed numerous blows, but Harris increasingly got under his skin rather than the other way around.

ABC tilted against Trump, with a series of tougher questions, more followups, more fact-checking, and more corrections by the network. This vindicated Trump's pregame criticism of ABC as the ""meanest"" network.

Now the partisan spinning gets under way in earnest."
In the Trump-Harris face-off there was a clear winner but don't believe this election is over,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-harris-face-off-there-clear-winner-dont-believe-election-over,2024-09-11T04:09:14Z,"A focus group of voters across the board shared who they believe won the face-off between the 2024 candidates at Tuesday night's debate.

It's pretty clear to me that on Tuesday night, Vice President Kamala Harris won what may be the only debate between herself and former President Donald Trump. The vice president had some help, too. She was aided and abetted by two ABC News moderators who seemingly felt the need to fact-check virtually everything the former president said.

The former president was clearly frustrated and became more strident and divisive as the nearly two-hour debate continued. And the vice president appeared to gain renewed confidence as she saw Trump faltering under relentless questioning from herself and moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis.

Although Harris clearly won the debate in my estimation, it isn't at all clear that this debate, just 56 days before the election, will fundamentally impact the outcome on November 5.

ABC DEBATE MODERATORS SPARK FURY FOR AGGRESSIVE FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP, EASY TREATMENT OF HARRIS

I say that because Trump did speak directly to his base on Tuesday night. His supporters understood, as well as anyone, how much bias ABC News introduced into the process. To be sure, Harris had better answers on abortion, healthcare, climate change and leadership for the future. That much is clear. But what is also clear is that what Trump said in his closing statement remains the case.

Voters remain angry about the direction the country is headed in, about the performance of both President Biden and Vice President Harris, as well as which candidate they trust more on the top two or three issues facing the country: the economy, immigration and law and order.

My best guess is that Harris will get a slight bump from her performance at this face-off, which had Democrats cheering as soon as Trump began turning harsh and hostile within the first 45 minutes of the debate.

HARRIS TELLS TRUMP HE'S 'NOT RUNNING AGAINST JOE BIDEN' DURING DEBATE

Yet, elections rarely turn on a dime as completely as they did after the June 27 debate between Trump and President Biden. And while Trump was a seemingly different man on Tuesday night than he was back in June, the points he made were the same. And many voters, indeed a majority of voters, agree with his core assessment of the current state of our nation.

I also believe that this is likely to be the last debate that the candidates engage in. For Vice President Harris, the calculus is simple: she will claim victory, her supporters will be emboldened, money will continue to flow into her coffers and there will be absolutely no reason for her to reengage in any shape, matter or form with the former president.

The Harris campaign may claim that they want a second debate, but it will almost certainly be under conditions that the former president will never agree to. I doubt that Trump would ever agree to go back to ABC, much less NBC or CBS, and the chance that Harris will appear on Fox News is negligible at best.

TAYLOR SWIFT ENDORSES KAMALA HARRIS FOR PRESIDENT AFTER DEBATE: 'I'VE MADE MY CHOICE'

For the former president, the calculation is very different but reaches the same conclusion: his worst fears were confirmed on Tuesday night. The debate was hardly fair. And absent a debate on Fox News, there's little reason to believe he'll get a fair shake from any other network.

He also knows that in both the 2016 and 2020 presidential contests, the first one a winning effort and the second one a losing effort, he was able to make up ground with voters separate and apart from any direct confrontation with his opponent. Trump, on the campaign trail, has a unique and compelling appeal. We have seen proof of that time and time again. '

He and his advisers will likely conclude that they can do a lot better with voters by eschewing direct confrontation with Harris. They will do that by sending him out on the campaign trail to do both interviews and rallies. That will be far more effective than taking the risks inherent in a night like the one we witnessed on Tuesday.

But, it is important to note that Harris did reaffirm, for her supporters and potentially many swing voters, that she is the real deal. She's ready and able to govern. Still, at the same time, doubts about her as the next president of the United States remain strong and clear. Indeed, the great weakness of Trump's performance on Tuesday night was that he failed to underscore the issue of the economy and the contrast between his economic leadership and that of Joe Biden in a way that was clear and accessible to voters.

Trump's emphasis on the southern border struck me as over the top, even if the points he was making have wide resonance.

Put another way, I am virtually certain many on the left will proclaim the election over based on Harris's strong performance. That will almost certainly be an exaggeration or an overstatement.

Trump will no doubt face a political setback from this week's encounter with the vice president and the two moderators from ABC. But judging by the past, it would be a profound mistake to count him out."
"Trump spars with Harris, moderators during heated presidential debate: 'She doesn't have a plan'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-spars-harris-moderators-during-heated-presidential-debate-doesnt-have-plan,2024-09-11T04:09:07Z,"PHILADELPHIA, PA - Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris faced off in a heated debate Tuesday night, sparring about abortion, immigration, Israel, the economy and a range of other issues -- but Trump also battled the ABC News moderators, who were quick to challenge and ""fact check"" the 45th president, while leaving Harris' numerous distortions untouched.

Trump and Harris engaged in their first, and possibly only debate of the 2024 general election cycle at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pa. Tuesday night -- a highly-anticipated ninety-minute showdown as they traded jabs, and repeatedly, accused each other of lying.

The two met for the first time Tuesday night on the debate stage, with the vice president introducing herself as ""Kamala Harris"" to the former president as they shook hands--before making it a top priority to attempt to get under his skin and bait him throughout the debate.

The debate got underway with questions from ABC News' David Muir and Linsey Davis, who challenged Trump throughout the debate.

TRUMP FLIPS 'I'M TALKING' SCRIPT FROM 2020 DEBATE AGAINST KAMALA HARRIS DURING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE SHOWDOWN

Shortly after it concluded, Trump told Fox News Digital that he thought it was his ""best debate ever, especially because it was three on one.""

Moderators began with the economy -- first questioning the vice president on whether Americans ""are better off than they were four years ago?""

Harris did not directly respond to the question. The Biden-Harris administration has seen rising inflation.

Instead, Harris incorrectly claimed Trump wanted to introduce a ""sales tax"" on everyday goods, but Trump dismissed that claim as an ""incorrect statement.""

Moderators chimed in, suggesting Trump's plan to impose tariffs on other countries would pass on higher costs to consumers.

But Trump countered, pointing to the high inflation of the Biden-Harris administration, calling it the ""worst in our nation's history,"" while touting the record-economy under his administration.

Trump went on to hit Harris on her lack of clear policies, saying her past record and ""everything that she believed three years ago and four years ago is out the window.""

""She's going to my philosophy now,"" he said. ""In fact, I was going to send her a MAGA hat.""

TRUMP, HARRIS TRADE BARBS ON CRIME DURING FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'THROUGH THE ROOF'

Trump accused Harris of being a ""Marxist,"" and said if she is elected, her policies will ""change"" and ""it will be the end of our country.""

Trump accused Harris of not having a plan for the economy -- specifically to combat rising inflation.

""She copied Biden's plan. And it's like four sentences like 'Run, Spot, Run' for sentences that are just, oh, we'll try and lower taxes,"" Trump said. ""She doesn't have a plan.""

Harris fired back, saying Trump ""has no plan for you,"" and instead offered Americans an ""opportunity economy.""

Trump pivoted to the issue of border security and illegal migration into the United States, saying policies of the Biden-Harris administration have been a ""disaster"" for the country with record-high illegal migration.

Trump suggested those policies have ""destroyed our country,"" and said they have policy ""that you say 'they have to hate our country.'""

Next, Harris jumped to the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, claiming that Trump ""intends on implementing"" what she referred to as the ""detailed and dangerous plan.""

Trump has repeatedly denied being involved in that plan, and maintained Tuesday that he has ""nothing to do with Project 2025.""

Trump, though, shifted back to illegal immigration, fueling viral claims that migrants are eating pets in a town in Ohio.

""In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, the people that came in, they're eating the cats, they're eating the pets of the people that live there,"" Trump said, and was met with pushback from moderators, who seemingly attempted to give the former president a live fact-check throughout the debate.

TRUMP FACT CHECKS HARRIS ON CHARLOTTESVILLE RIOT ACCUSATION: 'DEBUNKED'

But Trump stood by his remarks when challenged by the moderators, saying ""people on television say 'my dog was taken and used for food.'""

Meanwhile, as for abortion, Harris claimed Trump would install a national abortion ban that would allow for no exceptions -- despite Trump saying moments before that he believes in exceptions for abortion including rape, incest, and life of the mother.

Trump has repeatedly said he would not sign a national abortion ban and praised the Supreme Court overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, bringing the issue back to the states.

Trump added in his rebuttal that he does not support a national abortion ban and that Harris' comments were an ""absolute lie.""

""As far as the abortion ban, no, I'm not in favor of an abortion ban, but it doesn't matter, because this issue has now been taken over by the states,"" Trump said.

Harris, later, claimed there would be a national abortion ban if Trump is elected, and falsely said there would be a ""monitor that would be monitoring your pregnancies, your miscarriages.""

Harris baited Trump throughout the debate Tuesday night--from claiming people left his massive rallies before they ended; to calling out his legal challenges; mentioning the late-Sen. John McCain; Jan. 6; and more.

As for Jan. 6, Harris accused Trump of inciting ""a violent mob.""

Trump, though, stressed that he urged protesters to demonstrate ""peacefully and patriotically,"" and accused then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser of ignoring his offer for 10,000 National Guard soldiers. Trump said Pelosi ""was responsible"" for Jan. 6.

Biden's disastrous debate performance against Trump instantly fueled questions about his physical and mental abilities to serve another four years in the White House - and spurred a rising chorus of calls from within his own party for the 81-year-old president to end his bid for a second term. Facing increased pressure from fellow Democrats, Biden, in a blockbuster announcement on July 21, ended his re-election campaign and endorsed his vice president.

TRUMP SAYS HE 'PROBABLY TOOK A BULLET TO THE HEAD' DUE TO DEM RHETORIC

The Democratic Party quickly coalesced around Harris, who enjoyed a wave of momentum -including a rise in the polls and skyrocketing fundraising - from late July through August. But Republicans argue that Americans' honeymoon with Harris is waning.

Harris spent five straight days from Thursday through Monday hunkered down in a downtown Pittsburgh hotel, taking part in an intensive ""debate camp,"" which included numerous mock debate sessions. She arrived in Philadelphia on the eve of the debate.

Trump spent much of last weekend at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, taking part in less formal 'policy sessions' with aides and allies. But Trump also traveled to swing state Wisconsin on Saturday to headline a campaign rally.

Trump huddled with advisers at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, before flying to Philadelphia just a couple of hours before the start of the debate.

""Trump is prepared for every style because that's what he's been doing on the campaign trail; has been doing unscripted pressers, pull-asides, interviews,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters on the eve of the debate.

The former president and his allies for weeks have repeatedly criticized Harris for sitting for only one major interview, and holding no news conferences, since taking over for Biden as the Democrats' standard-bearer. And on the eve of the debate, the Trump campaign announced that the former president will hold another news conference Friday in Los Angeles.

With the debate now over, Harris will get right back on the campaign trail, with stops in some of the crucial battlegrounds, starting with two rallies Thursday in North Carolina.

""It is certainly an important moment in the campaign, but it is one moment,"" longtime Democratic strategist and presidential campaign veteran Maria Cardona told Fox News Digital ahead of the debate. ""It was a margin of error race going into the debate, and it will be that afterward.""

Trump also quickly gets back on the trail, with a stop Thursday in swing state Arizona."

Vice President Kamala Harris was dragged on social media for her exaggerated facial expressions during the ABC News Presidential Debate against former President Trump on Tuesday.

Harris' smirk was repeatedly captured on the split screen during Trump's turn to answer questions from the debate moderators. Both Harris' and Trump's microphones were muted when the other candidate was given time to speak, a rule the Harris campaign had tried to change. This left Harris with nothing but her facial gestures to express her contempt for the GOP nominee.

At times, Harris was captured on camera dramatically rolling her eyes, furrowing her brow or squinting at her opponent while he spoke. Other times, she laughed or appeared to mock Trump's responses with exaggerated smiles.

TRUMP SAYS HE 'PROBABLY TOOK A BULLET TO THE HEAD' DUE TO DEM RHETORIC

Her many faces were immediately mocked by social media users, with some saying they represented her nerves and discomfort on stage, while others slammed them as rehearsed and ""pathetic.""

""Kamala Harris' overexaggerated facial expressions during this debate are pathetic. They convey a sense of dishonesty and nervousness,"" Daily Wire senior reporter Ryan Saavedra said.

""So far... HARRIS is making faces way more than TRUMP on this split screen. DK how that's going to resonate with voters,"" Fox News congressional correspondent Aisha Hasnie posted.

""Kamala Harris has been way over coached on doing facial expressions because of the muted mics. It is uncomfortable and weird,"" conservative writer Carmine Sabia weighed in.

Former Michigan gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon quipped, ""My kids make the same facial expressions Kamala Harris is making when they are in trouble.""

ABC News sparked intense backlash among critics for its aggressive approach to former President Trump versus its soft treatment of Vice President Kamala Harris during Tuesday's presidential debate.

The Disney-owned network shocked the nation as its debate moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis repeatedly fact-checked Trump on various topics from crime, abortion to the former president's past comments about the 2020 election.

""The ABC moderators are fact checking- incorrectly!- and in such a shockingly obviously one-sided way, that Trump enduring the ambush as well as he has is a win,"" conservative radio host Buck Sexton reacted.

""ABC/Disney has done its best to help VP Harris. It's astonishing how badly moderated it has been,"" syndicated radio host Hugh Hewitt wrote. ""Trump could have put the election away and didn't. But she is so awful she still couldn't win with both moderators so obviously, terribly biased. Neither of them won but ABC/Disney lost half the country.""

The ABC moderators did earn some praise from other members of the liberal media.

""ABC moderators doing an *excellent* job,"" MSNBC host Chris Hayes reacted.

""I will say it ABC moderators have exceeded expectations. They are fact checking and confronting. Shows how abysmal CNN was,"" Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin wrote.

""Muir has a talent for delivering confrontational ripostes in a way that seems like Bob Ross talking about adding a little magenta to a sunset,"" New York Times correspondent Glenn Thrush said.

Meanwhile, Trump took a lot of flack for constantly ""taking the bait"" from Harris as well as the debate moderators.

""Ever since the crowd size comment, Kamala's been in his head. Trump's taking the bait and getting riled up. It's that easy,"" Puck News correspondent Tara Palmeri said.

""Harris keeps dangling bait for Trump and he keeps burning the first 20 seconds of the response on it,"" Semafor reporter David Weigel wrote.

""Donald Trump is taking every piece of bait - doing what a lot of the commentary was concerned VP Harris was going to do,"" MSNBC host Symone Sanders-Townsend similarly said.

ABC's Linsey Davis raises eyebrows with abortion fact-check against Trump: 'Completely interjects herself',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/abcs-linsey-davis-raises-eyebrows-abortion-fact-check-against-trump,2024-09-11T02:50:08Z,"ABC News moderator Linsey Davis fact-checks former President Trump during the presidential debate.

ABC Presidential Debate co-moderator Linsey Davis raised eyebrows on Tuesday when she fact-checked former President Trump on abortion.

Trump was asked about his stance on abortion, as ABC's Davis pointed out that the former president has boasted about killing Roe v. Wade and has called himself ""the most pro-life President in American history"" but has since declared he would be great for women's reproductive rights. Trump also recently said Florida's six-week abortion ban ""is too short,"" but said he would vote against a ballot initiative that would overturn the six-week ban on abortions in the state.

""The reason why I'm doing that vote is because... they have abortion in the ninth month. They even have, and you can look at the governor of West Virginia [Viriginia], the previous governor... not the current governor, whose doing an excellent job, but the governor before, he said, 'The baby will be born, and we will decide what to do with the baby,' in other words we'll execute the baby. And that's why I did that,"" Trump said.

KAMALA HARRIS, DONALD TRUMP FACE OFF IN BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA FOR FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

""They're radical. The Democrats are radical,"" Trump continued.

Once Trump was finished, Davis then sharply cut in to correct the record.

""There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born,"" Davis said.

Trump was presumably referring to former Virginia Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, who famously made headlines with comments on third-trimester abortions if severe deformities occur or a fetus is deemed non-viable.

""If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother,"" Northam said during a radio interview.

Davis' fact-check surprised many on social media.

Fox News host and Trurmp's former press secretary Kayleight McEnany said ABC should be ""ashamed"" of themselves and that the moderators were only prepared to fact-check Trump.

McEnany added, ""Kamala just invoked the Charlottesville 'both sides' hoax that has been fact checked as false by left-wing Snopes and the ""bloodbath"" hoax. Why is Trump having to debunk this and not the moderators?? The ABC moderators only fact check Trump.""

""Linsey Davis completely interjects herself into the debate to help Kamala. No surprise at all there. But I thought Trump nailed his abortion answer. This is Kamala's only issue,"" OutKick founder Clay Travis wrote.

Conservative pundit Stephen L. Miller repeatedly responded, ""Why didn't Lindsey Davis fact check this?,"" when people shared falsehoods told by Harris.

""Now, in over 20 states there are Trump abortion bans, which make it criminal for a doctor or nurse to provide health care in one state, it provides prison for life. Trump abortion bans that make no exception, even for rape and incest, which understand what that means.

""Understand, if Donald Trump were to be re-elected, he will sign the national abortion ban,"" Harris added.

The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, with Trump praising the decision. He is now campaigning that abortion laws and issues be left up to individual states following the Dobbs decision.

Earlier this year, Trump did spark the condemnation of some pro-life conservatives for the GOP's more muted language on abortion this election cycle, and for saying last month that Florida's six-week abortion ban ""is too short."" He has since said that he will vote against a Florida amendment that would legalize abortion through the 9th month of pregnancy, and has doubled down that abortion laws and issues should be left up to the states to decide."

Arizona voters will vote on the state's Right to Abortion Initiative, which would codify abortion rights in the state's constitution. An immigration and border law enforcement measure -- which would make unlawfully crossing the Arizona border from Mexico a state crime, letting state police arrest and detain migrants and allowing state judges to deport them -- will also be on the ballot. Harris and Democrats are banking on the abortion ballot measure to prove successful -- as similar initiatives have in seven other states where they've been up for a vote -- while Trump hopes for the same for the border enforcement measure. Immigration is a leading concern in Arizona, the Associated Press reported, noting frustration over illegal immigration persists in the state following a surge in migrant crossings.

2.5 points. That is Harris' national polls lead in FiveThirtyEight's polling average. The vice president also commands a 1.8-point lead in Real Clear Politics' polling average and leads by three points in Nate Silver's Silver Bulletin.

Trump, who won Arizona in 2016, lost the battleground state by just 10,457 votes in 2020 to Biden. Despite the loss, Trump claimed victory in Arizona and later alleged the entire voter database of Maricopa County, the state's most populous county, was deleted. Republican officials overseeing the election refuted Trump's claim, with Maricopa County recorder Stephen Richer characterizing Trump's statement as ""unhinged."" Trump also attempted to press former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) to overturn the election, telling the governor in a phone call if enough fraudulent votes were identified, it would flip the results in his favor, The Washington Post reported.

Trump is battling with Harris in six other swing states in addition to Arizona. They all remain tightly contested.

A number of the biggest names in Hollywood came out in support of Biden before he dropped out of the race, before turning their support to Harris. Olivia Rodrigo, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris by sharing a video of a speech the vice president gave promising to ""stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans."" Major Democratic fundraiser George Clooney, who used a New York Times essay to call for Biden to drop out of the race, lent his support to Harris and Barbra Streisand said she would support Harris because of her vow to fight for reproductive rights. Musician John Legend, who performed at the Democratic National Convention in 2024, posted he was ""so ready"" for a Harris presidency. Director Spike Lee, ""West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin and director Ken Burns hrew their support behind Harris, along with actresses Rosie O'Donnell and Jamie Lee Curtis. Robert De Niro, who narrated an advertisement for the Biden campaign, praised the president's ""selfless patriotism"" in a statement that did not mention Harris but said ""there is nothing more important for our country than defeating Donald Trump at the ballot box."" British pop artist Charli XCX brought Harris into the Gen Z fold by tweeting ""kamala IS brat,"" an endorsement that was met by Harris' team changing the background photo on her X account to the ""brat"" green color and using the same font used on Charli XCX's album of the same name. Rapper Cardi B, who in May said she wouldn't be endorsing Biden, tweeted ""AHAHAHAHA LETS GOOOOO I TOLD YALLL KAMALA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 2024 candidate...."" Pop musician Kesha said she plans to support Harris in November and, when asked how she felt about Vance, responded ""f -- - that man."" Beyonc√© has not made a public endorsement but did give the Harris campaign permission to use her song ""Freedom"" in a video of her first official visit to her campaign's headquarters, a rare approval from the superstar musician. Beyonc√©'s mom and businesswoman Tina Knowles endorsed Harris with an Instagram post. Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle and former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have also thrown their support behind Harris. Former President Jimmy Carter, 99, reportedly told his son last week he was trying to make it to his 100th birthday so he could cast his vote for Kamala Harris. ""Sex in the City"" actress and former New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon threw her support behind Harris and her Vice Presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, in a post that read: ""I'm Walzing on air!"" Billionaire Mark Cuban, who previously said he was committed to voting for Biden, has also supported Harris and endorsed Walz as her running mate, calling him someone who ""can sit at the kitchen table and make you feel like you have know him forever."" Actor Tony Goldwyn, Republican political commentator Ana Navarro, comedian Mindy Kaling and actress Kerry Washington each supported the Harris-Walz campaign by hosting one evening of the Democratic National Convention. Nick Offerman, Jane Fonda, Ben Stiller, Kathy Griffin, John Stamos, Ed Helms, Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz were among those who appeared on a ""Comics for Harris"" virtual rally via Zoom, which reportedly raised close to half a million dollars for the Harris campaign. Over Labor Day weekend, a fundraiser for the Democratic ticket in Southampton, New York was hosted by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and fashion designer Tory Burch, among others. Actors Matt Damon and Lin-Manuel Miranda will attend fundraiser in New York City in September -- for which tickets are listed at $25,000 per person -- to support the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket, Bloomberg reported. Actress Aubrey Plaza posted a photo of herself on Instagram holding Grumpy Cat -- the face of a famous meme -- with the caption ""HARRIS üá∫üá∏ WALZ. Mel Brooks said he was ""all in"" for the Harris and Walz ticket in a post to social media holding his dog, adding ""I don't have a cat, so a dog will have to do!"" Stevie Nicks did not name a particular candidate when she encouraged her followers to vote in an Instagram post this week, but signed her message ""Childless Dog Lady."" Billionaire pop star Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris in an Instagram post minutes after a debate between Harris and Donald Trump wrapped up, with a photo of her holding her cat that has since been recreated by several other celebrities. After declining to endorse a candidate in 2020, Martha Stewart said at the Retail Influencer CEO Forum she will supporting Kamala Harris in the election because she wants a president ""who doesn't hate New York"" and ""doesn't hate democracy,"" the Daily Beast reported. Pop star Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas, a songwriter and producer, made a video about National Voter Registration Day and Billie said they would both be voting for Harris and Walz ""because they are fighting to protect our reproductive freedom, our planet and our democracy."" Famous television scientist Bill Nye, in a video posted to the Kamala HQ TikTok account, called Trump a ""climate change denier"" and encouraged viewers to ""vote with the climate in mind."" Nye participated ""Geeks & Nerds for Harris"" fundraiser on Sept. 28 hosted by ""Wonder Woman"" star Lynda Carter that will also feature ""Star Trek"" actors LeVar Burton and Anthony Rapp, actor Misha Collins of ""Supernatural,"" Star Wars actor Mark Hamill and others.

Former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan ripped off his shirt while on stage at the Republican National Convention last month to reveal a Trump-Vance campaign shirt underneath, and called Trump his ""hero"" and the ""greatest president of the United States."" Musician Kid Rock has been vocal about his support of Trump in the past and at the RNC revamped his song ""American Bad Ass"" to include references to Trump. UFC President and personality Dana White called Trump the ""toughest, most resilient human being."" Rapper and reality TV star Amber Rose gave a speech at the RNC in support of Trump. Country music stars Chris Janson and Jason Aldean also appeared at the convention. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy in January said voting for Trump over Biden was a ""no-brainer."" Public-facing billionaires like Elon Musk and Steve Wynn have also supported the former president. Actress Rosanne Barr, a longtime conservative supporter of Trump, clapped back at Cuban's endorsement of the Harris-Walz ticket and called the VP pick ""another reason Harris is a disaster."" Rapper Azealia Banks last year said she would vote for Donald Trump in Novemebr and she appeared at a rally in Florida this summer. Actor Jon Voight has defended Trump on multiple occasions. 50 Cent's 2023 song ""Many Men (Wish Death)"" started trending online after the assassination attempt of Trump last month. The rapper responded by putting Trump's face on the cover of his ""Get Rich or Die Tryin.'"" While it's hard to call the response an official endorsement, he did appear to support the president in 2020 before apparently backtracking. Other celebrities who have supported Trump in the past, but not outright endorsed him yet this election season, include Lil Wayne and ""Happy Days"" star Scott Baio. Trump thanked Brittany Mahomes, wife of NFL superstar Patrick Mahomes, for her ""defending him"" after she lashed out at social media users who criticized her for liking several pro-Trump posts last month (Mahomes has not formally endorsed a candidate). At a rally in Las Vegas, Trump thanked reggaeton star Nicky Jam for his endorsement, but apparently thought he was a she -- saying: ""Do you know Nicky? She's hot. Where's Nicky?"" -- before correcting himself after Jam climbed to the stage, saying, ""Oh, look, I'm glad he came up.""

Notable names missing from the list of public supporters include billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who called the decision ""too important to rush."""

reast Cancer Awareness Month has been in full swing for ten days now -- but for as much pink as you might be seeing in the world, do you know how this campaign got its start? I'll admit, I did not, but I've since learned that the first ever breast cancer awareness campaign happened in 1985, when the American Cancer Society and a pharmaceutical arm of a company that is now part of AstraZeneca first teamed up to promote mammograms as a detection tool.

While the month can bring its fair share of pink washing and potential triggers for people who have been diagnosed with the disease and aren't looking for additional reminders of how their lives have changed, the executives of the National Breast Cancer Foundation want people to know that early detection does save lives. NBCF president and COO Kevin Hail and director of communications Ashley Miller made this point when they joined me at Nasdaq MarketSite for an interview earlier this week.

""There's been a 60% decrease in the mortality rate, which I think indicates we've done a good job on early screenings,"" Hail says. ""If you detect it early, you dramatically increase your chances of survival.""

We also talked about the importance of knowing your family history -- and this is a theme that came up in more than one of my interviews this week. I also interviewed Joseph Grzymski, the Chief Genomics Officer for Renown Health; he and his team spearheaded research that shows there is a significant number of people who are not aware that they carry genetic risk factors for breast and ovarian cancer. In his study, which was recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), 80% of respondents had not been aware that they could be eligible for genetic screening for these diseases based on their family history.

Grzymski reached this conclusion after using a seven-question survey to assess patients' family histories, and his goal is to get more doctors and health systems to use this survey. ""When 8 out of 10 individuals do not know their risks and doctors do not see them as high-risk individuals... it's really important to change the narrative on the importance of screening,"" he said.

The United States has few rules governing egg and sperm donation, a Wild West being supercharged by influencers touting it as a cash-cow to millions of young followers. Americans conceived through donors are using social media to fight back. ""This is not an industry that creates tables, creates shirts; they're literally making babies,"" says Laura High, one of the most-followed donor-conceived creators on TikTok. ""They should be held to the highest standard. And the fact that we don't have the equivalent of a seat belt should terrify everybody.""

The National Hockey League took a historic step toward gender equity this week as Jessica Campbell became the first woman to coach in an NHL regular season game. Campbell, an assistant coach for the Seattle Kraken, made her debut behind the bench in the Kraken's season opener Tuesday night.

Kate Ryder founded Maven Clinic in 2015 to address gaps in women's health. Fresh off a $125 million Series F fundraise, Ryder joined me to talk about how she'll use the fresh funds and why today -- with Roe v. Wade repealed and 35% of U.S. counties lacking an ob-gyn -- the need for her company is even greater.

Abortions after six weeks of pregnancy were banned in Georgia as of Monday evening, as the Georgia Supreme Court halted a ruling that struck down the state's six-week abortion ban, once again putting the Southern state among more than a dozen states that now restrict abortion. I spoke with Michele Goodwin, professor of Constitutional law and global health at Georgetown University whose writing was cited in the ruling that briefly struck down the ban, about how this about-face happened and why more courts should consider the 13th and 14th amendments when hearing cases involving abortion bans.

Taylor Swift leapfrogged singer and beauty mogul Rihanna to become the world's richest female musician following the blockbuster success of her Eras Tour, as other female artists, including Madonna and Beyonc√©, rank just outside the billion-dollar club.

The effects of the 2016 election on women's political engagement and power are lasting: According to an analysis from ForbesWomen contributor and director of research for the Center for American Women and Politics Kelly Dittmar, of the 15 women best poised to pick up U.S. House seats in November 2024, eight entered state legislative office in 2016 and five became state legislators in 2018 alone.

1. Protect your time and focus. Successful people know exactly what they want to achieve. They are laser-focused on their goals. This clarity makes it easier to say no to things that don't align with those goals. For example, podcaster Tim Ferriss, podcaster uses a ""not-to-do list"" to avoid time-wasters and maintain focus on what's truly important. Read this piece to learn more about saying no and setting boundaries.

2. Handle the ghost in the office. This isn't a pre-Halloween thing; this is real-life advice on what to do when a coworker -- or worse, your boss -- goes silent.

3. Put more women in CEO ""feeder"" roles. A new analysis reveals that few women hold the C-suite roles that typically lead to the top spot, suggesting that the number of female CEOs in corporate America may remain frustratingly low for the foreseeable future. This imbalance doesn't just reflect a lack of representation at the top but also underscores deeper, systemic issues in how female leaders are developed and supported throughout their careers."
Michigan 2024 Trump-Harris Polls: Harris Leads In Latest Survey,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/11/michigan-2024-trump-harris-polls-harris-leads-in-latest-survey/,2024-10-11T17:10:22Z,"A new survey shows Vice President Kamala Harris leads former President Donald Trump by two points in Michigan, a departure from other surveys this week showing both Trump leading with three points and Trump tied with Harris, as the race remains razor-thin in the three ""blue wall"" states that could solidify a win for either candidate in November.

Michigan households with a union member have been more likely to vote for a Democratic presidential candidate than union households nationwide in the last three presidential elections, Reuters reported, citing the polling firm Edison Research. The United Auto Workers' endorsement of Harris was considered a boon to her candidacy in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. However, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and International Association of Fire Fighters' decisions not to endorse anyone, after backing Biden in 2020 and historically supporting Democrats, were widely seen as blows to Harris.

Michigan has a sizeable Arab-American population, many of whom have been angered by the Biden-Harris administration's continued support for Israel in its war in Gaza. Recent polling for the Arab American Institute by John Zogby Strategies appears to show the Biden administration's handling of the crisis has severely dented his support among the demographic, with those who identify as Republicans and those who identify as Democrats split at 38%, compared to 40% who identified as Democrats and 32% who identified as Republicans in 2020. The pro-Palestinian group ""Uncommitted"" -- which encouraged primary voters not to back Biden in Michigan and other key states -- has not endorsed Harris, though it said this week it views Trump as worse than Harris.

2.6 points. That's Harris' lead in national polls, according to FiveThirtyEight's polling average. She leads by two points in Real Clear Politics' polling average and by 3.2 points in Nate Silver's Silver Bulletin.

Democrats control all three branches of state government in Michigan for the first time since the 1980s.

Trump had been leading Biden in Michigan in polls by a slim margin prior to Biden dropping out of the race. The state's popular Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, co-chair of both Biden's and Harris' campaigns, is seen as a key asset in helping Harris repeat Whitmer's own success in the state, where she has won two elections by double-digits, increasing her margins in the 2022 election while campaigning on abortion rights in the wake of Roe v. Wade's reversal. Abortion, while still a high-ranking priority for voters, has lost some of its weight in electoral politics since 2022, however, as other issues, including ongoing inflation and the Israel-Hamas war, are also driving voting decisions.

Harris leads Trump in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Nevada, while Trump is up in Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona, according to FiveThirtyEight's swing state polling averages.

A win for Harris across the ""blue wall"" is contingent on her winning Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District and its single electoral vote. The district is an outlier in the state as it typically votes for a Democrat for president. Nebraska is just one of two states that uses a piecemeal approach to allocating electoral votes instead of a winner-takes-all approach. A final-hour GOP-backed effort to change the rule recently failed to gain the traction needed to succeed in the state legislature.

Why Political Rhetorical Says More About Us Than It Does Politics,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcuscollins/2024/10/10/why-political-rhetorical-says-more-about-us-than-it-does-politics/,2024-10-10T13:24:50Z,"If eyes are the window to the soul, as they say, then words are bridges to the mind. They allow us to externalize the inner workings of our affects and beliefs, giving shape to abstract ideas and divulging the biases that help us make meaning of the world. And if that be the case, then perhaps we should spend more time analyzing the words people use in their rhetoric to better understand the connections they make about the world and how they navigate through it.

In a recent interview on the conservative Hugh Hewitt Show, Former President Donald Trump erroneously asserted that thirteen thousand people who had crossed the southern border under the Biden administration were murderers. Trump's causal theory: genetics. In Trump's words, ""You know, now, a murderer, I believe this, it's in their genes. And we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now.""

The inflammatory language used by the former president harkens back to the theories of eugenics -- a widely discredited pseudoscience that promoted the notion of genetic superiority in a population -- and exposes the connecting bridges by which Trump makes meaning of the world. If certain groups of people from particular parts of the world are genetically predisposed to commit murder, in Trump's calculus, then the subjugation and marginalization of these people would, therefore, be seemingly justified.

From comments that misattribute Vice President Kamala Harris' racial identity to his previous description of Haiti and African nation as ""s*hithole countries,"" Trump's rhetoric not only reveals the meaning frames by which he translates the world but they also connect him to the people who see the world similarly. This is the power of language. It acts as a doorway into culture that helps us identify the people ""like us,"" which is critical for practitioners and citizens a like.

Culture writer and linguist Amanda Montell speaks about language as the way we get people on the same ideological page and make them feel that they belong to the group. Knowing the hidden meanings within a coded language is to evidence a level of intimacy within a community, a way of proving you're one of us. The use and understanding of the lexicon signal membership and intimacy and provide a currency that community members can exchange as an act of social cohesion. And the influence of this cohesion informs how we vote, what we buy, and just about every aspect of social living.

Marieke de Mooij, communications scholar and retired professor of international advertising at the University of Navarre, asserts that culture influences our social needs, which, in turn, are satisfied by the use and ownership of innovative products. That is to say, consumption is a byproduct of culture, and language is a signal of cultural subscription because it reveals our ideological schemas. Out of the mouth speaks the abundance of the heart, as the scripture attests. Therefore, to understand language is to understand humanity.

Much like apes physically groom the hairs of other apes to foster community, we use the exchange of language to promote social bonding through the act of mimicry. When conversing with others, we coordinate breaking patterns and use the exact words and similar grammatical structures. These are all means of community building, and the lexicon plays a significant role in this performative act throughout society.

A biblical story recounts a time when the world had one language and one common way of speaking. The people settled on a plot of land and decided to build a tower so high that it reached the heavens to prepare for the possibility of another flood.

According to the story, God saw this as blasphemy, where people would forgo faith for a human-made structure. And He said, ""Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.""

Language enables cooperation among individuals. So God confused their language, giving them different tongues so that they could not understand each other and, therefore, could not finish the tower. The Bible refers to this place as Babel, which today means confused noise, like a baby's speech. Regardless of your religious leanings, the story of the Tower of Babel, as it is commonly known, illustrates the role that the lexicon of a community plays in how it enables cooperation among its members.

Considering the nature of language as a cultural practice, I partnered with the consumer insights company Suzy to get a sense of the kind of language that Democrats and Republicans use about hotbed social topics, like guns and the border, to get a sense of how these groups see the world and what unites them.

Using a natural language database to score sentiment on a scale of -1 to 1, we conducted a sentiment survey among Americans across age and gender. The sample was split across self-identified Democrats and Republicans to compare and contrast how these different groups use language to construct meaning in hopes of better understanding ""us."" The results said much about the foundational beliefs that serve as antecedents to their voting proclivities.

When probed on guns in America, the Republican respondents provided strong positive statements about the Second Amendment. Language like ""right to bear arms"" was a reoccurring phrase that gives us some ideological understanding of how they frame the world so that we might better understand their policy preferences. The Republican verbatims also demonstrated negative sentiment on the topic of mental health and neutrality when it comes to background checks and gun violence -- diminishing any potential degradation to the integrity of the Second Amendment in their estimation.

When it comes to the topic of abortion, sentiment also runs strong, with Democrats demonstrating positive language toward personal choices and the right to choose. However, Republican respondents tended to exhibit less positive sentiment in their rhetoric, evoking more neutrality around the topics of birth control, rape, and incest.

Surprisingly, the topic of parenting produced positive sentiments for both parties. Democrats tended to have the most positive sentiment around the regulation of social media and the most negative sentiment around the impact on mental health, a point of view they share with Republican respondents. Similarly, both parties shared negative sentiment among with regard to the topic of illegal immigrants and polarizing sentiment around the way the border is covered in the news.

These finding uncovered a powerful truth that is perhaps counterintuitive to reports in the current zeitgeist. The prevailing assumption is that the country is more divided than ever. But if the analysis of our language is any indication, that may not be the case at all. Understanding these kinds of nuances can make the difference in a marketer's ability to connect with consumers and scale their business, because it centers on understanding people.

Sure, there are plenty of things on which we disagree, as well as factions of the population who hold radical and harmful beliefs. But radicals aside, disagreement isn't necessarily a bad thing -- it leads to more permutations of reality, which helps foster more discourse that leads to better solutions and, perhaps more importantly, better understanding.

However, there is a stipulation. As James Baldwin once said, ""We can disagree and still love each other unless your disagreement is rooted in my oppression and denial of my humanity and right to exist."" And this distinction can be identified by the words we choose to outwardly express what's rooted deeply inside of us -- so choose your words wisely."

The state's popular Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, co-chair of both Biden's and Harris' campaigns, is seen as a key asset in helping Harris repeat Whitmer's own success in the state, where she has won two elections by double-digits, increasing her margins in the 2022 election while campaigning on abortion rights in the wake of Roe v. Wade's reversal. Abortion, while still a high-ranking priority for voters, has lost some of its weight in electoral politics since 2022, however, as other issues, including ongoing inflation and the Israel-Hamas war, are also driving voting decisions.

Harris leads Trump in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Nevada, while Trump is up in Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona, according to FiveThirtyEight's swing state polling averages.

A win for Harris across the ""blue wall"" is contingent on her winning Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District and its single electoral vote. The district is an outlier in the state as it typically votes for a Democrat for president. Nebraska is just one of two states that uses a piecemeal approach to allocating electoral votes instead of a winner-takes-all approach. A final-hour GOP-backed effort to change the rule recently failed to gain the traction needed to succeed in the state legislature.

Why Business Leaders Need To Stand Up To Protect U.S. Democracy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelposner/2024/10/09/why-business-leaders-need-to-stand-up-to-protect-us-democracy/,2024-10-09T14:25:38Z,"In today's hyper-partisan political environment, U.S. business leaders are struggling to decide if and when to speak out on issues of the day. Our society is deeply divided on abortion, guns, immigration, LGBTQ+ rights, the Middle East conflict, and views on diversity and inclusion. Corporate CEOs are loathe to challenge politicians and a public ready to punish companies in retribution for their public statements. On the other hand, these leaders face increasing pressure to speak out -- from their employees, customers, and the communities where they operate. Top executives have their own values and beliefs, of course, and these, too, may feed a desire to join the political fray. While it is understandable that most corporate leaders have declined to engage publicly on these topics, there is one issue on which I believe they need to take a stand. It is the sanctity of our elections and defense of our democratic system.

U.S.-based businesses have been the beneficiaries of democratic society where, in broad terms, the rule of law is respected, courts resolve disputes fairly, and there is trust in the legitimacy of elected officials. When this democratic edifice breaks down, businesses suffer. This is not about who gets elected but rather whether the system that elects them is fair, accessible, and inclusive. It's about whether our electoral choices are based on real facts rather than concocted ones. And it is about whether there is an orderly transition of power once the results of an election become clear. As these basic tenets of democracy are coming under attack, business leaders need to speak out. And yet to date, few have been willing to do so.

There are three types of threats to our elections and democratic order that deserve special attention. The first is voter suppression laws, usually aimed at limiting the participation of poor and minority voters. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, ""The restrictive laws passed in the last 10 years target every aspect of voting, including making voter registration more difficult, curtailing early voting opportunities, closing polling places, and limiting voter assistance. ""

In 2020, Michael Gerson, the late Washington Post columnist and speechwriter for President George W. Bush, critiqued his party, when he wrote, ""the GOP seems to expend more energy and creativity on discouraging minority voting than it does on doing minority outreach."" That same year several prominent business leaders including Kenneth Chenault, the former CEO of American Express; Kenneth Frasier, the former CEO of Merck; and Michael Dell, whose computer company bears his name, forcefully challenged the latest generation of voter-suppression laws in places like Georgia and Texas. But too few business executives followed their lead. While these laws cannot be repealed or amended before next month's election, looking to the future, more corporate leaders need to join efforts to restore voting rights in the more than 29 states where restrictive laws are now on the books.

A second challenge relates to the spread of online disinformation before, during, and after elections. The major social media companies have a special responsibility for addressing this growing problem. In the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, mindful of Russian interference in 2016, Facebook took a number of constructive steps to counter political disinformation on its platform. It took down Russian-government-sponsored sites, banned new political ads in the week before the election, strengthened responses to posts aimed at dissuading voter turnout, and countered disinformation in the uncertain weeks after the election. These measures reflected Facebook's recognition of the enormity of its influence. As its founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, rightly observed, ""This election is not going to be business as usual."" Therefore, he asserted, ""We all have a responsibility to protect our democracy.""

Four years later, Zuckerberg is singing a different tune, expressing a desire to stay politically ""neutral."" Pursuing this new laissez-faire approach, Meta has removed transparency tools making it harder for journalists and others to track disinformation on its sites. The company also has disbanded its election integrity team and laid off or shifted scores of those who worked in that unit to other roles. The company also has scrapped its plans to set up a ""war room,"" around the upcoming election, an internal mechanism the company has utilized in the past.

A report my colleagues at the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights published earlier this year concluded, ""The social media industry has retreated from safeguarding elections from the manipulation, hatred, and conspiracy-mongering that all too often now characterize online political discourse.""

Zuckerberg and some of his counterparts elsewhere in Silicon Valley argue that they are obligated to allow deliberately and provably false information from populating their sites in the name of free speech. But their companies are not bound by the First Amendment, a protection against government censorship that does not prevent private organizations or companies from deciding what speech to host. As disinformation tied to our elections floods social media sites, these companies need to do much more to moderate this kind of harmful content.

A third challenge relates to new state laws that could delay and disrupt the vote counting and election certification processes. According to the Brennan Center ""Since the 2020 election, a growing number of rogue local officials have refused or threatened to refuse to certify valid election results. In each of these instances, state courts and officials intervened to protect the certification process. But the danger remains that rogue officials may attempt to interfere with the timely certification of this year's presidential election results.""

The adoption of so many new certification laws since 2020 appears to be an attempt by Republicans to lay the groundwork for endless and frivolous court challenges similar to the dozens that were ultimately turned away by judges in the last election cycle. Menacing comments by local GOP election officials only add fuel to the fire. In the days and weeks after the election, if local officials seek to interfere with an orderly transition of power, it will be more important than ever for business leaders to speak out. In this period when our democratic institutions are being sorely tested, the public embrace of democracy by leaders of the business community becomes more important than ever."
Trump's Economic Policies Will Hurt Working Women,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardmcgahey/2024/10/09/trumps-economic-policies-will-hurt-working-women/,2024-10-09T10:32:19Z,"Although Donald Trump says he'd act as women's ""protector"" his economic policies -- especially towards working women -- would make things worse for them. Whether on equal pay and anti-discrimination, raising wages, providing affordable child care, supporting unions, or guaranteeing reproductive rights, the policies advocated by Trump and his allies would set women back economically.

The current Republican hostility to working women is well documented. In 2021, Trump's running mate JD Vance said professional women ""choose a path to misery"" when emphasizing their careers, and those women go on to ""project that misery...on the rest of society.""

According to Ms. Magazine, Project 2025, a hyper-conservative policy blueprint for the new Trump administration, calls for reversing executive orders on sex discrimination in the workplace. This would include reversing standards in place since the 1960s prohibiting sex discrimination by federal contractors and also restricting the Civil Rights Act from fighting sex discrimination by employers.

Trump's policies also would make it harder to pursue equal pay for women. We know women earn less than men across the board. In 2023, the Institute for Women's Policy Research reported that women earned ""82.7 cents on the dollar compared to men.""

But in Trump's first term, he ordered the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to not collect pay and hours data linked to sex, race, and ethnicity. The Economic Policy Institute said this would make it ""harder for employers and federal agencies to identify pay disparities and root out employment discrimination."" The decision was initially reversed by the courts, but the Trump Administration still later stopped collecting the data.

Broader anti-worker policies also will disproportionately hurt women. Trump and the Republicans oppose increasing the federal minimum wage, currently $7.25 per hour and unchanged since 2009. Its real value has fallen -- economist Sylvia Allegretto at the Center for Economic Policy Research says its current real value is at a ""68-year low.""

If adjusted for inflation, it would now be over $10.50 per hour. And if the minimum wage had kept up both with workers' productivity and inflation, Allegretto says it ""would be over $26.00 today.""

That lack of earning power matters to all workers, but especially to women. The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in 2023, women were 68.9% of all minimum wage workers, more than two-thirds of the total. And those pay gaps with men then persist all the way up the job ladder.

What about affordable high-quality child care, essential for working families, but especially for mothers? Economics columnist Catherine Rampell of the Washington Post reports a new study ""shows spending on child care as one the most effective, pro-work policies ever evaluated in the United States.""

The Yale and Brown university economists who studied universal pre-kindergarten programs found it helped kids, but also parents (especially women), raising their earnings ""for at least six years after the end of pre-kindergarten."" And it is enormously cost-effective. The researchers found ""each dollar of net government expenditure yields $5.51 in after-tax benefits for families, almost entirely from parents' earning gains."" As Rampell points out, ""this kind of payoff is almost unheard of in government labor-market policies.""

During the Vice-Presidential debate, JD Vance claimed there could be a ""bipartisan solution"" to child care. But Senate Republicans consistently voted against expanding child care under President Biden. And Senate Republicans recently blocked expansion of the existing child care tax credit, with Vance not attending to cast a vote.

Republican hostility to unionization also is bad for working women. Steven Greenhouse writes in The Guardian that Project 2025 outlines a wholesale attack on unions, including major limits on the right to organize. According to the National Women's Law Center, ""women who are union members experience more economic security for themselves and their families than nonunion members."" Pay and promotions can be fairer and more equal with unions, and unions' bargaining ability helps equalize power with employers.

Finally, the hostility of Trump and Republicans to reproductive rights and abortion hurts women economically. In 2021, 154 economists and researchers filed a brief with the Supreme Court during the Dobbs case that overturned Roe v. Wade, summarizing a ""substantial body of well-developed and credible research."" That research shows access to abortion ""has -- and continues to have -- a significant effect on...women's educational attainment and job opportunities.""

By empowering women to manage their fertility and decide when and if having children is best for them, abortion and reproductive rights give them more power over their work and career choices. As the dissenting justices in Dobbs (all women) noted, ""pregnancies continue to have enormous physical, social, and economic consequences"" even though Justice Alito's majority opinion dismissed such concerns.

And even with the overturning of Roe, Trump's campaign continues fighting against women's reproductive health. Vance recently said Trump would eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, which provides not only abortion and reproductive care, but other health services such as cancer and mental health screening, disproportionately for low-income women.

So Trump would go backwards on economic fronts that are vital to women -- employment discrimination, minimum wages and wage equality, unionization, child care, and abortion and reproductive rights. We'll see if his claims to be women's ""protector"" can outweigh his negative economic policies for women."
What Working Millennials Of Color Are Feeling About Project 2025,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasminebrowley/2024/10/08/what-working-millennials-of-color-are-feeling-about-project-2025/,2024-10-08T20:16:05Z,"Project 2025, a manifesto created by the conservative organization The Heritage Project and a playbook of likely actions to be taken within the first 180 days in office if Donald Trump is elected (despite his protestations about the plan). Although the sweeping proposal touches on everything from critical race theory to abortion bans, one of the most immediately concerning parts of the plan is how will affect the future of work for millennials workers of color.

Some of the agenda focuses on proposed changes to workplace policies that could adversely affect workers' pay, security, and right to organize against grievances.

For instance, Project 2025 outlines a concerted slashing to overtime pay for workers' leaving with smaller take home pay. Data shows millennials are still the hardest working generation in comparison to Gen X and Gen z, the two age group millennials are sandwiched between.

The plan also proposed that eliminating the Biden administration-led rule that raised the salary threshold to $58,656 and expanded the protection to 4.3 million more workers. Project 2025 reads like it is aiming to help business owners and investors save money over time by skimping on employee protections, but the plan could make way for larger financial disasters.

Project 2025 includes details that rolls back post-crisis policies that protect consumers, investors, and the stability of financial markets by limiting regulators' ability to step in during periods of volatility. This includes putting a stranglehold on the Federal Reserve's ""lender-of-last-resort"" function in which failing banks are able to borrow emergency funds to stay solvent.

An example of this can be seen in the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) crisis in which the Federal Reserve and other regulators stepped in to ensure the bank's customers would have access to their funds by the next day - beyond just the $250,000 guaranteed by the FDIC. The bank's potential collapse could've devastated a number of Black businesses and employees since Silicon Valley Bank has been one of the most pivotal in aiming to help narrow the funding chasm for Black founders, as ESSENCE points out.

""We all know that young Black founders get a fraction of the business loans and venture capital their non-Black counterparts get,"" Shila Nieves Burney of Zane VC says.

Zane VC, a firm that boasts an investment catalog of young startups aims to address the health equity gap, in the most effective way it can, through infusions of much needed capital. Nieves Burney says that if Project 2025's proposed actions are implemented, already vulnerable Black and Brown workers could be in dire straights.

""I'm sitting on the side of the table where Black women typically aren't seated,"" she says. ""I get to push against the narrative that Black founders don't exist and ensure they get the funding they deserve but my job will be made harder if these proposed restrictions get implemented.""

Another lynchpin in the workforce section of proposed initiatives of Project 2025 is its plan to address DEI, which is often described as an attack on America's progress by conservatives.

""The next conservative President must make the institutions of American civil society hard targets for woke culture warriors,"" Project 2025 authors write. ""This starts with deleting the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (""SOGI""), diversity, equity, and inclusion (""DEI""), gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights, and any other term used to deprive Americans of their First Amendment rights out of every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists.""

Dominic K. Hawkins, Vice President Of Communications at the NAACP says the proposed roll backs to DEI efforts will cause great harm to the country.

""Project 2025's policies will weaken civil rights protections, increase workplace discrimination, and ultimately set us back years,"" Hawkins says. ""As a Black professional who has worked across private and public sectors, I've seen how DEI practices only strengthen organizations and give opportunities that our community might be barred from due to the legacy of enslavement and systemic racism. If Project 2025 is enacted, what's to stop companies from blocking my application even when I'm more qualified? Nothing! And there would be no federally powered recourse.""

He adds, ""On top of that, it could create a dearth Black leaders at the top of organizations, who can't then help guide operations and they wouldn't be able to serve as role models and mentors for the next generation. As a Black executive, I wouldn't be where I am today with out sponsors at the C-level. Project 2025 would seek to wipe that out.""

The far reaching plan not only has the ability to touch business owners and corporate leaders, but content creator community as well. Quentin ""Funky Dineva"" Latham and Patrick ""Mr. Jones X"" Jones both expressed their fear for what's to come if the project is fully rolled out.

""It's terrifying, honestly,"" Latham says. He hosts a video podcast on his Youtube channel, which boasts more than 440k subscribers. Although he generates income from his broadcasts, Latham shares that government sanctions on DEI-driven initiatives could affect growth opportunities, including strict censoring rules that could impact the way he creates content.

Jones, on the other hand, shares fears of how his overall safety could be affected since he is a public figure that often comments on hot-button political topics. His combined social media pages boast more than 100k followers.

""Some people that existed on the TikTok platform that weren't very fond of my messaging {about Project 2025 potential ills} found out where I lived and sent the law enforcement to my house, which is where I work,"" Jones stated. ""I do believe that action is a direct manifestation of that group feeling emboldened by the conservative right's anti-DEI push.""

Overall, he says this is the apt time for working millennials like himself to empower and educate themselves about the future of work, and how the upcoming election could affect it.

""Be willing to learn more about the policies that can affect your life and do something about it,"" Jones advises. ""Use that as a motivation to stay the course. Never stop having the important conversations because it could be the difference between living the life you worked for, or having it shift in ways you could never imagine."""
Inside Project 2025 And Its Connection To Donald Trump,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2024/10/08/inside-project-2025-and-its-connection-to-donald-trump/,2024-10-08T20:15:42Z,"There has been a lot of discussion about Trump's connection to Project 2025, a 922-page document, written by the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation. Is the Democrat's assertion that Trump is connected to the effort, correct? What does Project 2025 actually say? Project 2025 contains a multitude of items, more than we can cover in this article.

Is Trump connected to Project 2025? According to the slightly left leaning newspaper USA Today, this is a false assertion (read more here). The slightly right leaning NY Post also refutes the notion that Trump is connected to it. CNN has gone on record to say that Harris has made false claims about Trump and Project 2025. She said Trump, if elected, would cut Social Security. While the document says very little about Social Security, it does not propose cuts in the program (read more here).

Why then are Democrats claiming a Trump connection to Project 2025? In this hotly contested political race, each party is looking for ways to attack the credibility of the other and instill fear in the electorate to garner votes. To accomplish this, each party has made assertions about their opponent with the hope that it will resonate in the minds of undecided voters. While there may be several reasons to be hesitant about a second Trump presidency, his connection to Project 2025 or lack thereof, isn't one of them. What is true about Project 2025? Here's what I found after reading much of the 922-page document.

The Heritage Foundation published Project 2025 in 2023. There were 34 authors, 276 contributors, and 2 editors. Among the contributors, about 71% of them worked for the federal government during the first Trump administration. Some worked closely with Trump himself.

What prompted the creation of Project 2025? The premise behind it is that the federal government is far too powerful and too inefficient. This is a widely held belief among Americans. However, there are a few items in the document that run contrary to the Democrats agenda. For example, Project 2025 would restore the definition of ""sex"" as ""biological sex at birth"" instead of ""sexual orientation and gender identity."" According to a Pew research poll from May 2022, 60% of those polled believe gender is determined by the sex assigned at birth. Yet, Democrats continue to define sex as ones ""sexual orientation and gender identity."" Thus, the document states, ""The CDC should immediately end its collection of data on gender identity, which legitimizes the unscientific notion that men can become women (and vice versa)...""

Another example involves abortion. Liberals promote abortion as health care. The Project 2025 document (page 455) states, ""It should fund studies into the risks and complications of abortion and ensure that it corrects and does not promote misinformation regarding the comparative health

and psychological benefits of childbirth versus the health and psychological risks of intentionally taking a human life through abortion."" Conservatives see the issue as more than a woman's right to choose. They see abortion as the taking of life. In general, conservatives are against abortion but do believe exceptions to protect the life of the mother, rape, incest are appropriate.

Project 2025 also exposes some conflicts of interest in the federal government. One such conflict is found in the National Institute of Health (NIH). It states, ""In 2018, it was revealed that a $100 million NIH study on the benefits of moderate drinking was funded by the beer and liquor industry."" It also points out how the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) owns half of the patent for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, among thousands of other pharma patents. It goes on to say that several NIH employees personally receive up to $150,000 per year from Moderna vaccine sales.

Project 2025 does have some controversial items within the document, but its overarching theme is that government has become too large, too inefficient, and there are too many agencies whose actions go well beyond their charter. In short, the document makes suggestions that would reorganize the federal bureaucracy, returning agencies to their original mandates.

Democrats have suggested Trump will enact its provisions if elected in November. While Trump may indeed implement some of the provisions of Project 2025, many of them are standard conservative ideals and not something from a horror movie as Democrats have suggested."
Stevie Nicks' New Single Instantly Debuts In The Same Position On Multiple Charts,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2024/10/08/stevie-nicks-new-single-instantly-debuts-in-the-same-position-on-multiple-charts/,2024-10-08T12:28:51Z,"Stevie Nicks returned a little more than a week ago with ""The Lighthouse,"" her latest solo single. The Fleetwood Mac star's fan base snapped up copies of the tune the moment it dropped, and they've collectively sent the song to multiple charts in the U.K. this week, immediately making it into something of a quick, if minor, hit.

""The Lighthouse"" launches on both the Official Singles Sales and Official Singles Downloads charts this time around. Coincidentally, the tune is new at No. 48 on the two tallies.

It's not entirely uncommon for songs to debut in similar spots on those two rankings, as they are both ranked based on pure purchases. Most sales of individual tracks take place on download storefronts like iTunes and Amazon, so it makes sense that new arrivals on the Official Singles Downloads list would also perform just as well-or, almost as well-on the Official Singles Sales roster at the same time.

""The Lighthouse"" marks Nicks' second solo hit on the Official Singles Sales chart. She debuted on the list of the top-selling songs in the U.K. in 2020. That year, ""Edge of Seventeen"" peaked at No. 7, and it still stands as her top placement.

Nicks' latest offering marks her fourth career win on the Official Singles Downloads ranking. It's her second-highest appearance, coming in ahead of the No. 72 high point that ""Dreams"" by Deep Dish reached years ago, as well as the No. 98 peak that ""Show Them the Way"" mustered.

""The Lighthouse"" stands as the fifth-highest debut on the Official Singles Downloads chart, landing behind tracks from Kylie Minogue, Callum Beattie, Jack Savoretti and Miles Kane, and Josh Baker. On the Official Singles Sales list, Nicks claims the sixth-loftiest entrant. In addition to the five names mentioned above, The Veronicas also hit the tally with their years-old single ""Untouched,"" which reaches the list for the first time.

Nicks released ""The Lighthouse"" as a means to inspire discussions about women's rights and the issue of abortion. For the moment, the track is a standalone single, as it's not connected to any larger project-at least for the time being."
Kamala Harris' 'Call Her Daddy' Appearance Divides Podcast Host Alex Cooper's Listeners,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/10/07/kamala-harris-call-her-daddy-appearance-divides-podcast-host-alex-coopers-listeners/,2024-10-07T19:54:16Z,"Podcast host Alex Cooper interviewed Vice President Kamala Harris on her popular ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, Spotify's second-biggest podcast which has a large audience of women listeners, drawing criticism from some of Cooper's conservative-leaning listeners.

""Call Her Daddy"" has ranked as Spotify's second-biggest podcast, only behind Joe Rogan's ""Joe Rogan Experience,"" for the past two years. Spotify also says it is the biggest podcast for women on its platform. ""Call Her Daddy"" ranked as the fourth-biggest podcast across all platforms for the second quarter of 2024, according to Edison Research, behind Rogan, ""Crime Junkie"" and The New York Times' ""The Daily."" Cooper also has a significant social media following, with 2.4 million followers on her ""Call Her Daddy"" Instagram account and 3.9 million followers on the podcast's TikTok. Cooper regularly hosts high-profile celebrity guests on her podcast, including Simone Biles, Post Malone and Katy Perry. Cooper has also raised her podcast's profile through media appearances, including a stint as a host at the Paris Olympic Games this summer for NBC. Her podcast has been highly sought after by streaming services: SiriusXM spent $100 million on the rights to her podcast in August, three years after Spotify paid $60 million for exclusive rights.

Though it's unclear how much of Cooper's listening base is made up of conservatives, Cooper said she has a ""very mixed audience when it comes to politics"" prior to her Harris interview, acknowledging she seldom talks about politics to make her podcast a welcome space for all listeners. Cooper, however, has previously spoken out in favor of abortion rights. In one ""Call Her Daddy"" episode released in October 2022, Cooper spoke with women who had to travel from states with restrictive abortion laws to other states to receive care, which she said was to highlight the impact of anti-abortion legislation on women. She also criticized the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Cooper's podcast also exploded in popularity after it was acquired in 2018 by Barstool Sports, the media company founded by Dave Portnoy known for its conservative-leaning audience that Politico called ""Barstool Republicans.""

Cooper released her interview with Harris on Sunday, in which she largely asked the vice president questions about women's issues, including reproductive rights. Harris slammed state laws she called ""Trump abortion bans"" and dismissed Trump's claim that he would be a ""protector"" for women as president. She also addressed comments made by Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Republican, last month in which she said Harris does not have biological children to keep her ""humble."" Harris said she feels ""sorry"" for Sanders, stating many women are ""not aspiring to be humble"" and ""have a lot of love in their life, family in their life and children in their life"" who lift them up.

""I couldn't see a world in which one of the main conversations in this election is women, and I'm not a part of it,"" Cooper said, defending her decision to interview Harris despite her politically mixed audience, as well as her choice to center their conversation around women's issues.

Cooper ranked No. 12 on Forbes' list of the top-earning creators of 2023, with estimated earnings of $20 million. She was also included on Forbes' 30 Under 30 list in 2022.

Harris' ""Call Her Daddy"" interview was one of several media appearances she has scheduled for this week. Also this week, Harris will appear on ""The View,"" ""60 Minutes,"" ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" and Howard Stern's radio show.

Public Opinion 101: How Do Voters Decide?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bowmanmarsico/2024/10/07/public-opinion-101-how-do-voters-decide/,2024-10-07T19:32:46Z,"Why do people vote the way they do? What factors influence them as they make this decision and other crucial ones about things such as their health care? Those in the Washington political bubble tend to place considerable emphasis on the acquisition of factual material. But is that how other Americans make these big decisions?

In the aftermath of the Vance-Walz debate, fact checkers worked overtime to confirm the accuracy of both candidates' statements. Their work may aid voters' decisions, but their efforts seem to appeal more to their fellow journalists and political pundits. As such, they are unlikely to have much impact on public opinion.

Facts are important, of course, but in the words of the late sociologist Daniel Yankelovich, they are not ""the royal road to judgment."" Other things matter. In 2024, some voters will vote on a single issue. Since 1992, for example, Gallup has tracked the proportion of registered voters that say they will only vote for a candidate who shares their views on the abortion. In June of 2024, 32% gave that response. A much smaller number will vote on climate. Still others may be Second Amendment purists and evaluate candidates based on their views of guns. Some will vote on character or because they dislike a candidate. Still others will cast their ballots for their party just as their parents and grandparents did.

There are many others whose party ties are weak, who don't follow complicated policy issues, who don't have a single most important issue, or who don't hate the other party's candidate. They will vote for other reasons. But where do these decisions originate?

Yankelovich wrote about decision making in his 1999 book The Magic of Dialogue, and I am indebted to his work. He notes that journalists and social scientists base their opinions on the accumulation of facts, but the general public does not make its determinations this way. The public, he says, ""forms its judgments through dialogue and discussion. People weigh what they hear from others against their own convictions. They compare notes with one another in terms of what makes sense to them.""

In many years of following the polls, I have been struck by Americans' responses when they are asked how they form their opinions. Conversations with friends and family often top the list. A new Morning Consult poll for the Public Affairs Council asked people about their most trusted source for political news and information. ""Friends and family"" swamped the other categories, far ahead of the parties, business, and social media.

An August Syracuse University/Ipsos poll asked people to imagine that they had 100 minutes to cast an informed vote on the 2024 election. When asked how much time they would spend speaking to a variety of sources, the mean response for family and friends was the highest, followed distantly by eight other sources including broadcast news, cable news, national newspapers, and social media. The results were virtually identical in their July and May polls. In these three soundings, Democrats, Republicans, and independents all gave the most attention to the views of friends and family.

On a very different often highly complex subject, Axios/Ipsos asked people who they trusted to provide them information on ""health topics."" Eighty-six percent said they had a great deal or fair amount of trust in information from their personal physician, followed by information from friends and family (74%). Information from the CDC, the FDA, the NIH, or the governor of their state ranked far behind in terms of high trust.

Yankelovich believed people start with their values. The public doesn't distinguish between facts and values the way journalists do, he says. He was suspicious of the ""conventional paradigm of knowledge with its sharp distinctions between 'objective' facts and 'subjective' values."" What he called the public's ""pre-scientific ways of knowing"" actually has ""greater validity for the important questions of living together than current theories of knowledge."" A poorly informed public can make sound, even wise, judgments, he argued.

The process of arriving at these judgements often takes time, and it is probably harder in our polarized age. In our current environment in which institutional trust is so low, understanding how much people rely on discussions with their family and friends is surely important.

The fact checkers will continue their work for those of us in the Washington bubble and beyond. But they alone will not help Americans arrive at decisions about the 2024 candidates or other important decisions in their lives."
Five Things Small Business Owners Can Do To Prepare For The Election,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyshoenthal/2024/10/07/five-things-small-business-owners-can-do-to-prepare-for-the-election/,2024-10-07T16:49:24Z,"As the U.S. braces for the upcoming presidential election, small business owners harbor a unique set of concerns around how the outcome might impact their day to day operations. From legislation that could affect taxes, healthcare costs and regulation, the political climate will have a domino effect on consumer behavior, financial markets and more.

Regardless of who wins, it's critical for small business owners to stay informed on new policies and regulatory shifts, as new legislation could reshape things like employee benefits and compliance requirements. With one month to go, many small business owners are curious about proactive steps they can take to prepare for the looming uncertainty. Experts suggest five key principles to prepare for the election's outcome:

1. Monitor policy changes.

It's widely known that election years can bring market volatility. That's why it's critical for small business owners to stay informed about proposed changes in regulations, taxes, healthcare and labor laws that could directly impact their operations. Understanding candidates' platforms will help anticipate shifts and plan for potential changes accordingly.

Jen Stark, who serves as a strategic advisor to Don't Ban Equality, advises small business owners to pay attention to local laws that might impact employee health benefit concerns, especially around reproductive care.

""Small businesses in states that have passed abortion bans and restrictions are left with the burden of shouldering the costs and chaos facing workers and communities,"" she says. ""Those workers have to travel out of state, resulting in more time off and greater healthcare costs out of pocket even if their employer has a benefits program to support them.""

Shifts in economic regulations are another area small business owners should pay close attention to.

""Political uncertainty in the months leading up to the presidential election can affect confidence and decision-making for consumers, which leads to impact on small business owners and can cause a decrease in consumer spending,"" says Cate Luzio, former banker and founder of Luminary, a professional education and networking platform. ""The election results themselves can eventually cause a change in business regulations that small business owners need to be aware of, along with the impact that might have on their business, their growth, their customers and more.""

2. Focus on consumer and employee engagement.

Consumer spending patterns may shift during an election year due to uncertainty. Many people tend to cut back on discretionary spending when they feel uneasy about the economy.

Consider changes you can make to your business to prepare for this sentiment shift. Do you offer essential products or services that are less impacted by economic swings? Are there ways to re-engage your most loyal consumers right now? Focus on those if possible.

At the same time, this is a prime opportunity to foster civic engagement among employees.

""As this election season kicks into high gear, entrepreneurs and business leaders have an opportunity to use their trusted voice to protect American democracy,"" says Katie Vlietstra Wonnenberg, principal of Public Private Strategies. ""Consumers want businesses to be active in protecting America's democracy and they support actions to ensure it.""

Wonnenberg cited research from the Business & Democracy Initiative, which revealed that 75% of consumers support businesses who promote employee civic education and agree that employees should have time off for political engagement.

""Taking these steps during election season can help with employee retention and can build trust and loyalty with consumers,"" she points out.

3. Scenario plan.

Given the potential for significant regulatory changes, business owners should consider the changes that might occur under different administrations. Think through any adjustments you might need to make within operations or budgets when considering factors like minimum wage hikes, healthcare mandates, trade policies and more.

""Company leadership should always be preparing for uncontrollable changes by discussing different scenarios with their teams so they are prepared,"" says Chantell Preston, a healthcare development consultant who advises small businesses on reducing risk.

Preston suggests playing out different scenarios so your company and employees are prepared for any outcome. ""Enlist feedback and engage with your stakeholders so they know you are preparing,"" she says. ""Communicate and be transparent with your employees to build trust and reduce uncertainty.""

4. Remind your employees that they have a say.

Presidential elections can influence labor laws and healthcare regulations, which impact employee pay and HR policies. Business owners should keep a close eye on any proposed changes to healthcare, minimum wage, or employee benefits that could impact overhead costs, communicating openly with employees to prepare for any potential changes that might occur following the election.

Kimber Lanning, CEO of Local First Arizona, suggests starting this conversation prior to the election by reminding employees that they actually do have a say in shaping the outcome.

""A great way to get involved in an election while staying out of divisive politics is to stick to a message of getting out the vote,"" she says. ""Consider giving your employees time off to go to the polls on Election Day. Encourage your customers to vote by placing signs in your establishment or stickers at the cash register. Sponsor or organize a voter registration event. Using your voice as a business owner to support democracy is a noble thing to do.""

5. Be prepared to dip into cash reserves.

Election years can bring about economic uncertainty, which leads to market volatility. Small businesses should consider building up cash reserves to cushion against any potential downturns.

Experts recommend postponing major investments until after the election, reviewing current tax strategies and being prepared to dip into cash reserves in case of significant disruption.

Preston recommends having at least 18 months of capital available. She also suggests researching regulatory perspectives from all parties and evaluating supply chains in case of issues.

Lanning suggests treating an election cycle like any other slow season. She points out that, ""In Phoenix, our summers are hot, so businesses know to plan for decreased revenue as customers go away on vacation. In the months running up to a major election, business owners should do the same thing.""

""No matter what industry you're in, sales activity slumps as Americans hold their money tighter, wondering how the election will turn out and what policies a new president will implement that may affect their pocket book,"" says Lanning. ""You may need to pause hiring, dip into savings or wait to make a big purchase to keep your business healthy.""

Luzio acknowledges the financial anxiety that comes with the election can lead to impulsive, shortsighted decisions.

""Get your 2025 financial projections in order with scenarios around growth, flat and down performance,"" she suggests. ""At a macro level, key issues may have an impact on your numbers: taxes, regulation, trade and consumer spending/customer acquisition. It is important for business owners to be informed about issues and make sure they're aware regardless of which way the election goes. Doing an updated SWOT analysis for your business can help, especially as it relates to how to mitigate or protect your business against threats.""

Finally, Luzio recommends talking to your trusted experts such as insurance professionals, financial advisors, cybersecurity experts, attorneys and banking partners to help mitigate risk.

""Discuss potential business impacts with these experts to help you feel informed about decision making around the business,"" says Luzio.

""The election is out of your control,"" she says. ""So don't panic, please vote, and focus on awareness to support your business through this time."""
New Supreme Court Term Starts Today: Here Are The Biggest Cases To Watch -- So Far,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/07/new-supreme-court-term-starts-today-here-are-the-biggest-cases-to-watch-so-far/,2024-10-07T15:02:28Z,"The Supreme Court's new term kicks off on Monday, with justices already slated to hear major cases on such topics as transgender rights and guns -- and other huge cases could still be added, including on the 2024 election and former President Donald Trump's criminal cases.

Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines. Text ""Alerts"" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.

The Supreme Court's term begins on Monday and will run through the end of June. It's unclear when rulings in the court's major cases will come out. Decisions are usually released a few months after the court hears oral arguments, meaning rulings will come out quicker for cases heard earlier in the term, though the biggest decisions of the court's term are often released in June.

The Supreme Court is likely to add a number of other major cases to its docket this term. The court has already been asked to hear such cases as a lawsuit seeking damages for oil companies' impacts on climate change and a challenge to a school's race-neutral admissions practices, but has not yet ruled on taking those up. A number of gun-specific challenges have also been filed with the court, including cases regarding Maryland's assault weapons ban, the ban on people convicted of felonies possessing guns, whether states can ban 18-to-20-year olds from purchasing guns and whether people under felony indictment can buy guns. Lawsuits taking issue with the Biden administration's new efforts on student loan forgiveness are also winding through the courts, and while the Supreme Court already upheld a block on a student debt relief effort in August, it could be asked again to consider the issue more fully. The Supreme Court punted last term on abortion when it ruled challengers trying to restrict abortion drug mifepristone didn't have standing to bring the case and dismissed a challenge against Idaho's abortion ban, but both cases are still moving forward in lower courts as plaintiffs try to make the cases work, and could return to the high court.

After ruling last term that Trump and other ex-presidents have some immunity from criminal prosecution -- ruling he can't be charged for anything he did that was an ""official act"" as president, but can be prosecuted for actions outside his official duties -- justices could be asked this term to weigh in on the issue for a second time. The Supreme Court directed Trump's criminal case for trying to overturn the 2020 election to go back to the lower court, and U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan now has to decide which charges against Trump comply with the Supreme Court's ruling and can proceed to trial. Trump is all but certain to appeal whatever Chutkan decides, however, and it could be up to the Supreme Court to make the final determination on the issue. Special Counsel Jack Smith is also now trying to revive the federal case against Trump for allegedly mishandling White House documents, after Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon threw it out because she found Smith had been unlawfully appointed. That appeal could also go to the Supreme Court to determine whether Smith and other special counsels have the appropriate authority.

The Supreme Court is also likely to play a role in the November election, as it did in 2020. Justices were repeatedly asked to weigh in on cases challenging the election results in that election, which could happen again this year should Trump lose the election. There are also lawsuits challenging various voting rules that could still make their way to the Supreme Court before Election Day or become a factor while ballots are being counted, most notably regarding whether ballots must be received by Election Day.

The Supreme Court's term kicks off as Americans have become increasingly dissatisfied with the 6-3 conservative bench, amid a series of ethics scandals and controversial rulings. The court ended its last term with a slew of major rulings, including the Trump immunity case, striking down a ban on bump stocks for guns, killing Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy settlement, allowing a ban on ""public camping"" that targets the homeless, limiting charges for Jan. 6 rioters and overturning a longstanding precedent that gave broad power to federal agencies. Justices have also refused to enact a binding ethics code amid a series of controversies involving potential conflicts of interests, particularly by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. A Gallup poll conducted in September found 51% of Americans now disapprove of the Supreme Court as its new term begins, versus 44% who approve of the job justices are doing. Results broke heavily along party lines, with 83% of Democrats disapproving of the high court versus only 19% of Republicans."
What Does Abortion Look Like In Your State? An Alphabetical Guide,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/evaepker/2024/10/05/what-does-abortion-look-like-in-your-state-an-alphabetical-guide/,2024-10-05T13:36:04Z,"In exactly one month, voters across the United States will cast their ballots - and for residents of 10 of those states, those ballots will include questions about the future of abortion. For nearly 50 years, the U.S Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade established that a person's individual right to an abortion was protected by the U.S Constitution. The U.S Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization in 2022, however, overturned that prior ruling, leaving states with the power to regulate abortion.

Since then, 20 states have banned or restricted abortions, seven states have already voted on abortion rights, and multiple states have abortion-related laws and guidelines that simply aren't clear. For example, four states (Arkansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and South Dakota) allow abortions only to save a pregnant person's life but not to improve her health. Healthcare professionals then have to decide - sometimes in the middle of a medical emergency - whether an abortion would qualify as life-saving or, in other words, legal or not. They are then liable if they have found to have broken the law and could face punishments such as fines, jail sentences, loss of license, or a combination of the three.

This state-by-stage guide aims to clear up some unknowns about abortion, such as where it is legal, what exceptions might exist, what lawsuits or laws are pending, and what voters - and the rest of the U.S population - should know in advance of Election Day.

Alabama: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life or health: both physical and mental. Alabama is actually the only state that explicitly includes mental health concerns as an exception to its abortion ban but requires that a psychiatrist both to diagnose the pregnant individual with a ""serious mental illness"" and to document that her mental health condition could cause her to engage in behavior that might threaten her life or that of the fetus.

There are no exceptions to the abortion ban for fatal fetal anomalies or in cases of rape and/or incest.

Alaska: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Arizona: Abortion is legal up to 15 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person counseling from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission before the abortion.

In September 2024, Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs signed the legislature's repeal of an 1864 near-total abortion ban.

Arizona residents will be also be voting on Arizona Proposition 139, the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" will amend the state Constitution to provide the fundamental right to abortion before the point of fetal viability (which is usually between 22 and 26 weeks and marks the point where the fetus has a high chance of surviving outside the uterus without any significant medical intervention) unless ""justified by a compelling state interest"" (such as improving or maintaining the health of the individual seeking an abortion). Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment.

Arkansas: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exception to this ban is to save a pregnant person's life. There are no exceptions for risks to the pregnant person's physical health, for fatal fetal anomalies, or for rape and/or incest.

Arkansans for Limited Government tried to get an abortion rights amendment on the ballot in 2024. If passed, the amendment would've legalized abortion up to 18 weeks and protected abortion access after that time period in the cases of risks to the pregnant person's life or health, for fatal fetal anomalies, and for rape and/or incest. In August 2024, the Arkansas Supreme Court ruled that Arkansans for Limited Government had failed to file the paid canvasser training certification and had failed to comply with state law so the amendment wouldn't appear on the 2024 ballot.

California: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

In 2022, California residents passed California Proposition 1, the Right to Reproductive Freedom Amendment, which supported amending the state Constitution to prohibit the state from interfering with or denying an individual's reproductive freedom, including the right to an abortion. The Proposition passed with 67% support.

Colorado: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian or adult relative (if the minor lives with that relative and not with one or both parents) must be informed at least 48 hours before the abortion.

Next month, residents will vote on Colorado Amendment 89, the Right to Abortion and Health Insurance Coverage Initiative. Voting ""yes"" would both enshrine a right to abortion in the Colorado Constitution and allow the use of public funds for abortion. Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment and would uphold a current constitutional provision that bans the use of public funds for abortion.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, there is no parental/guardian involvement required.

Delaware: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors under 16, a parent/guardian, grandparent, or mental health professional must be notified.

Florida: Abortion is legal up to six weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person counseling from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian must be notified at least 48 hours before and must give permission.

Next month, residents will vote on Florida Amendment 4, the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" would both enshrine a right to abortion in the state Constitution up to fetal viability (or when necessary to protect a pregnant person's health, as determined by their healthcare provider) while maintaining the current law that requires that a parent/guardian be notified if a minor is seeking an abortion. Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive information from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. (They do not have to receive that information in person; it can be mailed to them or read over the phone to them.) For minors, a parent/guardian must be notified.

In September 2024, Georgia Judge Robert C.I. McBurney struck down the prior state law, which prohibited most abortions after six weeks. Georgia's Republican attorney general has already appealed this ruling, though, and the Georgia Supreme Court will likely make the final decision.

Hawaii: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Idaho: Abortion is illegal as of August 25, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life and physical health or for rape and/or incest.

The Idaho Supreme Court ruled in 2023 that there is no constitutional right to an abortion in the state. Since then, two consolidated court cases (Idaho v. United States and Moyle v. United States have argued that healthcare professionals should be able to perform emergency abortions to preserve a pregnant person's physical health - not just save her life. The Supreme Court received this case but dismissed it in June 2024, sending it back to the federal appeals courts for further litigation. Until a decision is made, the exceptions to the abortion ban do currently include preserving the pregnant person's physical health.

In cases of rape and/or incest, an abortion can be legally performed up to 14 weeks but requires a police report or report from child protection services.

There are no exceptions to the ban for fatal fetal anomalies.

Illinois: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Indiana: Abortion is illegal as of September 15, 2022.

In 2023, the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that the state Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion with three exceptions. Abortions can be performed at any time to preserve the life and health of the pregnant person; up to 20 weeks for fatal fetal abnormalities; and up to 12 weeks gestational age for rape and/or incest .

Four residents and the group Hoosier Jews for Choice have argued that abortion is an exercise of religion; banning abortion thus violates Indiana's 2015 religious freedom law. The Indiana Supreme Court is expected to hear the case soon.

Iowa: Abortion is legal up to six weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian or grandparent must be notified at least 48 hours before.

Kansas: Abortion is legal up to 22 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, both parents/guardians (or a singular parent/guardian if that individual has sole custody) must give permission.

Kansas was the first state to vote on abortion rights following Dobbs. In November 2022, its residents rejected the Value Them Both Constitutional Amendment, which would have ruled that there was no right to abortion in the state Constitution, subsequently enacting a near-total ban on abortion. 53% of voters rejected that proposed amendment.

Kentucky: Abortion is illegal as of June 15, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life or physical health (with affirmative defense). There are no exceptions for fatal fetal anomalies or for rape and/or incest.

In November 2022, Kentucky residents rejected Kentucky Constitutional Amendment 2, the No Right to Abortion in Constitution Amendment, which would have amended the state Constitution to say explicitly that it doesn't protect the right to abortion. 52% of voters rejected that proposed amendment.

In February 2023, the Kentucky Supreme Court rejected a request to block the state's abortion ban, ruling that abortion providers lacked the standing to challenge the state's abortion ban. The Kentucky Supreme Court, though, didn't elaborate whether or not the state Constitution secured abortion rights, and abortion remains banned in the state as a result.

In late February 2024, Republican Rep. Ken Fleming of Louisville introduced House Bill 711 that would make abortions legal up to six weeks in cases of rape and/or incest, of fatal fetal anomalies, or of fetuses who died in the womb. No action has been taken on the bill since then.

Louisiana: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life or physical health or in limited cases of fatal fetal anomalies. There are no exceptions for rape and/or incest.

Maine: Abortion is legal until fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Maryland: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must be notified unless the minor doesn't live with a parent/guardian or reasonable efforts to give notice to a parent/guardian are unsuccessful.

Next month, residents will vote on Maryland Question 1, the Right to Reproductive Freedom Amendment. Voting ""yes"" would support amending the state Constitution to establish a right to ""reproductive freedom"". Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment.

Massachusetts: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors under 16, a parent/guardian must give permission.

Michigan: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission.

In 2022, Michigan residents passed Michigan Proposal 3, the Right to Reproductive Freedom Initiative, which supported providing a constitutional right to reproductive freedom, including the right to an abortion. The Initiative passed with 57% support.

Minnesota: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Mississippi: Abortion is illegal as of July 7, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life, for a limited number of fatal fetal anomalies, and for rape and/or incest. For the latter, an abortion can be legally performed up to six weeks gestational age but requires documentation from law enforcement. There are no exceptions for risks to the pregnant person's physical health.

Missouri: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life or physical health (with affirmative defense). There are no exceptions for fatal fetal anomalies or for rape and/or incest.

Next month, residents will vote on Missouri Amendment 3, the Right to Reproductive Freedom Initiative. Voting ""yes"" supports amending the Missouri Constitution to provide the right to ""reproductive freedom"" and allowing the state legislature to enact laws that regulate abortion only after fetal viability. Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment and would oppose allowing the state legislature to enact laws that regulate abortion only after fetal viability.

Montana: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required. In August 2024, Montana's Supreme Court ruled that the law requiring parental/guardian permission for a minor seeking an abortion was unconstitutional.

In 2022, Montana residents rejected Legislative Referendum No. 131 which would've required medical care for ""infants born alive"", such as those born prematurely or those who were born due to a botched abortion. 53% of voters rejected that proposed referendum.

Next month, residents will vote on Montana CI-128, the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" supports amending the Montana Constitution to provide the right to ""make and carry out decisions about one's own pregnancy, including the right to abortion"" and allowing the state to regulate abortion only after fetal viability. Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment and would oppose allowing the state legislature to enact laws that regulate abortion only after fetal viability.

Nebraska: Abortion is legal up to 12 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive information from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. (They don't have to receive that information in person; it can be mailed to them or read over the phone to them.) For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission.

Next month, residents will vote on both Nebraska Initiative 434, Prohibit Abortions After the First Trimester Amendment and Nebraska Initiative 439, Right to Abortion Initiative.

Voting ""yes"" on Initiative 434 would support amending the state Constitution to ban abortions after the first trimester except to preserve the pregnant person's life or physical health or for rape and/or incest. Voting ""no"" would oppose banning abortions after the first trimester.

Voting ""yes"" on Initiative 439 would support amending the state Constitution to provide a right to abortion until fetal viability. Voting ""no"" on Initiative 439 would oppose adding this Amendment.

Nevada: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Next month, residents will vote on Nevada Question 6, the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" supports amending the state Constitution to protect the right to an abortion and to allow the state to regulate abortion only after fetal viability. Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment and would oppose allowing the state to regulate abortion only after fetal viability.

New Hampshire: Abortion is legal up to 24 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before 24 weeks have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must be notified.

New Jersey: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

New York: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Next month, residents will vote on New York Proposal 1, Equal Protection of Law Amendment. Voting ""yes"" would support adding language to the New York Bill of Rights that would give prevent discriminating against all persons, including due to ""pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy"". Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this language.

North Carolina: Abortion is legal up to12 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 72-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person counseling from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian or grandparent (if the minor has lived with them for at least six months) must give permission.

North Dakota: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive information from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission.

In September 2024, North Dakota Judge Bruce Romanick declared North Dakota's total abortion ban ""unconstitutional"". Republican Attorney General Drew H. Wrigley said that he planned to appeal that decision, though, while the Republican-controlled legislature may try to enact another ban when it reconvenes in January 2025.

Ohio: Abortion is legal up to 22 weeks

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission.

In November 2023, Ohio residents passed Ohio Issue 1, Right to Make Reproductive Decisions Including Abortion Initiative, which supported amending the Ohio Constitution to guarantee the right to abortion until fetal viability as well as the right to other reproductive health decisions. The Initiative passed with 57% support.

Oklahoma: Abortion is illegal as of May 25, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to save the pregnant person's life. There are no exceptions for risks to the pregnant person's physical health, for fatal fetal anomalies, or for rape and/or incest.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive information from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. If the person seeking an abortion is 18 or older, that information can be read over the phone to them; if the person seeking an abortion is 17 or younger, they have to receive that counseling in person with a parent/guardian. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission.

Rhode Island: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission.

South Carolina: Abortion is legal up to six weeks (or up to 12 weeks for rape and/or incest as long as the physician reported the rape or incest within 24 hours of performing the abortion).

Those seeking an abortion before six weeks have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive information from their abortion provider and when they can receive the abortion. (They don't have to receive that information in person.) For minors under 17, a parent/guardian or grandparent must give permission.

South Dakota: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve a pregnant person's life. There are no exceptions for risks to the pregnant person's physical health, for fatal fetal anomalies, or for rape and/or incest.

Next month, residents will vote on South Dakota Constitutional Amendment G or the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" would support providing a state constitutional right to abortion in South Dakota using a trimester framework. During the first trimester, the state would be prohibited for regulating abortion; during the second trimester, the state may regulate abortion but ""only in ways that are reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman""; during the third trimester, the state may regulate or prohibit abortion, except ""when abortion is necessary, in the medical judgment of the woman's physician, to preserve the life and health of the pregnant woman"". Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment.

Texas: Abortion is illegal as of July 1, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve a pregnant person's life (with affirmative defense). There are no exceptions for risks to the pregnant person's physical health, for fatal fetal anomalies, or for rape and/or incest.

A group of Texas women who had serious pregnancy complications were the first in the country to testify in court about being denied abortions after Dobbs. And yet, the court has advised Texan physicians only that they should ""meticulously document"" their decision-making around abortions without any clarification about what actions - regardless of documentation - might put them at risk for prosecution.

Utah: Abortion is legal up to 18 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 72-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person counseling from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian must be notified at least 24 hours before the abortion and give permission.

A state law that completely banned abortion in Utah went into effect on June 24, 2022 but was challenged in court by Planned Parenthood Association of Utah. On August 1, 2024, the Utah Supreme Court prevented this total ban from taking effect while the lawsuit continued.

Vermont: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

In November 2022, residents of Vermont passed Vermont Proposal 5, the Right to Personal Reproductive Autonomy Amendment, which supported amending the Vermont Constitution to protect the right to personal reproductive autonomy - such as the decision to receive an abortion - and to prohibit government infringement in these matters unless ""justified by a compelling state interest"". The Amendment passed with 77% support.

Virginia: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion then have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian (or adult family member or parent-like individual with whom the minor regularly lives) must be notified at least 24 hours before the abortion.

Washington: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Washington D.C: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

West Virginia: Abortion is illegal as of September 16, 2022.

The exceptions are to preserve the pregnant person's life or physical health, for fetal anomalies, and for rape and/or incest. For the latter, abortions can be performed up to eight weeks (or up to 14 weeks for minors) as long as the assault has been reported to law enforcement.

Wisconsin: Abortion is legal up to 22 weeks

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person counseling from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian, grandparent, or a sibling or aunt or uncle who is at least 25 years old must give permission.

Abortion opponents have claimed that a law from 1849 bans abortion in all cases except when the pregnant person's life is in danger. Lower level courts have argued that the law in question applies only to infanticide and not consensual abortions. The Wisconsin Supreme Court will hear that case.

Wyoming: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must be informed at least 24 hours before the abortion.

The Wyoming Supreme Court received this case but dismissed it in April 2024, sending it back to the lower courts. Until a decision is made, abortion remains legal in the state up to fetal viability.

Trump Campaign Thinks Abortion Ballot Measures Might Actually Help Him,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/04/trump-campaign-thinks-abortion-ballot-measures-might-actually-help-him/,2024-10-04T20:11:04Z,"Battleground states' ballot measures on abortion could benefit former President Donald Trump in the election, the Trump campaign's political director told The Washington Post Friday, as polling suggests Republicans are willing to turn out to support abortion rights but still back Trump, despite Democrats trying to use the ballot measures to their advantage.

Polling shows Trump is leading in battleground states even as respondents trust Harris more on handling abortion. A 56% majority of Fox News' Arizona poll respondents said they trusted Harris to do a better job on abortion -- though the respondents still preferred Trump overall -- as did 53% of Arizona respondents in the Times/Siena College poll. Fox News' polling in August found 58% of voters from Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina preferred Harris on abortion, but only 48% overall said they'd support her (compared with 47% who backed Trump).

Politico reports abortion ballot measures may also impact voters in subsequent elections, noting that Democrats are reporting pro-abortion rights voters in Michigan -- where abortion was legalized via ballot measure in 2022 -- aren't as fired up this year because they think their reproductive rights are safe. A KFF poll found in July that 60% of Michigan women believe abortion's legality is now a ""settled"" issue in their state, with Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow telling Politico there's a ""false sense of comfort"" among voters that abortion is no longer under threat. Democratic candidates have had to argue to voters that their rights could still be taken away if Trump wins, Politico reports, as candidates claim Trump would enact national restrictions if elected that would override any state measures.

Democrats have continued to insist they expect their candidates will be buoyed by abortion ballot measures. They hope it will help them in the presidential election and key Senate races, as Democrats face close races in states with abortion ballot measures like Montana, Florida and Arizona. ""Wherever they've been on the ballot, we've had a significant turnout of folks who care deeply about reproductive freedom,"" Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., who leads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told The Post. ""Folks who turn out understand that the Republican candidates tend to be diametrically opposed to that -- and so they vote for the referendum and they vote for the Democratic candidate.""

Harris and Trump are still neck-and-neck in the polls. While polling has largely been in support of abortion ballot measures coming out in favor of reproductive rights -- and no ballot measure since the Supreme Court's ruling has yet come out against abortion rights -- it remains to be seen how the measures in this year's election will fare. Florida's ballot measure will require 60% of the vote in order to pass, meaning it will have to clear a particularly high bar compared with other states that only need a simple majority.

What Trump would actually do on abortion if elected. Though the ex-president has repeatedly said he does not support a national abortion ban, Democrats have been highly skeptical. Anti-abortion advocates have reframed their rhetoric to push for ""national minimum standards"" on abortion rather than ""bans"" -- phrasing restrictions differently to get around the unpopularity of abortion bans -- and the Trump campaign has not yet responded to a request for comment on if he supports a ""national minimum standard."" Anti-abortion groups have continued to push for Trump to enact national restrictions even as the ex-president has said he wants to leave it up to the states, and while the GOP's national platform doesn't call for a national ban, it does call for giving constitutional rights to fetuses, which would ban abortion by default.

The Supreme Court's ruling overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022 has made abortion into a key electoral issue, with Democrats relying on abortion rights as a tool to galvanize the party's base. Abortion ballot measures have been a key part of that strategy, emerging as the primary way for abortion rights advocates to harness public support and protect access even in states with Republican leadership. Republicans have downplayed their anti-abortion views in elections that have taken place since the Supreme Court's decision, with candidates editing their websites and toning down anti-abortion rhetoric so as to not alienate voters who support the procedure remaining legal. Trump said in April he supported abortion being left up to states after previously suggesting he could endorse a 15-week national ban, and has continued to insist he won't restrict abortion and tried to downplay the issue. His running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, has backed a national abortion ban in the past, but has more recently toned down his views, saying he supports Trump's view of leaving the issue to the states and falsely claiming at Tuesday's vice presidential debate that he never supported a national ban. The Harris campaign has continued to insist voters should not take Trump at his word, believing the ex-president would still listen to his anti-abortion base and take steps to ban or restrict the procedure if elected."

A number of the biggest names in Hollywood came out in support of Biden before he dropped out of the race, before turning their support to Harris. Olivia Rodrigo, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris by sharing a video of a speech the vice president gave promising to ""stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans."" Major Democratic fundraiser George Clooney, who used a New York Times essay to call for Biden to drop out of the race, lent his support to Harris and Barbra Streisand said she would support Harris because of her vow to fight for reproductive rights. Musician John Legend, who performed at the Democratic National Convention in 2024, posted he was ""so ready"" for a Harris presidency. Director Spike Lee, ""West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin and director Ken Burns hrew their support behind Harris, along with actresses Rosie O'Donnell and Jamie Lee Curtis. Robert De Niro, who narrated an advertisement for the Biden campaign, praised the president's ""selfless patriotism"" in a statement that did not mention Harris but said ""there is nothing more important for our country than defeating Donald Trump at the ballot box."" British pop artist Charli XCX brought Harris into the Gen Z fold by tweeting ""kamala IS brat,"" an endorsement that was met by Harris' team changing the background photo on her X account to the ""brat"" green color and using the same font used on Charli XCX's album of the same name. Rapper Cardi B, who in May said she wouldn't be endorsing Biden, tweeted ""AHAHAHAHA LETS GOOOOO I TOLD YALLL KAMALA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 2024 candidate...."" Pop musician Kesha said she plans to support Harris in November and, when asked how she felt about Vance, responded ""f -- - that man."" Beyonc√© has not made a public endorsement but did give the Harris campaign permission to use her song ""Freedom"" in a video of her first official visit to her campaign's headquarters, a rare approval from the superstar musician. Beyonc√©'s mom and businesswoman Tina Knowles endorsed Harris with an Instagram post. Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle and former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have also thrown their support behind Harris. Former President Jimmy Carter, 99, reportedly told his son last week he was trying to make it to his 100th birthday so he could cast his vote for Kamala Harris. ""Sex in the City"" actress and former New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon threw her support behind Harris and her Vice Presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, in a post that read: ""I'm Walzing on air!"" Billionaire Mark Cuban, who previously said he was committed to voting for Biden, has also supported Harris and endorsed Walz as her running mate, calling him someone who ""can sit at the kitchen table and make you feel like you have know him forever."" Actor Tony Goldwyn, Republican political commentator Ana Navarro, comedian Mindy Kaling and actress Kerry Washington each supported the Harris-Walz campaign by hosting one evening of the Democratic National Convention. Nick Offerman, Jane Fonda, Ben Stiller, Kathy Griffin, John Stamos, Ed Helms, Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz were among those who appeared on a ""Comics for Harris"" virtual rally via Zoom, which reportedly raised close to half a million dollars for the Harris campaign. Over Labor Day weekend, a fundraiser for the Democratic ticket in Southampton, New York was hosted by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and fashion designer Tory Burch, among others. Actors Matt Damon and Lin-Manuel Miranda will attend fundraiser in New York City in September -- for which tickets are listed at $25,000 per person -- to support the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket, Bloomberg reported. Actress Aubrey Plaza posted a photo of herself on Instagram holding Grumpy Cat -- the face of a famous meme -- with the caption ""HARRIS üá∫üá∏ WALZ. Mel Brooks said he was ""all in"" for the Harris and Walz ticket in a post to social media holding his dog, adding ""I don't have a cat, so a dog will have to do!"" Stevie Nicks did not name a particular candidate when she encouraged her followers to vote in an Instagram post this week, but signed her message ""Childless Dog Lady."" Billionaire pop star Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris in an Instagram post minutes after a debate between Harris and Donald Trump wrapped up, with a photo of her holding her cat that has since been recreated by several other celebrities. After declining to endorse a candidate in 2020, Martha Stewart said at the Retail Influencer CEO Forum she will supporting Kamala Harris in the election because she wants a president ""who doesn't hate New York"" and ""doesn't hate democracy,"" the Daily Beast reported. Pop star Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas, a songwriter and producer, made a video about National Voter Registration Day and Billie said they would both be voting for Harris and Walz ""because they are fighting to protect our reproductive freedom, our planet and our democracy."" Famous television scientist Bill Nye, in a video posted to the Kamala HQ TikTok account, called Trump a ""climate change denier"" and encouraged viewers to ""vote with the climate in mind."" Nye participated ""Geeks & Nerds for Harris"" fundraiser on Sept. 28 hosted by ""Wonder Woman"" star Lynda Carter that will also feature ""Star Trek"" actors LeVar Burton and Anthony Rapp, actor Misha Collins of ""Supernatural,"" Star Wars actor Mark Hamill and others.

Former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan ripped off his shirt while on stage at the Republican National Convention last month to reveal a Trump-Vance campaign shirt underneath, and called Trump his ""hero"" and the ""greatest president of the United States."" Musician Kid Rock has been vocal about his support of Trump in the past and at the RNC revamped his song ""American Bad Ass"" to include references to Trump. UFC President and personality Dana White called Trump the ""toughest, most resilient human being."" Rapper and reality TV star Amber Rose gave a speech at the RNC in support of Trump. Country music stars Chris Janson and Jason Aldean also appeared at the convention. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy in January said voting for Trump over Biden was a ""no-brainer."" Public-facing billionaires like Elon Musk and Steve Wynn have also supported the former president. Actress Rosanne Barr, a longtime conservative supporter of Trump, clapped back at Cuban's endorsement of the Harris-Walz ticket and called the VP pick ""another reason Harris is a disaster."" Rapper Azealia Banks last year said she would vote for Donald Trump in Novemebr and she appeared at a rally in Florida this summer. Actor Jon Voight has defended Trump on multiple occasions. 50 Cent's 2023 song ""Many Men (Wish Death)"" started trending online after the assassination attempt of Trump last month. The rapper responded by putting Trump's face on the cover of his ""Get Rich or Die Tryin.'"" While it's hard to call the response an official endorsement, he did appear to support the president in 2020 before apparently backtracking. Other celebrities who have supported Trump in the past, but not outright endorsed him yet this election season, include Lil Wayne and ""Happy Days"" star Scott Baio. Trump thanked Brittany Mahomes, wife of NFL superstar Patrick Mahomes, for her ""defending him"" after she lashed out at social media users who criticized her for liking several pro-Trump posts last month (Mahomes has not formally endorsed a candidate). At a rally in Las Vegas, Trump thanked reggaeton star Nicky Jam for his endorsement, but apparently thought he was a she -- saying: ""Do you know Nicky? She's hot. Where's Nicky?"" -- before correcting himself after Jam climbed to the stage, saying, ""Oh, look, I'm glad he came up.""

Notable names missing from the list of public supporters include billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who called the decision ""too important to rush."""

""There's no question the discussion around family life, childbearing and pronatalism has gotten a lot more popular and gotten media attention because of JD Vance,"" Brad Wilcox, the director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, told the Associated Press.

The total fertility rate in the United States fell to 1.62 births per woman last year, a 2% decline from the year before and the lowest recorded rate since at least the 1930s. Reasons for the declining birthrate are varied and plentiful -- women are getting married later and pushing off having children as they pursue careers and higher education; the rising cost of living has impacted the economic realities of starting a family; and the U.S. lacks affordable child care and universal paid family leave policies, to name a few. Both Democrats and Republicans have supported policies that encourage family growth -- Republican senators have drafted a plan for monthly cash benefits for working families and Vice President Kamala Harris has proposed a $6,000 tax credit to parents of newborns, for example -- though conservatives tend to be more vocal about the goal of boosting birth rates. Economists have warned that a declining birth rate, and aging population, could spell disaster for the nation's Social Security program -- without enough young, working people to counterbalance the number of Social Security dependents, the existing system isn't sustainable. The same is true of other economic institutions that need to continue to replace retiring workers with those of the next generations. Experts also say that a low birth rate demonstrates an overall decline in American stability -- people aren't expressing a desire to have fewer children, research shows, but they are more worried about the economic and social impacts that they are excited to start a family.

The United States isn't the only developed nation experiencing a decline in birth rates, and it's not the only one to be encouraging reproduction at the government level. France in 2023 had the lowest number of babies born in the country since 1946; the Japanese government has described the situation ""critical"" after years of a declining birth rates; and Italy's birth rate has declined more than 34% since 2008. Each country has implemented new policies to address the situation, including an Italian parental leave that can be taken until a child is six years old and Japan extending public insurance coverage to maternity expenses. Hungary's birth rate, once the lowest in the European Union, has started to increase over the last decade as the country implements policies like exempting women who have more than three children from income tax providing home buying and building subsidies that increase based on their marital status and the number of children per household.

Donald Trump, who made conservative appointments to the Supreme Court resulting in the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, has supported states determining their own abortion policies. Since Roe v. Wade was overturned, 20 states have banned or restricted abortion earlier in the stages of pregnancy than what was established by Roe v. Wade, according to The New York Times. However, the former president stopped short of supporting a national ban on abortion after being coy about the matter, saying in a Truth Social post this week he ""would not support a federal abortion ban, under any circumstances."" Melania Trump's stance on abortion was largely unclear prior to her memoir. The memoir will dive into details about the former first lady's private life, which she said in a video last month ""has often been the subject of public scrutiny and misrepresentation.""

ndustry watchers predict generative AI could lead to an administrative battle of the bots between doctors and health insurers over care decisions. That leaves patients in limbo without access to medications or other treatment while institutions duke out prior authorization and denial letters by fax, phone or algorithm. Warris Bokhari is trying to change that by putting the power of AI in the hands of patients.

Bokhari, a physician-executive who has worked at Amazon, Apple and Anthem (now Elevance Health), saw that large language models like GPT-4 could be useful to summarize information for patients at different reading levels. The idea behind Claimable, his startup that launched Wednesday, is to use these models to flip the script. Or in his words, to ""take a patient story and transform it into something compelling to an insurance company.""

The company is starting by partnering with rheumatology clinics, since many patients with conditions like arthritis are on expensive drugs known as biologics, which are often subject to prior authorization. For Bokhari, this fight is personal, his mom had rheumatoid arthritis, but because he grew up in England, his family didn't have to go bankrupt to afford medication.

While building in stealth mode, he found that health insurers are often issuing denials because the guidelines for certain diseases are significantly out-of-date. Bokhari said Claimable is prompting and fine-tuning GPT-4 with the latest clinical guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology, as well as all of the FDA labels and trial data for specific drugs, in order to generate appeals letters for a flat fee of $39.95.

After testing the tech and having it generate ""hundreds and hundreds"" of letters with a human-in-the-loop for quality assurance, the fully-automated software pilot phase has generated around 50 appeal letters for real patients with an 80% denial overturn rate, said Bokhari. Most cases have been resolved in under 10 days. With a seed round led by Walkabout Ventures (he declined to disclose the amount), Claimable is hoping to add more than a hundred conditions in 2025, for patients with multiple sclerosis, cardiac diseases, diabetes, obesity, asthma and certain cancers. ""We think we could achieve a lot just by getting the patients to be heard,"" said Bokhari.

Judy Faulkner, who founded electronic health records giant Epic in 1979, has bucked convention from day one, starting with the company dress code: ""When there are visitors, you must wear clothes.""

While competitors like Cerner (now Oracle Health), Allscripts (now Veradigm) and Athenahealth, grew by taking venture capital money, executing mergers and acquisitions, going public and then private again, Faulkner has eschewed any outside interference. And she intends to keep it that way. Faulkner told Forbes she has set a plan in motion to ensure that Epic remains private, independent and employee-owned in perpetuity with a unique trust structure.

Does Project 2025 Plan A 'Registry Of Pregnancies'?

Tim Walz claimed at Tuesday's vice presidential debate that the right-wing policy agenda Project 2025 calls for a ""registry of pregnancies,"" repeating claims he's made on the campaign trail -- but that mischaracterizes the conservative proposal, which wants states to report detailed abortion, though not pregnancy, information to the government.

Vice President Kamala Harris described Project 2025's proposal more accurately in her speech at the Democratic National Convention, decrying that Republicans want to ""force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions.""

In addition to monitoring abortions in a more comprehensive way, Project 2025's proposal also calls for the CDC to stop collecting data on gender identity -- part of a broader move away from the federal government supporting transgender rights -- claiming that collecting that data ""legitimizes"" arguments in favor of transgender rights ""and encourages the phenomenon of ever-multiplying subjective identities.""

Project 2025's policy agenda -- which broadly calls for a total overhaul of the executive branch if former President Donald Trump wins the election -- is overwhelmingly opposed to abortion, proposing a total focus by the federal government to push a pro-family agenda that rejects abortion rights. The agenda says HHS should be known as the ""Department of Life"" by ""explicitly rejecting the notion that abortion is health care"" and having a mission statement that protects Americans' well-being ""from conception to natural death."" Project 2025 broadly calls for restricting abortion, suggesting the Food and Drug Administration should rescind its approval of abortion drug mifepristone and the federal government should start enforcing the Comstock Act, a long-dormant 19th century law that would ban abortion pills and any abortion equipment from being sent through the mail.

It's unclear if Trump would take up Project 2025's proposals on abortion or other issues if he's elected. The ex-president has sought to distance himself from Project 2025 and its policy proposals as they've come under controversy, though he does have ties to the Heritage Foundation -- the group spearheading the agenda -- and could always take up its proposals if elected regardless of what he says while campaigning. Trump has said he wants to leave abortion up to the states and said he opposes a national abortion ban, but has not commented on any federal reporting of abortions in states where it is allowed. Vance, who has strong links to the Heritage Foundation, said only at the debate that ""certainly we won't"" create a ""federal pregnancy monitoring agency,"" but did not comment beyond that on any increased surveillance of abortions. Vance has called for banning abortion nationwide in the past -- even as he denied doing so at Tuesday's debate -- but has more recently said he backs Trump's view that it should be left to the states.

625,978. That's the number of U.S. abortions that were reported to the CDC in 2021, the most recent year for which data is available. The CDC already requests data including the pregnant person's age, state of residence, gestational age of the fetus, race, marital status, method of abortion and number of previous births and abortions, though Project 2025's proposals would add more data like why people got abortions and impose consequences if states don't report the data. The CDC's most recent data is from before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and states started banning the procedure, though reports from non-governmental organizations suggest abortion rates have actually gone up despite the restrictions.

Polling shows that most Americans are broadly in favor of abortion rights and the issue has historically galvanized voters since the Supreme Court's June 2022 ruling, with a series of ballot measures all breaking in favor of abortion rights and races in which abortion has been a big focus often breaking in favor of Democrats. Trump has tried to minimize the issue and said he now supports leaving abortion rights up to states after previously floating support for a national 15-week ban, and Vance, who previously touted his anti-abortion views on his website prior to becoming Trump's nominee, has downplayed them since getting on the ticket. The senator said Tuesday he acknowledges Republicans have ""to do so much better of a job at earning the American People's trust back on this issue, where they frankly just don't trust us."" Democrats and the Harris campaign have also used Project 2025 as a key argument against Trump, repeatedly pointing to its extreme proposals as a key reason for voters to oppose the ex-president and insisting he will carry out its plans even as Trump has tried to distance himself."
Collapse Of Reproductive Rights In America On Exhibit In Dallas,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chaddscott/2024/10/02/collapse-of-reproductive-rights-in-america-on-exhibit-in-dallas/,2024-10-02T14:04:32Z,"Artists from around the South brought together to share stories of a national healthcare crisis.

Tens of millions of Americans found themselves asking that question in spring 2022 when news leaked that the Supreme Court would be throwing out 50 years of supposedly settled law and overturning the Roe v. Wade decision guaranteeing women access to abortion nationwide.

Dallas-based curators Emily Edwards and Sara Hignite were among those in disbelief.

Is it Real? Yes It Is! (1969), the title of Juanita McNeely's multi-panel painting depicting her harrowing illegal abortion experience in the permanent collection and presently on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.

The feeling and artwork gave name to an unprecedented exhibition from Edwards and Hignite, the first organized and mounted in the American South directly addressing abortion access and reproductive rights. The pair has assembled more than 30 artists, most from or connected to the South-where reproductive rights have suffered their greatest assault-most representing marginalized communities-those most at risk from the politicians' and judges' anti-woman cruelties.

Like 28-year-old Amber Nicole Thurman, a Black woman from Georgia who died during childbirth from a preventable infection after being denied life-saving healthcare by the state's draconian abortion laws. Art curators work their entire lives hoping shows intersect with current events, capturing lighting in a bottle, drawing crowds and media attention. Not in this case.

In the case of ""Is It Real? Contemporary Artists Address Reproductive Freedom,"" it's ""ripped from the headlines"" feel represents tragedy. Ongoing tragedy. Needless tragedy.

""The United States is experiencing a reproductive care emergency across the board, and the worst states are in the South, and that's why this exhibition is based in the South,"" Hignite told Forbes.com. ""That's why we're featuring and focusing on artists who have connections to the southern states. If you look at the numbers, potentially every state in the South has a ban on abortion because you've either got total bans or six-week bans. We're living it every single day.""

""Is it Real"" opens at Lagoon Studio in Dallas (1105 Lagoon Drive, Dallas, TX, 75207) on October 5 and runs through October 26, 2024, nine days before Election Day in America.

The symbolism of debuting the presentation in Dallas-where Roe v. Wade was first argued in 1970 before reaching the Supreme Court in 1973-and in Texas-where dogma and control trump safety for pregnant women-is not lost on the curators.

""Is it Real"" examines strategies contemporary artists employ to address the topic of reproductive freedom. Leading with empathy and fact, and challenging often deeply rooted misinformation, the exhibition seeks to destigmatize and humanize reproductive care.

""By transporting people who are experiencing the show into so many different perspectives, into, quite literally, the shoes of some of the experiences, (visitors) are able to see how multifaceted this reproductive freedom crisis is,"" Edwards told Forbes.com. ""(The artists) help foster empathy by rooting (issues) in emotion and in beauty.""

That's what artists can do. They can't wave a magic wand and change laws, but they can change minds.

""Sarah and I both believe in the soft power of art,"" Edwards added. ""If someone comes in and they want to protest the work, they're likely not leaving being like, 'I'm going to vote blue,' but there's a softening that happens, and I think that's the hope for everyone who comes in here who is either on the fence, isn't sure, maybe is not an activist, maybe is just not informed on these issues. I've seen people soften, including my own parents who do not view this topic the same way I do. They've come to every show, and I see them soften, and I see them care, and I see them ask questions, and those questions turn into people changing their minds over time.""

Minds do change. Ballot initiatives related to abortion access nationwide since the repeal of Roe have overwhelmingly gone in favor of more access.

""I have had conversations with people who have started having conversations with family members and friends or people in their community who didn't believe in the right to abortion and maybe we're moving the needle now as they're hearing about this project,"" Hignite said. ""I don't want to overstate it. Obviously, this exhibition is not changing the landscape of abortion access in the country, but if we can just start cracking the window to the idea of coming around to believing in everyone's right to self-determination and bodily autonomy, then we will be so proud.""

While abortion access draws most of the headlines in the contemporary struggle for reproductive rights in America, it's not the only issue, nor the only issue approached in the exhibition.

""It's about the mortality rate of pregnant women, particularly Black women,"" Edwards said. ""It's about rape and sexual assault. It's about trans men who are also experiencing these experiences, and so having these different stories coming together in the show that really all interwoven to show how widespread this is, how this impacts everyone.""

Maternal mortality is on the rise in America. Black women, Native American and Alaska Native people suffer disproportionately. The South, of course, leads the way. Restrictive abortion policies have always gone hand-in-hand with higher maternal mortality. Not that anywhere in America can brag. America ranks 55 globally for maternal mortality, worst of any developed nation.

Broadly speaking, the U.S. is experiencing a reproductive care emergency. From proposed total bans on abortion-including in the case of rape and incest-to threats against birth control, Plan B, and IVF. Abortion access serves as the flash point for a frightening regression of not only reproductive care in America, a subject always impacting women more gravely, but also a frightening regression in how women are viewed, treated, and respected societally.

In November, 70 million or so Americans will vote for Donald Trump for president. He was found liable for rape. His running mate J.D. Vance has verbalized insulting, denigrating, dehumanizing opinions related to women across a spectrum of subjects over many years that would have been cringe-worthy in the 1960s. Comments that would have immediately disqualified a candidate for local office, let alone national office, just 10 years ago.

""Is It Real?"" exposes the harsh realities of the current political climate and envisions a more just country in which every human has the basic right to control their own body and determine their own future.

That hardly seems radical, but in 2024, in Dallas, in Texas, across the South, it is. An advertising poster for the show featuring a Guerrilla Girls Broadband artwork was banned from Dallas Rapid Transit rail stations.

That's why Edwards and Hignite chose to finance and present their project themselves, not in a museum.

""We didn't have to worry about any of the institutional challenges and bureaucracy,"" Hignite explained. ""We wanted to make sure that we could fully realize our curatorial vision, and we decided early on that the best way to do that was to do it independently.""

They've bootstrapped all the fundraising themselves, every penny, grass roots style. They've been supported by The Goss-Michael Foundation, ACLU of Texas, Texas Abortion Advocacy Network, and more than 100 individual donors. ""Is It Real?"" will also be raising funds for Texas Equal Access Fund and The Afiya Center, two Texas-based mutual aid organizations providing essential support to people needing reproductive care and related services.

Programming will include a film series organized in partnership with Spacy DTX; wellness workshops; panel discussions; Get Out the Vote initiatives; a resource library; and a reflection space organized by Make Art with Purpose. Admission to the exhibition and related programs are free and open to the public.

The collapse of reproductive rights in America and its resulting consequences represent a tragedy. In the face of tragedy and crisis and inequality and barbarity, artists make work. Curators bring that work to the public. The public's role is to vote."

Election 2024 Swing State Polls: Trump Tightens Race In These Two Harris Strongholds (Forbes)"
"As Healthcare And Politics Intersect, Doctors Urge Patients To Vote.",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/adairalandry/2024/10/01/as-healthcare-and-politics-intersect-doctors-urge-patients-to-vote/,2024-10-01T16:05:11Z,"Five years ago, a young woman with stabbing abdominal pain arrived at my emergency department. Her blood pressure steadily dropped as she developed pale, clammy skin. We told her, ""You are bleeding into your abdomen. We see blood on your ultrasound. We are worried you are having an ectopic pregnancy."" Within minutes, she was in the operating room getting a life-saving surgical procedure for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, a type of pregnancy that is considered non-viable for the fetus.

Remarkably, our pregnant patient survived. Yet, what stands out today is that the legality of our care, years ago, was never a concern. The team was centered only on providing the care she needed.

The Political Landscape of Healthcare

Today, the delivery of healthcare has become increasingly politicized. The recent overturn of Roe v. Wade reversed rights for pregnant people, leaving many vulnerable under recent state abortion bans. In states where exceptions for ectopic pregnancies exist within their abortion ban, women have still encountered hospitals that ""refused to treat their ectopic pregnancies."" This shift in regulation underscores the intersection of healthcare and politics, a reminder of how both physicians and patients should engage in the democratic process.

While a growing number of politicians have healthcare expertise, many lack a nuanced understanding of medical practice and healthcare delivery. This knowledge gap creates challenges when those who regulate medicine are not the ones providing it. ""Doctors and patients should be protected to make collaborative decisions -- without the intrusion of politics"" says Dr. Sharon Malone, physician, patient advocate, and author. The intertwining of politics and healthcare complicates efforts to address fundamental health issues. ""We haven't agreed on the most basic tenant: does everyone in this country deserve healthcare?"" she argues.

Aspects of healthcare influenced by politics extend beyond women's health. Insurance reimbursement, gun violence, criminalization of illicit substances, pharmaceutical cost-regulation are just a few active political issues that affect patient outcomes.

The Need for Voter Registration

As of 2022, there are approximately 162 million registered voters in the United States, leaving millions without a voice in upcoming elections. The journey toward change begins with voter registration. Politicians, like Elizabeth Warren, are working to streamline this process, recently announcing that patients filling out health insurance forms via HealthCare.gov will receive information about voter registration. ""The health of our democracy depends on Americans registering and exercising their right to vote,"" Warren stated.

In Minnesota and Pennsylvania, leaders have designated August as Civic Health Month to emphasize the importance of voting on healthcare. And yet, despite the clear push to increase patients' civic engagement, some critics -- including physicians -- oppose discussing voter registration in clinical settings.

Stanley Goldfarb MD, has been outspoken against doctors speaking with patients about voter-registration. He argues that ""leftists are making the doctor's office a major cog in their voter-registration and turnout machine."" Why the act of registering to vote at the encouragement of a doctor feels threatening or unwarranted is unclear to me, a physician who routinely witnesses the profound and direct impact politics has on patients. His organization, Do No Harm, states that they are focused on ""combating the attack on our healthcare system from woke activists.""

""Many believe that doctors should 'stay in their lane' and not become involved in the political process, as [patients] may see this as a conflict and not get care,"" Dr. Ayana Jordan, Associate Professor at NYU School of Medicine argues. She clarifies that our role is to be non-partisan and avoid swaying patients in our direction. ""Our role is to ensure that patients understand how to register to vote, make this process as easy as possible, and discuss issues most pertinent to them."" she adds.

Critics fear that doctors will abuse their power to sway patients towards their own individual political agenda. ""It's not just ""vote"". It is vote for Joe Biden, if we are honest. Inherently, the doctor's political bias is reflected in the encouragement. What happens if the patient's father is wearing a MAGA hat. Do you still remind them to vote?"" says one physician, Vinay Prasad MD MPH.

I do agree that physicians should certainly not impose their own beliefs onto patients. And that if they ask one patient to register to vote they should indeed ask all, when clinically appropriate. However, it is countercultural to see physicians grossly avoiding the empowerment and education of patients. A physician need only say, ""I'm sorry you can't afford your life-saving medication"" once for it to be clear there's no effective solution in that statement.

Why Clinicians Should Encourage Voting

In 2022, the AMA declared that voting is a social determinant of health. Dr. Alister Martin, physician, CEO and Co-Founder of A Healthier Democracy, a non-partisan organization that is determined to increase voter registration among patients, says that ""data demonstrates that across rural and urban regions, when voting rates are high, health outcomes are better."" While he believes the exact cause is hard to pinpoint, he suspects areas with high voter engagement are better able to pull in resources that help patients access healthcare. ""These communities have more specialty clinics, hospitals remain open, health centers are available. In the rural areas with less civic engagement, there are more hospital closures."" adds Martin.

Martin emphasizes that voting fosters a sense of agency among patients. ""Those who vote generally feel more empowered to effect change in their lives."" He also highlights a concerning statistic: 72 million eligible individuals are not registered to vote, a gap that can influence electoral outcomes and therefore healthcare related policies.

Encouraging voter registration is not only legal but also supported by leading healthcare organizations, such as the AMA. The encouragement should not be invasive, biased, or demanding. Martin advocates for integrating questions about voter registration into patient social histories, asking, ""Do you smoke? Drink? Are you registered to vote?"" He believes that by enabling patients to exercise their voting rights, we can all contribute to a healthier democracy."
JD Vance Vs. 'Childless Cat Ladies': VP Candidate's Views Explained Ahead Of Tonight's Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/01/jd-vance-vs-childless-cat-ladies-vp-candidates-views-explained-ahead-of-tonights-debate/,2024-10-01T16:04:55Z,"Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio is likely to be asked at Tuesday's vice presidential debate about comments he made denouncing Vice President Kamala Harris and others as ""childless cat ladies"" who don't have a ""direct stake"" in the country's future, which reflects a worldview that has affected Vance's policy views as he stands to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.

Vance will face off against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at Tuesday's debate in Philadelphia. The debate comes as the Harris campaign and Walz -- a cat owner himself -- have repeatedly highlighted Vance's ""childless cat ladies"" comments on the campaign trail. Walz has posted videos with cats and said when Taylor Swift endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, ""It's not as if I didn't warn these guys a few months ago: You mess with cat people, you will find out."" The governor attacked Vance for his comments even before he was named Harris' running mate in August, criticizing the senator for apologizing to cats instead of women for his comments and telling MSNBC, ""My god, they went after cat people ... It would be funny if it wasn't so sad.""

In comments to right-wing journalist Megyn Kelly about his ""childless cat ladies"" comments going viral, Vance said his remarks were ""obviously ... a sarcastic comment"" and he has ""nothing against cats,"" but defended his broader views. ""People are focusing so much on the sarcasm and not on the substance ... and the substance of what I said, Megyn -- I'm sorry, it is true,"" Vance said.

Vance's views that emphasize the importance of married families with children echo views espoused by the Heritage Foundation, a private right-wing organization with close ties to Vance that's recently come under fire for its 900-page policy agenda for a second Trump presidency known as ""Project 2025."" The Heritage Foundation has publicly called for ""encouraging marriage at the front end of a woman's childbearing years"" in order to increase the birth rate, and Project 2025 heavily emphasizes the importance of the nuclear family and imposing policies that strengthen it. The policy blueprint calls for ending ""LGBTQ equity"" initiatives and others in the Department of Health and Human Services and ""replacing such policies with those encouraging marriage, work, motherhood, fatherhood, and nuclear families,"" for instance, along with restricting abortion rights and eliminating federal healthcare mandates around contraception coverage. About the Heritage Foundation's proposals, Vance spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk told Forbes, ""The views of any outside group have zero effect on JD's policy positions -- full stop."" Vance's office also directed Forbes to comments Vance has made noting Project 2025 has no affiliation with the Trump campaign and saying he thinks ""there's some good ideas in there"" and ""there's some things that I disagree with.""

Vance's comments denouncing ""childless cat ladies"" have drawn widespread condemnation from the left, particularly from female voters. Actress Jennifer Aniston said in an Instagram post she ""truly can't believe that this is coming from a potential VP of the United States."" Addressing Vance, she added ""I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day."" Swift's post endorsing Harris was accompanied by a photo of the singer holding her own cat. Former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., also criticized Vance on X, saying she is a ""proud mom"" of stepchildren -- like Harris -- and she and husband Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., were trying to conceive through in vitro fertilization before she was shot in 2011. ""To suggest we are somehow lesser is disgraceful,"" Giffords said. While Harris has not commented on his attacks directly, her stepdaughter Ella Emhoff posted an Instagram story saying, ""How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I,"" referring to her brother. ""I love my three parents,"" she added. Harris also garnered a significant amount of high-profile support from female voters in her campaign's opening days as Vance's comments first went viral, with more than 100,000 women joining a Zoom call Thursday to support the Harris campaign and fans of Taylor Swift mobilizing for the vice president.

How Vance's policy views would actually affect a potential Trump presidency. The vice presidential candidate is likely to fall in line with Trump's chosen policy agenda, and the ex-president has publicly espoused more moderate positions than Vance on issues like abortion, calling for the issue to be left up to the states. (Abortion rights advocates believe he may take harsher action if elected, however.) Trump has also publicly distanced himself from Project 2025 and its more extreme proposals, though many involved with his first presidential administration helped author the policy agenda.

Trump named Vance as his vice presidential candidate on July 15 as the Republican National Convention was underway, siding with allies like son Donald Trump Jr., who had pushed for Vance to be the nominee over more moderate choices like Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. Vance was elected to the Senate in 2022 and was previously best known as the author of memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy."" He notably spoke out against Trump in the 2016 election before he ultimately claimed his views had changed and he now strongly supports the ex-president. Trump's selection of Vance has come under increasing scrutiny as his more extreme views have gone viral and as President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and Harris replaced him, shaking up a contest that polling previously suggested could go more easily for Trump. The vice presidential candidate has struggled in the polls, with a FiveThirtyEight analysis finding he is the least popular non-incumbent vice presidential nominee since at least 2004, and The Hill reported even some House Republicans denounced him as Trump's running mate."

Vance told The New York Times in February that his populist economic vision can be described as ""applying as much upward pressure on wages and as much downward pressure on the services that the people use as possible."" The senator said he supports raising the minimum wage as an incentive to get workers back in the workforce -- and has co-sponsored legislation to raise it -- and other government intervention to boost industries, like providing subsidies or tax credits. He does not support more stringent government regulations on private businesses, however, telling The Times that to boost the economy, ""there's a lot you can do on the regulatory side -- make building nuclear facilities easier, make building natural gas pipelines easier, make building housing easier -- that doesn't cost money and in fact brings in money."" Vance also supports tariffs that impose taxes on foreign goods, saying that while that can result in higher prices, ""when you are forced to do more with your domestic labor force, you have all of these positive dynamic effects."" He told The Times that while he wouldn't want to raise taxes on middle class Americans, he isn't necessarily opposed to raising taxes on the wealthy, but asked, ""How much revenue does that actually raise?"" Vance is also a big proponent of cryptocurrency, holding bitcoin himself and drafting legislation that would help the cryptocurrency industry.

Vance told The Times he supports Social Security, saying, ""I don't know why people think that you solve many problems by taking a bunch of elderly people and saying, 'You're on your own.'"" The senator suggested he believes in raising more money for the program through a combination of tariffs and bolstering the American labor force, arguing that if more Americans are working rather than relying on public assistance, it would mean more money can go toward Social Security.

Vance has been widely criticized for his views on abortion. In 2022 he said he ""certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally"" and opposed the idea that pregnant people could simply cross state lines to obtain an abortion if the state where they reside banned the procedure. He has also compared abortion to slavery, saying in 2021, ""While the people who obviously suffer the most are those subjected to it, I think it has this morally distorting effect on the entire society."" The senator was part of a broader group of GOP lawmakers who asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to enforce the Comstock Act in 2023, a long-dormant law from the 19th century that would ban the mailing of anything related to abortion. While the letter specifically asked to stop the mailing of abortion pills, experts have suggested the law could be interpreted more broadly to ban the mailing of abortion-related equipment altogether, which would effectively ban the procedure in practice by ensuring physicians can't get the necessary materials to perform it. Vance has more recently downplayed his former support for restricting abortion and endorsed Trump's view of leaving the issue up to the states.

Vance has echoed Trump in calling for mass deportations of immigrants from the U.S. and criticized the Biden administration for allowing an influx of undocumented immigrants. He also helped spread false rumors against Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, and disapproved of the Biden administration extending temporary legal protections to Haitian migrants. The senator has denounced using immigrants for cheaper labor in the U.S., saying business owners should instead increase incentives to lure American workers.

Vance has perhaps garnered the most attention for his attacks on childless Americans, with comments resurfacing from 2021 in which he complained about Democrats being ""childless cat ladies"" who ""want to make the rest of the country miserable too"" and don't have a ""direct stake"" in the country's future. While Vance has claimed his comments were a joke, they do reflect his broader views, as the senator has pushed policies that would incentivize people to have children and benefit families. He has suggested there should be a higher tax rate for childless adults and even said in 2021 parents should have more voting power than voters without children, and has touted a policy in Hungary that provides loans to married couples and then forgives those loans if the couple has children. Vance has supported ""universal childbirth"" policies that would provide healthcare coverage for childbirth, though he has opposed ""universal childcare"" proposals, which he said in 2021 are a ""massive subsidy to the lifestyle preferences of the affluent over the preferences of the middle and working class."" He has also supported expanding child tax credits for low-income families, but has been criticized for missing a Senate vote on the issue. The senator made comments in 2021 suggesting he was against no-fault divorce -- though he did not explicitly call for repealing it -- claiming that ""children suffered"" because of more relaxed views around divorce and calling for a return to viewing marriage as ""sacred"" in order to preserve American families.

Vance has deep ties to the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank spearheading the controversial Project 2025 policy agenda proposing an extreme overhaul of the executive branch should Trump win the election. The senator authored the introduction to Heritage president Kevin Roberts' forthcoming book -- which calls for a ""second American Revolution"" and says ""it's time to circle the wagons and load the muskets"" -- and has long been allied with the organization, with Roberts telling Politico in March Vance is ""absolutely going to be one of the leaders -- if not the leader -- of our movement."" Prior to joining Congress, Vance penned the introduction to a Heritage Foundation report that endorses many of the policies also mentioned in Project 2025, promoting heterosexual nuclear families and decrying abortion and public assistance programs. He has also expressed support for a key pillar of the Project 2025 agenda, which calls for replacing career civil servants with political appointees. Vance has not explicitly endorsed Project 2025, however, particularly as the Trump campaign has tried to distance itself from its proposals. He said in July, prior to becoming Trump's running mate, that he thinks ""there's some good ideas in"" Project 2025's policy blueprint, but it also has ""some things I disagree with.""

LGBTQ+ advocacy groups criticized Vance's nomination as Trump's running mate due to his record on LGBTQ+ rights. As a senator, Vance introduced legislation opposing transgender rights, authoring bills that would classify gender-affirming care for minors as a felony and ban ""X"" from being used as a neutral gender designation on U.S. passports. Vance also said in 2022 he would vote no on legislation to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, and has voiced support for policies like Florida's law known as ""Don't Say Gay,"" which restrict what schools can say about sexual orientation and gender identity.

Vance is one of the GOP lawmakers who has vocally opposed providing additional aid to Ukraine, and has come under fire for saying in 2022 that he ""do[esn't] really care what happens to"" the eastern European country. The senator called at the Republican National Convention for the U.S.'s allies to ""share in the burden of securing world peace,"" saying there should be ""no more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer,"" and told The Times in June the U.S. ""should be dealing with other countries based on whether they're good or bad for America's interests."" He criticized the Biden administration's Ukraine policy to The Times, saying the U.S. was not sufficiently working to deter China from invading Taiwan because ""we're sending all the damn weapons to Ukraine,"" though also acknowledged that handling the situation in Ukraine means ""there's going to have to be some American security assistance over the long term."" Vance also agreed that Russia gaining control of Ukraine is ""is not in our interest."" The senator has expressed strong support for Israel in its war against Hamas, saying at a rally on Saturday that his peace plan is ""elect Donald Trump"" and suggesting he aligns with Trump's view that ""the only way to get to peace is to destroy Hamas and let Israel finish the job.""

Vance's views stand in stark contrast to Democratic rival Walz, who has championed progressive policies including abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights and opposing climate changes. Walz is a gun owner but is strongly in favor of gun control measures like universal background checks and banning bump stocks, in contrast to Vance, whom the National Rifle Association described as ""a true Second Amendment champion"" and has opposed gun control reforms. As governor of Minnesota, Walz has signed bills into law that include free meals for school children, expanded protections for workers, restoring voting rights for the formerly incarcerated, climate change initiatives and legalizing marijuana, among other measures. Like Vance, Walz supports expanding the child tax credit, and he helped enact a nation-leading $1,750 tax credit in Minnesota after a federal tax credit expired. Walz's administration also eliminated many beneficiaries' income taxes on Social Security benefits, which Trump has also called for.

While Vance's economic philosophy has a strong emphasis on bolstering the American worker, the senator has come under fire from the left for his mixed record on supporting labor unions. Though Vance made headlines for visiting striking United Auto Workers union members on the picket line, the senator opposed the PRO Act that would have strengthened protections for unionized workers and codified the collective bargaining process. He told Politico in March that he opposed the legislation in part because he favors a system where industries negotiate union deals, rather than individual workplaces or companies, and because he ""think[s] it's dumb to hand over a lot of power to a union leadership that is aggressively anti-Republican.""

Vance has reached across the aisle for several of his efforts in Congress, working with Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, on a bill to improve rail safety standards after the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on legislation regarding banking regulations. The vice presidential candidate told Politico in March that his wariness of big corporations often aligns him with progressive Democrats even as he disagrees with them on other issues, saying, ""If you look at the people that I've worked with most successfully, it's people who, even though they're from the left, recognize that something's pretty fundamentally broken about American society."" Warren, for example, is ""at least thinking deeply about what's going on in the country and why things seem to be going off the rails,"" Vance said. In his June interview with The Times, Vance said ""Bernie Bros"" are the group on the left ""whose politics I'm open to,"" while criticizing ""center-left liberals who are doing very well,"" arguing them and their center-right counterparts ""have an incredible blind spot about how much their success is built on a system that is not serving people who they should be serving.""

34.7%. That's the average number of U.S. adults who have a favorable view of Vance as of Monday, according to a compilation of polls by FiveThirtyEight, versus 45.7% of Americans who have a negative view of him. Polling suggests the Ohio senator is the least popular non-incumbent vice presidential candidate in at least the past 20 years, according to FiveThirtyEight."
A Faux 'October Surprise' -- How Misinformation Could Upend The Election,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/01/a-faux-october-surprise-how-misinformation-could-upend-the-election/,2024-10-01T14:08:23Z,"As we head into the final weeks before Election Day, the political campaigns are likely bracing for an unexpected ""October Surprise"" that could influence voters and impact the results. The term was first coined by William Casey, who served as campaign manager for Ronald Reagan during the 1980 presidential campaign, yet, there have been October election-upending events going back to the 19th century.

What Casey and his predecessors likely never expected was how misinformation -- and even disinformation -- could be employed to sway voters. Advances in technology like Deep Fakes, an overreliance on social media for news and information, and foreign actors who seek to undermine confidence in our elections have created a perfect storm for such a nightmare scenario.

Nearly eight years ago, a video of then-candidate and now-former President Donald Trump surfaced in which he bragged about grabbing women by their genitals. It was an ""October surprise"" that almost derailed his campaign. Four years later, Trump contracted Covid-19 and was forced to cancel a debate with then-candidate Joe Biden and stop all campaigning.

With just weeks to go until Election Day, there could be a similar surprise -- and perhaps even a made-up one. Yet, the consequences could be huge.

""When Hillary Clinton recently warned Kamala Harris about the threat of an October surprise, she knew what she was talking about. Remember James Comey, just 11 days before the 2016 election? That turned out to be a nothing burger -- and Comey was rebuked in subsequent investigations for his actions. Or Pizzagate? That, too, turned out to be false,"" said Susan Campbell, distinguished lecturer in the College of Arts & Sciences at the University of New Haven.

""This year, voters must be on guard for the biggest threat to a free and fair election: Misinformation. They must steel themselves against lies and distortions, particularly on social media,"" added Campbell. ""Recently, an army of bots and trolls took to X(witter) to say that the federal government had not done enough to help the people harmed by Hurricane Helene, which was false.""

The spread of misinformation and disinformation during an election season isn't new and actually dates back to the country's founding. Smithsonian magazine previously reported how in the 1800 election Thomas Jefferson engaged in a ""smear campaign against then-president John Adams,"" which ""climaxed with an unexpected October broadside."" The late-season attack, carried out by Alexander Hamilton -- a critic of Adams and who went on to be Jefferson's VEEP -- remains one of the earliest examples of an effective late-campaign attack on a political rival.

During the 1840 election, rumors circulated that the Whig Party had paid residents of Pennsylvania to cross state lines and cast votes in New York during the 1838 election. There was no basis that this occurred, but people believed it -- just as some today believe illegal immigrants can head to the polls to sway the election results.

It was also 100 years before William Casey coined the term ""October Surprise"" that a disinformation campaign almost impacted the presidential election results.

The New York Truth newspaper published a forged letter on October 20, 1880, allegedly written by Republican candidate James Garfield voicing support for Chinese immigration at a time when many white Americans were opposed to Chinese immigration over fears that they were stealing jobs from American workers. In truth, both campaigns were in favor of immigration restrictions. Garfield went on to win the election by a narrow margin, but there has been speculation if the forged letter was released a little earlier the situation could have been different.

Misinformation/disinformation has clearly existed for a while, but social media could impact how it reaches the masses.

""The World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report highlights that the primary risk for 2024 is the use of misinformation and disinformation by malicious actors to disrupt society and further polarize communities,"" warned

Craig Barkacs, professor of business law and ethics in the MBA programs at the Knauss School of Business at the University of San Diego.

The October surprise may no longer be a single event or revelation. We could already see many at work, with misinformation already circulating about Senator JD Vance and his couch, and Governor Tim Walz supporting post-birth abortions.

But users of social media should be on guard for even more misinformation and disinformation in the coming weeks.

""There may be several October surprises in the works,"" said Barkacs. ""For most individuals, these may not make a significant difference as their opinions are already formed. For a small percentage, however, these surprises could be pivotal. The presidential elections of 2016 and 2020 illustrate how a tiny fraction of votes in crucial swing states can determine the outcome.""

Artificial intelligence may offer the ability to micro-target voters on social media while being strategically timed and aimed at a particular audience to help alter the results of the election.

""These micro-targeted voters are likely to be low-information voters, who are more susceptible to misinformation. These individuals, often unaware of the broader context, are the first to believe and spread unfounded stories,"" Barkacs continued. ""Research indicates that micro-targeting specific groups can influence voting behavior. We should be concerned about just what impact a deviously concocted October surprise could have on the outcome of the election.""

The most effective way to combat misinformation and disinformation is to ensure that we have a well-informed electorate, and that could users offering direct responses to the more outlandish commentary spread on the social networks.

""This go-round, there can be no passivity,"" suggested Campbell. ""For the good of the election, voters must find and amplify the truth -- to, in effect, shout down the trolls."""
California Sues Catholic Hospital For Refusing To Provide Abortion To Save Patient's Life,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/09/30/california-sues-catholic-hospital-for-refusing-to-provide-abortion-to-save-patients-life/,2024-09-30T20:44:25Z,"The state of California sued a Catholic hospital for refusing to provide an emergency abortion to a patient whose pregnancy had been deemed nonviable in accordance with what Attorney General Rob Bonta called a ""draconian"" policy that he says violates state law.

""It is damning that here in California, where abortion care is a constitutional right, we have a hospital implementing a policy that's reminiscent of heartbeat laws in extremist red states,"" Bonta said in a statement, to which he added, ""abortion care is healthcare.""

Nearly two dozen US states have banned or severely restricted access to abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act still requires hospitals to offer abortions in emergency situations, but the Center for Reproductive Rights advocacy organization has said doctors in restrictive states still hesitate to perform the procedure out of fear they'll be prosecuted. In California, abortion is legal through the age of fetal viability (usually between 24 and 26 weeks of pregnancy)."

The controversial law has been facing legal challenges for years. In November 2022, months after it went into effect, McBurney ruled the ban was unconstitutional when it was signed into law because Roe v. Wade had not yet been overturned, and reversed it. About a week after that decision, the Georgia Supreme Court reinstated the ban temporarily, granting the government's request to pause McBurney's order while they appealed it. Then, nearly a year later in October 2023, the Georgia Supreme Court upheld the abortion ban, finding it did not violate the U.S. constitution in 2019 -- though the court focused on the procedural question and did not consider whether abortion was constitutional, meaning the case was sent back to the lower court to answer that question. The case was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Georgia, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the Center for Reproductive Rights and Georgia-based law firms on behalf of SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective and other women's health care providers.

JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Democratic vice presidential candidate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will debate Tuesday on CBS in their first faceoff and what could be the final debate of the 2024 presidential campaign.

Tuesday, Oct. 1 at 9 p.m. ET on CBS News from the network's studios in Philadelphia, without a live audience. The debate will be broadcast by all CBS local affiliates, simulcast by most major networks and available for live-streaming on the websites of most major news networks.

The candidates will have two minutes to answer questions during the 90-minute debate, two minutes to respond and one minute for additional rebuttals. There will be no opening statements and the candidates will each have two minutes for closing statements. Vance won the coin toss to give the final word. Candidates will not be given questions in advance, nor will they be allowed to interact with campaign staff or have pre-written notes during the debate.

""CBS Evening News"" anchor Norah O'Donnell and ""Face the Nation"" moderator and chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan.

Neither an agreement nor a proposal for a second debate has been made public.

Harris immediately challenged Trump to a rematch at the conclusion of their first debate earlier this month, but Trump has said he won't debate her again, insisting Harris only wants a rematch because he ""won"" the first faceoff.

More Americans view Walz favorably (39% vs. 34%) than they do Vance, and more say Walz is qualified to serve as president if necessary than Vance (35% versus 30%), according to a September Pew Research survey of U.S. adults.

Vance, a former Marine and Iraq war veteran, seized on criticism of Walz's military record soon after Walz's entrance into the race, accusing him of ""stolen valor."" Walz, for years, has faced allegations from some of his fellow guardsmen of retiring from the National Guard to avoid being deployed to Iraq, though others who served alongside Walz have defended him and said he had discussed retiring to run for Congress months before his unit's deployment was announced. Republicans have labeled both Harris and Vance as far-left, and have coined the nickname ""Tampon Tim"" for Walz, in reference to a law he signed as governor requiring menstrual products be available in restrooms used by students in grades 4-12 in public schools to ensure transgender students have access to them.

Vance has faced a string of controversies since joining Trump's ticket. Resurfaced comments he made in 2021 about ""childless cat ladies"" running the Democratic Party drew widespread scrutiny, and he is widely credited with amplifying the baseless claim that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, were abducting and eating residents' house pets, leading to increased threats of violence in Springfield. Walz has repeatedly referred to Vance and Trump as ""weird"" throughout the summer, popularizing the attack line among Democrats. And Harris' campaign has cited Vance's prior public comments in support of making abortion illegal nationwide, as Trump and Vance seek to distance themselves from the idea.

Trump tapped Vance as his running mate in July at the start of the Republican National Convention. Harris chose Walz about three weeks after launching her own campaign on July 21 when President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. Both hail from the Midwest and are relatively new to the national political scene. Vance was first elected to public office in the 2022 midterm, and Walz was relatively unknown to voters on a national level prior to him joining Harris' ticket.

It's a version of the weekly Under 30 newsletter and would be even better in your inbox.

Big Sean was 11 years old when he started dreaming of making it big in music. He wanted to be the Black artist that would represent his hometown of Detroit. And with Grammy nominations and seven BET awards, he says he stands proud today.

But what did it take? A long battle with his mental health, he told the audience at the 2024 Forbes Under 30 Summit this week, where he detailed his journey of using Adderall and losing himself to the momentum of the industry. ""I was so addicted to the music industry that I didn't even realize what I was into anymore,"" Big Sean said. ""I had to step away from everything, from music, from all the obligations I had. I just had to rediscover who I was.""

This year's Under 30 Summit, which kicked off Sunday, explored themes of vulnerability and lessons learned -- translating into invaluable advice for the audience members who came to Cincinnati, Ohio from 66 different countries and 44 U.S. states. Speakers from across different sectors of business and entertainment took the Under 30 stage on Monday and Tuesday after a Sunday night music festival featuring performances from singer-songwriter Shaboozey, DJ and producer Metro Boomin and Cincinnati-native DJ Xandra.

The record-producing star Metro advised all the young people in the crowd to make the most of their 20s: To surround themselves with like-minded individuals and hustle every single day, but to do it with patience. ""Stay down, stay patient,"" he said to the twentysomethings. ""Look at it like you're a piggy bank. Keep depositing, keep depositing, keep depositing.""

Business legends like former American Express CEO Ken Chenault and Ken Frazier, the former chairman and CEO of Merck, talked about how leaders focus on the people and not the money. Rare Beauty chief marketing officer Katie Welch and fellow panelist Robyn Delmonte, A.K.A. GirlBossTown on social media, lent their marketing genius: They both emphasized how the most successful brands will build a community that tells them their next big move.

The Summit also featured talks from creators like Drew Afualo, Bobbi Althoff, Dani Austin and billion-dollar advice from high net-worth individuals like Josh Harris and Ankur Jain, among many more icons. Other than taking home a notebook's worth of thoughts to reflect on, attendees also enjoyed experiences like book signings with Forbes Top Creator Afualo and poet Rupi Kaur, a live recording of Althoff's The Really Good Podcast, city-wide tours of Cincinnati and the first ever Women in Sports Summit hosted by ForbesWomen publisher and president Moira Forbes.

We can't do four days of experiences, learning and networking justice without a larger word count on this newsletter, but you can read about it all in our live blog here. And yes, we're already gearing up for next year's Under 30 Summit in Columbus, Ohio. See you there?!

Women with unwanted pregnancies are turning to one another for pills and herbal remedies on Facebook. Forbes found nearly 800 groups and pages (across 76 countries), and at least 300 of the groups operate in countries where abortion is at least sometimes illegal. But many of the group members say they are getting scammed instead of supported.

-Once on track for Forbes' Billionaires list, record-making producer Sean 'Diddy' Combs is facing a long and growing list of allegations that have reduced his empire to rubble. Over the last two decades, he'd expanded his businesses across lifestyle categories like the Sean John fashion and fragrance lines, a C√Æroc vodka partnership with British spirits conglomerate Diageo and founded the Revolt TV network, earning nearly a billion dollars. But Forbes took a look inside the rise (and recent fall) of his empire. (Forbes)

-More than four years after we were sent home for Covid lockdowns, countless companies are still determining what makes the most sense for their workforce. Amazon, along with multiple tech firms, recently announced it wants workers back in the office five days a week starting in the new year. So much for the life of a digital nomad. (Forbes)

-We can all relate to asking a question to a chatbot and getting back an answer that, well, doesn't make any sense. Sometimes it doesn't actually address the question at all, while other times the bot will contradict itself or change its mind halfway through. But OpenAI is attempting to create a more intelligent, and intentional, LLM. Nicknamed ""Strawberry,"" its latest o1 model will use a ""think, then answer"" approach to responding to prompts and allegedly ""performs similarly to Ph.D. students on challenging benchmark tasks in physics, chemistry, and biology,"" according to the company.

Sixty-two years after Sam Walton opened the first Walmart in Rogers, Arkansas, its spectacular success has minted his eldest son as a centibillionaire.

Rob Walton became the first member of America's richest family to hold a 12-figure fortune, worth an estimated $100 billion. Shoppers have flocked to the budget retailer amid high inflation, sending Walmart's shares up 53% year-to-date.

Just 15 other people are worth $100 billion or more, including Elon Musk and Nvidia cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang. With Walmart's stock market tear, Rob's siblings Jim and Alice may soon join him in this elite club.

A Forbes review of Facebook found nearly 800 groups offering to connect women to abortion remedies -- at least 300 of which operate in countries where abortion is at least sometimes illegal, or even a criminal offense. But the groups are something of a double-edged sword, says Katy Mayall, the director for strategic initiatives at the Center for Reproductive Rights. While they may get some women help, they can be a gateway to scams and fraudsters and carry health and privacy risks for people in restrictive countries.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams was indicted on federal criminal charges by a grand jury Wednesday night, capping a series of federal corruption investigations against him and several high-ranking members of his administration. In a defiant video statement shortly before the indictment was reported, Adams said the charges were ""entirely false, based on lies"" and dismissed calls for him to resign, saying the people of New York ""elected me to lead this city, and lead it I will.""

Since the Federal Reserve's major interest rate cut last week, yields for 10-year Treasury notes, the benchmark for loans like mortgages and auto rates, have actually increased. Now expectations have shifted for the Fed to enact another big cut amid mounting evidence that the economy needs even more of a jolt.

Coinbase, the largest publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange in the world, has custody of 11% of all Bitcoin tokens. Now, Brian Armstrong, the company's chief executive and cofoun¬≠der, wants to disrupt his money machine -- the key to that pivot is Base, a system designed to improve upon Ethereum's blockchain by potentially speeding up transactions.

A Delaware court extended an order stalling Bolt founder Ryan Breslow's bid to raise $450 million, characterizing the deal as a ""prisoner's dilemma"" for investors. It's the latest snag in Breslow's ongoing bid to raise fresh capital for the struggling payments company, as three irate Bolt investors requested the halt on the Series F financing round -- including the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock.

The Senate voted 78-18 to approve legislation Wednesday to continue funding the government through December 20, narrowly averting a shutdown just five days before the deadline. The short-term spending deal still requires lawmakers to either hash out a funding deal or pass another extension in December, about six weeks after Election Day.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin (D-Md.) was the target of a sophisticated spoofing operation where a video caller used deepfake imagery to pose as a high-level Ukrainian official, according to multiple reports late Wednesday. In a notice reported by NBC News, the Senate security office warned lawmakers about an ""active social engineering campaign ... targeting Senators and Senate staff.""

President Joe Biden said he was not forced out of the presidential race in his first sit-down interview since his historic decision to end his campaign in July. Biden said on ABC's The View that he always saw himself as a ""transition president,"" but insisted he would have beaten former President Donald Trump.

The Israeli military is reportedly considering a ground invasion into Lebanon, amid an escalating conflict with Hezbollah that has killed hundreds and threatens to turn into a full-blown war. Late Wednesday, the U.S., France and several key allies issued a statement calling for an immediate 21-day cease-fire, noting that the conflict ""presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said he has not yet responded to the ""U.S.-French proposal"" and has ""instructed the IDF to continue fighting with full force.""

Since hedge fund Elliott Investment Management, run by billionaire activist investor Paul Singer, announced in June it had taken a $1.9 billion stake in Southwest Airlines, the carrier has made policy changes, upended its board and had its chairman resign. But it's apparently not enough: On Tuesday, the hedge fund announced it would call for a special meeting at Southwest Airlines ""in the coming weeks."" In a letter to shareholders, Elliott accuses Southwest's leadership of obstructing a leadership change with ""a chaotic series of defensive actions.""

TOPLINE Philip Morris International is rehabilitating nicotine's image with its wildly in-demand flavored Zyn pouches, embraced by celebrities, entrepreneurs and star athletes.

By the end of 2024, PMI, which owns Zyn manufacturer Swedish Match, expects to sell as much as 580 million cans of Zyn, a 50% increase over the 385 million sold last year. Forbes estimates that Zyn sales, which PMI does not break out in public filings, generated $1.3 billion last year (about 3.7% of PMI's $35 billion in total revenue) and could hit $1.9 billion this year.

Zyn is six times more profitable than PMI's cigarette division, says Bonnie Herzog, an analyst for Goldman Sachs who covers the tobacco industry. And unlike cigarettes, which have been steadily declining in volume for the last decade, Zyn is in hypergrowth mode. Shipment volume in the U.S. has jumped a staggering 238% since 2020.

But while pouches have successfully divorced nicotine from the cigarette, they still have health risks. Plus, the FDA has not authorized them for sale, although Swedish Match filed an application in March 2020. This means the products are technically illegal, but the FDA is allowing them to stay on the market while the agency reviews applications.

And at least five lawsuits allege that PMI is marketing Zyn to minors. ""Zyn is Juul 2.0,"" says Scott Schlesinger, a Florida-based attorney who recently filed a class action against PMI and Swe¬≠dish Match.

But Stacey Kennedy, head of PMI's U.S. operations, insists that PMI is marketing Zyn only to adults who already smoke or use nicotine. ""I think Zyn is proof that nicotine can be used [to replace] more harmful products,"" she says.

WHY IT MATTERS ""Zyn has become a runaway success for PMI. Its newest nicotine product will generate nearly $2 billion in sales this year, Forbes estimates,"" says staff writer Will Yakowicz. ""But the nicotine pouch is more than just a financial juggernaut -- Zyn has spawned its own culture online (also known as the Zynternet), with viral memes and celebrities touting the brand. And it has even entered the presidential election: Ohio Senator JD Vance has been photographed holding a container of Zyn, while on the other side of the aisle, Tim Walz levied a 95% tax on Zyn and other nicotine products as governor of Minnesota.""

Last week, the 2024 Lasker-Bloomberg Public Service Award was granted to married duo Quarraisha Abdool Karim and Salim S. Abdool Karim.The South African-born researchers began their work while both were at Columbia University in New York during the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. That disease wasn't the focus of their research at the time, but that changed quickly. ""HIV absolutely dominated New York in 1988,"" Salim told Forbes. And the two realized that the disease wasn't going to stay there. ""When we got back to South Africa, we committed ourselves to work on HIV,"" he continued.

Back home, their research led them to realize that preventing the spread of HIV meant empowering women to protect themselves. So they began their research into a wide variety of different types of prophylactic treatments that might help. They spent the next 18 years ""failing repeatedly,"" Salim said, while also through the years working on advocacy and education about HIV/AIDS to bring help to those who needed it and to find other ways to prevent its spread.

In the early 2000's, the pair turned their attention to tenofovir, a drug originally directed at herpes which was approved in 2001 by the FDA for treating HIV. The couple wanted to see if it might also be used to help prevent infection in the first place. After a years-long study, the couple presented the results that the drug could lower the risk of infection for women at an AIDS research conference in 2010. They received a standing ovation at the presentation of their results, and this work became the foundation for current HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (aka PReP), which has helped slow down the spread of HIV/AIDS throughout the world.

The Lasker Awards are sometimes called ""America's Nobel Prize"" - recognizing some of the most important advancements in medical science. Which makes receiving it ""humbling at one level, but also inspiring,"" Quaraissha said. ""Because what we're being recognized for is a combination of science, contribution to policy and service to humanity at different levels. I think it really gave more meaning to what we've contributed to date.""

In the ultra-competitive world of cancer medicines, Summit Therapeutics is a relative minnow. The 21-year-old biotech company has just 130 employees, no revenue and no approved drugs. But in the past two weeks, its market capitalization has exploded following positive news about its most promising drug candidate.

Shares of Nasdaq-listed Summit Therapeutics nearly doubled since September 6, lifting the company's market capitalization to nearly $17 billion. That has in turn made its co-CEO, Maky Zanganeh, with a stake just under 5% plus a slew of options, a new billionaire -- worth an estimated $1.1 billion. She's one of just 34 self-made U.S. women billionaires, and one of three American women to have made a billion-dollar fortune in the healthcare sector. The other two: Bio-Rad Laboratories cofounder Alice Schwartz and United Therapeutics founder Martine Rothblatt.

Neuroscience: The FDA has approved arimoclomol, marketed by Zevra Therapeutics as Miplyffa, for treating Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) in combination with miglustat. NPC is a neurodegenerative disease and arimoclomol is the first approved treatment for it.

Genomics: Synthetic genomics company Constructive Bio announced it raised a $58 million series A round.

Generative AI: Novartis announced a research collaboration with Generate:Biomedicines to leverage the latter's generative AI for drug discovery platform to discover new treatments for multiple diseases. Generate:Biomedicines will receive $65 million upfront for the agreement, which is worth up to $1 billion in milestone payments plus royalties from any approved drugs.

Radiopharma: Radiopharmaceutical company Telix announced that it's acquiring U.S-based RLS in a deal worth up to $250 million, pending regulatory and shareholder approval, which will give it access to the latter's network of 31 radiopharmacies in 18 states. This will be Telix's third acquisition of 2024.

Medical Tech: MedTech startup Route 92 Medical announced it's raising $50 million in a series F extension.

Cell Therapy: GC Therapeutics, founded by a group of researchers in George Church's lab at Harvard, announced its launch along with a $65 million series A that brings its total capital raised to $75 million. The startup will be focused on developing a new generation of cell therapies.

A Forbes review of Facebook found nearly 800 groups and pages across 76 countries offering to connect women to abortion remedies -- at least 300 of which operate in countries where abortion is at least sometimes illegal, or even a criminal offense. All told, the groups have nearly 1.8 million members. Forbes found that Facebook groups and pages selling abortion drugs were present in nearly every major region around the world, including abortion-restrictive population centers.

Seventeen groups and pages claimed to provide abortion pills to women in the United States, though it is unclear how many of them actually make the pills available. The largest, which has more than 117,000 members, directed users to an abortion-related URL that subsequently redirected to an adult website. The Facebook groups are something of a double edged sword: while they may get some women help, they can be a gateway to scams and fraudsters into the picture, and carry health and privacy risks for people in restrictive countries.

What If We're Not As Divided And Polarized As We Think?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/marymeehan/2024/09/25/what-if-were-not-as-divided-and-polarized-as-we-think/,2024-09-25T20:21:19Z,"As we get closer and closer to the election, the insults are getting more heated, and the accusations more shocking. And for those paying attention, the political polarization is stretching our emotional and democratic seams to the point of shredding. But are we really as divided as social and news media tell us we are? Or is the content designed to keep us huddled in our ideological bubbles and hating ""the other""? Studies are showing that we all agree on much more and share more values than we think, but we believe everyone else is wrong, convinced by the tiny minority that is the loudest, most outraged, and most convincing.

On September 23 Gallup reported that ""a record-high 80% of U.S. adults believe Americans are greatly divided on the most important values, while 18% believe the country is united. The percentage seeing the nation as divided has ticked up from 77% the last time Gallup asked the question in 2016. It is more than 10 percentage points higher than in prior 2004 and 2012 measures.""

It's depressing to learn that we feel that way about each other, that we don't understand how other people think and vote the way they do. But there's hope, as studies tell a different story.

Reality shows us something very different from perception.

Last April Axios posed this thought experiment, ""What if we've been deceived into thinking we're more divided, more dysfunctional, and more defeated than we actually are?"" They acknowledge that deep divisions exist but debunk many culture war assumptions that dupe us into making the other side the enemy. They report statistics around topics like Christian nationalists, abortion, college professors, support for Israel, and immigrants. They went on to cite that most Americans, Republicans and Democrats, agree on the right to vote, freedom of speech, press, and religion, and the right to privacy.

TIME recently reported on this same issue. A professor named Todd Rose conducted a study on how people ranked specific topics and how they thought other people would rank the same topics.

""When the results were tallied, the surprise was not that ""People have individual rights"" came in first, or that ""People have high-quality health care"" finished second. The surprise was the third highest priority: ""Successfully address climate change."" We know that's a surprise because, on the list of what ""other people"" considered important, climate came in 33rd. In other words, no one thought their fellow Americans saw climate as the high-priority item nearly everyone actually considered it to be.""

""Much of what news reports, politicians, and pollsters call polarization, Rose understands as ""learned divisiveness"" -- ¬≠division propagated by the assumption that it exists even where it does not.""

Another 2021 study in the Journal of Politics, found that when respondents identified someone they thought had a negative view, it was typically talking heads on a cable news show, not another regular person.

Market researcher, Diane Hessan's work adds to these findings. Her book, Our Common Ground: Insights from Four Years of Listening to American Voters, published in 2021, relates the findings from 500 voters over a four-year study. She found that ""An overwhelming majority of voters believe in commonsense gun licensing and regulation. They are pro-immigration. They believe climate change is real and the coronavirus is deadly. They care deeply about their families and are willing to work hard to make ends meet. And, they believe that Washington is slow, bureaucratic, and not working in their best interests.""

Path to Unity

With all these studies and insights there must be a way out of this negative spiral. It turns out the solution is up to us. We all need to consider the source of our information, listen more, drop the assumptions, and remember we share many of the same values and have a lot in common.

Here are a few suggestions from the experts.

- Axios posed this idea: ""In a given year, you meet scores or more people you spend enough time with to appraise their character. Think about them: How many do you think are decent, normal people who do volunteer work, help shovel after a storm, look out for family and neighbors?""

- Diane Hessan suggests: ""The path to healing our divided nation is both simple and profound. We must turn down the heat. We must begin to listen, to stop presuming, to try to understand, to treat each other with dignity, and to know that most Americans are not crazy radicals. We truly share common ground. If we can pull together, we can have a much better America.""

- The TIME article states that ""Fortunately, when people learn the truth about the other side, they feel better."" ""In so many studies, people register surprise that their assumptions about their rivals are wrong. ""They're like, 'Oh, I didn't know that,' and then they feel better about the other side,..."""
Inside Facebook's Scammy Abortion Access Network,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2024/09/25/inside-facebooks-scammy-abortion-access-network/,2024-09-25T12:29:34Z,"In hundreds of groups across the social media app, women with unwanted pregnancies turn to one another for pills and herbal remedies. Many say they are getting scammed instead.

a Facebook group of more than 8,000 strangers, Brazilian women plead for help.

""I'm 15 weeks pregnant I don't know what to do anymore. I tried the medicine at 8 weeks and it went wrong,"" says one message.

""I'm 9 weeks and 4 days pregnant. I've tried all the possible teas that I saw on the internet, and some of them really hurt. I already have two small children, and this one came from carelessness .... Time is passing and I am desperate,"" says another.

A third woman says she cannot afford abortion medicine, so she's seeking other remedies. A fourth says she spent the only money she had on a sale she now fears was a scam.

The group hosting these messages is called ""Safe Abortion -- Helping Women."" In Brazil, where abortion is illegal in most cases, nearly two hundred thousand women have joined similar groups devoted to buying and selling mifepristone, misoprostol and a variety of homemade remedies that they hope might terminate their unwanted pregnancies.

The groups are not for the faint of heart. Many feature photos of bloody sanitary pads and fetal solids, and many more feature cries for help from women fleeing abusive partners or fearing for the health of their existing children. Posts warning of scammers and fake pills are common, as are side-conversations about unprotected sex and contraception. Occasionally, a person opposed to abortion chimes in advising the women to consider adoption.

Brazil is one of many countries where women have turned to a muddied Facebook landscape to seek abortion care. A Forbes review of the platform found nearly 800 groups and pages across 76 countries offering to connect women to abortion remedies -- at least 300 of which operate in countries where abortion is at least sometimes illegal, or even a criminal offense. All told, the groups have nearly 1.8 million members.Forbes found that Facebook groups and pages selling abortion drugs were present in nearly every major region around the world, including abortion-restrictive population centers like Brazil (111 groups; >191,000 members), Kenya (50 groups, >111,000 members) and the Philippines (57 groups; >37,000 members). We also found them in Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Japan, Germany and Norway.

Seventeen groups and pages claimed to provide abortion pills to women in the United States, though it is unclear how many of them actually make the pills available. The largest, which has more than 117,000 members, directed users to an abortion-related URL that subsequently redirected to an adult website. The two admins for the group, one of whom sells live fowl in the Philippines from their Facebook profile, did not respond to interview requests. (Disclosure: In a previous life, I held content policy positions at Facebook and Spotify.)

Many of the groups have made use of a new Facebook feature that enables group members to post in groups as an ""anonymous participant,"" rather than under the name they use on Facebook. Of the group members selling, rather than seeking, drugs and remedies, many have taken other steps to disguise their identities -- which, if revealed, could threaten their safety and liberty. One private group in Brazil listed 10 admins, all of whom used apparently AI-generated profile pictures and four who listed their surnames as ""cyto"" or ""cito"" -- short for cytotec, the Pfizer brand for misoprostol. While some of the groups claim they are run by doctors, many are clearly not, and instead provide places for women to buy and sell pills and other products without a prescription.

Abortion bans don't make people less likely to end a pregnancy, but they do make it harder for them to do so safely. Katy Mayall, the director for strategic initiatives at the Center for Reproductive Rights, told Forbes that there are reliable websites where people can learn how to self-manage abortion and order safe, authentic pills. (She recommended Women Help Women, Women on Web, and INeedAnA.com.) But the Facebook groups, she said, are something of a double edged sword: while they may get some women help, they can be a gateway to scams and fraudsters into the picture, and carry health and privacy risks for people in restrictive countries.

One risk for people in these groups is that Facebook could be required to share their personal information with law enforcement. In August 2022, after the United States Supreme Court made abortion illegal in dozens of US states, Facebook was required to turn over messages between a mother and daughter to Nebraska law enforcement officials, who used them as evidence in prosecution of the women for their purchase and use of abortion pills to terminate a pregnancy. The daughter subsequently pleaded guilty to a felony charge of removing, concealing or abandoning a dead human body, and the mother pled to that charge and an additional one: performing an abortion beyond 20 weeks.

After the U.S. Supreme Court decision, Facebook began removing groups, pages, and posts between women trying to buy and sell abortion drugs. But ongoing policing of that activity has been tricky for the platform: many of the groups no longer refer to the drugs by name, instead using euphemisms like ""candy"" and ""caramelos.""

Facebook's parent company, Meta, does allow businesses in some countries to run advertisements for prescription drugs, including mifepristone and misoprostol, as long as the ads are not targeted to people under the age of 18. Advertisers promoting prescription drugs must provide evidence to Meta that they are properly licensed to sell them and must receive pre-approval before running ads.

Meta does not prohibit women from talking about their experiences self-managing abortions on its platforms, and in the groups and pages reviewed by Forbes, it appears the actual sale of drugs rarely happens on Facebook itself. Instead, sellers typically direct potential buyers to contact them on WhatsApp, Meta's encrypted chat service; ""DM me for candies"" is typical of this type of solicitation. When a person reaches out to the Whatsapp numbers posted in some of these groups, they'll sometimes get an automated welcome message asking for details about where they are located and how far along their pregnancy is.

One provider quoted Forbes with a range of prices between $80 and $200 USD, for various purported drugs and remedies. Women on Web, one of the websites that Mayall recommended, offers combinations of mifepristone and misoprostol for between 70 and 90 euros, depending on the patient's location.

When Forbes reached out to dozens of these numbers on WhatsApp, few responded after we identified ourselves as journalists. One provider we messaged said they were ""saddened to see the death toll from abortion in women."" Another person whose number had been posted in the groups said they weren't a provider, but they ""receive messages every day asking for remedies.""

Meta spokesperson Ryan Daniels said in a statement, ""We want our platforms to be a place where people can safely discuss the issues that matter to them, including topics around health. At the same time, we have specific rules and policies on buying, selling, or trading prescription drugs and protections to keep people safe from scammers, whether in health or other matters. We will take action against any pages and groups we find to violate our policies.""

In some groups, women ask and advise one another about how to end pregnancies with home remedies. While most of these remedies are harmless (though ineffective), some can lead to health problems. Several of the groups reviewed by Forbes contained advice recommending that women use a combination of over-the-counter medication and Coca Cola to end their pregnancies. The remedy does not cause abortion, but can cause vaginal infections and other health problems.

The groups are also filled with warnings about various Facebook profiles that either take money for pills they never deliver, or deliver medicine that is fake. One account -- an admin of several groups in Brazil -- made a series of formulaic posts that appeared to recycle the same desperate story of an eighteen year old woman seeking help as part of a scaled effort to reach other women in need.

In addition to claims of one-off scammers, Forbes also found evidence of larger, more coordinated efforts to reach -- and potentially deceive -- women seeking care. In Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, and other locations, a network of several hundred pages offers ""abortion kits"" using the same set of profile pictures, descriptions and phone numbers.

Some of the groups and pages specifically sought out women with difficult abortion needs -- like those who are 6, 7, or even 8 months pregnant. In a group for South Africa, where abortion is legal, one participant wrote: ""I was 6 months! Now I'm free after being scammed 3 times don't give up ladies."" Several other members of the group also mentioned having been repeatedly scammed, and ultimately terminating later-term pregnancies as a result.

Other groups speak specifically to teen girls who are not ready to become parents -- dozens of posts made by a group admin identifying as a doctor promoted a Zimbabwean service to its more than 800 members: ""Teens welcome & no parental consent."" The message was also included on the group's ""about"" page. Abortion is only legal in the country in cases of rape, incest, when the pregnancy threatens the life or health of the pregnant person, or if the fetus is at risk of serious physical or mental defects.

Groups for buying and selling abortion remedies have also flourished in South Africa, which -- unlike most other countries on the African continent -- has broadly legalized abortion. Of the groups analyzed by Forbes, 142 offered services in the country, with many promising hand delivery of pills or herbal remedies.

A recent post in a 39,000-person South African group read: ""Thank God I'm free but it's painful guys."" A thread of comments followed beneath the post, where others asked what method the original poster used, how to get care for themselves, and how much it would cost. More than 30 comments down, one user questioned the premise of the group at all.

""Just so you know guys the pills are free in hospital and it's safe."""
Here's What To Know About Next Week's Vance-Walz Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/09/24/heres-what-to-know-about-next-weeks-vance-walz-debate/,2024-09-24T16:12:20Z,"Republican vice presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Democratic vice presidential candidate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are set to debate next week in what could be the final faceoff of the 2024 presidential campaign.

Oct. 1 at 9 p.m. ET on CBS News. The debate will be broadcast by all CBS local affiliates, simulcast by most major networks and available for live-streaming on the websites of most major news networks.

""CBS Evening News"" anchor Norah O'Donnell and ""Face the Nation"" moderator and chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan.

It's unclear, but they could follow the same rules as the first two presidential debates, including muting candidates' microphones when they're not speaking and no live audience.

Neither an agreement nor a proposal for a second debate has been made public.

Harris immediately challenged Trump to a rematch at the conclusion of their first debate earlier this month, but Trump has said he won't debate her again, insisting Harris only wants a rematch because he ""won"" the first faceoff.

More Americans view Walz favorably (39% vs. 34%) than they do Vance, and more say Walz is qualified to serve as president if necessary than Vance (35% versus 30%), according to a September Pew Research survey of U.S. adults.

Vance, a former Marine and Iraq war veteran, seized on criticism of Walz's military record soon after Walz's entrance into the race, accusing him of ""stolen valor."" Walz, for years, has faced allegations from some of his fellow guardsmen of retiring from the National Guard to avoid being deployed to Iraq, though others who served alongside Walz have defended him and said he had discussed retiring to run for Congress months before his unit's deployment was announced. Republicans have labeled both Harris and Vance as far-left, and have coined the nickname ""Tampon Tim"" for Walz, in reference to a law he signed as governor requiring menstrual products be available in restrooms used by students in grades 4-12 in public schools to ensure transgender students have access to them.

Vance has faced a string of controversies since joining Trump's ticket. Resurfaced comments he made in 2021 about ""childless cat ladies"" running the Democratic Party drew widespread scrutiny, and he is widely credited with amplifying the baseless claim that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, were abducting and eating residents' house pets, leading to increased threats of violence in Springfield. Walz has repeatedly referred to Vance and Trump as ""weird"" throughout the summer, popularizing the attack line among Democrats. And Harris' campaign has cited Vance's prior public comments in support of making abortion illegal nationwide, as Trump and Vance seek to distance themselves from the idea.

Trump tapped Vance as his running mate in July at the start of the Republican National Convention. Harris chose Walz about three weeks after launching her own campaign on July 21 when President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. Both hail from the Midwest and are relatively new to the national political scene. Vance was first elected to public office in the 2022 midterm, and Walz was relatively unknown to voters on a national level prior to him joining Harris' ticket.

A number of the biggest names in Hollywood came out in support of Biden before he dropped out of the race, before turning their support to Harris. Olivia Rodrigo, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris by sharing a video of a speech the vice president gave promising to ""stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans."" Major Democratic fundraiser George Clooney, who used a New York Times essay to call for Biden to drop out of the race, lent his support to Harris and Barbra Streisand said she would support Harris because of her vow to fight for reproductive rights. Musician John Legend, who performed at the Democratic National Convention in 2024, posted he was ""so ready"" for a Harris presidency. Director Spike Lee, ""West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin and director Ken Burns hrew their support behind Harris, along with actresses Rosie O'Donnell and Jamie Lee Curtis. Robert De Niro, who narrated an advertisement for the Biden campaign, praised the president's ""selfless patriotism"" in a statement that did not mention Harris but said ""there is nothing more important for our country than defeating Donald Trump at the ballot box."" British pop artist Charli XCX brought Harris into the Gen Z fold by tweeting ""kamala IS brat,"" an endorsement that was met by Harris' team changing the background photo on her X account to the ""brat"" green color and using the same font used on Charli XCX's album of the same name. Rapper Cardi B, who in May said she wouldn't be endorsing Biden, tweeted ""AHAHAHAHA LETS GOOOOO I TOLD YALLL KAMALA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 2024 candidate...."" Pop musician Kesha said she plans to support Harris in November and, when asked how she felt about Vance, responded ""f -- - that man."" Beyonc√© has not made a public endorsement but did give the Harris campaign permission to use her song ""Freedom"" in a video of her first official visit to her campaign's headquarters, a rare approval from the superstar musician. Beyonc√©'s mom and businesswoman Tina Knowles endorsed Harris with an Instagram post. Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle and former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have also thrown their support behind Harris. Former President Jimmy Carter, 99, reportedly told his son last week he was trying to make it to his 100th birthday so he could cast his vote for Kamala Harris. ""Sex in the City"" actress and former New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon threw her support behind Harris and her Vice Presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, in a post that read: ""I'm Walzing on air!"" Billionaire Mark Cuban, who previously said he was committed to voting for Biden, has also supported Harris and endorsed Walz as her running mate, calling him someone who ""can sit at the kitchen table and make you feel like you have know him forever."" Actor Tony Goldwyn, Republican political commentator Ana Navarro, comedian Mindy Kaling and actress Kerry Washington each supported the Harris-Walz campaign by hosting one evening of the Democratic National Convention. Nick Offerman, Jane Fonda, Ben Stiller, Kathy Griffin, John Stamos, Ed Helms, Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz were among those who appeared on a ""Comics for Harris"" virtual rally via Zoom, which reportedly raised close to half a million dollars for the Harris campaign. Over Labor Day weekend, a fundraiser for the Democratic ticket in Southampton, New York was hosted by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and fashion designer Tory Burch, among others. Actors Matt Damon and Lin-Manuel Miranda will attend fundraiser in New York City in September -- for which tickets are listed at $25,000 per person -- to support the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket, Bloomberg reported. Actress Aubrey Plaza posted a photo of herself on Instagram holding Grumpy Cat -- the face of a famous meme -- with the caption ""HARRIS üá∫üá∏ WALZ. Mel Brooks said he was ""all in"" for the Harris and Walz ticket in a post to social media holding his dog, adding ""I don't have a cat, so a dog will have to do!"" Stevie Nicks did not name a particular candidate when she encouraged her followers to vote in an Instagram post this week, but signed her message ""Childless Dog Lady."" Billionaire pop star Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris in an Instagram post minutes after a debate between Harris and Donald Trump wrapped up, with a photo of her holding her cat that has since been recreated by several other celebrities. After declining to endorse a candidate in 2020, Martha Stewart said at the Retail Influencer CEO Forum she will supporting Kamala Harris in the election because she wants a president ""who doesn't hate New York"" and ""doesn't hate democracy,"" the Daily Beast reported.

Former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan ripped off his shirt while on stage at the Republican National Convention last month to reveal a Trump-Vance campaign shirt underneath, and called Trump his ""hero"" and the ""greatest president of the United States."" Musician Kid Rock has been vocal about his support of Trump in the past and at the RNC revamped his song ""American Bad Ass"" to include references to Trump. UFC President and personality Dana White called Trump the ""toughest, most resilient human being."" Rapper and reality TV star Amber Rose gave a speech at the RNC in support of Trump. Country music stars Chris Janson and Jason Aldean also appeared at the convention. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy in January said voting for Trump over Biden was a ""no-brainer."" Public-facing billionaires like Elon Musk and Steve Wynn have also supported the former president. Actress Rosanne Barr, a longtime conservative supporter of Trump, clapped back at Cuban's endorsement of the Harris-Walz ticket and called the VP pick ""another reason Harris is a disaster."" Rapper Azealia Banks last year said she would vote for Donald Trump in Novemebr and she appeared at a rally in Florida this summer. Actor Jon Voight has defended Trump on multiple occasions. 50 Cent's 2023 song ""Many Men (Wish Death)"" started trending online after the assassination attempt of Trump last month. The rapper responded by putting Trump's face on the cover of his ""Get Rich or Die Tryin.'"" While it's hard to call the response an official endorsement, he did appear to support the president in 2020 before apparently backtracking. Other celebrities who have supported Trump in the past, but not outright endorsed him yet this election season, include Lil Wayne and ""Happy Days"" star Scott Baio. Trump thanked Brittany Mahomes, wife of NFL superstar Patrick Mahomes, for her ""defending him"" after she lashed out at social media users who criticized her for liking several pro-Trump posts last month (Mahomes has not formally endorsed a candidate).

Notable names missing from the list of public supporters include billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who called the decision ""too important to rush."""
"In Florida, A School District Puts Books Back On The Shelves",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petergreene/2024/09/23/in-florida-a-school-district-puts-books-back-on-the-shelves/,2024-09-23T10:47:06Z,"Facing a federal lawsuit over their removal of 36 books from schools, the Nassau County School District reached a settlement agreement to return the books to library shelves.

The books on the list included works by Ellen Hopkins and Sarah Maas as well as works by prize-winning author Toni Morrison. Oft-challenged works such as The Kite Runner, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and The Hate You Give were on the list, as well as the children's book And Tango Makes Three, the true story of two male penguins who adopt a penguin nestling.

The board's action was picked up by local news in late January, and that local news story caught the attention of Tango authors Peter Parnell and Justin Richardson, who are no strangers to having their book challenged.

The challenge to the books was brought by the Nassau County Chapter of Citizens Defending Freedom. That chapter's executive director Jack Knocke said in February ""School districts that are breaking the law should be held accountable. In this case, we are very pleased with the cooperation and professionalism of the Nassau County School Board, who respectfully worked with us every step of the way to help protect our county's children.""

Citizens Defending Freedom was founded as County Citizens Defending Freedom in 2021. Jack Jenkins at Religion News Service reported that the inspiration came from hearing Rand Paul speak to a group of faith and business leaders meeting at Mar-a-Lago. The group also has names ties to other conservative groups, particularly the Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian conservative group that has exercised considerable influence in opposing LGTBQ rights and abortion.

CCDF started out in Polk County, where the group challenged 16 books as illegal in 2022. It soon expanded to other counties and states, changing its name to reflect its greater reach. In its IRS filing, CDF lists a threefold mission:

To equip and empower American citizens to stand for and preserve freedom for themselves and future generations. To resolve breaches of liberty through local awareness, local light, and local action. To educate the American citizen on the value of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and its influence on America's founding.

Founder Steve Maxwell is the CEO of a company that makes produce packaging, and most of the visible members of CDF are also Christian businessmen. One critic called them ""Moms for Liberty in suits.""

CDF Nassau has previous experience with the Nassau school board. CDF Nassau board member Rich Lamken was a ""regular speaker"" at board meetings and had pushed for a Citizens Budget Advisory Committee. The board resisted but eventually created the committee, giving it oversight of just 5% of the budget. They did not appoint Lamken to the committee. The headline in the conservative Citizens Journal Florida read ""School Board Selects Leftist Extremist Over a Qualified, Experienced Candidate for Review Board.""

CDF Nassau's request to remove the books could not have come as a surprise to the board. But Lauren Zimmerman, attorney for the Tango authors, says it came as a surprise to those outside the board. ""There was no public hearing. There was no real announcement about what was going on."" But when the news broke, the authors and several parents and students in the district filed suit in federal court.

The district had claimed that Tango was removed due to ""lack of circulation,"" but Zimmerman says that examination of district records showed that the book had been taken out by students, and that other books that showed no circulation were not removed. In a press release protesting the board's decision to pursue settlement, CDF doubled down on its challenge to the book:

Suggesting that children find their values from the abnormal animal kingdom behavior is manipulative and confusing to young minds. Values taught is school should come from the Judeo-Christian values ordained by God on which the United States of America was founded.

In the press release, CDF also objects to Ghost Boys, which promotes ""racial division, hatred, anti-police themes, and directs students to even more radical writings.""

The other books, argued CDF, were in violation of Florida statute 847.012, which broadly forbids exposing minors to any depiction of ""sexual conduct.""

The list appears to have been drawn from the website BookLooks.org, a site that highlights objectionable content in books; the site has been linked to many book challenges in the U.S.

The lawsuit charged that the school board used ""unlawful censorship"" to remove ""the children's book behind closed doors and without community involvement or comment"" in violation of Florida's sunshine laws. Zimmerman says the district has a book challenge procedure in place, but it was not followed in this case.

Shortly after the suit was filed, the school board centered negotiations to settle the suit, and soon after the parties reached a settlement. That settlement requires the board to restore the books, to refrain from making any future removals behind closed doors, and to acknowledge that Tango contains no obscene material.

Zimmerman argues that suit was important because ""it's a playbook that we're seeing"" in which some organization steps in and decides ""its views on what our children should and shouldn't read should rule the say."" Why would successful authors whose work is often challenged but rarely removed bother with this? Zimmerman explains, ""Freedom of information, the importance of education, diversity, and viewpoints that students can be exposed to those. It's just all very important. It's kind of the cornerstone of American education.""

CDF Nassau executive director Jack Knocke called the settlement ""a dark day for Nassau County Schools."" CDF called on Governor Ron DeSantis to remove the Nassau County School Board and Superintendent. They have also notified the Nassau County Sheriff, sharing district findings as evidence ""that they are distributing materials in violation of Florida's child obscenity laws."" Says Sarah Calamunci, CDF Florida State Director, ""We intend to hold them accountable.""

At this time, the school board has not replied to a request for comment."
We're Living In A Student Loan Land Of Confusion,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryancraig/2024/09/20/were-living-in-a-student-loan-land-of-confusion/,2024-09-20T13:01:12Z,"As the world's shortest and baldest rock star, Phil Collins has long been the butt of jokes. In the 2016 film Sing Street, a charming coming-of-age story of an Irish musician, the protagonist's older brother imparts this timeless advice: ""Trust me. No woman can truly love a man who listens to Phil Collins."" South Park portrays Collins as a cross-eyed villain who plays horrible music and flaunts his Tarzan Oscar at every opportunity; at the 2000 Academy Awards, Tarzan beat South Park for Best Original Song, prompting the show's caustic creators to remark that although they were prepared to lose, they weren't prepared to lose to Phil Collins. And when the diminutive drummer announced he had changed his mind about retiring, a Change.org petition garnered thousands of supporters for this proposition: ""Phil Collins must be stopped. There is far too much suffering in the world as it is.""

But the best Phil Collins joke was one played on him by his idol. Collins was a huge Beatles fan. As a 13-year-old, he was in the audience for the filming of the concert sequence at the end of A Hard Day's Night. So in early 1970, the 18-year-old drummer couldn't have been more excited to receive an invitation to play congas on a track for George Harrison's first solo album, All Things Must Pass. Collins showed up, met George, and played hard enough to raise blisters on both hands. But when the album appeared, Collins heard no congas, saw no credit, and received no explanation.

Collins and Harrison met a few times over the years but never discussed the session. Then in 2000, as Harrison was re-mixing All Things Must Pass, Collins bought the house of Harrison's friend, Formula One driver Jackie Stewart. Collins and Stewart got to talking about the upcoming re-release and Collins shared he was at the recording session but didn't show up on the album. A few days later, Collins received a package from Harrison with a master tape and note that read ""Could this be you?"" Collins pressed play and recognized the track. Then, Collins recollected, ""suddenly the congas come in - too loud and just awful."" Collins was mortified; the conga player was rubbish. Then at the end of the take, Harrison says audibly, ""Can we try another without the conga player?""

George Harrison had a wonderful sense of humor. When Monty Python lost funding for the controversial Life of Brian, George stepped up because he wanted to see the film (as Eric Idle described, ""the world's most expensive theater ticket""). He released a single where he's laughing through several verses, recorded the song Dark Horse while hoarse, and was an avid participant in the first great mockumentary, The Rutles, and subsequently annoyed Paul McCartney by repeating Rutles jokes throughout The Beatles Anthology. So as Stewart and Harrison subsequently disclosed, it's not surprising that the tape sent to Collins was a joke. After hearing Collins' story from Stewart, Harrison re-recorded the song and instructed the percussion player: ""Play bad, I'm going to record it and send it to Phil."" When it came to jokes, the Quiet Beatle was loudest of all.

In addition to being a good sport, Phil Collins deserves credit for a hit that accurately describes how tens of millions of Americans are thinking about their student loans. No, I'm not talking about Against All Odds or Sussudio. The song is Genesis' Land of Confusion.

With $1.59 trillion outstanding - nearly $40,000 per borrower - student loan debt has become a danger to economic mobility. But in the last 3 and ¬Ω years, through dozens of executive decisions involving various Federal Student Aid programs, the federal government has canceled over 10% of that balance: $168.5 billion. Nearly 5 million borrowers - also about 10% - have benefited from loan beneficence. President Biden's Department of Education (ED) has made fools of those of us who never thought federal bureaucracy could be so forgiving.

But that's not the only thing that's gone on in student loan land over the past 3 and ¬Ω years. Starting on March 13, 2020, ED paused all repayments and reset rates to zero. The Covid student loan moratorium was extended twice by the Trump administration, then seven successive times by the Biden administration. Mid-moratorium, President Biden's chief of staff bragged that ""Joe Biden right now is the only president in history where no one's paid on their student loans for the entirety of his presidency.""

Loan forgiveness and the repayment moratorium weren't wholly independent; the connection was made by ED itself. The explanation provided for the final extension to October 2023 - long past the Covid emergency's sell-by date - was ""it would be deeply unfair to ask borrowers to pay a debt that they wouldn't have to pay [when loan forgiveness is effected]."" So that's 3 and ¬Ω years of no repayments entwined with 3 and ¬Ω years of forgiveness.

Enter the increasingly Javert-like federal courts. Last year, in a widely expected decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the Biden administration's single biggest swing at loan forgiveness - $10,000 for borrowers making less than $125K, another $10,000 for borrowers who received Pell Grants, adding up to a number ($430 billion) with serious fiscal implications - required clearer congressional authorization by dint of being a major question. While the 9/11 HEROES Act did give ED the ability to ""modify"" student loan program rules, Chief Justice Roberts noted the proposed plan ""modified"" student loans ""in the same way that the French Revolution 'modified' the status of the French nobility"" i.e., abolishing it.

Hard upon last year's Supreme Court decision, ED indicated it would try blanket loan forgiveness again - this time based on the Higher Education Act. Meanwhile it had already established a second front: a new income-driven repayment program, the heroically named SAVE (saving on a valuable education). SAVE's terms are much more generous than any prior program at a cost the Congressional Budget Office pegged at $230 billion, or as the American Enterprise Institute's Michael Brickman called it, ""loan forgiveness disguised as loan repayment.""

But like a bad sequel, these borrower-friendly changes were blocked after a lawsuit filed by Missouri and six other red states resulted in same-day rulings from federal judges in Kansas and Missouri followed by an even broader injunction by the 8 Circuit barring changes to income-driven repayment and suggesting a lack of authority for any loan forgiveness under income-driven repayment. Now, in something of a fit of spite, ED is not allowing new enrollment in SAVE and has launched a brand-new moratorium for income-driven repayment participants.

Perhaps Chief Justice Roberts wouldn't have made a French Revolution joke about student loans if he realized millions of borrowers are as angry as their forerunners who stormed the Bastille. (As Phil Collins sang in Land of Confusion: ""I can hear the marching feet. They're moving into the street.) But they're not only angry; they're also really confused. Borrowers are telling media and advocacy organizations how confusing this all is and newspapers are running headlines like ""All so confusing"" and ""Loan forgiveness fighting is giving debtors whiplash."" But don't take my word for it. Just look at how the New York Times answers whether borrowers who can no longer enroll in SAVE or other income-driven repayment programs can stop interest from accruing. Better yet, don't - I assure you it's baffling (and also moot given the new moratorium).

Since no one knows how much they'll owe once this all shakes out, it shouldn't be surprising that nearly half of all borrowers are not making payments; Preston Cooper calculates the rate of non-repayment at nearly 60%. In the great tradition of setting a fire then pulling the alarm, Persis Yu, of the Student Borrower Protection Center, a progressive group that advocated for both loan forgiveness and the lengthy repayment moratorium, was quoted in the Times saying ""the nonpayment rate really is emblematic of a system that's not doing its job.""

This month's new lawsuit from Missouri + conservative confr√®res to prospectively block Big Swing II (pre-election blanket loan forgiveness premised on the Higher Education Act) aimed to keep the din to a dull roar. In their complaint, the states provided evidence that before publishing the final rule, ED instructed loan servicers to forgive loans and draft emails notifying borrowers. The point, apparently, was to spread the word quickly; even ED knows that forgiveness isn't forgiveness if it's done in secret. Missouri et al. argued that confusion would be compounded if millions of borrowers hear from servicers that their loans are forgiven only to learn that another federal court has countermanded that decision. A Georgia judge agreed and issued yet another injunction.

Speaking of injunctions, one of the few semi-coherent statements made by former President Trump in last week's presidential debate involved student loans. Although the context (abortion) was inappropriate and the analogy inapposite (inability to get congressional votes vs. winning in court), he wasn't wrong about this: ""they said they're going to get student loans terminated and it ended up being a total catastrophe... all these students got taunted... they taunted young people."" He should know; if anyone's an expert on taunting, it's former President Trump.

Our current approach to costly college tempered by loan forgiveness is a confusing combination of control and lenience: control in that - unless you're inordinately wealthy - you must take on debt to earn a degree and launch your career; lenience in that maybe you won't have to pay the debt. As such, financing higher education has caught up with the college experience itself. As UNC's Rita Koganzon noted in the New York Times, universities attempt to micro-manage campus life but don't hold students accountable for violating policies or laws. What's the result of this heighted control and lenience? ""A kind of simulacrum of adult independence that in reality infantilizes students and protects them from responsibility.""

With both the student experience and now its financing, higher education has followed in the footsteps of helicopter and snowplow parents who indulge their children through to adulthood then complain they're not independent. The answer must be greater independence. But the current cost of college is simply way too high.

There's only one way out: dramatically expand the supply of less expensive pathways to career launch. Pathways like industry certifications, bootcamps, and earn-and-learn options like work-integrated learning, internships, degree-apprenticeships, and apprenticeships. Then give students the freedom to choose. In this future state with a multitude of cheaper alternatives, if they take on debt to attend an expensive college, that's a choice they'll have to live with as independent adults. But as the current limited options - College or Chipotle - don't present a serious choice, we're only giving them a simulacrum of independence.

There's a second benefit as well. Loan forgiveness has been criticized by many as backward-looking policy. So much time and energy directed into trying to right past college wrongs - ""going back,"" as Vice President Harris might say, instead of turning the page and moving forward. If even a small percentage of these resources had been directed towards establishing and strengthening new pathways to career launch, the Democratic Party would have plausible deniability to the charge that it's the party of college elites. Particularly since, according to Brookings, ""the beneficiaries of student loan forgiveness would be higher income, better educated, and whiter than beneficiaries of [any] other transfer program.""

Are we about to start trying? Here's one positive sign. Last Friday Vice President Harris said this at a Pennsylvania rally: ""For far too long, our nation has encouraged only one path to success: a four-year college degree. Our nation needs to recognize the value of other paths, additional paths, such as apprenticeships and technical programs."" If the next administration spends as much effort on new pathways to economic opportunity as this one has on new pathways to student loan forgiveness, we won't need to try another without the conga player.

The most confusing part of our Land of Confusion is why we're not moving faster. Perhaps it's all a big joke. If so, it's a confusing one - and not nearly as good as the joke the Quiet Beatle played on the conga player."
Economic Concerns Are Top Priority For College Voters,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/meglittlereilly/2024/09/19/economic-concerns-are-top-priority-for-college-voters/,2024-09-19T14:55:54Z,"While much of the discourse about college voters has focused on campus war protests and reproductive rights, America's youngest voting block does not rank these as priority issues. If young voters turn out in high numbers on Election Day 2024, they will likely be driven by economic concerns like the cost of rent, food and college tuition. That's according to the latest analysis from The Brookings Institution, which synthesizes their ongoing research on this critical subgroup of the electorate.

""In short, young voters are experiencing a complexity of economic stress,"" according to the Brookings analysis. ""This includes a dramatic rise in the cost of rent and mortgages that has led many to move back in with their parents; a drastic increase in the cost of higher education that has saddled them with college debt; and limited job opportunities, even for those with college degrees.""

Gabriel R. Sanchez, a primary author of the Brookings paper, says that this is the extension of an underappreciated trend that's been simmering among youth voters for several years.

""Inflation was actually the number one issue for voters 18-29 in 2022, so this is not a new trend among this age group,"" says Sanchez. ""While more ideological issues like abortion are often talked about much more in the national media, young voters have been feeling the economic downturn and are voting based on the economy.""

He points to the results of the 2022 African American Research Collaborative Mid-Term Voter Election Poll which was an early sign of these emerging economic priorities. The findings are consistent with those of the 2024 Harvard Youth Poll and the 2024 Tufts Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement youth poll, both of which found inflation and cost of living as the top concerns among young voters this year.

Young voters are not a monolith, and not all attend college, but these trends appear to hold true among the subgroup of young voters who are currently in college. A 2024 poll from Young America's foundation found that economic issues outrank all social issues for college students, across party lines.

Mike Burns, national director of the Campus Vote Project, points out that, as the most diverse voting block in the electorate, youth voters express interest in a broad range of concerns.

""This generation of college voters is incredibly diverse so they are motivated by a range of issues. However, economic issues such as inflation, cost of rent/housing, and income inequality rank highly for them in surveys just like for older voters,"" says Burns. ""Students are also very concerned about mass shootings. We hear students wanting to see elected officials take strong action to address these issues.""

How these concerns will translate to voter turnout remains unknown. Most of the political data available today predates the July shakeup in the Democratic party, when President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.

Early signs suggest that Harris's entry into the race provided an infusion of enthusiasm among many young voters, including a September poll from Tufts that shows a dramatic increase in youth voter registration since July. In eight states, there are already more young voters registered than there were on Election Day 2020.

Youth voters are always outnumbered by their older counterparts, but the bar for making history is higher than it has ever been.

""2020 was also the highest turnout election in the history of the country and youth and students had especially high voter turnout, even compared to the increase for other groups of voters that election,"" says Mike Burns. ""So we are optimistic that will we again see young people, and students in particular, making their voices heard in their communities up and down the ballot at very high rates."""
InnovationRx: FDA Commissioner Talks Healthcare AI,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/innovationrx/2024/09/18/innovationrx-fda-commissioner-talks-healthcare-ai/,2024-09-18T21:17:51Z,"InnovationRx is your weekly digest of healthcare news. To get it in your inbox, subscribe here.

Healthcare AI startups developing products geared towards hospital systems have raised $23.2 billion over the past decade, according to a recent analysis by Flare Capital Partners. The biggest chunk of funding at $11.5 billion has gone to 324 companies working on solutions that impact clinical care. The flow of venture capital money, speed of technology advancement and the resources of Big Tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon and Apple have raised questions about who's really going to drive the healthcare AI regulatory agenda: industry or the feds?

""There is a risk that the system's going to outrun the ability to regulate it, but it will eventually self-correct,"" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf told reporters at an event in Massachusetts last week. ""I can guarantee you Congress is not going to give us 8,000 more positions to regulate the whole thing, and we can't just stop it.""

The FDA has authorized 950 AI and machine-learning-enabled medical devices as of August 7 with the majority of them being radiology software, but the next generation of software medical devices is about to get more complicated. ""It gets very different when you're using AI for decision support for healthcare, and there's a lot more concern there about how it can go akilter,"" said Califf. ""If you basically leave an AI algorithm in place and don't constantly check on it, it can get a lot better, it can get a lot worse.""

This is even more concerning with new advances in generative AI, he said, which is why there needs to be ""an ecosystem where there's shared accountability."" Califf specifically called out the need for health systems to ""step up."" ""I don't know how all this is going to play out with regard to liability,"" said Califf. ""But I think there's a lot of good reason for health systems to be concerned that if they don't step up, they're going to end up holding the bag on the liability with these algorithms.""

Ulrich Otte, Novo Nordisk's senior vice president of finance & operations, said at the Cantor Global Healthcare Conference on Tuesday that it is ""very likely"" Ozempic will be part of cost negotiations organized by the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, adding Novo Nordisk ""is ready for that,"" Bloomberg reported.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services can directly negotiate with pharmaceutical companies over drug prices through President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, and will announce its next group of drugs designated for price negotiations by Feb. 1, 2025.

Sleep Disorders: The FDA cleared the sleep apnea detection function in Apple Watch, which uses the device's sensors to detect breathing obstructions when the user is asleep and alert them to that so they can obtain care.

Brain Implants: Synchron, which has developed a brain implant that allows interaction with computing devices, announced that one of its patients with ALS was able to use his implant to control Amazon Alexa.

RNA Therapies: Korro Bio announced that it's partnering with Novo Nordisk on two rare disease targets for its RNA editing technology. The deal is valued up to $530 million in milestone payments plus royalties on sales of any drugs developed.

Dermatology: The FDA has approved lebrikizumab-lbkz, marketed by Lilly as Ebglyss, for the treatment of moderate to severe dermatitis.

AI For Drug Development: Ginkgo Bioworks announced it's launched a protein large language model built in collaboration with Google Cloud Consulting for customers to use AI insights that utilize Ginkgo's own private datasets.

Antifungal Treatments: F2G, a pharma company developing new antifungal treatments, announced that it has raised a $100 million financing round.

Despite a near decade-long ban on the sale of ""metaphysical services,"" the $6 billion arts and crafts e-commerce platform hosts thousands of spells being sold by its creators. Its public data shows that some of its most popular spell sellers, who boast hundreds of offerings and thousands of largely 5-star reviews, have made hundreds of thousands of dollars on tens of thousands of sales.

Many of these spells promise health benefits -- to cure depression and disease, to immediately enhance fertility, to ""ensure successful surgeries."" But they're also typically marketed with a disclaimer noting they are offered for entertainment purposes only, which provide them legal protection in most states.

""These are scams,"" said Kenny Biddle, the chief investigator for the Center of Inquiry, an organization devoted to defending science. ""They're taking money from people and they're going to keep consumers from looking at science-based medicine, which is harming them.""

Kelly Bishop On Her New Memoir And Life At 80: 'I Love Myself A Little Bit More',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffconway/2024/09/18/kelly-bishop-on-her-new-memoir-and-life-at-80-i-love-myself-a-little-bit-more/,2024-09-18T17:35:55Z,"She remains one of the most celebrated stage, film and television actors of our time - and yet, Kelly Bishop seems far from slowing down. Arguably best known for playing Sheila within the original production of A Chorus Line on Broadway and Jennifer Grey's on-screen mother Marjorie Houseman in Dirty Dancing, the role that continues to receive the most admiration from fans, generation after generation, is undoubtedly her performance as Emily Gilmore, the mother of Lorelai (played by Lauren Graham) and grandmother of Rory (played by Alexis Bledel) on the beloved series, Gilmore Girls.

Running on television for seven seasons, from 2000 through 2007, followed by a reboot miniseries on Netflix in 2016 titled Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, Bishop (who changed her birth name of Carole to stage name Kelly in the midst of her career) is now telling her life story in the form of a newly released memoir from Simon & Schuster, The Third Gilmore Girl.

Just before her 92NY appearance and on-stage conversation in New York City on September 17, which was moderated by her longtime Gilmore Girls co-star Graham, I spoke with Bishop about her new book, her life today and more.

Jeff Conway: You are 80 years young. What is it about your life today that made this feel like the right time for you to tell your story and share it with the world?

Kelly Bishop: Well, I think I was sort of badgered into it enough. A lot of people kept pushing me through the years and I didn't take it very seriously. And then of course, [Gilmore Girls creator] Amy Sherman-Palladino has great influence on my life, she started on me about it. It was around [Covid-19] shutdown time and I thought, Okay, sure. Let's try it. Besides, I'm 80 - it's not that I'm planning to leave anytime soon but I've done a lot by now, so let's play with it. Let's find out.

Conway: Gilmore Girls has such a legacy with fans, but when it comes to being off-screen with both Lauren and Alexis, are you able to keep in touch well and stay in each other's lives?

Bishop: Lauren, yes - absolutely! She's really like a daughter to me. She's one of my favorite people in the world - so Lauren, constantly. I see Amy when we can and I'm extremely fond of her. Alexis, I haven't talked to or seen since we did the reboot of Gilmore Girls. I don't even know which coast she's on or anything about her right now.

Conway: Like you said, we've already had a reboot of Gilmore Girls. Would you be open to having another one?

Bishop: I would be open to it. First of all, it would have to be Amy - Amy Sherman-Palladino would have to start it. I would pretty much follow her anywhere. She's just so solid and she's loyal and she's generous and she's a friend now, but then it would take the rest of us because I don't think you could replace any of us. We'd all have to agree and want to do it and be available to do it. So, I just think it's kind of unlikely - never say never, but it seems unlikely.

Conway: Kelly, where do you hope Emily Gilmore is today? Where would she be? What would she be doing?

Bishop: Well, now that we've seen her sitting by herself in that place, where she seemed fairly content. I give it a little bit of thought - I think she might be traveling the world and meeting new people. I doubt that she has fallen in love, but she might have. You never know!

Conway: So, when people read The Third Gilmore Girl and understand your story, what do you hope both women and men take away from this and bring into their own lives?

Bishop: Well, especially in reading about my relationship with Lee Leonard, my wonderful husband - that's for the men, too - if they could understand the companionship. Yes, we're lovers - we're this, we're that - but when you can become a partner and a buddy and a pal - and laughing. That was one of the best things about him. We didn't do it all the time, but when you get the giggles with someone and you can't stop, it's a great feeling. If you can find a relationship like that, you have to love it. And love yourself and love your person and be happy that you have or had, at least, what you had.

Conway: What was the hardest or most challenging part when you wrote your memoir that you wanted to make sure you got right and was told without any regrets?

Bishop: I wasn't very careful with the book. I'm very forthcoming and I'm a little bit too honest, sometimes. What really happened with the book would be when I talked about the abortion, which I never was going to. It's private, it's personal - it was not something that was horrifying or terrifying - it was nothing that I was ashamed of or felt guilty about, but I just thought that was private until Roe v. Wade and the Supreme Court [overturned it]. I really got angry, concerned about what I call ""my little sisters"" and remembering what I had - just the freedom. I had no intention of having an abortion and I don't think any woman wants one, but the fact that I could explain my experience doing that. I wanted people, particularly people who are offended by it or believe it's wrong - and that's their right - to understand the experience I had. So, I thought that was kind of important for people to hear, especially people who don't have that right anymore. I'm hoping we get it back.

Conway: So, what's next for you, Kelly? Any upcoming acting roles?

Bishop: Well actually, there's a certain show that's in the works now. It's Amy Sherman-Palladino's new show called √âtoile, which is about ballet companies, both in Paris and New York. I've done two guest spots on it, so that's the next one! That's the next step now.

Conway: Kelly, what are you enjoying more about life today perhaps in some ways that you didn't in the past? What is it about you at this stage in your life and your activities & choices that you are enjoying now?

Bishop: I think I've forgiven myself a lot - not that I'm ashamed of anything - but I think I'm a little easier on myself. I love myself a little bit more. Pat myself on the back - I'm my friend - my very best friend is me. It's just saying Be grateful, be happy - you've had a really good run here and it's not over. That's it. Who knows?

Conway: What would you say to Emily Gilmore, if you Kelly today could speak to her now? After embodying her over these years on Gilmore Girls, what do you feel she needs to hear?

Bishop: That'd be the first time I ever talked to her - she's not the kind of woman I'd be hanging with.

Conway: You guys would not be buddies?

Bishop: No, no! Oh my goodness, no! Now that she's a little more relaxed, we could talk about nature and the environment. We could talk about widow-hood and we could share that with each other, but this is not a woman I would have ever been friends with, ever.

Conway: So lastly, if you could go back to the Kelly Bishop, before A Chorus Line, before Dirty Dancing, before Gilmore Girls - and could give her advice, a warning or a comforting message after everything you have achieved and accomplished in your life, Kelly, what would you say to yourself then, way before everything?

Bishop: I think what I would've said to myself is keep on doing it. You're on the right track. Don't let anyone stop you and do it as long as you want to. You have this gift - just keep going."
"Harris And Trump's Biggest Celebrity Endorsements: Billie Eilish, Nicky Jam And More",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/09/17/harris-and-trumps-biggest-celebrity-endorsements-billie-eilish-nicky-jam-and-more/,2024-09-17T16:43:06Z,"Celebrity voices have entered the 2024 presidential race in a variety of ways in recent weeks, and some of the biggest names in politics and in Hollywood have lent their voices to a particular candidate in hopes of moving the needle this November.

A number of the biggest names in Hollywood came out in support of Biden before he dropped out of the race, before turning their support to Harris. Olivia Rodrigo, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris by sharing a video of a speech the vice president gave promising to ""stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans."" Major Democratic fundraiser George Clooney, who used a New York Times essay to call for Biden to drop out of the race, lent his support to Harris and Barbra Streisand said she would support Harris because of her vow to fight for reproductive rights. Musician John Legend, who performed at the Democratic National Convention in 2024, posted he was ""so ready"" for a Harris presidency. Director Spike Lee, ""West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin, director Ken Burns and Star Wars actor Mark Hamill threw their support behind Harris, along with actresses Rosie O'Donnell and Jamie Lee Curtis. Robert De Niro, who narrated an advertisement for the Biden campaign, praised the president's ""selfless patriotism"" in a statement that did not mention Harris but said ""there is nothing more important for our country than defeating Donald Trump at the ballot box."" British pop artist Charli XCX brought Harris into the Gen Z fold by tweeting ""kamala IS brat,"" an endorsement that was met by Harris' team changing the background photo on her X account to the ""brat"" green color and using the same font used on Charli XCX's album of the same name. Rapper Cardi B, who in May said she wouldn't be endorsing Biden, tweeted ""AHAHAHAHA LETS GOOOOO I TOLD YALLL KAMALA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 2024 candidate...."" Pop musician Kesha said she plans to support Harris in November and, when asked how she felt about Vance, responded ""f -- - that man."" Beyonc√© has not made a public endorsement but did give the Harris campaign permission to use her song ""Freedom"" in a video of her first official visit to her campaign's headquarters, a rare approval from the superstar musician. Beyonc√©'s mom and businesswoman Tina Knowles endorsed Harris with an Instagram post. Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle and former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have also thrown their support behind Harris. Former President Jimmy Carter, 99, reportedly told his son last week he was trying to make it to his 100th birthday so he could cast his vote for Kamala Harris. ""Sex in the City"" actress and former New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon threw her support behind Harris and her Vice Presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, in a post that read: ""I'm Walzing on air!"" Billionaire Mark Cuban, who previously said he was committed to voting for Biden, has also supported Harris and endorsed Walz as her running mate, calling him someone who ""can sit at the kitchen table and make you feel like you have know him forever."" Actor Tony Goldwyn, Republican political commentator Ana Navarro, comedian Mindy Kaling and actress Kerry Washington each supported the Harris-Walz campaign by hosting one evening of the Democratic National Convention. Nick Offerman, Jane Fonda, Ben Stiller, Kathy Griffin, John Stamos, Ed Helms, Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz were among those who appeared on a ""Comics for Harris"" virtual rally via Zoom, which reportedly raised close to half a million dollars for the Harris campaign. Over Labor Day weekend, a fundraiser for the Democratic ticket in Southampton, New York was hosted by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and fashion designer Tory Burch, among others. Actors Matt Damon and Lin-Manuel Miranda will attend fundraiser in New York City in September -- for which tickets are listed at $25,000 per person -- to support the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket, Bloomberg reported. Actress Aubrey Plaza posted a photo of herself on Instagram holding Grumpy Cat -- the face of a famous meme -- with the caption ""HARRIS üá∫üá∏ WALZ. Mel Brooks said he was ""all in"" for the Harris and Walz ticket in a post to social media holding his dog, adding ""I don't have a cat, so a dog will have to do!"" Stevie Nicks did not name a particular candidate when she encouraged her followers to vote in an Instagram post this week, but signed her message ""Childless Dog Lady.""

Former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan ripped off his shirt while on stage at the Republican National Convention last month to reveal a Trump-Vance campaign shirt underneath, and called Trump his ""hero"" and the ""greatest president of the United States."" Musician Kid Rock has been vocal about his support of Trump in the past and at the RNC revamped his song ""American Bad Ass"" to include references to Trump. UFC President and personality Dana White called Trump the ""toughest, most resilient human being."" Rapper and reality TV star Amber Rose gave a speech at the RNC in support of Trump. Country music stars Chris Janson and Jason Aldean also appeared at the convention. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy in January said voting for Trump over Biden was a ""no-brainer."" Public-facing billionaires like Elon Musk and Steve Wynn have also supported the former president. Actress Rosanne Barr, a longtime conservative supporter of Trump, clapped back at Cuban's endorsement of the Harris-Walz ticket and called the VP pick ""another reason Harris is a disaster."" Rapper Azealia Banks last year said she would vote for Donald Trump in Novemebr and she appeared at a rally in Florida this summer. Actor Jon Voight has defended Trump on multiple occasions. 50 Cent's 2023 song ""Many Men (Wish Death)"" started trending online after the assassination attempt of Trump last month. The rapper responded by putting Trump's face on the cover of his ""Get Rich or Die Tryin.'"" While it's hard to call the response an official endorsement, he did appear to support the president in 2020 before apparently backtracking. Other celebrities who have supported Trump in the past, but not outright endorsed him yet this election season, include Lil Wayne and ""Happy Days"" star Scott Baio.

Notable names missing from the list of public supporters include billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who called the decision ""too important to rush."""
Donald Trump Posted 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT' -- What Did He Expect?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/09/16/donald-trump-posted-i-hate-taylor-swift-what-did-he-expect/,2024-09-16T17:17:50Z,"Probably more than a few men in their late 70s would proudly say they're ""Swifties"" -- as in fans of pop singer Taylor Swift. However, former President Donald Trump isn't one of them, not by a long shot.

In a post on Truth Social on Sunday, the former president wrote, ""I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,"" without going into any specific reason, although her endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris last week likely is what spurred Trump to make his view clear.

The question, however, is why he waited several days to make the statement, but also what -- if anything -- he expected he sought to get from airing his personal opinion about the recent Grammy Award winner. Last Wednesday, he told Fox & Friends that he ""was not a Taylor Swift fan,"" and expected that she would endorse Harris.

""She's a very liberal person. She seems to always endorse a Democrat and she'll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace,"" Trump said, suggesting that her public endorsement might drive away Conservative voters.

That fact may be true as there have been some on social media who have said they're through with the pop singer, but the story seems to have passed. Now Trump's post may have only served to energize the masses of Swifties -- but likely not in his favor!

""Trump clearly understands her influence -- and his 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT' post could be interpreted as a defensive or one-dimensional move aimed at influencing his followers. As their leader, he perceives himself as having complete control over his cohort,"" explained technology industry analyst Susan Schreiner of C4 Trends.

""With Taylor Swift, Trump has met his greatest match yet,"" Schreiner suggested. ""Beyond a fight, he's picking a battle with a Titan.""

It is still possible that as a former TV celebrity Trump may think his reach is as great as Ms. Swift's, and he may feel to see that her appeal reaches potential segments of the electorate that both campaigns are eager to attract -- namely women, young people, and most importantly, people who don't pay attention to politics very much.

""If anything, Trump has underscored why he's not the candidate for Swifties,"" Schreiner suggested. ""Trump has drawn attention to his policies and statements that could motivate people to vote -- against him. Many of Swift's fans are already outraged by the loss of access to abortion care and other rights following Dobbs. They also understand that implementing Project 2025 could mean women being demoted to second-class citizens.""

Although Taylor Swift hasn't responded to Trump's post, many of her fans have, and #ILoveTaylorSwift has been trending on Monday morning -- again highlighting her reach.

""Taylor Swift's influence on social media is undeniable. Especially with younger generations who are newer voters,"" said celebrity business strategist, stylist, and creator Nina Vargas. ""Her call for voter registration has worked and had an influence, and that's the true power of a celebrity with cultural reach.""

Trump may have the comments before the second assassination attempt on his life and may have been an attempt to change the conversation away from the claims he made about Haitian migrants eating pets last week -- in other words trading one controversy for another.

Yet, if that is the case, Vargas said it would be a strange play to make.

""Why would Donald Trump respond by saying 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT' on social media because it's not about liking or disliking her, it's about understanding that this kind of response, in front of her massive following, could have the opposite effect from what he is hoping for,"" Vargas continued.

Fans who may not have even been leaning politically one way or another could now take this as a reason to vote against him regardless of how they feel about Harris.

""Instead of turning people against Swift and thereby Harris, he has sparked a backlash. She's expanding the electorate in ways that could be negative to Trump,"" said Schreiner.

""End of the day, this is a prime example of how perception can turn into reality in today's world and why our actions or reactions really do matter,"" added Vargas. ""If anything, candidates should be focusing on how to respond thoughtfully to cultural shifts like this, not just emotionally."""
Forbes Daily: Murdoch Family Feud Will Decide Future Of Fox News,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2024/09/16/forbes-daily-murdoch-family-feud-will-decide-future-of-fox-news/,2024-09-16T12:11:02Z,"The Murdoch family is headed to court this week over the future of billionaire Rupert Murdoch's media empire.

Murdoch's new succession plan would pass control of his businesses solely to Lachlan Murdoch, his eldest son and the chairman of News Corp -- the parent firm of the print empire that includes the Wall Street Journal and New York Post -- and executive chairman and CEO of the Fox Corporation. But three of Murdoch's other children, who were set to have equal voting shares under the original plan, are fighting back.

According to one document obtained by the New York Times, Murdoch may be motivated by a desire to maintain the conservative leanings of his outlets like Fox News -- which some of his children do not share.

Former President Donald Trump is safe after shots were fired Sunday in what the FBI described as an ""attempted assassination"" at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The suspected shooter is now in custody, and was about 300 to 500 yards away from Trump when he was spotted and fired upon by the Secret Service.

Consumer sentiment improved this month but remains historically weak, according to the University of Michigan's monthly survey. The lingering low sentiment coincides with elevated inflation during President Joe Biden's time in office, though economists say presidential actions have far less of an impact on the economy than public perception may suggest.

Adobe's stock fell 8% Friday after the company reported a lower forecast for its upcoming quarter than expected, bringing the software firm's shares down into the negative for the year. The firm actually beat estimates for earnings and revenue, but nearly $23 billion was erased from its market capitalization amid Friday's slide.

The S&P 500 closed out its best week of the year Friday, fresh off of its worst week of 2024, as the market walks a tightrope. Friday's rally was driven by hope that the Federal Reserve will take the market-friendly approach of an aggressive monetary policy shift when it meets this week.

Billionaire venture capitalist Walter Kortschak, who owns the land where Jurassic Park was filmed, made his estimated $1.6 billion fortune thanks to his tenure at growth equity firm Summit Partners and, later, personal early-stage investments that paid off big. In an interview with Forbes, he said the fear of missing out is the biggest risk investors face today, and cautioned against getting swept up in the mass hysteria around a sector.

A rally in shares of software giant Oracle briefly propelled its chairman Larry Ellison to the second spot on Forbes' ranking of the wealthiest people on the planet on Friday, with his net worth reaching as high as $208.4 billion. But Amazon founder and chairman Jeff Bezos retook the No. 2 spot as the day went on, and Oracle stock's gains pared.

Disney and DirecTV reached a crucial deal Saturday, bringing back college football broadcasts for 11.3 million DirecTV customers who lost access to Disney networks like ABC and ESPN after the cable provider and Disney battled over a distribution agreement at the start of the month. The new distribution deal will also make Disney streaming services and ESPN's upcoming standalone streaming service available in select DirecTV packages.

TOPLINE Etsy, the $6 billion arts and crafts e-commerce platform, hosts thousands of spells promising everything from untold wealth to cures for chronic depression, despite a near decade-long ban on the sale of ""metaphysical services.""

Sellers on the platform offer spells like ""Extreme Millionaire Lotto Spell"" ($13.13), ""Best Death Spell"" ($60.87), ""14th Dimensional Master Energy"" ($365.01), ""Wonderful Holiday With Family Spell"" ($19.01"") and ""Child Athlete Spell"" ($11.95). There are also ""Social Media Fame Spells"" ($2.88) and, predictably, too many penis enhancement spells to bother counting.

Etsy does not break out witchcraft and wizardry in its quarterly financials. But interviews with people who claim to practice it and some rough math suggest the platform has facilitated millions of dollars in spell sales. Etsy's own public data shows that some of its most popular spell sellers have made hundreds of thousands of dollars on tens of thousands of sales.

To say that Etsy, a company with a market capitalization of over $6 billion, has historically struggled to moderate its website is an understatement. It has been caught hosting deepfake pornography of female celebrities, counterfeit and mass-produced goods and AI-generated tripe. Earlier this year, following a widely publicized ban on sales of sex toys, Forbes found a proliferation of them two weeks later.

Most spells marketed on Etsy feature a disclaimer noting they are offered for entertainment purposes only, which provide them legal protection in most states, Charles McCrary, a professor of religious studies at Eckerd College in Florida, told Forbes. But it's hard not to view such spells as deceptions -- especially when Etsy exempts them from the platform's mediation system.

WHY IT MATTERS ""Etsy, a company with a market capitalization of over $6 billion, and a company that has always been known for selling artisanal handicrafts, has been found to have facilitated the sale of millions of dollars worth of purported 'spells,'"" says Forbes senior writer Cyrus Farivar. ""These include magical offerings to enhance body parts, but also to seek wealth and power. One expert told Forbes that these are 'modern day snake oil,' and can be financially harmful to those that purchase these items.""

In response to growing concerns about the grueling work culture in investment banking, JPMorgan and Bank of America are implementing new measures to curb excessive working hours for junior bankers. The changes follow the death of a bank employee earlier this year:

80 hours: The number of working hours JPMorgan is capping most junior investment bankers at per week

1 to 4: A new BofA tool allows junior bankers to indicate their workload capacity on a scale of 1 to 4

95 hours: A 2021 survey of a group of Goldman Sachs analysts revealed they had been working over 95-hour workweeks

The average net worth of American households surpassed $1 million for the first time in 2022, according to Federal Reserve data. A few key habits can help you become -- and stay -- a millionaire, like living below your means, focusing on how your money can work for you, and not letting status be the driving force behind your purchases. Raising independent children can also help ensure they're not relying on you later in life.

Vance Won't Say If Trump Would Veto An Abortion Ban -- Walking Back Earlier Comments,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2024/09/15/vance-wont-say-if-trump-would-veto-an-abortion-ban-walking-back-earlier-comments/,2024-09-15T15:29:05Z,"Ohio Sen. JD Vance wouldn't say whether former president Donald Trump would veto a national abortion ban on Sunday -- backtracking on comments from three weeks earlier, after Trump avoided saying whether he'd veto a ban in last week's presidential debate.

When pressed by Welker again whether Trump would veto a federal abortion ban, Vance responded: ""I think that I've learned my lesson on speaking for the president before he and I have actually talked about an issue.""

Abortion is expected to be a key issue in November's election, with Democrats arguing Republicans would ban or heavily restrict access to the procedure if they gain power. Many Republicans -- including Trump and Vance -- have pushed back and insisted the issue should be largely decided by the states following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, which ensured a national right to abortion access. Trump has said recently he is not in favor of a national ban, but he refused to say if he would contest Congress if it approved such a ban twice during Tuesday's debate. The former president has been inconsistent on his views of abortion throughout his career: In 1999 he was ""very pro-choice"" despite hating the ""concept of abortion,"" in 2016 he suggested women who get abortions should be punished in some way and, while in office, Trump supported a 20-week federal abortion ban. Vance has described himself as pro-life and believes states should make their own policies, but as recently as 2022 he has indicated he would support making the procedure illegal federally.

18. That's how many states have a ban on all or most abortions, according to The Washington Post. Two states have had bans blocked by courts, and another three states have bans in places after 12 or 15 weeks."

75%. That is the share of U.S. Catholics who view Pope Francis favorably, according to a Pew Research Center report released earlier this year, marking an 8% decrease since 2021. About nine out of 10 Democratic Catholics or those who lean toward the Democratic Party have a positive view of the pope, according to the report, which noted 63% of Catholics who are Republicans or lean Republican have a positive view of him.

Francis previously made comments about the presidential election in 2016, criticizing Trump's plan to build a wall on the border between the U.S. and Mexico and saying anyone who builds walls to shut out migrants ""is not Christian."" The pope also warned against using fear as a political tool just days before the 2016 election, saying in addition to ""being a good deal for the merchants of arms and death,"" it ""also numbs us to the suffering of others."" Francis has also repeatedly condemned abortion, calling it ""murder"" and saying ""those who carry out abortions kill,"" regardless of how close an abortion is carried out to conception, Reuters reported in 2021. Francis, who approved blessings for same-sex couples last year, has developed a rocky relationship with conservatives in the Catholic Church, telling CBS's Norah O'Donnell in May that conservative church leaders in the U.S. were ""closed up inside a dogmatic box.""

A number of the biggest names in Hollywood came out in support of Biden before he dropped out of the race, before turning their support to Harris. Olivia Rodrigo, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris by sharing a video of a speech the vice president gave promising to ""stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans."" Major Democratic fundraiser George Clooney, who used a New York Times essay to call for Biden to drop out of the race, lent his support to Harris and Barbra Streisand said she would support Harris because of her vow to fight for reproductive rights. Musician John Legend, who performed at the Democratic National Convention in 2024, posted he was ""so ready"" for a Harris presidency. Director Spike Lee, ""West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin, director Ken Burns and Star Wars actor Mark Hamill threw their support behind Harris, along with actresses Rosie O'Donnell and Jamie Lee Curtis. Robert De Niro, who narrated an advertisement for the Biden campaign, praised the president's ""selfless patriotism"" in a statement that did not mention Harris but said ""there is nothing more important for our country than defeating Donald Trump at the ballot box."" British pop artist Charli XCX brought Harris into the Gen Z fold by tweeting ""kamala IS brat,"" an endorsement that was met by Harris' team changing the background photo on her X account to the ""brat"" green color and using the same font used on Charli XCX's album of the same name. Rapper Cardi B, who in May said she wouldn't be endorsing Biden, tweeted ""AHAHAHAHA LETS GOOOOO I TOLD YALLL KAMALA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 2024 candidate...."" Pop musician Kesha said she plans to support Harris in November and, when asked how she felt about Vance, responded ""f -- - that man."" Beyonc√© has not made a public endorsement but did give the Harris campaign permission to use her song ""Freedom"" in a video of her first official visit to her campaign's headquarters, a rare approval from the superstar musician. Beyonc√©'s mom and businesswoman Tina Knowles endorsed Harris with an Instagram post. Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle and former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have also thrown their support behind Harris. Former President Jimmy Carter, 99, reportedly told his son last week he was trying to make it to his 100th birthday so he could cast his vote for Kamala Harris. ""Sex in the City"" actress and former New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon threw her support behind Harris and her Vice Presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, in a post that read: ""I'm Walzing on air!"" Billionaire Mark Cuban, who previously said he was committed to voting for Biden, has also supported Harris and endorsed Walz as her running mate, calling him someone who ""can sit at the kitchen table and make you feel like you have know him forever."" Actor Tony Goldwyn, Republican political commentator Ana Navarro, comedian Mindy Kaling and actress Kerry Washington each supported the Harris-Walz campaign by hosting one evening of the Democratic National Convention. Nick Offerman, Jane Fonda, Ben Stiller, Kathy Griffin, John Stamos, Ed Helms, Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz were among those who appeared on a ""Comics for Harris"" virtual rally via Zoom, which reportedly raised close to half a million dollars for the Harris campaign. Over Labor Day weekend, a fundraiser for the Democratic ticket in Southampton, New York was hosted by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and fashion designer Tory Burch, among others. Actors Matt Damon and Lin-Manuel Miranda will attend fundraiser in New York City in September -- for which tickets are listed at $25,000 per person -- to support the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket, Bloomberg reported.

Former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan ripped off his shirt while on stage at the Republican National Convention last month to reveal a Trump-Vance campaign shirt underneath, and called Trump his ""hero"" and the ""greatest president of the United States."" Musician Kid Rock has been vocal about his support of Trump in the past and at the RNC revamped his song ""American Bad Ass"" to include references to Trump. UFC President and personality Dana White called Trump the ""toughest, most resilient human being."" Rapper and reality TV star Amber Rose gave a speech at the RNC in support of Trump. Country music stars Chris Janson and Jason Aldean also appeared at the convention. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy in January said voting for Trump over Biden was a ""no-brainer."" Public-facing billionaires like Elon Musk and Steve Wynn have also supported the former president. Actress Rosanne Barr, a longtime conservative supporter of Trump, clapped back at Cuban's endorsement of the Harris-Walz ticket and called the VP pick ""another reason Harris is a disaster."" Rapper Azealia Banks last year said she would vote for Donald Trump in Novemebr and she appeared at a rally in Florida this summer. Actor Jon Voight has defended Trump on multiple occasions. 50 Cent's 2023 song ""Many Men (Wish Death)"" started trending online after the assassination attempt of Trump last month. The rapper responded by putting Trump's face on the cover of his ""Get Rich or Die Tryin.'"" While it's hard to call the response an official endorsement, he did appear to support the president in 2020 before apparently backtracking. Other celebrities who have supported Trump in the past, but not outright endorsed him yet this election season, include Lil Wayne and ""Happy Days"" star Scott Baio.

Notable names missing from the list of public supporters include billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who called the decision ""too important to rush,"" and Taylor Swift, who pledged support for Biden last election cycle, has not come out for a candidate."
Here's Where Abortion Is On The Ballot In November -- As Nebraska Measures Upheld In Court,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/09/13/heres-where-abortion-is-on-the-ballot-in-november-as-nebraska-measures-upheld-in-court/,2024-09-13T16:42:48Z,"The Nebraska Supreme Court ruled Friday that the state's planned questions on abortion rights can stay on the ballot, as 10 states are set to have abortion on their November ballot -- including some where the procedure is now banned.

Abortion is totally banned in Missouri and South Dakota, meaning the ballot measures in those states would overturn the bans if they're passed by voters and restore abortion access. They would also have an impact in Florida, which bans abortion after six weeks, and Arizona, where abortion is banned after 15 weeks. Nebraska has a 12-week ban in place now, so voting in favor of the pro-abortion rights amendment would undo that ban, while the anti-abortion rights measure would make the 12-week ban permanent. Abortion is still legal in Colorado, Maryland, Nevada and New York, but enshrining the protections in state law would ensure legislators can't impose bans in the future. Montana has also preserved the right to an abortion, as the state constitution already specifies a right to privacy that has led to abortion bans getting struck down, but the proposed ballot measure language would be even more explicit that the procedure is allowed. Approximately 20 states now have some form of abortion ban in place.

The Nebraska Supreme Court upheld both of the state's abortion measures remaining on the ballot Friday, ruling the pro-abortion rights referendum did not violate a law on ballot measures only dealing with a single subject, as opponents claimed. While the challenge focused on alleged issues with the pro-abortion rights measure, pro-abortion rights advocates challenged the anti-abortion measure remaining in place if the pro-abortion one was struck down, saying either both measures should appear on the ballot or neither of them. The ruling came days after the Missouri Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that state's abortion measure can stay on the ballot after a lower state judge said it was invalid, siding with opponents of the measure who alleged it was ""insufficient"" because it didn't properly say how it would affect existing state laws. Missouri Attorney General Jay Ashcroft decertified the ballot measure after the lower court's ruling -- prompting an effort by Democrats to hold him in contempt -- but the state's highest court then ruled the measure was valid after all and Ashcroft must put it back on the ballot. The tussles were part of a broader effort by Republicans to challenge abortion ballot measures even just weeks before the election, with court battles also ongoing in South Dakota, while Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration is investigating signatures in favor of that state's measure.

While many states have accepted ballot measures on abortion this election cycle, Arkansas' potential ballot measure was rejected in court. The state initially rejected the ballot measure application for paperwork issues and organizers then sued the state, but the Arkansas Supreme Court ruled in August in the state'. Organizers submitted enough signatures for the measure to make the ballot but the state claimed they didn't correctly submit a sworn statement regarding instructing canvassers who collected the signatures, which the state Supreme Court upheld.

Abortion ballot measures have been met with significant resistance by GOP politicians and anti-abortion rights advocates in the states where they've been considered and approved. Beyond the court battles playing out in Nebraska and South Dakota, anti-abortion groups in a number of states have gone to court to challenge technical issues with applications, signatures received in support of the measures, the wording of various proposals and other alleged issues. Opponents told Politico in July their aim was to block the measures from making the ballot, though many legal challenges have continued even after that point. ""We are working to make sure it doesn't get on the ballot in the first place,"" Jill Norgaard, a board member of Arizona Right to Life and former member of the Arizona House of Representatives, told the outlet about the state's ballot measure before it was approved.

85%. That's the share of U.S. adults who think abortion should be legal in at least some circumstances, according to Gallup polling released in May. A Public Religion Research Institute poll released in May found residents in all but five states believe abortion should be at least mostly legal -- though those five states include South Dakota, where only 47% reported supporting abortion rights ahead of the ballot measure this fall.

Among the people who will vote on Florida's abortion ballot measure is former President Donald Trump, who has said he believes abortion should be left up to the states. The ex-president has said he will vote against the Florida measure even as he's criticized the state's six-week ban. When asked at the presidential debate on Tuesday about his vote, Trump claimed he was opposing the measure because it would allow abortion in the ""ninth month,"" though in actuality the measure would only allow abortions until the fetus is viable unless medically necessary. Abortions in the final months of a pregnancy are exceedingly rare.

Abortion ballot measures have emerged as a successful way to protect abortion rights in the past two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, setting off a wave of state-level bans. While Republican legislators have been eager to ban the procedure, abortion rights supporters have used ballot measures to harness public support in favor of abortion, hamstringing lawmakers from imposing restrictions in even some Republican-leaning states. Kansas was the first state to put abortion on the ballot in August 2022, with 59% of voters opposing a measure that would have paved the way for abortions to be restricted. Five states then had abortion-related measures on the ballot in the 2022 midterms -- California, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana and Vermont -- with Ohio following suit last year. All votes have broken in favor of abortion rights."
Harris Expands Lead Over Trump In First Post-Debate Polls,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/09/12/harris-expands-lead-over-trump-in-first-post-debate-polls/,2024-09-12T19:44:05Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris leads former President Donald Trump by five points in the first two major national polls taken following Tuesday's debate -- in which pundits widely considered Harris the winner.

2.7. That's how many points Harris was leading Trump by in polls on the day of the debate, according to FiveThirtyEight's polling average. Her polling surge appeared to be tapering off, with Trump notching one of his first leads by a major pollster since early August with a New York Times/Siena survey taken Sept. 3-6 that found him up by one point, 48% to 47%.

Tuesday's debate -- the first and only scheduled showdown between Trump and Harris and the first time the two met in person -- was widely considered the most consequential night of the 2024 election. It was particularly high stakes for Harris, as voters are less familiar with her from a personal and policy perspective considering her late entrance into the race. While she didn't float any new policy proposals during the debate, she and Trump traded their usual barbs over the economy, the troubled U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, the border and abortion. The debate came a little over two months after President Joe Biden's disastrous debate with Trump that effectively ended his presidential campaign, paving Harris' path to securing the Democratic nomination.

ABC moderators Linsey Davis and David Muir faced criticism from Trump allies for fact-checking Trump in multiple instances, but never Harris. News outlets that fact-checked the candidates' answers found that Trump made far more baseless or factually wrong statements -- such as inflation being the worst it's ever been -- than Harris, though Harris did stretch the truth in a few cases, including by saying she made her position on fracking clear in 2020, and wasn't corrected by moderators.

Trump said Thursday he won't debate Harris again, writing on Truth Social, that Harris ""SHOULD FOCUS ON WHAT SHE SHOULD HAVE DONE DURING THE LAST ALMOST FOUR YEAR PERIOD. THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!"" Trump accused Harris of challenging him to a second debate only because she lost the first one, comparing her to a fallen UFC fighter who wants a rematch.

Tuesday night's ABC debate was the first time Trump and Harris met in person, and it was widely considered the most important night of the 2024 campaign yet. They touched on major topics including the economy, abortion, wars in Ukraine and Israel and each of their past records. Harris was largely seen as the winner of the debate by pundits who said she successfully goaded Trump to get off topic and defend himself angrily rather than address the questions and topics at hand. Early polls also showed people largely considered Harris to have won the debate, with ABC News reporting Wednesday afternoon that an average of 57% of respondents thought Harris performed better.

2.7. That's how many points Harris led Trump by in national polls, on average, on Wednesday as of 6 p.m. EDT, according to FiveThirtyEight.

Whether Harris and Trump agree to another debate. The Harris campaign has said it is all in on having the pair face off again in a second debate, which they previously agreed to in principle but did not specify a date or time.

I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos,"" Swift added in her Instagram post, and she called upon her followers to vote -- but didn't actually call upon them to vote for Harris.

""Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make,"" she suggested. ""I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered!""

In a call-in to ""Fox & Friends"" on Wednesday morning, Trump responded that he wasn't surprised by Swift's decision to endorse Harris, labeled her ""a very liberal person,"" and suggested, ""She'll probably pay a price for it [...] in the marketplace.""

Swift's endorsement of Harris shouldn't be seen as surprising, as she had back Joe Biden and Harris in 2020, but her superstar has only increased in the past four years. Thus the impact it could have on the election shouldn't be dismissed, especially as it could entice younger voters to head to the polls.

""This is a real case study in terms of a celebrity impacting an election,"" explained Scott Talan, senior professorial lecturer in public communications at American University. ""She laid out in several paragraphs what led to her endorsement. The fact that it was on Instagram is noteworthy as it is the medium that young people use. It was an A+ job in impact and potential success.""

Swift's post also allowed her to respond directly to the false claims from last month that she had endorsed Trump. Her post set the record straight to her fans while highlighting the danger not to believe everything you read on the platforms.

""Social Media are marketing platforms now and not necessarily based on personal thought or opinion. The amount of misinformation spreads like wildfire because of the sheer size of those communities. They do not encourage impact, but actually the contrary and Gen Z are savvy to authenticity. It was powerful for Taylor to officially post her intentions, as she said, to be very transparent and fight misinformation with the truth,"" said Claire Wright, CEO and co-founder of social media utility app BUDDY.

""Taylor has her comments turned off, most likely to prevent everyone, including herself, from experiencing toxic comments -- sadly what the culture of social media use has become,"" suggested Wright.

In many ways, Swift's endorsement via Instagram could be critical for Harris simply because of her massive following. Even if not all ""Swifties"" are liberals, her message was still about the importance of voting -- and serves as a reminder of MTV's Rock the Vote campaign from the 1990s.

""The key to the 2024 Presidential election is getting new voters out to the polls,"" said Linda Bloss-Baum, professorial lecturer in the Department of Management at American University.

""The biggest crop of 'new' votes may come from the younger electorate that has not actively participated in past elections,"" added Bloss-Baum, who also said many students have been asking how to register to vote and get involved in a campaign. ""These voters are proud 'Swifties.'""

The power of celebrity can't be dismissed, as Bloss-Baum further noted that Swift sold 4.35 million tickets last year for the first U.S. leg of her Eras tour.

""The way she relates to her fans through her music, social media, and personal anecdotes creates a sense of intimacy and understanding,"" said Bloss-Baum. ""Taylor Swift's deep connection with an entire generation surpasses that of any artist in my lifetime. The millions of Instagram likes that Taylor's post received within mere minutes after the Presidential debate shows how quickly her fans stand ready to support her, and by extension, Kamala Harris. If a mere fraction of those 'likes' turn into 'votes' for Kamala Harris, it could seriously impact the outcome of the election in November.""

Yet, it should be remembered too that Trump is also more celebrity than a politician.

""If he wasn't a reality TV star he wouldn't be president,"" added Talan.

The difference is that Trump's celebrity status may have helped win him the White House in 2016, but it fell short in 2020, and might not put him over the top in 2024. By comparison, Swift is at the top of her game.

""She has one of the biggest fan bases around, and you tie this into more and more young voters being politically motivated, while her fans are mainly fans are female with abortion being a central campaign issue,"" said Talan. ""There isn't another celebrity on the other side of the political spectrum that has the reach of Swift."""
Here's Where Abortion Is On The Ballot In November -- As Missouri Measure Upheld In Court,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/09/11/heres-where-abortion-is-on-the-ballot-in-november-as-missouri-measure-upheld-in-court/,2024-09-11T18:54:23Z,"The Missouri Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the state's planned question on abortion rights can stay on the ballot, after the state's Republican attorney general tried to decertify it, as 10 states are set to have abortion on their November ballot -- including some where the procedure is now banned.

Abortion is totally banned in Missouri and South Dakota, meaning the ballot measures in those states would overturn the bans if they're passed by voters and restore abortion access. They would also have an impact in Florida, which bans abortion after six weeks, and Arizona, where abortion is banned after 15 weeks. Nebraska has a 12-week ban in place now, so voting in favor of the pro-abortion rights amendment would undo that ban, while the anti-abortion rights measure would make the 12-week ban permanent. Abortion is still legal in Colorado, Maryland, Nevada and New York, but enshrining the protections in state law would ensure legislators can't impose bans in the future. Montana has also preserved the right to an abortion, as the state constitution already specifies a right to privacy that has led to abortion bans getting struck down, but the proposed ballot measure language would be even more explicit that the procedure is allowed. Approximately 20 states now have some form of abortion ban in place.

The Missouri Supreme Court ruled the state's abortion measure can stay on the ballot after a lower state judge said Friday it was invalid, siding with opponents of the measure who alleged it was ""insufficient"" because it didn't properly say how it would affect existing state laws. Missouri Attorney General Jay Ashcroft decertified the ballot measure after the lower court's ruling -- prompting an effort by Democrats to hold him in contempt -- but the state's highest court then ruled the measure was valid after all and Ashcroft must put it back on the ballot. The tussle was one of a few efforts by Republicans to challenge abortion ballot measures even just weeks before the election, with court battles also ongoing in Nebraska and South Dakota, while Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration is investigating signatures in favor of that state's measure.

While many states have accepted ballot measures on abortion this election cycle, Arkansas' potential ballot measure was rejected in court. The state initially rejected the ballot measure application for paperwork issues and organizers then sued the state, but the Arkansas Supreme Court ruled in August in the state'. Organizers submitted enough signatures for the measure to make the ballot but the state claimed they didn't correctly submit a sworn statement regarding instructing canvassers who collected the signatures, which the state Supreme Court upheld.

Abortion ballot measures have been met with significant resistance by GOP politicians and anti-abortion rights advocates in the states where they've been considered and approved. Beyond the court battles playing out in Nebraska and South Dakota, anti-abortion groups in a number of states have gone to court to challenge technical issues with applications, signatures received in support of the measures, the wording of various proposals and other alleged issues. Opponents told Politico in July their aim was to block the measures from making the ballot, though many legal challenges have continued even after that point. ""We are working to make sure it doesn't get on the ballot in the first place,"" Jill Norgaard, a board member of Arizona Right to Life and former member of the Arizona House of Representatives, told the outlet about the state's ballot measure before it was approved.

85%. That's the share of U.S. adults who think abortion should be legal in at least some circumstances, according to Gallup polling released in May. A Public Religion Research Institute poll released in May found residents in all but five states believe abortion should be at least mostly legal -- though those five states include South Dakota, where only 47% reported supporting abortion rights ahead of the ballot measure this fall.

Among the people who will vote on Florida's abortion ballot measure is former President Donald Trump, who has said he believes abortion should be left up to the states. The ex-president has said he will vote against the Florida measure even as he's criticized the state's six-week ban. When asked at the presidential debate on Tuesday about his vote, Trump claimed he was opposing the measure because it would allow abortion in the ""ninth month,"" though in actuality the measure would only allow abortions until the fetus is viable unless medically necessary. Abortions in the final months of a pregnancy are exceedingly rare.

Abortion ballot measures have emerged as a successful way to protect abortion rights in the past two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, setting off a wave of state-level bans. While Republican legislators have been eager to ban the procedure, abortion rights supporters have used ballot measures to harness public support in favor of abortion, hamstringing lawmakers from imposing restrictions in even some Republican-leaning states. Kansas was the first state to put abortion on the ballot in August 2022, with 59% of voters opposing a measure that would have paved the way for abortions to be restricted. Five states then had abortion-related measures on the ballot in the 2022 midterms -- California, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana and Vermont -- with Ohio following suit last year. All votes have broken in favor of abortion rights."
"In Debate, Harris Reiterates Healthcare Positions While Trump Balks",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2024/09/11/in-debate-harris-reiterates-healthcare-positions-while-trump-balks/,2024-09-11T16:55:51Z,"The fiery presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris was perhaps a spectacle. But as is historically often been the case when candidates for president square off, there weren't many substantive policy discussions. Nevertheless, on healthcare Harris reiterated her positions on the Affordable Care Act, the Inflation Reduction Act and abortion, while Trump showed an unwillingness to commit to specific policies.

A May 2024 poll of voters by the Pew Research Center found that healthcare ranked as the third-highest issue priority for voters, behind inflation and the perceived need for more bipartisanship. Survey respondents cited rising healthcare costs, with 57% saying that the increasing expenses are a ""very big problem"" in the country today.

Yet it took more than 90 minutes into the debate for moderators to finally pose a question about healthcare.

Harris defended the Affordable Care Act and Inflation Reduction Act, noting how under the Biden Administration the ACA was ""strengthened"" and that the newly enacted IRA ""lowers drug prices for seniors ... and caps out-of-pocket costs for insulin as well as other [outpatient] drugs.""

Just this week, the ACA reached a milestone of nearly 50 million individuals having received coverage under the law.

The $35 per month cap on insulin out-of-pocket costs she was referring to is in effect and applies to all Medicare recipients. The Trump Administration did issue an executive order in 2020 in which monthly insulin out-of-pocket costs were capped at $35 for a relatively small number of Medicare beneficiaries under a voluntary model. By contrast, the IRA mandates such an out-of-pocket maximum for all Medicare recipients.

The $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket costs for outpatient drugs Harris referenced will be implemented starting in 2025. This means that in a given year Medicare beneficiaries will not pay more than $2,000 out-of-pocket on outpatient drugs.

In defending the Biden Administration's policies on prescription drugs and the ACA Harris reiterated a Democratic plank that ""healthcare is a right, not a privilege.""

Trump revealed he doesn't have a specific proposal to replace the ACA. But he said he had ""concepts of a plan."" This may have reminded viewers of something similar he stated about replacing the ACA while he was president. While in office, Trump often proclaimed he would come up with an alternative to the ACA. However, during his time in office he never did.

During the debate, Trump declared ""we can do much better than Obamacare,"" but that he ""would only change it if we come up with something that's better and less expensive."" He also reiterated points he has made in the past about ""saving"" the ACA while he was president. Indeed, following unsuccessful efforts to scuttle the ACA, the Trump Administration did issue multiple executive orders to ""improve ACA market dynamics."" But overall enrollment in the program declined from 2017 through 2020. And a Brookings article details the ways in which the Trump Administration may have done more to undermine than save the ACA.

Surprisingly, Trump said nothing to parry Harris's points on reducing Medicare drug prices. He could have noted that his Administration drafted proposals to lower drug prices in Medicare. As president, Trump issued executive orders that would have instituted a ""most favored nations"" drug pricing policy for the Medicare program. Specifically, MFN would have required pharmaceutical firms to sell certain drugs to Medicare for the lowest price that they offer to peer nations overseas. But notably, the use of international price referencing was staunchly opposed by many fellow Republicans. And the MFN executive order was never implemented.

On abortion rights, the two candidates voiced strongly differing views on a topic that remains critical for about one in eight voters. According to KFF, 12% of the electorate says that abortion is the most important issue for their vote in the 2024 elections.

While Trump said he would not sign a nationwide abortion ban, he hedged by also refusing to commit to vetoing such a ban. Moreover, he maintained that the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade was broadly popular, though that isn't the case according to state ballot initiatives or public opinion polling. More than 60% of Americans disapprove of the Supreme Court decision.

Harris repeated her strong support for women's reproductive rights, criticizing Trump for his role in facilitating decreased access to abortion in a growing number of states. However, she declined to say whether she supported restrictions on abortion in the third trimester."
Who Is 'Abdul'? Trump's Bizarre Debate Story About Taliban Negotiations Explained,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/09/11/who-is-abdul-trumps-bizarre-debate-story-about-taliban-negotiations-explained/,2024-09-11T16:12:18Z,"Former President Donald Trump incorrectly said during Tuesday's debate that someone named ""Abdul"" leads the Taliban while discussing his role in negotiating the end of the U.S. war in Afghanistan -- reprising a story he frequently tells that seems to conflate the name of one of the terrorist organization's negotiators with its leader.

Harris defended Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan during the debate and accused Trump of having ""negotiated one of the weakest deals you can imagine,"" blasting him for agreeing to the release of 5,000 Taliban prisoners from Afghan prisons.

Trump forged an alliance with some of the families of the 13 service members killed in the Abbey Gate bombing who are critical of the Biden administration. His visit to Arlington National Cemetery last month to commemorate the third anniversary of the attacks sparked controversy when his team took photos and videos in a restricted area, Section 60, where service members killed in recent wars are buried. Federal law prohibits photos and videos in Section 60 for political purposes. The Army, which operates the cemetery, accused a Trump aide of pushing a female staffer out of the way who tried to prevent his team from taking photos, a claim the Trump campaign denied, while accusing the staffer of having a mental breakdown and promising to release footage of the alleged incident (though his campaign has never done so). Harris, along with some veterans and Gold Star families, publicly criticized Trump, alleging he disrespected the gravesites. Other Gold Star family members, including some whose loved ones were killed in Abbey Gate, publicly defended Trump and criticized the Biden-Harris administration in the wake of the controversy.

Trump and Harris debated -- and met -- for the first time Tuesday in a 90-minute debate hosted by ABC News. Pundits widely lauded Harris' performance, praising her for putting Trump on the defensive with her frequent jabs over abortion, the crowd sizes at Trump's rallies, his pandering to dictators and his legal woes. The candidates sparred over abortion, the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars, and the economy, as Trump promoted his plan for tariffs and Harris detailed proposals she said are designed to boost the middle class. Harris' campaign challenged Trump to a second debate almost immediately after the first one ended Tuesday, but Trump said Wednesday he's not sure if he will participate.

It's not clear whether abortion ballot measures will significantly sway the presidential race. Analyses of past abortion measures have pointed out the questions typically outperform Democratic candidates, as some Republicans will vote in favor of protecting abortion rights but still vote for GOP candidates. It remains to be seen whether Trump's refusal to say he would veto a national abortion ban could be enough to sway pro-abortion rights Republicans and independents in Arizona, Florida and Nevada away from Trump. A FiveThirtyEight analysis also argued ballot measures don't necessarily boost turnout as much as Democrats have claimed, with data suggesting increased access to voting has a bigger impact than what's on the ballot.

Ballot measures could have a bigger impact on state-level turnout when they're designed to overturn existing abortion restrictions (like in Arizona or Florida) rather than when they reinforce the status quo (like in Nevada). Turnout increased in Michigan in 2022 when the state put a measure on the ballot that determined the legality of the procedure, for instance, with 4.5 million voting in 2018 versus 4.3 million in 2018 and 3.1 million in 2014. FiveThirtyEight attributes at least some of that bump to the state enacting same-day and automatic voter registration, though it notes the ballot measure's fairly high stakes might've made it more impactful.

Beyond the presidential race, Democrats are also hoping an abortion-focused ballot measure in Montana will boost incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, as he faces a tough reelection fight in the right-leaning state. Maryland is also one to watch as Republican former Gov. Larry Hogan runs for the Senate in the typically left-leaning state, though Hogan has said he supports abortion rights. In its April memo, the DCCC identified 18 close House races in states with abortion measures in which Democrats could get a boost from the questions. More states have added ballot measures since that list was compiled, so there are likely even more races that Democrats are targeting now.

Abortion was a major topic at Tuesday's debate, with moderator Linsey Davis asking Trump about whether he'd veto a national abortion ban after his running mate Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, suggested Trump would. The ex-president again pushed back on the idea of imposing a national ban and claimed ""there's no reason to sign a ban because we've gotten what everybody wanted"" -- even as most voters oppose overturning Roe v. Wade -- but refused to answer directly whether he would veto any ban that did pass. Trump said he ""didn't discuss"" the issue with Vance, only claiming he ""won't have to"" veto a bill and ""we don't have to discuss it because she'd never be able to get it,"" apparently referring to Harris wanting federal protections for abortion. Harris responded by slamming Trump's defense of overturning Roe v. Wade and tied him to the impacts of the state bans, like people having to spend money to travel out of state for abortions or being denied IVF procedures, arguing, ""What you are putting [people]

Trump has said he will vote against Florida's abortion ballot measure in November even as he's criticized the state's six-week ban. When asked about his opposition to the measure at Tuesday's debate, Trump falsely claimed the measure supports abortions ""in the ninth month"" and went off on a tangent about abortions in the ninth month and ""after birth."" No state legalizes any procedure to kill babies after they're born and abortions in later pregnancy are exceedingly rare, and Florida's measure, if enacted, would only allow abortions up until the point of fetal viability -- about 24 weeks -- unless medically necessary.

It's unclear how Trump's position on abortion will continue to evolve before Election Day, as the ex-president faces backlash from his anti-abortion base for saying he supports abortion being left to the states and refusing to outright support a national ban. While Trump has disavowed a national ban -- but remained vague on if he'd veto one -- abortion rights supporters still believe it's likely Trump would restrict abortion if elected, pointing to other steps Trump could take without a national ban, like enforcing the 19th century-era Comstock Act to ban mailing abortion pills and equipment or stripping abortion drug mifepristone of its federal approval. Trump has said in interviews he's not interested in either of those options, but he has backed the proposals outlined in the Republican National Committee's formal platform -- which supports giving constitutional rights to fetuses, a legal theory that, if adopted, would ban abortion nationwide.

The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to an abortion in June 2022, kicking off a wave of state bans nationwide. Polling has shown a majority of Americans support the procedure remaining broadly legal, however, which has led abortion to become a key election issue, as voters are inclined to support abortion rights. That's led to Republicans often downplaying their opposition to abortion -- even changing their campaign websites -- in order not to alienate voters, and has made ballot measures a key tactic for abortion rights supporters, as they can harness voters' support for abortion rights even in states where lawmakers want to ban it. Seven states have had ballot measures on abortion since the Supreme Court's ruling -- California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, Ohio and Vermont -- with all breaking in favor of abortion rights. Trump said in April he supported abortion being left up to the states after months of uncertainty of where the ex-president stood on abortion, and after he previously suggested he could be open to a national 15-week ban. Polling has suggested his position is broadly unpopular, with an August Kaiser Family Foundation poll finding 74% of women of reproductive age oppose leaving abortion up to the states, and anti-abortion advocates have decried Trump for not going further to oppose abortion rights."
11 Takeaways From Kamala Harris And Donald Trump's Presidential Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sughnenyongo/2024/09/11/11-takeaways-from-the-kamala-harris---donald-trump-presidential-debate/,2024-09-11T15:35:35Z,"In a face-off, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump took to the stage in Pennsylvania in a fiery debate for the Oval Office, laying out their sharply contrasting visions for America's future.

Moderated by ABC News' David Muir and Linsey Davis, the debate kicked off with immediate tension, as former President Trump focused on his familiar themes: border security and economic recovery, repeatedly pointing to his claim of record-breaking tariffs and tough immigration policies.

Vice President Harris called out what she framed as Trump's failures, including public health mismanagement, saying Trump's administration had triggered a public health epidemic. Harris also ripped into Trump's recession-prone economic plan and his response to the January 6th attack on the Capitol. Sensitive issues like race, abortion, and voting rights also took center stage, with Harris accusing Trump of worsening the country's divides. Trump was also challenged for his misleading comments about winning the 2020 election.

The debate, which was different from the 2020 presidential debate, with no audience, saw the two presidential hopefuls rip into each other's policies, with words like ""weak"" and ""stupid"" thrown about. Here are 11 key takeaways from the U.S. presidential debate.

In the first few minutes of her speech, Harris focused on the middle class, young families, and small businesses, pushing her bold ""opportunity economy"" plan by offering tax breaks for small businesses and a $6,000 tax cut for growing families. Her pledge: to lead as president for all Americans and act as a unifying buffer for both sides.

Meanwhile, Trump doubled down on immigration and dismissed Harris' vision as a socialist threat. Trump fired at Joe Biden's policies and criticized Harris for aligning with what he called Marxism, claiming that the Biden administration's policies had deteriorated the U.S. economy and led it into economic disaster. Trump also painted Harris as an advocate for Marxism, warning viewers that her economic plans would stifle economic growth.

Harris, in response, dismissed these attacks, emphasizing that her ""opportunity economy"" was aimed at uplifting middle-class families, not just the wealthy elite, drawing a sharp contrast between her inclusive economic vision and Trump's policies, which she argued favored only the rich. Trump, in turn, fired back, stating that Harris' leadership was eroding the economy and depriving the American people of being able to afford basic groceries.

During the debate, Trump repeatedly zeroed in on immigration, noting it as a core issue of American national security and patriotism.

Trump argued that his border policies had kept America safe and emphasized that a softening of these policies under Harris would open the country to job losses, crime, and economic regression. He pointed to his administration's success in implementing tariffs and border security measures as a defense against what he labeled as ""radical socialist"" policies from Harris. His rhetoric on immigration was designed to appeal to his base, framing the border as a frontline issue that threatened the livelihood and safety of everyday Americans.

Harris, on the other hand, aimed to reach voters from a collaborative standpoint, welcoming voters to approach the election with unity and humanity. By leaning into her history as a public servant, Harris aimed to appeal to the people and chart a new path.

In a particularly impassioned moment, Trump began to passionately speak about the harm that undocumented immigrants were causing, citing baseless stories that immigrants were eating pets in Springfield, Ohio -- a claim that moderator David Muir quickly challenged.

The abortion debate was one of the most heated exchanges of the night, with Harris passionately defending Roe v. Wade and women's rights.

Trump accused Harris of advocating for executing babies post-birth; Harris argued that her policies were centered around humanizing the conversation by focusing on the personal toll these decisions would have on families, either because of incest or rape.

Trump, in contrast, reiterated his pro-life stance but admitted that he would consider exceptions for abortion in cases of incest and rape. He positioned himself as the candidate who would protect religious freedom.

At the same time, Harris emphasized the need to separate government from personal medical decisions, particularly for women, and held Trump accountable for putting women through something ""unconscionable."" Harris argued for the reinstatement of Roe v. Wade to set protections in place for women to make collaborative decisions about their healthcare with their providers.

The candidates clashed over their approaches to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. Harris said that it was important to uphold international humanitarian law while supporting Israel's right to defend itself. She criticized Trump's foreign policy approach, suggesting that his presidency had weakened America's global standing and that her administration would pursue a ceasefire and a two-state solution.

Trump, meanwhile, argued that such conflicts would have never happened under his leadership, accusing Harris of abandoning Israel. He also claimed that Iran's growing influence was a direct result of Biden's weak policies, which he said had allowed terror groups like Hamas to thrive.

Trump claimed he could have ended the war between Russia and Ukraine before it began, positioning himself as a proficient leader who commands respect from adversaries like Vladimir Putin. He blamed Biden's ""weak"" foreign policy for allowing the conflict to escalate with no foresight.

Harris, in contrast, defended the Biden administration's support of Ukraine and echoed the need for Americans to stand up for democratic values. She argued that Trump's admiration for dictators like Putin only emboldened autocrats, and that his foreign policy record was filled with mistakes that destabilized global security.

Like with other issues, Trump and Harris offered different views on the state of the American economy. Trump framed his presidency as one of unprecedented economic growth, boasting job creation and record stock market highs.

At the same time, Harris blamed the former Trump administration for the ""worst economy since the Great Depression.""

Trump pointed to inflation and rising gas and grocery prices as evidence of Democratic failure, but Harris fired back by pointing to her economic plans, which she argues would focus on tax relief for middle-class families, investment in clean energy jobs, and $25,000 in assistance for first-time home buyers. Harris also positioned herself as a unifying bridge between both parties, arguing that addressing economic inequality and creating a fair economy would benefit all Americans.

The candidates' debate over national security was a flashpoint, with Trump painting Harris as weak and unprepared to handle global threats. He claimed that during his presidency, countries like China, Russia, and North Korea were ""afraid"" of him, and that his strength had kept the world more stable.

Harris pushed back, challenging Trump's problematic relationships with authoritarian leaders and his tendency to admire dictators. She emphasized the importance of diplomacy, alliances, and upholding America's role as a leader in promoting global security and democracy. Harris also advocated for strength in national security, which means respecting and supporting the U.S. military and its veterans, which she accused Trump of neglecting.

Racial division was another major topic, with Harris accusing Trump of using race to divide the country. She recalled Trump's history of racial discrimination and raised his refusal to rent to Black tenants in the 1970s to his comments on the Central Park Five. The issue of race was brought up when Muir asked Trump about his comments on Harris' race.

Harris, on the other hand, positioned herself as a unifying political figure who would be committed to addressing systemic racism and healing the divisions that have widened under Trump's leadership.

During the debate, the moderator Muir grilled Trump about the January 6th riots at the Capitol and whether he regretted the incident, but the former president did not provide a direct response. Rather, he addressed other topics, challenging the Biden administration for their lackluster response to riots in Minneapolis.

This lack of direct acknowledgment has since drawn attention from critics who have raised concerns about Trump's evasion and his response to the rioters. In contrast, Harris took the opportunity to condemn the violence of January 6, 2021, emphasizing the importance of protecting democratic institutions and holding individuals accountable.

Harris strongly positioned herself as an advocate for climate action and promised to continue expanding renewable energy and reducing America's dependence on fossil fuels. She also criticized Trump's lackadaisical approach to climate change, which Trump dismissed and, in contrast, doubled down on his support for deregulating the fossil fuel industry. He argued that his policies had led to American energy independence, while Harris' plans would cripple the economy with excessive regulations and economy-crippling green initiatives.

Apart from seemingly sidestepping questions about the January 6th riots, Trump also denied any association with Project 2025, a policy agenda outlined by the Heritage Foundation. The initiative, which includes plans to drastically reduce the size of the federal workforce and increase executive power, has been met with both support and criticism from different political factions.

Trump distanced himself from the project during the debate, insisting that it was not part of his campaign strategy, despite speculation about his alignment with its goals. His denial came as part of a broader effort to reframe his policy vision, focusing instead on familiar themes like immigration and the economy, while avoiding detailed discussions on controversial policy proposals tied to his potential second term.

Harris did not hold back when addressing Trump's criminal history during the debate. She pointed to the former president's legal battles, including ongoing investigations and indictments.

Since the debate, political analysts have continued to dissect the two contenders' strategy, responses and optics on the debate stage, with some arguing that both candidates did not answer certain questions around economy, immigration and policy as closely as they should have. With less than eight weeks left to election day, this debate will be critical in moving the needle in terms of who wins America's ultimate vote."

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump squared off in Tuesday night's presidential debate, speaking on a range of issues including inflation, abortion and immigration.

Harris, meanwhile, falsely claimed that Trump ""left us with the worst unemployment since the Great Depression,"" despite the fact that unemployment had fallen to 6.4% by the time Joe Biden took office.

MORE: Following a strong performance Tuesday night, Harris vaulted past Trump to become the bookmaker's favorite to win the election. According to the Election Betting Odds tracker, bookmakers now believe Harris has a 51.8% chance of winning -- a jump of more than four points in 24 hours.

Larry Ellison's wealth soared by nearly $18 billion Tuesday, propelling him to the third spot on Forbes' real-time billionaires list. The Oracle cofounder surpassed both Facebook cofounder Mark Zuckerberg and Europe's richest man Bernard Arnault. Ellison's $191 billion fortune was boosted as shares of his cloud computing firm shot up over 11% following its positive earnings report.

Tron, Tether, and blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs have joined forces to form a strategic alliance focused on curbing cryptocurrency crime. Stablecoins like Tether's USDT are the lifeblood of crypto markets, but with a market cap exceeding $118 billion and more than half of USDT's supply running on Tron, its scale and ease of use have made it a magnet for malicious actors.

South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang led an approximately $3.5 million fundraising round for Episoden, the Seoul-based video chat app. Episoden allows users to video chat one-on-one with people who are looking to practice their English, and the video chat service says it has more than 200,000 users across 165 countries.

Billionaire pop star Taylor Swift endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as her debate with former President Donald Trump concluded Tuesday. Swift told her 283 million Instagram followers that Harris ""fights for the rights and causes I believe [in],"" and praised Harris' running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. She said she decided to issue the endorsement after Trump shared a series of AI images that suggested Swift had endorsed the Republican candidate, which raised fears about ""the dangers of spreading misinformation.""

A man who accused Sean ""Diddy"" Combs of sexually assaulting him at a party almost 30 years ago has won a $100 million default judgment in a civil lawsuit against the music producer and entrepreneur, the Detroit Metro Times first reported. Combs has been accused by several women of sexual misconduct and assault in allegations that span decades, all of which he has denied.

Researchers have long explored the possibility of treating diseases like Parkinson's with cells that are made by reprogramming blood or skin cells to act more like stem cells. Creating these tissues is a costly and laborious process, but biotech startup Cellino is developing self-contained units that can grow personalized treatments for patients on site at their hospital. Now, the company has received a $25 million federal grant, in addition to its $96 million in venture capital funding.

Israel's military said on Tuesday it is ""highly likely"" that American Aysenur Eygi was ""indirectly and unintentionally"" shot and killed by the Israel Defense Force during a protest in the West Bank last week. In response to the report, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the IDF should make ""fundamental changes"" in the way it operates in the West Bank.

TOPLINE UFC 306 on Saturday is the first sporting event to come to the state-of-the-art Las Vegas Sphere, and the fight promotion is pulling out all the stops. Forbes got an exclusive look at the knockout production, which CEO Dana White says is ""a completely different animal than anything we've ever done.""

Initially, no one at the company, including White, had any idea how expensive it would be to stage a promotion at the 18,600-seat venue. When the CFO at TKO Group Holdings, UFC's New York City-based parent company, asked what the budget might be for the event, UFC executive vice president and chief content officer Craig Borsari estimated $8 million. In the end, it cost White and Borsari more than $20 million to realize their vision for UFC 306.

Saturday's spectacle will include six short film segments before each fight, tracking Mexican history from the dawn of man through to hundreds of years in the future, each with its own animated graphics, practical effects and elaborately costumed octagon girls.

The hope is to prove that live sports in the Sphere is viable, and perhaps even spectacular, both for attendees and viewers around the globe.

For TKO, a company founded last September when Ari Emanuel's Endeavor merged UFC and WWE into one $20 billion publicly traded entity, the real money is made from media rights. Some two-thirds of TKO's $851 million in revenue last quarter comes from the category, including UFC's current pact with ESPN, which expires at the end of 2025. Negotiations are expected to begin early next year. In other words, now is the perfect time for a noisy, attention-grabbing event.

WHY IT MATTERS ""Dana White claims that UFC's event at the Sphere will change the way sports broadcasts are thought of forever,"" says Forbes reporter Matt Craig. ""He's no stranger to hyperbole, of course, but if you think about it, the way sports are presented on TV hasn't changed much over the past few decades. UFC 306 is not only a pivotal moment for that company, with billions of dollars in the next media rights negotiation hanging in the balance, but it could present some fresh ideas for others to adopt. A lot of people will be watching closely to see if it succeeds or fails.""

The economy was a key topic at Tuesday night's debate, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump sparring back and forth on issues like inflation. But both Trump and the Biden Administrations oversaw strong economic output and labor markets during their time in office:

3.5%: The annualized expansion of real GDP during President Joe Biden's first three years, compared to 2.7% during Trump's

16.3%: The annualized return of the S&P 500 index under Trump, compared to 11.8% since Biden took office in 2021

19%: The increase in inflation over the first 42 months of Biden's term compared to 6% during Trump's first 42 months

As summer winds down, it's key to adopt effective time management strategies. First, develop a consistent daily routine and break your day into blocks for tasks like meetings, planning, work and relaxation. Designate specific times to check your email and declutter your inbox, and consider a ""dopamine detox"" by limiting your screen time.

Trump claimed ""every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, liberal, conservative, all wanted"" Roe v. Wade to be overturned and the matter be brought back to the states ""where the people could vote, and that's what happened."" This is false, as several legal scholars filed briefs with the Supreme Court to preserve Roe v. Wade, and polls show a large majority of Americans disapprove of its overturning. Harris later retorted Trump's claim: ""You want to talk about this is what people wanted? Pregnant women who want to carry a pregnancy to term, suffering from a miscarriage, being denied care in an emergency room because the health care providers are afraid they might go to jail, and she's bleeding out in a car in the parking lot - she didn't want that."""
11 Important Takeaways From The Historic U.S. Presidential Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sughnenyongo/2024/09/11/11-important-takeaways-from-the-historic-us-presidential-debate/,2024-09-11T04:23:59Z,"In a historic face-off, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump took to the stage in Pennsylvania in a fiery debate for the Oval Office, laying out their sharply contrasting visions for America's future. Moderated by ABC News' David Muir and Linsey Davis, the consequential debate kicked off with immediate tension, with former President Donald Trump focused on his familiar themes: border security and economic recovery, repeatedly pointing to his claim of record-breaking tariffs and tough immigration policies. Harris called out what she framed as Trump's failures -- public health mismanagement, saying Trump's administration had triggered a public health epidemic. Harris also ripped into Trump's recession-prone economic plan and his response to the January 6th attack. Sensitive issues like race, abortion, and voting rights also took center stage, with Harris accusing Trump of worsening the country's divides. Trump was also challenged for his controversial and misleading comments about winning the 2020 election.

The debate, which was distinctly different from the 2020 presidential debate, with no audience, saw the two presidential hopefuls rip into each other's policies, with words like ""weak"" and ""stupid"" thrown about. Here are 11 key takeaways from the US presidential debate.

In the first few minutes of her speech, Harris focused on the middle class, young families, and small businesses, pushing her bold ""opportunity economy"" plan by offering tax breaks for small businesses and a $6,000 tax cut for growing families. Her pledge: to lead as president for all Americans and act as a unifying buffer for both sides. Meanwhile, Donald Trump focused on doubling down on immigration and dismissing Harris's vision as a socialist threat. Trump fired at Joe Biden's policies and criticized Harris for aligning with what he called Marxism, claiming that their policies had deteriorated the US economy and led it into economic disaster. Trump also painted Harris as an advocate for Marxism, warning viewers that her economic plans would stifle economic growth. Harris, in response, dismissed these attacks, emphasizing that her ""opportunity economy"" was aimed at uplifting middle-class families, not just the wealthy elite, drawing a sharp contrast between her inclusive economic vision and Trump's policies, which she argued favored only the rich. Trump, in turn, fired back, stating that Harris' leadership was eroding the economy and depriving the American people of being able to afford basic groceries.

During the debate, Trump repeatedly zeroed in on immigration, noting it as a core issue of American national security and patriotism. Trump argued that his border policies had kept America safe and emphasized that a softening of these policies under Harris would open the country to job losses, crime, and economic regression. He pointed to his administration's success in implementing tariffs and border security measures as a defense against what he labeled as ""radical socialist"" policies from Harris. His rhetoric on immigration was designed to appeal to his base, framing the border as a frontline issue that threatened the livelihood and safety of everyday Americans. Harris, on the other hand, aimed to approach voters from a collaborative standpoint, welcoming voters to approach the election with unity and humanity. By leaning into her history as a public servant, Harris aimed to appeal to the people and chart a new path. In a particularly impassioned moment, Trump began to passionately speak about the harm that undocumented immigrants were causing, citing that immigrants were eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, a claim that moderator David Muir quickly challenged.

The abortion debate was one of the most heated exchanges of the night, with Harris passionately defending Roe v. Wade and women's rights. While Trump accused Harris of advocating for executing babies post-birth, Harris argued that her policies were centered around humanizing the conversation by focusing on the personal toll these decisions would have on families, either because of incest or rape. Trump, in contrast, reiterated his pro-life stance but admitted that he would consider exceptions for abortion in cases of incest and rape. He positioned himself as the candidate who would protect religious freedom. At the same time, Harris emphasized the need to separate government from personal medical decisions, particularly for women, and held Trump accountable for putting women through something ""unconscionable."" Harris argued for the reinstatement of Roe v. Wade to set protections in place for women to make collaborative decisions about their healthcare with their providers.

Both candidates clashed over their approaches to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. Harris said that it was important to uphold international humanitarian law while supporting Israel's right to defend itself. She criticized Trump's foreign policy approach, suggesting that his presidency had weakened America's global standing and that a ceasefire and a two-state solution would be pursued under her administration. Trump, meanwhile, argued that such conflicts would have never happened under his leadership, accusing Harris of abandoning Israel. He also claimed that Iran's growing influence was a direct result of Biden's weak policies, which he said had allowed terror groups like Hamas to thrive.

Trump claimed he could have ended the war between Russia and Ukraine before it began, positioning himself as a proficient leader who commands respect from adversaries like Vladimir Putin. He blamed Biden's ""weak"" foreign policy for allowing the conflict to escalate with no foresight. Harris, in contrast, defended the Biden administration's support of Ukraine and echoed the need for Americans to stand up for democratic values. She argued that Trump's admiration for dictators like Putin only emboldened autocrats, and that his foreign policy record was filled with mistakes that destabilized global security.

Like other raised issues, Trump and Harris offered different views on the state of the American economy. Trump framed his presidency as one of unprecedented economic growth, boasting job creation and record stock market highs. At the same time, Harris blamed the former Trump administration for the ""worst economy since the Great Depression."" He pointed to inflation and rising gas and grocery prices as evidence of Democratic failure, but Harris fired back by pointing to her economic plans, which she argues would focus on tax relief for middle-class families, investment in clean energy jobs, and $25,000 in assistance for first-time home buyers. Harris also positioned herself as a unifying bridge between both parties, arguing that addressing economic inequality and creating a fair economy would benefit all Americans.

The candidates' debate over national security was a flashpoint, with Trump painting Harris as weak and unprepared to handle global threats. He claimed that during his presidency, countries like China, Russia, and North Korea were ""afraid"" of him, and that his strength had kept the world more stable. Harris pushed back, challenging Trump's problematic relationships with authoritarian leaders and his tendency to admire dictators. She emphasized the importance of diplomacy, alliances, and upholding America's role as a leader in promoting global security and democracy. Harris also advocated for strength in national security, which means respecting and supporting the U.S. military and its veterans, which she accused Trump of neglecting.

Racial division was another major topic, with Harris accusing Trump of using race to divide the country. She recalled Trump's history of racial discrimination and raised his refusal to rent to Black tenants in the 1970s to his comments on the Central Park Five. The issue of race was brought up when Muir asked Trump about his comments on Harris' race. Harris, on the other hand, positioned herself as a unifying political figure who would be committed to addressing systemic racism and healing the divisions that have widened under Trump's leadership.

During the debate, David Muir grilled Trump about the January 6th riots at the Capitol and whether he regretted the incident, but the former president did not provide a direct response. Rather, he addressed other topics, challenging the Biden administration for their lackluster response to the riots in Minneapolis. This lack of direct acknowledgment has since drawn attention from critics who have raised concerns about Trump's evasion and his response to the rioters. In contrast, Harris took the opportunity to condemn the violence of January 6, 2021, emphasizing the importance of protecting democratic institutions and holding individuals accountable.

Harris strongly positioned herself as an advocate for climate action and promised to continue expanding renewable energy and reducing America's dependence on fossil fuels. She also criticized Trump's lackadaisical approach to climate change, which Trump dismissed and, in contrast, doubled down on his support for deregulating the fossil fuel industry. He argued that his policies had led to American energy independence, while Harris's plans would cripple the economy with excessive regulations and economy-crippling green initiatives.

Apart from seemingly sidestepping questions about the January 6th riots, Trump also denied any association with Project 2025, a policy agenda outlined by the Heritage Foundation to take over the federal government. The initiative, which includes plans to drastically reduce the size of the federal workforce and increase executive power, has been met with both support and criticism from different political factions. Trump distanced himself from the project during the debate, insisting that it was not part of his campaign strategy, despite speculation about his alignment with its goals. His denial came as part of a broader effort to reframe his policy vision, focusing instead on familiar themes like immigration and the economy, while avoiding detailed discussions on controversial policy proposals tied to his potential second term.

Harris did not hold back when addressing Trump's criminal history during the debate. She pointed to the former president's legal battles, including ongoing investigations and indictments. Since the debate, political analysts have continued to dissect the two contenders' strategy, responses and optics on the debate stage, with some arguing that both candidates did not answer certain questions around economy, immigration and policy as closely as they should have. With less than eight weeks left to election day, this debate will be critical in moving the needle in terms of who wins America's ultimate vote."
"Harris And Trump's Biggest Celebrity Endorsements: Taylor Swift, Matt Damon And More",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/maryroeloffs/2024/09/10/harris-and-trumps-biggest-celebrity-endorsements-taylor-swift-matt-damon-and-more/,2024-09-11T03:31:04Z,"Celebrity voices have entered the 2024 presidential race in a variety of ways in recent weeks, and some of the biggest names in politics and in Hollywood have lent their voices to a particular candidate in hopes of moving the needle this November.

A number of the biggest names in Hollywood came out in support of Biden before he dropped out of the race, before turning their support to Harris. Olivia Rodrigo, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris by sharing a video of a speech the vice president gave promising to ""stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans."" Major Democratic fundraiser George Clooney, who used a New York Times essay to call for Biden to drop out of the race, lent his support to Harris and Barbra Streisand said she would support Harris because of her vow to fight for reproductive rights. Musician John Legend, who performed at the Democratic National Convention in 2024, posted he was ""so ready"" for a Harris presidency. Director Spike Lee, ""West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin, director Ken Burns and Star Wars actor Mark Hamill threw their support behind Harris, along with actresses Rosie O'Donnell and Jamie Lee Curtis. Robert De Niro, who narrated an advertisement for the Biden campaign, praised the president's ""selfless patriotism"" in a statement that did not mention Harris but said ""there is nothing more important for our country than defeating Donald Trump at the ballot box."" British pop artist Charli XCX brought Harris into the Gen Z fold by tweeting ""kamala IS brat,"" an endorsement that was met by Harris' team changing the background photo on her X account to the ""brat"" green color and using the same font used on Charli XCX's album of the same name. Rapper Cardi B, who in May said she wouldn't be endorsing Biden, tweeted ""AHAHAHAHA LETS GOOOOO I TOLD YALLL KAMALA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 2024 candidate...."" Pop musician Kesha said she plans to support Harris in November and, when asked how she felt about Republican Vice Presidential candidate JD Vance, responded ""f -- - that man."" Beyonc√© has not made a public endorsement but did give the Harris campaign permission to use her song ""Freedom"" in a video of her first official visit to her campaign's headquarters, a rare approval from the superstar musician. Beyonc√©'s mom and businesswoman Tina Knowles endorsed Harris with an Instagram post. Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle and former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have also thrown their support behind Harris. Former President Jimmy Carter, 99, reportedly told his son last week he was trying to make it to his 100th birthday so he could cast his vote for Kamala Harris. ""Sex in the City"" actress and former New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon threw her support behind Harris and her Vice Presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, in a post that read: ""I'm Walzing on air!"" Billionaire Mark Cuban, who previously said he was committed to voting for Biden, has also supported Harris and endorsed Walz as her running mate, calling him someone who ""can sit at the kitchen table and make you feel like you have know him forever."" Actor Tony Goldwyn, Republican political commentator Ana Navarro, comedian Mindy Kaling and actress Kerry Washington each supported the Harris-Walz campaign by hosting one evening of the Democratic National Convention.

Former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan ripped off his shirt while on stage at the Republican National Convention last month to reveal a Trump-Vance campaign shirt underneath, and called Trump his ""hero"" and the ""greatest president of the United States."" Musician Kid Rock has been vocal about his support of Trump in the past and at the RNC revamped his song ""American Bad Ass"" to include references to Trump. UFC President and personality Dana White called Trump the ""toughest, most resilient human being."" Rapper and reality TV star Amber Rose gave a speech at the RNC in support of Trump. Country music stars Chris Janson and Jason Aldean also appeared at the convention. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy in January said voting for Trump over Biden was a ""no-brainer."" Public-facing billionaires like Elon Musk and Steve Wynn have also supported the former president. Actress Rosanne Barr, a longtime conservative supporter of Trump, clapped back at Cuban's endorsement of the Harris-Walz ticket and called the VP pick ""another reason Harris is a disaster."" Actor Jon Voight has defended Trump on multiple occasions. 50 Cent's 2023 song ""Many Men (Wish Death)"" started trending online after the assassination attempt of Trump last month. The rapper responded by putting Trump's face on the cover of his ""Get Rich or Die Tryin.'"" While it's hard to call the response an official endorsement, he did appear to support the president in 2020 before apparently backtracking. Other celebrities who have supported Trump in the past, but not outright endorsed him yet this election season, include Lil Wayne and ""Happy Days"" star Scott Baio.

Notable names missing from the list of public supporters include billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who called the decision ""too important to rush,"" and Taylor Swift, who pledged support for Biden last election cycle, has not come out for a candidate."
"In New Hampshire, An Attempt To Overturn A Landmark School Funding Decision",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petergreene/2024/09/10/in-new-hampshire-an-attempt-to-overturn-a-landmark-school-funding-decision/,2024-09-11T01:12:26Z,"Last year, Pennsylvania joined the roster of states under a court ordered by the court to get their school funding house in order. In 2021, a North Carolina judge ordered the state to fix funding inequity with $1,75 billion of additional monies. In 2012, the court ruled that Washington was not adequately funding its schools. Other states have faced similar court challenges to their school funding, some successful and some not.

But even when these lawsuits succeed, legislatures can have a long and difficult time meeting the court demands. Finding the political will to meet the requirements over decades can be challenging.

An early landmark case of this sort was Claremont School District v. Governor of News Hampshire. The case bounced around the courts for most of the 90s until the court finally declared that the state's funding system was unconstitutional, leaving poorer districts struggling with inadequate funding. Ruled the court:

While the State may delegate its obligation to provide a constitutionally adequate public education to local school districts, it may not do so in a form underscored by unreasonable and inequitable tax burdens.

Thirty years after the case was launched, the state failed to fix the system, with the results so unsatisfactory that New Hampshire's school funding was declared unconstitutional again last year.

That second ruling came from Contoocook Valley School District v. The State of New Hampshire, and the State Supreme Court has issued a stay based on the argument that the $537,6 million price tag would cause the state to ""suffer irreparable harm.""

Contoocook has been appealed, and in an amicus brief filed with the State Supreme Court, Republican legislators have proposed a simple solution -- throw out the original Claremont decision.

Speaker of the House Sherman Packard, along with 28 members of the Republican House caucus and two GOP senators, have filed an amicus brief arguing that the Claremont suit was incorrectly decided. The brief is by Gregory Sorg, a former GOP representative (2002-2008) who has been a longtime critic of Claremont.

Sorg's argument is novel, resting largely on Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito's ruling overturning of Roe v. Wade. Michael Kitch, reporting for NH Business Review, notes that the sixteen-page brief includes eleven pages about abortion jurisprudence with nine of those about Alito's Roe opinion.

Sorg argues for separation of powers, claiming the court was exercising powers it does not have. He also argues that, as with Roe, the court has failed to correctly understand the historical origin of a constitutional right, and that the court has the power to overturn a precedent that is ""egregiously wrong."" The constitution, he argues, simply says that the legislature has the ability to compel local districts to raise adequate funding and does not require the state to make sure that all schools are fairly and equitably funded.

NH School Funding Fairness Project Executive Director Zack Sheehan's response was quoted by columnist Garry Rayno:

Instead of owning up to their failure to adequately fund education in compliance with the Claremont rulings, these legislators are instead arguing that Claremont should be thrown out. They are trying to blame the Court for their own failure to comply with the Court's rulings over the past 30 years. And this begs the question, what do they think the State's role in funding education should be?

Currently the state pays a base amount of $4,404 per student. In the 2022-2023 school year, the average cost per pupil was $24,234. The NH School Funding Fairness Project found that in 2023, state and federal funds covered only 17.47% of costs for students with special needs. Using state data, the funding fairness project computes that state a federal funding covers only 30% of the revenues funding NH public schools."
Questions For The Kamala Harris And Donald Trump Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanmichelson2/2024/09/10/questions-for-the-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-debate/,2024-09-11T00:17:13Z,"As Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump do their last minute preparations for tonight's debate, I queried a handful of experts for questions they suggest - or would like - to be asked, and tossed in a few of my own.

Here are proposed questions the moderators might want to use:

2. Do you believe in democracy? What is your definition of democracy?

3. The peaceful transfer of power is a fundamental principle of democracy. You and Vice President Harris never met in person before tonight because you refused to attend the peaceful transfer of power during the inauguration. Why didn't you attend?

4. You have repeatedly threatened there would be violence, including referring to a ""bloodbath,"" if you lose this election. We experienced that on January 6th when your supporters stormed the Capitol and tried to hang Vice President Mike Pence. Why are you promoting violence?

5. How will you bring the American people together after the election if you win when at least half the public thinks you are unfit to be president again?

7. You repeatedly say that the United States is a failing nation, yet inflation is now lower than it was when you left office, the stock market has achieved historic highs, unemployment is lower than it was when you took office. The U.S. economy has rebounded faster and better than any other nation after the pandemic. What metrics do you have for describing the U.S. economy as failing?

8. The Inflation Reduction Act is pumping billions of dollars in to Republican-dominated, so called ""red"" states, including Texas, Florida, and Georgia, creating thousands of new jobs and boosting those states' economies. Members of Congress and Senators who voted against those bills have even taken credit for them with their constituents and shown up at ribbon cuttings for projects funded by them. If you are re-elected, you have claimed on the campaign trail that you'll reverse this legislation. Why would you undo all that economic growth across the country?

9. The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued its final climate risk disclosure rules, which are on hold as legal challenges work their way through the system. However, investors have been clamoring for such rules for years, because of the measurable financial risks of climate change as visible in the devastation to communities, homes and businesses from extreme weather events. The financial markets see these rules as a way to measure the financial risk companies are taking and how they are preparing for it. Other countries have similar rules and companies that do business overseas need to meet most of those rules too, so they have to do the same reporting. What action would you take regarding those climate rules?

10. You appointed U.S. Supreme Court judges who would overturn Roe v. Wade and bragged about it. Yet, you have changed your position on abortion over the years. What is your position on abortion and reproductive rights?

1. You have pivoted positions on fracking and oil and gas. Why did you change positions and what is your position today on fracking and can the American people trust that you will stick to that position this time?

2. The Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Act that you helped develop and pass include billions of dollars for energy projects, including mostly clean energy, but also carbon capture and natural gas, which favor the oil and gas sectors. But permitting challenges cause these and other energy and infrastructure projects to take as long as seven years in some cases. What specifically will you do to expedite the permitting process without compromising the analysis of the potential impact on the environment and communities?

3. President Biden angered the environmental community by approving the Willow pipeline and allowing some oil and gas drilling in public lands. What is your position on pipelines and why?

4. What is your position on nuclear energy and why? How will you ensure that communities with even the small nuclear reactors are safe?

5. During the campaign and at the Democratic National Convention, climate change and related policies seem to have been sidelined. There were a couple of very short presentations related to it at the convention, but all the mentions focused on clean air and water and not on the impact of climate change. Why and how much importance will addressing climate change have in your administration?

6. Many areas of the country have repeatedly had devastating hurricanes and floods, yet communities continue to rebuild in those areas, putting their lives, homes, businesses and communities at risk. Some insurance companies have even pulled out of those areas because they are tired of the high payouts. NOAA and other scientists predict that these storms will become more ferocious and more frequent and, therefore, potentially more damaging and life-threatening. Extreme weather events over the past 30-40 years have already cost nearly $3 trillion, according to NOAA. Will your administration put limits on where people can rebuild after such devastating weather events?

7. If elected, will you propose to increase the number of seats on the U.S. Supreme Court? If so, how and why?

. During the Biden-Harris administration, the influx of undocumented immigrants at the border hit historic highs. The numbers are much lower now, down to levels from when you and President Biden took office. What will your border and immigration policies be in your new administration and how will you get them passed if you have a divided Congress and Senate?

9. Most Americans want abortion to be safe, legal and rare, and there are millions of people who are offended by abortion as well. When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and turned these decisions over to the states, about 26 state legislatures passed bans of some level on abortion rights and their governors signed them into law. What will your abortion policy be that respects the various choices of all Americans on this issue?

10. Polling on the American electorate reflects that there is a great deal of divisiveness in the country. If you are elected, there will still be millions of people who did not vote for you and who support the very different policies of Mr. Trump. How will you bring such a divided country together if you are elected?

And then there are plenty of foreign policy questions, related to Israel and Gaza, Ukraine and Russia, China, The European Union and beyond."
What We Know About Kamala Harris' Policy Agenda Before Tonight's Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/09/10/what-we-know-about-kamala-harris-policy-agenda-before-tonights-debate/,2024-09-10T14:01:47Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris will face off against former President Donald Trump at Tuesday's debate, where she's expected to be asked about a range of policy views -- and while the Harris campaign updated its website Sunday to elaborate on her platform, she still has not given many concrete policy proposals outside of economic issues.

Harris has broadly said she wants to support the middle class as president, proposing what she has dubbed an ""opportunity economy."" Tax-wise, that includes expanding the child tax credit -- including $6,000 for newborns in their first year and $3,600 per child in middle and lower-income families -- along with restoring the Earned Income Tax Credit for citizens who earn less than $63,398 and a pledge not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400,000 per year. The vice president also wants to go after price gouging for grocery store prices -- a proposal that economists have had mixed feelings about -- and target housing affordability. She has proposed giving $25,000 in assistance to first-time homebuyers and establishing tax credits for developers to build starter homes and affordable rental units, with a plan for a $40 billion ""innovation fund"" to address the housing crisis. Her administration would also boost small businesses by expanding a startup tax deduction from $5,000 to $50,000. After the Biden administration imposed a $35 monthly insulin cap for seniors, Harris has also called for expanding that to all Americans, along with a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket prescription costs. She said she will also work with states to abolish medical debt and expand Affordable Care Act subsidies. Harris said at the Democratic National Convention her administration would ""protect Social Security and Medicare,"" and her website notes it will ""strengthen"" those programs by raising taxes on high-income earners.

In addition to economic policies dedicated to boosting the middle class, Harris is also targeting higher taxes for the richest Americans, saying on her website the wealthy and large corporations will ""pay their fair share."" The campaign website outlines proposals to accomplish that including rolling back Trump-era tax cuts on the wealthy and implementing a ""billionaire minimum tax"" that imposes a 25% tax rate and taxes unrealized gains. She also proposes ""quadrupling"" the tax on stock buybacks and imposing a 28% long-term capital gains tax for people earning $1 million or more annually. That proposal is actually lower than the 39.6% rate that Biden has previously proposed, however, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has called for the vice president to ""go higher.""

Harris told CNN she does not support a ban on fracking, reversing an earlier position she held prior to 2020. The vice president did back climate change initiatives, telling CNN the ""climate crisis is real"" and ""it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time."" That being said, Harris explained she has learned that ""we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking."" The vice president's website otherwise points to the Biden administration's work on climate change and states Harris' platform ""advances environmental justice, protects public lands and public health, increases resilience to climate disasters, lowers household energy costs, creates millions of new jobs, and continues to hold polluters accountable to secure clean air and water for all"" -- but does not provide any concrete proposals.

While critics on the right have tried to paint Harris as Biden's ""border czar"" -- a position she never actually held -- Harris has faced pressure to outline her views on immigration. She told CNN she still wants to pass the bipartisan border bill that she blames former President Donald Trump for helping to kill earlier this year. Harris walked back earlier statements she made during the 2020 primary suggesting she wanted to decriminalize border crossings, telling CNN, ""We have laws that have to be followed and enforced that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally. And there should be consequences."" On its website, the Harris campaign said the vice president ""knows that our immigration system is broken,"" calling for ""comprehensive reform"" including bolstering border security measures and an ""earned pathway to citizenship.""

Harris told CNN she is ""unequivocal"" and ""unwavering in my commitment to Israel's defense and its ability to defend itself. And that's not going to change."" She pushed for a ceasefire deal with a two-state solution, saying any resolution must also ensure ""the Palestinians have security and self-determination and dignity,"" and her website suggests she would not make any changes to the Biden administration's approach to addressing the conflict. Harris also made comments in support of Ukraine during her convention speech and on her website, though she did not give specifics about any policies or level of aid she would support. The vice president has touted her work in helping Ukraine under Biden and said, ""As president, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies.""

Harris has made her support for reproductive rights a key part of her candidacy after advocating on the issue as vice president, and has heavily opposed attacks on the procedure by Trump and Project 2025 -- a right-wing agenda not formally affiliated with his campaign. She said at the convention and on her website she will sign a bill legalizing abortion into law if elected, which most abortion rights activists have interpreted as her calling for a return to the standard set under Roe v. Wade, in which abortion is allowed nationwide until the fetus is viable. Harris will ""never"" sign an abortion ban into law, her website states.

Harris called at the convention for passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. The John Lewis Voting Rights Act builds on the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and addresses parts of that bill that have been struck down by the Supreme Court, strengthening voting rights protections and restoring a requirement for states to get approval from the Justice Department to enact voting rules. The Freedom to Vote Act would impose sweeping measures like universal early voting, no-excuse voting by mail and automatic voter registration, along with adding protections against gerrymandering and reforming campaign finance laws to strengthen transparency and tighten rules around super PACs. Beyond voting, Harris' website also points to her longtime support for LGBTQ rights and said she will fight to pass the Equality Act that would codify anti-discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity into law.

Harris' website emphasizes she will work so that ""Americans have the freedom to live safe from gun violence,"" specifically backing proposals including bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, universal background checks and red flag laws. She also backs funding for law enforcement and said she would strengthen ""proven gun violence prevention programs."" Her calls to invest in law enforcement come after the Trump campaign has attacked Harris by claiming she wanted to ""defund the police,"" pointing to statements she made during the 2020 racial justice movement expressing some support for that movement -- though she never explicitly said she wanted to defund law enforcement.

In light of a series of controversial rulings by the conservative-leaning Supreme Court, Harris followed Biden in backing a series of reforms to the court, with her website singling out term limits and a binding code of ethics like lower federal judges have to follow. The candidate also expressed support for a federal measure that would undo the Supreme Court's ruling giving Trump and other ex-presidents some immunity from criminal charges, but her website did not specify whether Harris backs negating that ruling through a new constitutional amendment, as Biden supports, or via legislation.

Harris -- whose running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, is a veteran of the Army National Guard -- said on her campaign website that she will take increased steps to support veterans and their families. The website singles out steps like trying to end homelessness among veterans by investing in mental health and suicide prevention programs and eliminating barriers to employment for veterans. The Harris campaign said she will also ""[expand] economic opportunities"" for active duty military families and veterans, but did not specify any concrete proposals.

While her website does now mention a range of issues, she has not released the kind of detailed policy proposals on other issues that she did with the economy, and her website only briefly mentions any more concrete plans on each topic. The Democratic Party has released a platform that includes more detailed proposals, but it was drafted while Biden was still the nominee, so it's unclear if Harris would change those policies were she in office. The vice president has been willing to go beyond Biden's proposals with some issues she's released proposals on so far, such as supporting law enforcement's ability to go after companies for price gouging and raising the amount of assistance first-time home buyers should receive from $10,000 to $25,000.

Whether any of Harris' proposals will change before November. The New York Times reported in August that some of the vice president's big-money donors have asked her to tone down her proposal on taxing the ultra-rich, after she said she supported policies that would tax wealthy Americans on their ""unrealized gains"" -- meaning money that investors have made through assets like stocks, but haven't yet sold for a profit. Donors have reportedly brought their concerns up to Harris' campaign advisors and the candidate herself, and have claimed they do see some room for flexibility in her specific proposals. ""In my interactions with [the campaign], the key is she focuses on her values and is not an ideologue about any particular program,"" billionaire Mark Cuban told the Times. Harris defended changes in her specific policy views over the years to CNN, saying that while specifics of policies she supports may evolve, ""the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed.""

Trump and his campaign have slammed Harris' policies as being too far-left and ""radical."" ""If Kamala's goal was to confirm she's a Radical Left lunatic -- mission accomplished,"" the Trump campaign said in an email to press after Harris' CNN interview aired.

Harris took over as the Democratic nominee in July after Biden suddenly dropped out of the race, with the president endorsing Harris minutes after he announced he was stepping down and Democratic leaders quickly coalescing around the vice president. She had no challengers for the nomination. Harris' policy platform has become a key question her campaign has faced in the weeks since she became the nominee, and while the candidate released her economic agenda and highlighted it in an August 16 speech, those remarks are still the only substantive speech on her policy proposals she has given thus far. The vice president and running mate Gov. Tim Walz sat down with CNN in August following weeks of pressure for Harris to speak with the press, with the Trump campaign claiming the Democrat was ""ducking the media"" by refusing to do a one-on-one interview. Harris had previously only answered shouted questions from reporters and spoke with social media influencers at the convention. Her website had also not had an ""issues"" section previously, further inflaming criticism of not being upfront about her policies."

The ""platform"" section of Trump's campaign website now lists a set of 20 vague priorities, which are the same as those in the Republican National Committee's formal platform and often overlap with his previous Agenda47 proposals. The proposals now outlined on the website include ""seal[ing]

Trump's Agenda47 is distinct from Project 2025, a potential policy blueprint for the next conservative administration -- namely Trump's -- developed by the Heritage Foundation along with other third-party groups. While Agenda47 was released directly by the Trump campaign, the ex-president has said he doesn't have any involvement with Project 2025 and has attempted to distance himself from it, even as the 900-page policy guidebook was created with help from more than 100 people who served in his administration. Trump has also praised the Heritage Foundation's policy work in the past. The two policy proposals do have many commonalities -- like calling to leave the Paris Climate Agreement, kicking out career bureaucrats, pushing ""school choice"" policies and railing against transgender rights -- and it's unclear how much of Project 2025 Trump could choose to implement if he's elected.

Many of the items in Agenda47 and Project 2025 would probably require acts of Congress, but both agendas have proposed expanding the president's control over the executive branch. Trump's Agenda47 proposes reviving Trump's 2020 executive order (which Biden rescinded) that makes it significantly easier to replace career civil servants with political appointees. He also wants to ""overhaul federal departments and agencies"" to get rid of ""corrupt actors,"" crack down on government leakers and implement a ""Truth and Reconciliation Commission"" to fight what the GOP calls the ""Deep State.""

Since the last Agenda47 video was released in December 2023, Trump has announced other policy proposals separate from those released under the Agenda47 heading. On abortion, Trump has said he believes that the issue should be left to the states -- though many abortion rights advocates still believe he'd restrict abortion if elected. He and the GOP have also vowed mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, which is not mentioned in Agenda47's immigration plans. He's also pushed to eliminate the federal income tax on tips for service workers. Over the weekend, Trump called for mass arrests and prosecutions of people who oppose his claims on voter fraud, which he claims would include ""Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters & Corrupt Election Officials.""

What Trump will do once in office if he's elected. Trump's initial Agenda47 was released during the primary election and with the proposals on his website now offering much less detail, it's still unclear what policies Trump could actually impose if elected. The ex-president has tacked slightly more to the center in the general election on issues like abortion, but it remains to be seen what policies he would adopt once he's back in the White House.

In addition to proposals around more expected issues like immigration, education and defense, Trump's Agenda47 also includes a proposal for ""freedom cities,"" as the ex-president has called for using federal land to create up to 10 new cities, which would be roughly the size of Washington, D.C. Plans for the cities would be chosen via a nationwide contest, and Politico reported in March 2023 Trump's proposal includes investing in ""vertical takeoff-and-landing vehicles"" akin to human-sized drones and ""baby bonuses"" in hopes of staving off a declining birth rate.

Trump will debate Harris Tuesday night, marking the first time the two candidates have gone head-to-head since President Joe Biden left the race. The ex-president released his Agenda47 videos as he faced what was initially a crowded field of Republican primary candidates, though Trump ultimately proved to be the clear frontrunner, clinching the nomination in March. The GOP's policy proposals have come under increased scrutiny in recent months -- particularly as Democrats used the controversial Project 2025 to oppose Trump's candidacy while President Joe Biden faced criticism over his age -- though Project 2025 and Agenda47 have both been published since last year."

2.8. That's how many points Harris leads Trump by, according to FiveThirtyEight's polling average. Prior to Harris launching her candidacy on July 21, Trump led Biden in polls. Harris was up 3.7 points over Trump by Aug. 23, a high in her polling average, according to FiveThirtyEight.

The debate will run live on ABC and most other major networks at 9 p.m. on Tuesday, and on the ABC News Live streaming network, Disney+ and Hulu.

The economy, immigration and abortion are expected to be major topics in Tuesday's debate. Previewing his attacks on Harris, Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said the former president will link her to Biden's economic policies and highlight the more left-leaning proposals she endorsed during her 2020 presidential campaign. Harris, meanwhile, is widely expected to contrast her own background as a prosecutor with Trump's criminal record, highlight his role in Roe v. Wade's reversal and criticize his Project 2025 agenda. The debate is especially high stakes for Harris as she has spent only a month on the campaign trail and voters are less familiar with her background and policy proposals.

Trump said earlier this month he also agreed to a Sept. 4 debate on Fox News and that the ABC debate would be Sept. 25. His campaign quickly clarified the ABC debate would be Sept. 10 and NBC News would host the Sept. 25 debate, though Harris has only agreed to the Sept. 10 debate so far. An NBC spokesperson also indicated the date Trump floated was not official, according to CBS News, which reported the spokesperson said the network has had conversations with both campaigns about a range of dates.

Yes -- Oct. 1 on CBS.

Trump agreed last month to debate Harris after suggesting he might back out amid a feud over the rules. The rules for the ABC News debate mirror the ones Trump and Biden followed during the June 27 debate on CNN, including no live audience and muted microphones. Biden's rocky performance during that debate led him to drop out of the race and endorse Harris, following a weeks-long revolt by many top Democrats. Trump repeatedly waffled over whether he would debate Harris, bashing the network as biased.

It's unclear. The former first lady made a rare appearance at the Republican National Convention in July, and she issued a public statement on X criticizing President Joe Biden, while promoting her new book. ""It has become increasingly apparent that there are significant challenges to free speech as demonstrated by the efforts to silence my husband,"" she said in the statement.

Trump's campaign in 2020 argued against then-host Commission on Presidential Debates' decision to turn off mics during the second debate following repeated interruptions from Trump during the first debate.
