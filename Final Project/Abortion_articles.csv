DOJ accuses popular gym chain of discriminating against disabled people,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/doj-accuses-popular-gym-chain-discriminating-disabled-people,2024-10-08T21:48:53Z,"A man is in jail after he stabbed another man in the buttocks after an alleged dispute over a workout machine. (FOX 7)

The Department of Justice (DOJ) is accusing LA Fitness of discriminating against disabled people in a lawsuit that was announced on Tuesday.

In a press release published by the DOJ, the agency explained that it was suing Fitness International LLC - the company that owns LA Fitness - for ""discriminating against people with disabilities at its gym and fitness clubs.""

The DOJ is asking the Central District of California to ""stop LA Fitness from discriminating against people with disabilities, including by requiring LA Fitness to make its facilities and equipment accessible.""

According to the DOJ, LA Fitness discriminated against disabled people because some of the chain's amenities were not sufficiently accessible. The press release referenced broken pool lifts, broken elevators and broken equipment.

The chain is also accused of charging disabled patrons an extra fee for certain services. The lawsuit seeks money damages for the people who were ""harmed by LA Fitness's discrimination.""

""This includes people who were directly harmed by LA Fitness's barriers to access and broken equipment, as well people who need help to use LA Fitness's clubs and were charged extra fees to have a friend, nurse or personal assistant help them use LA fitness facilities,"" the press release noted.

LA Fitness, one of the largest chain gyms in the U.S., operates nearly 700 clubs across the country. The DOJ's lawsuit hinges on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which was passed in 1990 to ""establish a clear and comprehensive prohibition of discrimination on the basis of disability.""

""The ADA requires LA Fitness to give people with disabilities equal access to LA Fitness's services and facilities, remove architectural barriers to make its facilities accessible to people with disabilities and maintain accessible features,"" the DOJ argued.

""The ADA also prohibits LA Fitness from charging extra fees to people with disabilities.""

In a statement, Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said that access to physical health activities is ""crucial for promoting the health and well-being of all individuals, including those with disabilities.""

""For over 30 years, the ADA has prohibited gyms and fitness clubs like LA Fitness from denying patrons with disabilities the opportunity to use and enjoy facilities enjoyed by patrons without disabilities,"" Clarke said. ""Through this lawsuit, the department seeks to remedy LA Fitness's discriminatory actions and ensure that patrons with disabilities have equal access to fully participate at their local LA Fitness gym and fitness clubs.""

What Working Millennials Of Color Are Feeling About Project 2025,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasminebrowley/2024/10/08/what-working-millennials-of-color-are-feeling-about-project-2025/,2024-10-08T20:16:05Z,"Project 2025, a manifesto created by the conservative organization The Heritage Project and a playbook of likely actions to be taken within the first 180 days in office if Donald Trump is elected (despite his protestations about the plan). Although the sweeping proposal touches on everything from critical race theory to abortion bans, one of the most immediately concerning parts of the plan is how will affect the future of work for millennials workers of color.

Some of the agenda focuses on proposed changes to workplace policies that could adversely affect workers' pay, security, and right to organize against grievances.

For instance, Project 2025 outlines a concerted slashing to overtime pay for workers' leaving with smaller take home pay. Data shows millennials are still the hardest working generation in comparison to Gen X and Gen z, the two age group millennials are sandwiched between.

The plan also proposed that eliminating the Biden administration-led rule that raised the salary threshold to $58,656 and expanded the protection to 4.3 million more workers. Project 2025 reads like it is aiming to help business owners and investors save money over time by skimping on employee protections, but the plan could make way for larger financial disasters.

Project 2025 includes details that rolls back post-crisis policies that protect consumers, investors, and the stability of financial markets by limiting regulators' ability to step in during periods of volatility. This includes putting a stranglehold on the Federal Reserve's ""lender-of-last-resort"" function in which failing banks are able to borrow emergency funds to stay solvent.

An example of this can be seen in the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) crisis in which the Federal Reserve and other regulators stepped in to ensure the bank's customers would have access to their funds by the next day - beyond just the $250,000 guaranteed by the FDIC. The bank's potential collapse could've devastated a number of Black businesses and employees since Silicon Valley Bank has been one of the most pivotal in aiming to help narrow the funding chasm for Black founders, as ESSENCE points out.

""We all know that young Black founders get a fraction of the business loans and venture capital their non-Black counterparts get,"" Shila Nieves Burney of Zane VC says.

Zane VC, a firm that boasts an investment catalog of young startups aims to address the health equity gap, in the most effective way it can, through infusions of much needed capital. Nieves Burney says that if Project 2025's proposed actions are implemented, already vulnerable Black and Brown workers could be in dire straights.

""I'm sitting on the side of the table where Black women typically aren't seated,"" she says. ""I get to push against the narrative that Black founders don't exist and ensure they get the funding they deserve but my job will be made harder if these proposed restrictions get implemented.""

Another lynchpin in the workforce section of proposed initiatives of Project 2025 is its plan to address DEI, which is often described as an attack on America's progress by conservatives.

""The next conservative President must make the institutions of American civil society hard targets for woke culture warriors,"" Project 2025 authors write. ""This starts with deleting the terms sexual orientation and gender identity (""SOGI""), diversity, equity, and inclusion (""DEI""), gender, gender equality, gender equity, gender awareness, gender-sensitive, abortion, reproductive health, reproductive rights, and any other term used to deprive Americans of their First Amendment rights out of every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists.""

Dominic K. Hawkins, Vice President Of Communications at the NAACP says the proposed roll backs to DEI efforts will cause great harm to the country.

""Project 2025's policies will weaken civil rights protections, increase workplace discrimination, and ultimately set us back years,"" Hawkins says. ""As a Black professional who has worked across private and public sectors, I've seen how DEI practices only strengthen organizations and give opportunities that our community might be barred from due to the legacy of enslavement and systemic racism. If Project 2025 is enacted, what's to stop companies from blocking my application even when I'm more qualified? Nothing! And there would be no federally powered recourse.""

He adds, ""On top of that, it could create a dearth Black leaders at the top of organizations, who can't then help guide operations and they wouldn't be able to serve as role models and mentors for the next generation. As a Black executive, I wouldn't be where I am today with out sponsors at the C-level. Project 2025 would seek to wipe that out.""

The far reaching plan not only has the ability to touch business owners and corporate leaders, but content creator community as well. Quentin ""Funky Dineva"" Latham and Patrick ""Mr. Jones X"" Jones both expressed their fear for what's to come if the project is fully rolled out.

""It's terrifying, honestly,"" Latham says. He hosts a video podcast on his Youtube channel, which boasts more than 440k subscribers. Although he generates income from his broadcasts, Latham shares that government sanctions on DEI-driven initiatives could affect growth opportunities, including strict censoring rules that could impact the way he creates content.

Jones, on the other hand, shares fears of how his overall safety could be affected since he is a public figure that often comments on hot-button political topics. His combined social media pages boast more than 100k followers.

""Some people that existed on the TikTok platform that weren't very fond of my messaging {about Project 2025 potential ills} found out where I lived and sent the law enforcement to my house, which is where I work,"" Jones stated. ""I do believe that action is a direct manifestation of that group feeling emboldened by the conservative right's anti-DEI push.""

Overall, he says this is the apt time for working millennials like himself to empower and educate themselves about the future of work, and how the upcoming election could affect it.

""Be willing to learn more about the policies that can affect your life and do something about it,"" Jones advises. ""Use that as a motivation to stay the course. Never stop having the important conversations because it could be the difference between living the life you worked for, or having it shift in ways you could never imagine."""
Inside Project 2025 And Its Connection To Donald Trump,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2024/10/08/inside-project-2025-and-its-connection-to-donald-trump/,2024-10-08T20:15:42Z,"There has been a lot of discussion about Trump's connection to Project 2025, a 922-page document, written by the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation. Is the Democrat's assertion that Trump is connected to the effort, correct? What does Project 2025 actually say? Project 2025 contains a multitude of items, more than we can cover in this article.

Is Trump connected to Project 2025? According to the slightly left leaning newspaper USA Today, this is a false assertion (read more here). The slightly right leaning NY Post also refutes the notion that Trump is connected to it. CNN has gone on record to say that Harris has made false claims about Trump and Project 2025. She said Trump, if elected, would cut Social Security. While the document says very little about Social Security, it does not propose cuts in the program (read more here).

Why then are Democrats claiming a Trump connection to Project 2025? In this hotly contested political race, each party is looking for ways to attack the credibility of the other and instill fear in the electorate to garner votes. To accomplish this, each party has made assertions about their opponent with the hope that it will resonate in the minds of undecided voters. While there may be several reasons to be hesitant about a second Trump presidency, his connection to Project 2025 or lack thereof, isn't one of them. What is true about Project 2025? Here's what I found after reading much of the 922-page document.

The Heritage Foundation published Project 2025 in 2023. There were 34 authors, 276 contributors, and 2 editors. Among the contributors, about 71% of them worked for the federal government during the first Trump administration. Some worked closely with Trump himself.

What prompted the creation of Project 2025? The premise behind it is that the federal government is far too powerful and too inefficient. This is a widely held belief among Americans. However, there are a few items in the document that run contrary to the Democrats agenda. For example, Project 2025 would restore the definition of ""sex"" as ""biological sex at birth"" instead of ""sexual orientation and gender identity."" According to a Pew research poll from May 2022, 60% of those polled believe gender is determined by the sex assigned at birth. Yet, Democrats continue to define sex as ones ""sexual orientation and gender identity."" Thus, the document states, ""The CDC should immediately end its collection of data on gender identity, which legitimizes the unscientific notion that men can become women (and vice versa)...""

Another example involves abortion. Liberals promote abortion as health care. The Project 2025 document (page 455) states, ""It should fund studies into the risks and complications of abortion and ensure that it corrects and does not promote misinformation regarding the comparative health

and psychological benefits of childbirth versus the health and psychological risks of intentionally taking a human life through abortion."" Conservatives see the issue as more than a woman's right to choose. They see abortion as the taking of life. In general, conservatives are against abortion but do believe exceptions to protect the life of the mother, rape, incest are appropriate.

Project 2025 also exposes some conflicts of interest in the federal government. One such conflict is found in the National Institute of Health (NIH). It states, ""In 2018, it was revealed that a $100 million NIH study on the benefits of moderate drinking was funded by the beer and liquor industry."" It also points out how the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) owns half of the patent for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, among thousands of other pharma patents. It goes on to say that several NIH employees personally receive up to $150,000 per year from Moderna vaccine sales.

Project 2025 does have some controversial items within the document, but its overarching theme is that government has become too large, too inefficient, and there are too many agencies whose actions go well beyond their charter. In short, the document makes suggestions that would reorganize the federal bureaucracy, returning agencies to their original mandates.

Democrats have suggested Trump will enact its provisions if elected in November. While Trump may indeed implement some of the provisions of Project 2025, many of them are standard conservative ideals and not something from a horror movie as Democrats have suggested."
I went to a classic Wisconsin supper club to talk politics. This is what I learned,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5138314/wisconsin-supper-club-harris-trump,2024-10-08T15:11:27Z,"The Packing House in Milwaukee caters to diners of all political persuasions. Keren Carrión/NPR hide caption

When we started planning an election reporting trip to swing state Wisconsin, locals told us we had to include a visit to a supper club to experience a unique part of the state's culture. So when I finally met Chris Wiken, whose family opened The Packing House in Milwaukee 50 years ago, my first question was, ""What on earth is a supper club?""

""This is the elusive question,"" he says. ""The whole idea of a supper club is somewhere that you're going to come and spend the evening at.""

Typically, a supper club will include a few things: a Wisconsin brandy old-fashioned cocktail at the bar, seafood or prime rib in the dining room and then live music and a boozy ice cream drink to close out the night.

Even though The Packing House was remodeled about a decade ago, it still has a classic old-time aesthetic with dark wood and dim lighting. Walking through the doors feels like going back in time.

Milwaukee's main airport terminal was just across the street when The Packing House opened in 1974. Now, that terminal serves private jets where former President Donald Trump, Vice President Harris or their running mates park every time they come to town.

""The police and Secret Service come over and go, 'Hey, Chris, they have to close down the street again.' And then I go and shake my fist at them,"" he says, joking that he'll vote for whoever shuts down the street in front of his restaurant fewer times.

You won't see a Harris or Trump sign in front of The Packing House. Wiken doesn't want to alienate his customers, who have a wide range of views, as the All Things Considered crew and I discovered when we started chatting people up at the bar.

Janine Collette, having dinner with an old friend, remembers growing up in Wisconsin before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in the state.

""In high school, we used to raise money in the girls' bathrooms to help girls go to the state of New York to get an abortion,"" she says. ""We're not going back."" Collette is excited to cast her vote for the candidate she expects to become the first female U.S. president.

At the other end of the bar, Ron Raasch says that he has voted for Democrats his whole life and that this election may be the first time he doesn't. He's disillusioned with the two-party system and is considering a vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein.

""It's very hard to see the difference when both of the major parties are going to continue shipping arms all over the world and especially to Gaza,"" he says. Raasch isn't concerned that in 2016 and 2020 the margin of victory in Wisconsin for Trump and Biden, respectively, was less than 1% of the vote. ""People are throwing that as a fear tactic,"" he says. ""And I'm trying to [more so] make a statement that the two-party system is showing its age and its frailties.""

Wearing a Packers hat at the bar, Lee Cielonko is nursing a beer while he waits for his food to arrive. ""I want the economy to be put back together. I want energy. I want to drill, baby, drill, man,"" he says.

He's supporting Trump and is concerned about immigration, saying: ""People come here and they don't have the same culture as us. They don't understand and know a lot of the way our culture works.""

So much about the future, as well as this election, is uncertain; there can be something comforting in the familiar: fish fry Friday, a Wisconsin brandy old-fashioned at the bar and live music in a place that has been doing pretty much the same thing since before most Americans were born."
Fox News Power Rankings: The biggest surprises come after October,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-power-rankings-biggest-surprises-come-after-october,2024-10-08T13:04:54Z,"Fox News Poll Republican partner Daron Shaw on how Trump and Harris are polling with significant voter groups and in swing states ahead of the general election.

A Democratic win in Indiana. A Republican victory in New Mexico. And an election where Missouri was decided by less than 4,000 votes.

They've all happened in the last twenty years.

These results are little more than trivia questions today (the answers are 2008, 2004, and 2008 again). At the time, they raised eyebrows and changed our understanding of the electorate.

Surprises happen on election week. And when the national race looks this close, one unexpected flip can decide who wins the White House.

Vice President Harris still has the edge in this week's forecast. It predicts that Harris will take home at least 241 electoral college votes to Trump's 219.

Her advantage is no larger than it was in September, and as this column has mentioned, battleground states are usually - and mostly - won and lost together. The six toss-up states in this forecast are worth 78 votes, enough to give either candidate a victory on election night.

National polls show a tight race: a Quinnipiac survey has Harris and former President Trump tied at 48%-48% with likely voters, while Marist has the candidates at 50%-48%, well within the polls' margins of sampling error.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: TRUMP MAINTAINS LEAD ON TWO TOP ISSUES

Neither poll shows Trump slipping with the national electorate. Other recent polls showed a point worth of erosion after the September presidential debate.

Battleground state polls have been sparse. (Hurricane Helene has devastated communities in Georgia and North Carolina, and Hurricane Milton will soon make landfall in Florida. This will affect the accuracy of polling in these areas.)

Overall, this race is still anyone's game.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance debated a week ago in New York City. Vance mostly broke through the character that Democrats had constructed for him, while Walz stumbled out of the gate.

A flash poll showed neither candidate winning the night. As always, wait for results from multiple polls conducted in the weeks after the debate to properly assess the polling impact.

That was the only scheduled event that could surprise voters this month. (Fox News Media has proposed a second Harris-Trump debate later in October.)

Of course, it's the unexpected events in years past that have done more to reshape the race. And events in two categories have already resurfaced.

FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS CITE HIGH PRICES AS BIGGEST MOTIVATOR TO VOTE

Polarization will limit the impact of these events on the horserace. But watch Harris and Trump's support with independents over the coming weeks. Those voters made up 5% of the electorate in 2020, and they broke for President Biden by 15 points; recent polls put Harris in that ballpark. Trump likely needs to claw that back to win the race.

Two states that could surprise in November

There are nine ""likely"" races on the Power Rankings map. The two that would have the biggest impact on the race are Florida and Virginia.

Former President Trump improved his performance in Florida in the 2020 presidential election, bringing his margin up to about 372,000 votes.

That's a win of 3.4 points, or his second-closest victory of the cycle. (The closest was North Carolina, a toss-up in the rankings, which he won by 1.3 points.)

Republicans have strong advantages. The state's White working-class and senior voters lean towards Trump, while its large Hispanic population, particularly the Cuban and Venezuelan communities, has shifted right in recent years.

The GOP won big at every level in the midterms and enjoys a 1 million-plus voter registration advantage, and most tellingly, the Democratic Party is not making significant investments.

Democrats hope that a competitive Senate race, where incumbent Republican Rick Scott has personally spent more than $8 million, means the presidential election is closer than people think. Florida is also one of three competitive states with an abortion measure on the ballot.

It would take a blowout night for Harris to flip the Sunshine State. It would also be the first state after the battlegrounds to go blue.

Florida stays at Likely R in the rankings.

A win for Trump in Virginia would also be shocking, especially since Biden won this state by more than 10 points in 2020.

The state has a higher proportion of Black, suburban, and college-educated voters than the rest of the country, and all three groups help Democrats run up the margin. While Republicans talked about Virginia after the June presidential debate, the race has changed, and neither party is making big investments in the state today.

Some polls show a race that isn't over for the GOP. A survey from Virginia Commonwealth University in September put Harris at 47% with registered voters and Trump at 37%. A poll from the Washington Post earlier in the month had Harris at 50% to Trump's 42%.

Still, it would take a blowout in the other direction for the Old Dominion to reject Harris. Virginia remains a Likely D race.

Four weeks until election night

More than 1.5 million voters have cast their ballot as the countdown to election night continues. Early voting has now begun in:"
Stevie Nicks' New Single Instantly Debuts In The Same Position On Multiple Charts,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2024/10/08/stevie-nicks-new-single-instantly-debuts-in-the-same-position-on-multiple-charts/,2024-10-08T12:28:51Z,"Stevie Nicks returned a little more than a week ago with ""The Lighthouse,"" her latest solo single. The Fleetwood Mac star's fan base snapped up copies of the tune the moment it dropped, and they've collectively sent the song to multiple charts in the U.K. this week, immediately making it into something of a quick, if minor, hit.

""The Lighthouse"" launches on both the Official Singles Sales and Official Singles Downloads charts this time around. Coincidentally, the tune is new at No. 48 on the two tallies.

It's not entirely uncommon for songs to debut in similar spots on those two rankings, as they are both ranked based on pure purchases. Most sales of individual tracks take place on download storefronts like iTunes and Amazon, so it makes sense that new arrivals on the Official Singles Downloads list would also perform just as well-or, almost as well-on the Official Singles Sales roster at the same time.

""The Lighthouse"" marks Nicks' second solo hit on the Official Singles Sales chart. She debuted on the list of the top-selling songs in the U.K. in 2020. That year, ""Edge of Seventeen"" peaked at No. 7, and it still stands as her top placement.

Nicks' latest offering marks her fourth career win on the Official Singles Downloads ranking. It's her second-highest appearance, coming in ahead of the No. 72 high point that ""Dreams"" by Deep Dish reached years ago, as well as the No. 98 peak that ""Show Them the Way"" mustered.

""The Lighthouse"" stands as the fifth-highest debut on the Official Singles Downloads chart, landing behind tracks from Kylie Minogue, Callum Beattie, Jack Savoretti and Miles Kane, and Josh Baker. On the Official Singles Sales list, Nicks claims the sixth-loftiest entrant. In addition to the five names mentioned above, The Veronicas also hit the tally with their years-old single ""Untouched,"" which reaches the list for the first time.

Nicks released ""The Lighthouse"" as a means to inspire discussions about women's rights and the issue of abortion. For the moment, the track is a standalone single, as it's not connected to any larger project-at least for the time being."
DeSantis administration warns local TV stations to remove ads about abortion ballot measure,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/desantis-abortion-rights-florida-amendment-4-caroline-ad-rcna174387,2024-10-08T10:47:32Z,"The Republican administration is pressuring Florida stations to take down an ad that promotes a ""yes"" vote on Amendment 4, which would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration had already tried to put its thumb on the scale against Amendment 4, a statewide measure that could enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. And now the admin has added to that disturbing trend.

Florida's six-week abortion ban is one of the strictest in the country. The DeSantis administration recently had its election police unit investigate people who had signed a petition to get Amendment 4 on the ballot. Then the administration used taxpayer money to launch an anti-abortion website. The administration also used state money to air Orwellian television ads proclaiming that ""Florida cares about women and families.""

Now the DeSantis administration appears to be trying to intimidate people who have run an ad that promotes a ""yes"" vote on Amendment 4.

""The doctors knew if I did not end my pregnancy, I would lose my baby, I would lose my life, and my daughter would lose her mom,"" a woman says in the ad, titled ""Caroline.""

""Florida has now banned abortion even in cases like mine,"" she says.

Investigative journalist Jason Garcia published a letter from the Florida Department of Health's general counsel to the general manager of WFLA-TV, the NBC affiliate in the Tampa Bay area. The letter, dated Oct. 3, argues that the ad contains a ""categorically false"" claim about abortion in Florida -- and warns that the ad is in violation of state law.

""The advertisement is not only false; it is dangerous,"" the letter reads. ""Women faced with pregnancy complications posing a serious risk of death or substantial or irreversible physical impairment may and should seek medical treatment in Florida.""

In practice, Florida's law hasn't been so clear. Even though the law includes exceptions for rape and incest in certain cases, the law has confused doctors and caused a chilling effect among providers. The problem has been so glaring that the DeSantis administration has threatened doctors who don't provide emergency care in these confusing scenarios, which are only occurring because of the law Republicans put in place.

In another letter Garcia posted online, lawyers for the group sponsoring Amendment 4 defended the ad as true and urged a Florida TV station to continue carrying it.

The Florida Department of Health's letter ""is a flagrant abuse of power and must be rejected,"" the lawyers wrote.

The DeSantis administration sure seems like it's attempting to hide the dangerous impacts of Florida's abortion laws from public view."
Michael Moore mocks Democrats panicked by tight 2024 race: 'Shocking to me' they believe Trump is going to win,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/michael-moore-mocks-democrats-panicked-tight-2024-race-shocking-me-believe-trump-going-win,2024-10-08T10:44:31Z,"Liberal filmmaker and activist Michael Moore mocked Democrats worrying about the tight 2024 race, saying he found it hard to believe former President Trump could win election.

Liberal filmmaker and activist Michael Moore knocked Democrats who are panicking over the tight 2024 presidential race, admitting he's stunned that people on the left believe former President Trump could win the election.

""Democrats, they're such a frightened group of people,"" Moore said during a Monday interview on CNN. ""I mean, they still think that Trump is going to win.""

""This is kind of shocking to me. Like, don't you live with people? Are you not aware that there's going to be a tsunami of women voting between now and Election Day?"" he said, referring to backlash over the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022.

""Anybody who thinks women are going to stay home, that women are going to stay home -- Do you not know any women? Do you not live with a woman?"" Moore continued.

MICHAEL MOORE WARNS KAMALA HARRIS TO NOT GO 'CENTRIST'

CNN anchor Brianna Keilar asked Moore if he believed polling which shows the race is close.

According to the latest national Fox News poll from September, Harris currently holds a two-point edge over Trump with voters.

""I don't think it's a dead heat,"" Moore responded. He clarified that while he wasn't outright dismissing polling, he had more faith in surveys that questioned voters on the issues, rather than the candidates.

He pointed to polling misses from the 2016 campaign, such as when The New York Times predicted on Election Day, 2016, that Hillary Clinton had an 85% chance at winning the presidential election.

""No, I don't think people should be running their lives based on these polls,"" he said.

BLUE PHILLY WORKING-CLASS VOTERS START LEANING TOWARD TRUMP AHEAD OF THE ELECTION: 'PEOPLE ACTUALLY LOVE HIM'

Moore ripped Democrats pushing Harris to the center because of these concerns, arguing that the VP's progressive policy positions on abortion, the environment, guns and jobs are actually in the mainstream.

""You mentioned Democrats who want [Harris] to 'tone it down,'"" Moore continued. ""That's something women have been told for decades.""

""The reason she's so progressive -- because she believes in a woman's right to choose, she believes a 14-year-old shouldn't take an assault rifle to school....you go down all her positions and they line up exactly with where the majority of Americans are at,"" he continued.

""The majority of Americans believe climate change is real. The majority of Americans believe the minimum wage is too low. Just go down the list,"" Moore argued.

""The majority of Americans want regulation. They want people to be making sure that, when you have a hurricane and only 1% of the people have flood insurance -- That's not the country I live in. That's not the country I'm going to live in, where people now are suffering because of this,"" he said, referring to devastation from Hurricane Helene.

Last week, Moore warned Harris to not ""move to the center"" or it could backfire for Democrats.

""If Harris is advised by her wealthy donors to shun the left and drop her more progressive positions in favor of a 'move to the center,'"" Moore warned in a post on Substack, that could ""reduce or depress the vote."""
"Early voting kicks off in Indiana, New Mexico, Ohio, Wyoming",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/early-voting-indiana-new-mexico-ohio-wyoming,2024-10-08T09:15:20Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Four more states began their early voting processes on Tuesday: Indiana, New Mexico, Wyoming and the major swing state of Ohio.

Here is everything you need to know about casting a ballot in each of the states.

Ohio is home to one of the most competitive Senate races on the map.

Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown has won the Midwestern state three times, but with Trump pushing White working-class voters toward the GOP and record spending from both parties, this is set to be a tight race. Brown faces Republican businessman Bernie Moreno.

Republicans have made inroads in the northeastern and heavily industrial areas bordering Pennsylvania. Trumbull County flipped to the GOP in 2016, and Trump increased his margin to 10 points in 2020; Mahoning County flipped in 2020 by almost two points. These counties played a key role in Trump's statewide wins.

Democrats are performing better than ever in the ""three C's"": Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. These areas have the highest percentages of college-educated voters. President Biden won the counties home to these cities by double-digit margins in 2020, with roughly 30-point wins in Franklin (Columbus) and Cuyahoga (Cleveland).

Unlike in other competitive states, Republicans still hold up in Ohio's suburban and exurban areas, particularly those surrounding Cincinnati.

Ohio's Senate race is a toss-up and the presidential race is ranked Likely R on the Fox News Power Rankings.

Meanwhile, New Mexico is also in the ""likely"" column, both at the presidential and senate level. The state delivered Biden an 11-point win in 2020, but Latino or Hispanic voters made up 35% of the state's electorate in the 2020 election, and those voters' support for the Democrat ticket has wavered in recent polls.

"Kamala 2.0's challenge? Making more news, and not just with ultra-friendly hosts",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-2-0s-challenge-making-more-news-not-just-ultra-friendly-hosts,2024-10-08T07:11:26Z,"For well over a month, Kamala Harris rode a wave of the most positive press any presidential candidate has gotten in two decades, and her own skills, to turn what had been a lost cause for the Democrats into an extremely tight race.

But does she have a second act?

Kamala 2.0, under constant attack by Donald Trump and the Republicans, doesn't have much new to say. She is conducting a play-it-safe campaign, like a basketball team sitting on a lead and running out the clock.

But Harris doesn't have a lead in the three ""blue wall"" midwestern states she needs to win, and the loss of any one of them could hand Trump the presidency once again.

VANCE-WALZ VP DEBATE ENDED IN A 'DRAW': DEMOCRAT REP. DEBBIE DINGELL

For all the focus on Pennsylvania, Harris leads by 0.7 percent in Michigan - a statistical tie, based on the Real Clear Politics average.

On Sunday's ""Media Buzz,"" Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell told me her state could go either way.

""The vice president has a problem with union workers,"" Dingell said. ""Many of the men, as well as, quite frankly, African-American young men who have said to me, I was with a group with them last week. 'You know what, Donald Trump talks to us. Democrats take us for granted.'""

The lawmaker recalls how ""everybody got mad at me"" when she predicted in 2016 that Trump would win Michigan - which he did, along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

A major problem for Harris is that she doesn't seem to know how to make news. With less than 30 days to go, with many voters understandably believing they don't know her, or enough about her policies, since she took over for Joe Biden, the VP is stitching together parts of her stump speech and recycling the same anecdotes virtually verbatim.

A presidential candidate has to deliver a few new lines, a new proposal, something to break into the news cycle, which is currently being dominated by Trump.

So what's on this week's agenda? Kamala will sit down with Howard Stern (who is totally against his old pal Donald); ""The View,"" where the ladies despise Trump, and Stephen Colbert, who hosted fundraisers for Joe Biden in 2020 and this year.

For good measure, she's also spoken to Alex Cooper, whose podcast, ""Call Your Daddy,"" is about sex.

WHY VANCE EASILY BEAT WALZ IN DEBATE, SOFTENING HIS IMAGE IN THE PROCESS

I'll go out on a limb here and say these sessions are designed to be friendly - not unlike the conversation with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle, who kept agreeing with Harris and had just pronounced Trump a danger to democracy.

In fairness, Harris also sat for a ""60 Minutes"" interview, an invitation declined by Trump.

Look, there's nothing wrong with candidates showing their softer side with unorthodox outlets in our fragmented media universe. We've come a long way since critics scoffed at candidate Bill Clinton answering the ""boxers or briefs"" question on MTV, calling it unpresidential.

On ""Call Your Daddy,"" Harris was actually quite thoughtful in responding to Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying that her kids keep her humble and the VP doesn't have anyone to keep her humble.

Rather than jab at the Arkansas governor, which would have produced a cheap headline, she ruminated that families come in all shapes, bound by blood or love, that she is deeply involved with her stepchildren, and this isn't the 1950s anymore. They also discussed, uh, tampons.

Still, the party is getting nervous. ""Democratic operatives, including some of Kamala Harris' own staffers,"" says Politico, ""are growing increasingly concerned about her relatively light campaign schedule, which has her holding fewer events than Donald Trump and avoiding unscripted interactions with voters and the press almost entirely.""

Since the convention, the veep has spent more than a third of days on meeting and briefings, with no public events.

With early voting under way in more than half the states, Politico describes this ""a do-no-harm, risk-averse approach to the race.""

GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO WIN BACK PEACH STATE

Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan, who fervently doesn't want Trump to win, nonetheless is whacks Harris pretty hard:

""She hasn't fleshed out her political intent -- what she stands for, what she won't abide, what she means to establish, what she won't let happen.

What is her essential mission? Is it national 'repair,' is it to 'stabilize' an uncertain country, is it 'relaunch'?..

""She so far hasn't conveyed a sense of intellectual grasp. Her campaign has placed too many chips on the idea of the mood, the vibe, the picture.""

And vibes can only take you so far.

But the VP has certain duties, and spent two days visiting hurricane victims and relief workers in North Carolina and Georgia-which also happens to be good politics. She also met with Volodomyr Zelenskyy.

Harris attended a fundraiser over the weekend. Why bother? Her campaign has already had $400 million roll in. She's already outspending Trump 2-½ to 1 on ads. She doesn't need any more money. What's more, Harris doesn't make news at these fundraisers, which in any event are off camera. A ground game is great, but it has to be married to a winning message.

Here's one more: Dan Pfeiffer, a former top Obama White House official, says on Message Box, his Substack column, that ""the media -- and Politico Playbook in particular -- are fuming over the Harris-Walz media strategy.""

Kamala ""must be on offense at all times -- say new things, be edgy enough to get attention, and dictate the terms, or the campaign could ""take on water...In this media world, there is a never-ending, insatiable appetite for content. Either serve lunch or become the menu...

""Dominating attention is Trump's political superpower...Even when he doesn't have a big moment, Trump speaks so outrageously that it shifts attention to his issues of choice.""

Now it's easy to snipe from the sidelines. For Harris to be neck and neck in the core battleground states means she's obviously done many things right. She had to overhaul the Biden operation and vet a running mate while the campaign was in full swing, like changing the tires on a speeding hot rod. She could still win.

One positive sign: The Harris camp took off the bubble wrap and allowed Tim Walz to appear on ""Fox News Sunday."" This was an attempt at damage control, since he lost the debate so badly to JD Vance.

While Shannon Bream repeatedly pressed the governor on late-term abortions, his Minnesota record and his history of falsehoods and exaggerations, Walz was far more forceful than he'd been in the CBS debate. He ducked certain questions, but an interview format is much better suited to him than friendly exchanges with his opponent.

Walz's next stop? A man who relishes his feuds with Trump, Jimmy Kimmel."

Fox News host Sean Hannity reveals why Vice President Kamala Harris is now doing interviews before the election on ""Hannity.""

SEAN HANNITY: There is one huge reason, and only one reason, that Kamala is now going on and doing any interviews. Her internal poll numbers have got to be horrendous. Now, meanwhile, the publicly available poll numbers from the most credible pollsters in 2016 and 2020 and swing states we've been showing you (are) not great for Kamala Harris.

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

She is down in multiple polls in Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia. The race is even tighter in Virginia, where Kamala holds a slight lead. A brand new Yahoo News poll shows Trump surging nationwide.

Harris is desperately trying to make up ground. That's why she's finally doing friendly interviews, but lapping it up with Trump-hater Howard Stern, those hard-hitting interviewers on ""The View"" and Stephen Colbert, who's dull as dirt, or the ""Call Me Daddy"" podcast, while millions of Americans are suffering the devastating effects of Hurricane Helene and another major hurricane on the way, is not exactly the best look for the vice president when she and Joe Biden have been completely missing in action."
Georgia high court restores state's 6-week 'heartbeat' abortion law,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-high-court-restores-states-six-week-heartbeat-abortion-law,2024-10-07T22:07:07Z,"Abortion Survivors founder Melissa Ohden breaks down how Governor Tim Walz has changed Minnesota's abortion laws during an appearance on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.'

The Georgia Supreme Court on Monday stopped a lower court's ruling from last week that allowed abortions up to 22 weeks, as opposed to six weeks, as it considers an appeal filed by the state.

The order from the state Supreme Court came a week after Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled that abortions must be regulated the way they were before the ""Heartbeat Law"" went into effect, meaning abortions could be allowed until the 22-week mark.

The Associated Press reported that Justice John J. Ellington argued against McBurney's ruling, saying the case ""should not be predetermined in the State's favor before the appeal is even docketed.""

""The State should not be in the business of enforcing laws that have been determined to violate fundamental rights guaranteed to millions of individuals under the Georgia Constitution,"" Ellington wrote. ""The 'status quo' that should be maintained is the state of the law before the challenged laws took effect.""

GEORGIA JUDGE OVERTURNS STATE'S 6-WEEK 'HEARTBEAT' ABORTION LAW, CALLS IT 'UNCONSTITUTIONAL'

Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed the ""Heartbeat"" abortion bill, also known as the Living Infants Fairness and Equality Act, into law in 2019. The law made abortions after the six-week mark illegal.

McBurney called the law ""unconstitutional.""

""The authors of our Constitutions, state and federal, entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning,"" McBurney wrote in his final order last week. ""A review of our higher courts' interpretations of 'liberty' demonstrates that liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.

GEORGIA GOV BRIAN KEMP SIGNS CONTROVERSIAL 'HEARTBEAT' BILL INTO LAW

""That power is not, however, unlimited,"" the judge added. ""When a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then - and only then - may society intervene.""

McBurney continued by saying a law that prevents abortions after six weeks was inconsistent with those rights as well as the proper balance that a viability rule establishes between a woman's rights and society's interests in protecting and caring for unborn infants.

There were exceptions written into the law Kemp signed in 2019, including rape and incest as long as a police report was filed.

GEORGIA ABORTION LAW: A LOOK BACK AT WHAT HOLLYWOOD PRODUCTION COMPANIES HAVE SAID ABOUT FILMING IN THE STATE

The law signed by Kemp was blocked by a federal judge in October 2019 - before it went into effect - and ruled it violated the right to abortion as established by Roe v. Wade in 1973.

The Supreme Court then overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, clearing the way for Georgia's law on abortion to go into effect.

McBurney, in November 2022, ruled the law was ""unequivocally unconstitutional"" because it was enacted in 2019 when Roe v. Wade allowed abortions after six weeks.

But in October 2023, the Georgia Supreme Court rejected the ruling in a 6-1 decision, saying McBurney was wrong.

McBurney's ruling last week determined that the state, county, municipal and other local authorities are ""enjoined"" from seeking to enforce the six-week abortion law."

Harris attacked MAGA misogyny head-on in 'Call Her Daddy' interview,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-call-her-daddy-interview-alex-cooper-rcna174337,2024-10-07T21:05:54Z,"The Democratic presidential hopeful's appearance on the popular ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast was a clear rebuttal to Donald Trump and the MAGA movement. And Harris pulled no punches.

Kamala Harris sat for an interview on the popular podcast ""Call Her Daddy,"" for an episode that was released over the weekend. The podcast, helmed by host Alex Cooper, is known for being particularly popular with young women.

The interview was part of the Democratic presidential campaign's ongoing strategy of using sit-downs with nontraditional media sources to spread its messaging to targeted groups. Harris recently did an interview on ""All the Smoke,"" a sports-focused podcast known for its popularity among men of color. On Tuesday, she will be interviewed by Howard Stern, a longtime shock jock with a large male audience.

Trump also has gone on a tour of nontraditional media, though his podcast-heavy schedule has seemed structured almost entirely to shore up his support with men (albeit in some pretty juvenile ways). Harris' ""Call Her Daddy"" interview was the antithesis of that.

Where Trump and his movement have embraced the chauvinism of the 19th and 20th century and obsessed over ""tradwives"" -- women defined by their roles as homemakers and caretakers -- the Democratic candidate spoke to the podcast's massive audience of women and encouraged them to define themselves.

Harris said her mom had taught her and her sister ""the importance of us being able to express how we were feeling,"" that they ""had agency"" in how their lives played out, and that they ought to ""figure out how you can take charge of a moment.""

When Cooper asked Harris about Trump's thinly veiled sexist attacks, in which he has called her ""crazy, weak, fake and dumb,"" the VP replied: ""I think it's really important not to let other people define you.""

At one point, the conversation shifted to the crisis of domestic and sexual violence against women. Cooper said many of her listeners have described the shame and the terror they feel about coming forward, but Harris -- a former prosecutor -- told listeners not to ""quietly suffer"" and advised them to ""tell someone that you trust.""

And when Cooper asked about how we can make the country safer for women, Harris did an effective job of explaining how women's economic independence factors into the equation. She said:

This narrative about empowering women economically runs counter to the GOP's attack on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that can assist women in the workplace.

Harris also spoke about the impact of abortion bans, describing the harrowing reality of women who are forced to travel out of state to receive reproductive care -- assuming they even have the money and means to do so.

And she attacked conservatives' arcane view of women when asked to address Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' claim that Harris ""doesn't have anything keeping her humble"" because she does not have biological children. (The vice president, of course, has two stepchildren.)

""I don't think she understands that there are a whole lot of women out here who, one, are not aspiring to be humble,"" Harris said of Sanders. ""Two, a whole lot of women out here who have a lot of love in their life, family in their life and children in their life, and I think it's really important for women to lift each other up.""

The interview was essentially a message to young women that they don't have to accept the MAGA movement's restrictive roles for them -- and that the Harris campaign supports them leading more self-determined lives."
"Katie Phang: As questions swirl over Trump's mental fitness, is Vance ready to be president?",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/vance-25-amendment-trump-presidency-rcna174325,2024-10-07T20:08:02Z,"In some ways, vice presidents are like understudies; you may never need them to step into the breach but they're there just in case something goes wrong.

And as we inch closer to November's election, I want you to consider this: If elected, Donald Trump -- who is currently 78 years old, regularly frequents McDonald's, and loves his Diet Cokes -- would end his second term as the oldest person ever to serve as president of the United States. On the final day of his presidency in January 2029, Trump would be 82 years, seven months and six days old.

The former president's rambling, meandering speeches on the campaign trail have led some mental health experts to go on the record, raising concerns about his potential cognitive decline. Despite these concerns, Trump refuses to release even the most basic information about his health.

So what happens if Trump wins in November and then, days, weeks, months or years into his presidency, dies or becomes incapacitated and can no longer serve? Well, according to Section 1 of the 25th Amendment, in that event, the vice president would become the president automatically.

To state it plainly: Sen. JD Vance is a heartbeat away from the presidency of the United States. The same Vance who, right now, has poll numbers labeling him the least popular vice-presidential candidate of the 21st century -- unsurprising given his many extremist views on everything from child care to the truth of who won the 2020 election. I mean, not admitting your running mate lost the last election is a huge red flag that you have an issue with the truth.

During last week's vice-presidential debate, Vance got caught in another lie. The senator claimed he never supported a national abortion ban. However, in 2022 while he was running for the Senate, Vance said on a podcast he ""certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally.""

Then there's his extremist stances. Also during that 2022 run for the Senate, Vance delivered a 30-minute speech titled ""The Universities are the Enemy"" at the National Conservatism Conference.

""I think if any of us want to do the things that we want to do for our country and for the people who live in it, we have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country,"" the then-candidate told the crowd. ""Ladies and gentlemen, the universities do not pursue knowledge and truth, they pursue deceit and lies, and it's time to be honest about that fact.""

Now, in my opinion, the best way to pursue a good and fulfilling life is through education, but it seems Yale-educated Vance wants to overhaul the education system in his image. Under Project 2025, a Trump-Vance administration could eliminate the Department of Education, privatize K-12, and dismantle the current collegiate system.

He's a threat to everything Americans hold dear: life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And if something were to happen to Trump, the big job would go to Vance: the guy who refuses to acknowledge that Trump lost the 2020 election, promotes anti-immigrant hate rhetoric, and supports a national abortion ban.

And let's be clear, 40-year-old Vance is fully aware that Trump is 78 years old. You're kidding yourself if you think he didn't consider Trump's physical and mental health issues when contemplating his career advancement and upward mobility prospects as the Republican VP nominee.

So, before you cast your ballot in this year's election, you should remember this: Any vote for Donald Trump is a vote for a potential automatic JD Vance presidency. Vote accordingly."
Kamala Harris' 'Call Her Daddy' Appearance Divides Podcast Host Alex Cooper's Listeners,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/10/07/kamala-harris-call-her-daddy-appearance-divides-podcast-host-alex-coopers-listeners/,2024-10-07T19:54:16Z,"Podcast host Alex Cooper interviewed Vice President Kamala Harris on her popular ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, Spotify's second-biggest podcast which has a large audience of women listeners, drawing criticism from some of Cooper's conservative-leaning listeners.

""Call Her Daddy"" has ranked as Spotify's second-biggest podcast, only behind Joe Rogan's ""Joe Rogan Experience,"" for the past two years. Spotify also says it is the biggest podcast for women on its platform. ""Call Her Daddy"" ranked as the fourth-biggest podcast across all platforms for the second quarter of 2024, according to Edison Research, behind Rogan, ""Crime Junkie"" and The New York Times' ""The Daily."" Cooper also has a significant social media following, with 2.4 million followers on her ""Call Her Daddy"" Instagram account and 3.9 million followers on the podcast's TikTok. Cooper regularly hosts high-profile celebrity guests on her podcast, including Simone Biles, Post Malone and Katy Perry. Cooper has also raised her podcast's profile through media appearances, including a stint as a host at the Paris Olympic Games this summer for NBC. Her podcast has been highly sought after by streaming services: SiriusXM spent $100 million on the rights to her podcast in August, three years after Spotify paid $60 million for exclusive rights.

Though it's unclear how much of Cooper's listening base is made up of conservatives, Cooper said she has a ""very mixed audience when it comes to politics"" prior to her Harris interview, acknowledging she seldom talks about politics to make her podcast a welcome space for all listeners. Cooper, however, has previously spoken out in favor of abortion rights. In one ""Call Her Daddy"" episode released in October 2022, Cooper spoke with women who had to travel from states with restrictive abortion laws to other states to receive care, which she said was to highlight the impact of anti-abortion legislation on women. She also criticized the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Cooper's podcast also exploded in popularity after it was acquired in 2018 by Barstool Sports, the media company founded by Dave Portnoy known for its conservative-leaning audience that Politico called ""Barstool Republicans.""

Cooper released her interview with Harris on Sunday, in which she largely asked the vice president questions about women's issues, including reproductive rights. Harris slammed state laws she called ""Trump abortion bans"" and dismissed Trump's claim that he would be a ""protector"" for women as president. She also addressed comments made by Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Republican, last month in which she said Harris does not have biological children to keep her ""humble."" Harris said she feels ""sorry"" for Sanders, stating many women are ""not aspiring to be humble"" and ""have a lot of love in their life, family in their life and children in their life"" who lift them up.

""I couldn't see a world in which one of the main conversations in this election is women, and I'm not a part of it,"" Cooper said, defending her decision to interview Harris despite her politically mixed audience, as well as her choice to center their conversation around women's issues.

Cooper ranked No. 12 on Forbes' list of the top-earning creators of 2023, with estimated earnings of $20 million. She was also included on Forbes' 30 Under 30 list in 2022.

Harris' ""Call Her Daddy"" interview was one of several media appearances she has scheduled for this week. Also this week, Harris will appear on ""The View,"" ""60 Minutes,"" ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" and Howard Stern's radio show.

Public Opinion 101: How Do Voters Decide?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bowmanmarsico/2024/10/07/public-opinion-101-how-do-voters-decide/,2024-10-07T19:32:46Z,"Why do people vote the way they do? What factors influence them as they make this decision and other crucial ones about things such as their health care? Those in the Washington political bubble tend to place considerable emphasis on the acquisition of factual material. But is that how other Americans make these big decisions?

In the aftermath of the Vance-Walz debate, fact checkers worked overtime to confirm the accuracy of both candidates' statements. Their work may aid voters' decisions, but their efforts seem to appeal more to their fellow journalists and political pundits. As such, they are unlikely to have much impact on public opinion.

Facts are important, of course, but in the words of the late sociologist Daniel Yankelovich, they are not ""the royal road to judgment."" Other things matter. In 2024, some voters will vote on a single issue. Since 1992, for example, Gallup has tracked the proportion of registered voters that say they will only vote for a candidate who shares their views on the abortion. In June of 2024, 32% gave that response. A much smaller number will vote on climate. Still others may be Second Amendment purists and evaluate candidates based on their views of guns. Some will vote on character or because they dislike a candidate. Still others will cast their ballots for their party just as their parents and grandparents did.

There are many others whose party ties are weak, who don't follow complicated policy issues, who don't have a single most important issue, or who don't hate the other party's candidate. They will vote for other reasons. But where do these decisions originate?

Yankelovich wrote about decision making in his 1999 book The Magic of Dialogue, and I am indebted to his work. He notes that journalists and social scientists base their opinions on the accumulation of facts, but the general public does not make its determinations this way. The public, he says, ""forms its judgments through dialogue and discussion. People weigh what they hear from others against their own convictions. They compare notes with one another in terms of what makes sense to them.""

In many years of following the polls, I have been struck by Americans' responses when they are asked how they form their opinions. Conversations with friends and family often top the list. A new Morning Consult poll for the Public Affairs Council asked people about their most trusted source for political news and information. ""Friends and family"" swamped the other categories, far ahead of the parties, business, and social media.

An August Syracuse University/Ipsos poll asked people to imagine that they had 100 minutes to cast an informed vote on the 2024 election. When asked how much time they would spend speaking to a variety of sources, the mean response for family and friends was the highest, followed distantly by eight other sources including broadcast news, cable news, national newspapers, and social media. The results were virtually identical in their July and May polls. In these three soundings, Democrats, Republicans, and independents all gave the most attention to the views of friends and family.

On a very different often highly complex subject, Axios/Ipsos asked people who they trusted to provide them information on ""health topics."" Eighty-six percent said they had a great deal or fair amount of trust in information from their personal physician, followed by information from friends and family (74%). Information from the CDC, the FDA, the NIH, or the governor of their state ranked far behind in terms of high trust.

Yankelovich believed people start with their values. The public doesn't distinguish between facts and values the way journalists do, he says. He was suspicious of the ""conventional paradigm of knowledge with its sharp distinctions between 'objective' facts and 'subjective' values."" What he called the public's ""pre-scientific ways of knowing"" actually has ""greater validity for the important questions of living together than current theories of knowledge."" A poorly informed public can make sound, even wise, judgments, he argued.

The process of arriving at these judgements often takes time, and it is probably harder in our polarized age. In our current environment in which institutional trust is so low, understanding how much people rely on discussions with their family and friends is surely important.

The fact checkers will continue their work for those of us in the Washington bubble and beyond. But they alone will not help Americans arrive at decisions about the 2024 candidates or other important decisions in their lives."

Regardless of who wins, it's critical for small business owners to stay informed on new policies and regulatory shifts, as new legislation could reshape things like employee benefits and compliance requirements. With one month to go, many small business owners are curious about proactive steps they can take to prepare for the looming uncertainty. Experts suggest five key principles to prepare for the election's outcome:

1. Monitor policy changes.

It's widely known that election years can bring market volatility. That's why it's critical for small business owners to stay informed about proposed changes in regulations, taxes, healthcare and labor laws that could directly impact their operations. Understanding candidates' platforms will help anticipate shifts and plan for potential changes accordingly.

Jen Stark, who serves as a strategic advisor to Don't Ban Equality, advises small business owners to pay attention to local laws that might impact employee health benefit concerns, especially around reproductive care.

""Small businesses in states that have passed abortion bans and restrictions are left with the burden of shouldering the costs and chaos facing workers and communities,"" she says. ""Those workers have to travel out of state, resulting in more time off and greater healthcare costs out of pocket even if their employer has a benefits program to support them.""

Shifts in economic regulations are another area small business owners should pay close attention to.

""Political uncertainty in the months leading up to the presidential election can affect confidence and decision-making for consumers, which leads to impact on small business owners and can cause a decrease in consumer spending,"" says Cate Luzio, former banker and founder of Luminary, a professional education and networking platform. ""The election results themselves can eventually cause a change in business regulations that small business owners need to be aware of, along with the impact that might have on their business, their growth, their customers and more.""

2. Focus on consumer and employee engagement.

Consumer spending patterns may shift during an election year due to uncertainty. Many people tend to cut back on discretionary spending when they feel uneasy about the economy.

Consider changes you can make to your business to prepare for this sentiment shift. Do you offer essential products or services that are less impacted by economic swings? Are there ways to re-engage your most loyal consumers right now? Focus on those if possible.

At the same time, this is a prime opportunity to foster civic engagement among employees.

""As this election season kicks into high gear, entrepreneurs and business leaders have an opportunity to use their trusted voice to protect American democracy,"" says Katie Vlietstra Wonnenberg, principal of Public Private Strategies. ""Consumers want businesses to be active in protecting America's democracy and they support actions to ensure it.""

Wonnenberg cited research from the Business & Democracy Initiative, which revealed that 75% of consumers support businesses who promote employee civic education and agree that employees should have time off for political engagement.

""Taking these steps during election season can help with employee retention and can build trust and loyalty with consumers,"" she points out.

3. Scenario plan.

Given the potential for significant regulatory changes, business owners should consider the changes that might occur under different administrations. Think through any adjustments you might need to make within operations or budgets when considering factors like minimum wage hikes, healthcare mandates, trade policies and more.

""Company leadership should always be preparing for uncontrollable changes by discussing different scenarios with their teams so they are prepared,"" says Chantell Preston, a healthcare development consultant who advises small businesses on reducing risk.

Preston suggests playing out different scenarios so your company and employees are prepared for any outcome. ""Enlist feedback and engage with your stakeholders so they know you are preparing,"" she says. ""Communicate and be transparent with your employees to build trust and reduce uncertainty.""

4. Remind your employees that they have a say.

Presidential elections can influence labor laws and healthcare regulations, which impact employee pay and HR policies. Business owners should keep a close eye on any proposed changes to healthcare, minimum wage, or employee benefits that could impact overhead costs, communicating openly with employees to prepare for any potential changes that might occur following the election.

Kimber Lanning, CEO of Local First Arizona, suggests starting this conversation prior to the election by reminding employees that they actually do have a say in shaping the outcome.

""A great way to get involved in an election while staying out of divisive politics is to stick to a message of getting out the vote,"" she says. ""Consider giving your employees time off to go to the polls on Election Day. Encourage your customers to vote by placing signs in your establishment or stickers at the cash register. Sponsor or organize a voter registration event. Using your voice as a business owner to support democracy is a noble thing to do.""

5. Be prepared to dip into cash reserves.

Election years can bring about economic uncertainty, which leads to market volatility. Small businesses should consider building up cash reserves to cushion against any potential downturns.

Experts recommend postponing major investments until after the election, reviewing current tax strategies and being prepared to dip into cash reserves in case of significant disruption.

Preston recommends having at least 18 months of capital available. She also suggests researching regulatory perspectives from all parties and evaluating supply chains in case of issues.

Lanning suggests treating an election cycle like any other slow season. She points out that, ""In Phoenix, our summers are hot, so businesses know to plan for decreased revenue as customers go away on vacation. In the months running up to a major election, business owners should do the same thing.""

""No matter what industry you're in, sales activity slumps as Americans hold their money tighter, wondering how the election will turn out and what policies a new president will implement that may affect their pocket book,"" says Lanning. ""You may need to pause hiring, dip into savings or wait to make a big purchase to keep your business healthy.""

Luzio acknowledges the financial anxiety that comes with the election can lead to impulsive, shortsighted decisions.

""Get your 2025 financial projections in order with scenarios around growth, flat and down performance,"" she suggests. ""At a macro level, key issues may have an impact on your numbers: taxes, regulation, trade and consumer spending/customer acquisition. It is important for business owners to be informed about issues and make sure they're aware regardless of which way the election goes. Doing an updated SWOT analysis for your business can help, especially as it relates to how to mitigate or protect your business against threats.""

Finally, Luzio recommends talking to your trusted experts such as insurance professionals, financial advisors, cybersecurity experts, attorneys and banking partners to help mitigate risk.

""Discuss potential business impacts with these experts to help you feel informed about decision making around the business,"" says Luzio.

""The election is out of your control,"" she says. ""So don't panic, please vote, and focus on awareness to support your business through this time."""
New poll shows who Hispanics are backing in southwest swing states,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-poll-shows-hispanics-backing-southwest-swing-states,2024-10-07T15:06:03Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

With less than a month to go until Election Day in November, a new poll indicates Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Trump among self-identified Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada, two crucial southwestern battleground states.

But Trump has made gains with younger male Hispanic voters compared to four years ago, according to a pair of Suffolk University/USA Today surveys released on Monday.

According to the poll, Harris leads Trump 57%-38% among Hispanic voters in Arizona, with Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver both under 1% support. Three percent of voters remain undecided. When asked how they voted in the 2020 election, 55% of those Hispanic voters said they voted for President Biden, while a third said they voted for Trump.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW

The vice president's lead over the former president is slightly smaller in neighboring Nevada, at 56%-40%. According to the survey, Independent American Party's Joel Skousen is just over 1%, Libertarian Chase Oliver is under 1%, and 2% are undecided. When asked how they voted in the 2020 election, 56% said they voted for Biden, while 33% said they voted for Trump.

""So far, Harris is falling short of the 24-26 point advantage that Joe Biden carried with Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada in 2020, according to the exit polls from those states,"" Suffolk University Political Research Center director David Paleologos highlighted. ""This Democratic shortfall is largely due to young Hispanic men.""

In both states, a majority of men under 50 years of age are choosing Trump over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 53%-40% among Hispanic men ages 18-34 in Nevada, and tops her 53%-39% among Hispanic men ages 35-49.

In Arizona, the Republican presidential nominee leads the Democratic Party standard-bearer 51%-39% among Hispanic men ages 18-34, and 57%-37% among Hispanic men ages 35-49.

TIGHTEST PRESIDENTIAL RACE SINCE 2000 - WITH ONE MONTH UNTIL ELECTION DAY

The economy and immigration were the top two issues on the minds of those questioned in the survey in both states.

Arizona and Nevada have referendums to protect access to abortion on the ballot in November - and the poll indicates majority support for the measures in both states.

Arizona and Nevada - along with Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin - had razor-thin margins in the 2020 presidential election that decided Biden's victory over Trump. And all seven states are likely to determine if Harris or Trump wins the 2024 election in the race for the White House.

The latest surveys in Arizona and Nevada - as well as the other five swing states - indicate margin-of-error races between Harris and Trump.

The Suffolk University/USA Today surveys were conducted Sept. 27-Oct. 2, through live interviews of 500 self-identified Hispanic voters in the states of Arizona and Nevada. The overall sampling error for results from each state is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points."
Supreme Court denies Biden administration appeal over federal emergency abortion requirement in Texas,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-denies-biden-administration-appeal-over-federal-emergency-abortion-requirement-texas,2024-10-07T15:06:02Z,"Abortion Survivors founder Melissa Ohden breaks down how Governor Tim Walz has changed Minnesota's abortion laws during an appearance on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.'

The U.S. Supreme Court decided not to hear oral arguments about whether a Texas state abortion ban is at odds with a federal emergency care law - permitting the ban in the Lone Star state to be upheld.

Supreme Court justices, for now, are keeping in place a lower court ruling that hospitals in Texas can deny terminating certain emergency pregnancies that violate state law, despite the federal requirement.

The Biden administration had requested that the justices overturn the lower court's ruling, contending that federal law requires hospitals to provide abortions in emergency situations. They referenced last term, when the Supreme Court permitted emergency room abortions to continue in Idaho while a lawsuit continues in federal court. Texas is asserting that its laws are distinct from Idaho's because Texas has a health exception for pregnant patients.

TEXAS SUPREME COURT REJECTS CHALLENGE TO STATE ABORTION BAN'S MEDICAL EXCEPTIONS

In Texas, the central legal issue is whether the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which mandates hospitals to treat emergency conditions, overrides state laws that prohibit abortion in emergencies. The case focuses on whether a state can stop an emergency physician from performing an abortion if it's necessary to stabilize a pregnant woman's health.

Previously, the Texas Supreme Court ruled in June against a group of women who suffered serious pregnancy complications and became the first in the country to testify in court about being denied abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022.

In a unanimous ruling, the court upheld the Texas law after the women filed a lawsuit in March 2023 seeking clarity on when exceptions to the abortion ban are permitted, arguing the law was confusing for doctors who might turn away patients over fears of repercussions.

The court ultimately ruled that the law's exceptions are broad enough and that doctors would be misinterpreting the law if they decided not to perform an abortion when the mother's life is in danger.

With the SCOTUS decision looming just a month before Election Day, abortion has become a major focus for the Harris-Walz campaign.

New Supreme Court Term Starts Today: Here Are The Biggest Cases To Watch -- So Far,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/07/new-supreme-court-term-starts-today-here-are-the-biggest-cases-to-watch-so-far/,2024-10-07T15:02:28Z,"The Supreme Court's new term kicks off on Monday, with justices already slated to hear major cases on such topics as transgender rights and guns -- and other huge cases could still be added, including on the 2024 election and former President Donald Trump's criminal cases.

The Supreme Court's term begins on Monday and will run through the end of June. It's unclear when rulings in the court's major cases will come out. Decisions are usually released a few months after the court hears oral arguments, meaning rulings will come out quicker for cases heard earlier in the term, though the biggest decisions of the court's term are often released in June.

The Supreme Court is likely to add a number of other major cases to its docket this term. The court has already been asked to hear such cases as a lawsuit seeking damages for oil companies' impacts on climate change and a challenge to a school's race-neutral admissions practices, but has not yet ruled on taking those up. A number of gun-specific challenges have also been filed with the court, including cases regarding Maryland's assault weapons ban, the ban on people convicted of felonies possessing guns, whether states can ban 18-to-20-year olds from purchasing guns and whether people under felony indictment can buy guns. Lawsuits taking issue with the Biden administration's new efforts on student loan forgiveness are also winding through the courts, and while the Supreme Court already upheld a block on a student debt relief effort in August, it could be asked again to consider the issue more fully. The Supreme Court punted last term on abortion when it ruled challengers trying to restrict abortion drug mifepristone didn't have standing to bring the case and dismissed a challenge against Idaho's abortion ban, but both cases are still moving forward in lower courts as plaintiffs try to make the cases work, and could return to the high court.

After ruling last term that Trump and other ex-presidents have some immunity from criminal prosecution -- ruling he can't be charged for anything he did that was an ""official act"" as president, but can be prosecuted for actions outside his official duties -- justices could be asked this term to weigh in on the issue for a second time. The Supreme Court directed Trump's criminal case for trying to overturn the 2020 election to go back to the lower court, and U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan now has to decide which charges against Trump comply with the Supreme Court's ruling and can proceed to trial. Trump is all but certain to appeal whatever Chutkan decides, however, and it could be up to the Supreme Court to make the final determination on the issue. Special Counsel Jack Smith is also now trying to revive the federal case against Trump for allegedly mishandling White House documents, after Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon threw it out because she found Smith had been unlawfully appointed. That appeal could also go to the Supreme Court to determine whether Smith and other special counsels have the appropriate authority.

The Supreme Court is also likely to play a role in the November election, as it did in 2020. Justices were repeatedly asked to weigh in on cases challenging the election results in that election, which could happen again this year should Trump lose the election. There are also lawsuits challenging various voting rules that could still make their way to the Supreme Court before Election Day or become a factor while ballots are being counted, most notably regarding whether ballots must be received by Election Day.

The Supreme Court's term kicks off as Americans have become increasingly dissatisfied with the 6-3 conservative bench, amid a series of ethics scandals and controversial rulings. The court ended its last term with a slew of major rulings, including the Trump immunity case, striking down a ban on bump stocks for guns, killing Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy settlement, allowing a ban on ""public camping"" that targets the homeless, limiting charges for Jan. 6 rioters and overturning a longstanding precedent that gave broad power to federal agencies. Justices have also refused to enact a binding ethics code amid a series of controversies involving potential conflicts of interests, particularly by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. A Gallup poll conducted in September found 51% of Americans now disapprove of the Supreme Court as its new term begins, versus 44% who approve of the job justices are doing. Results broke heavily along party lines, with 83% of Democrats disapproving of the high court versus only 19% of Republicans."
Harris echoes debunked claim about Georgia abortion limits causing woman's death despite pushback from doctors,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-echoes-debunked-claim-about-georgia-abortion-limits-causing-womans-death-despite-pushback-from-doctors,2024-10-07T10:33:58Z,"Two Georgia doctors, one a congressman and the other a state legislator, weigh in on the tragic case of Amber Nicole Thurman and media claims that state laws regulating abortion led to her death.

Vice President Kamala Harris repeated the left's claim Sunday that a woman in Georgia died due to delayed care as a result of the state's abortion limits, despite doctors previously denouncing the narrative as false.

During an interview on the raunchy and often-sexually explicit ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, host Alex Cooper asked Harris about the impact of the overturning of Roe v. Wade, blaming the death of Amber Nicole Thurman on the Supreme Court ruling and the state's abortion limits after she received a chemically induced abortion in 2022.

""So, Amber was a young mother of a six-year-old son. She was a medical assistant who was so excited because she was just getting on her feet to be independent. She got her own apartment in a gated community with a pool that her son could play in. She got accepted to nursing school,"" Harris told listeners.

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

""She was, as described by her family, so excited and so ambitious, and she had plans. Then she found out she was pregnant, and she didn't want to go through with her pregnancy. And she was living in Georgia, and she couldn't receive care there because she was past six weeks. And so she ended up going to another state, and...she couldn't get there on time. And because the other state had been so overwhelmed by all these women coming from all these southern states who couldn't get treatment in their own state, her window for her appointment had closed and instead of having a surgical procedure, she had medication and basically went back home and then had some complications and went to the hospital because she was bleeding.""

""And they delayed 20 hours before they treated her,"" Harris continued, suggesting that Georgia's laws prevented her from receiving lifesaving care.

Her remark comes after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

Harris and other members of the Democratic Party, including her running mate Tim Walz, have cited their deaths as evidence for the need to expand abortion access after the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.

""Here's the thing that's so messed up about this,"" Harris told Cooper. ""Some of these people will say whoa, but I do believe in exceptions, I believe that there should be an exception in terms of the life of the mother. You know what that means in practical terms? She's almost dead before you decide to give her care. What, so we're going to have public health policy that says a doctor, a medical professional, waits until you're at death's door before they gives you care. That's outrageous...where is the humanity?""

Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

OB-GYNs have criticized the Amber Thurman narrative as a misleading story that is being pushed by the media and Democrats.

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Charlotte Lozier Institute Vice President and Director of Medical Affairs Dr. Ingrid Skop called out the ""fearmongering"" and ""lies"" of the media that are hurting women who don't understand new abortion laws.

""I was not surprised to see this pro-abortion media try to point the blame at Georgia's pro-life laws, but, in fact, Georgia's laws allow doctors to intervene to save the life of the woman,"" Skop recently told Fox News Digital.

""I think the focus of the Democratic Party upon abortion as an issue is only because the American people do not understand the laws. Many times, women are hurt by abortions. It is not necessary for women to live their best life. And, of course, it's the fearmongering and lies that have led us to this place where we are today, where people even think there would be a reason to point at the law.""

U.S. Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., and state Rep. Mark Newton have also come out to say they don't believe Georgia laws had anything to do with Thurman's death, alleging it was caused by complications from abortion pills because doctors may have waited too long to intercede.

""We never deny a woman an abortion because it's going to harm her in some way. She will always be protected,"" McCormick said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital.

""You have every right to an abortion, even with that heartbeat law,"" he continued. ""So, let's make that very clear right now. When they say there's no exceptions, there's never any law in any state where there's no exceptions. That doesn't exist. That's simply not the way it works. The mother's life is always protected. With that said, it doesn't mean it's easy to get an abortion just because you have a complication or because something goes wrong.""

Dr. Christina Francis, CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), made similar comments on ""Fox & Friends"" last month.

""We are seeing the direct results of spreading lies and misinformation about these laws. Women are being harmed by that because they are delaying in seeking care. And so I think it's really important, no matter where somebody stands on the issue of abortion, we should all want women to have accurate information so that they seek care immediately if they're experiencing complications from things like these high-risk abortion drugs,"" Francis said.

ProPublica previously defended their story in a statement to Fox News Digital, saying, ""We stand by our reporting. The state's committee of more than 30 experts concluded that the deaths of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller were preventable, a newsworthy finding. Our ongoing reporting is illuminating the challenges doctors face in caring for patients with pregnancy complications in states with restricted access to abortion.""

The Harris campaign did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment."
Opinion | Texas and Florida are too big an opportunity for Dems to pass up,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/senate-texas-florida-democrats-cruz-scott-rcna174071,2024-10-07T10:26:25Z,"With the path to maintaining their Senate majority narrowing, Democrats are going on the offense against Sens. Ted Cruz and Rick Scott.

Democrats can look at Florida and Texas in a couple of ways. From one angle, the states are both places where victory has been just out of reach -- a tantalizing ""what if?"" From another, they offer an unlearned lesson in heartbreak, a constant loop of Lucy yanking the football away from Charlie Brown at the last second.

For now, the former point of view is winning out as Senate Democrats look to hold on to their slim majority. A new wave of money and interest has begun to pour into Florida and Texas as polls show tightening races and Election Day fast approaches. And with incumbents like Republican Sens. Rick Scott of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas as their targets, it's not hard to see why Democrats see going on the offense as a risk worth taking.

The electoral map was never a good one for Senate Democrats this cycle, forced to defend far more seats than their Republican counterparts. With the GOP set to claim a seat from retiring Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.Va., the upper house is already starting from a 50-50 split. The odds for Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., pulling off an upset in his now deep-red state have continued to narrow, forcing Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to look elsewhere for a path to a majority. And that road requires knocking off at least one of the two least likable members of the GOP caucus.

Things are looking tight in Texas again this time around, with Democratic Rep. Colin Allred closing in on Cruz. Most polls still have Cruz ahead by around 3 points, but an outlier run by Morning Consult had the congressman up by 1 point. That's still within the margin of error, but the numbers have galvanized Democrats' hope that the state might be a jump ball. Accordingly, the Cook Political Report shifted the rating in that race from ""likely Republican"" to ""lean Republican"" on Tuesday, reflecting Allred's momentum.

Cruz at least is extremely aware of his own vulnerability. He roared into the Senate in 2012 and quickly made a name for himself as a darling of the far-right tea party movement. But his bid for president in 2016 faltered and his first re-election bid in 2018 ended up a squeaker that he won by less than 3 points. In the last two years, as he's prepared to face voters again, Cruz has sought to refashion himself as a bipartisan moderate, a hard task when you've built your whole brand on being a provocateur and ideological bomb-thrower.

Scott, on the other hand, hasn't bothered following Cruz's lead in playing for the middle (despite winning his seat that same year by just 0.1 points). Instead, the first-term senator is angling to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., at the top of the GOP caucus and take the title of majority leader, if all goes according to plan. But his time at the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee during the most recent midterms wasn't exactly a wild success, nor was his bid to pounce against McConnell last year.

Former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell isn't faring quite as well against Scott as Allred is against Cruz, but she is gaining traction. Five Thirty Eight's polling average has Scott up by 4 points, which is half of the lead he held over the summer. Mucarsel-Powell has also been set on making the race into a referendum on reproductive rights. In doing so, she's hoping to draw enough support from the abortion amendment on the ballot to negate any benefit Scott could get from riding former President Donald Trump's coattails.

The optimistic view is that each contest could be won with either more dedicated discipline from local Democrats or greater resources and attention from the national party. But recent history has shown that neither is a guarantee of success. Cruz's challenger in 2018, former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, was popular both locally and nationally, seen as a real contender at finally winning a statewide race in Texas after a more than 20-year drought for Democrats. Likewise, former Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., transformed her race in 2022 against Sen. Marco Rubio into a national referendum on the GOP, but neither managed to unseat their opponent.

Those two races raised -- and spent -- a jaw-dropping amount of money in the process. O'Rourke's campaign drew in a staggering $80 million, the most a single U.S. Senate candidate has ever raised. Demings managed to raise almost as much for her race, considerably outspending Rubio in the process. This year, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee announced in late September that both Mucasal-Powell and Allred will get support in the form of a multimillion-dollar ad buy in their states, but the DSCC has yet to disclose exactly how much is going to each candidate.

The two biggest unknowns in these races are factors outside of the individual candidates' control: infrastructure and demographics.

Florida was once the biggest swing state in the country but has shifted to the right in the last decade, producing blowout wins for the GOP in the 2022 midterms. It doesn't help that the Democratic Party there has been a bit of a mess, if we're being honest, which has left a vacuum for Trump to fill in his new home state. And Scott, who has already spent $8 million of his own money in this race, is sure to keep shoveling in cash to offset the DSCC's investment.

Conversely, Texas is deep Republican territory that Democrats have spent the last decade trying to transform into a purple state. An influx of people into the Austin and Houston metro areas has come with a boost in liberal voters. A major question mark hovers over how the state's Latinos wind up voting this year, as the GOP has been making major inroads with border communities. Meanwhile, Texas' Republican attorney general has been cracking down on voting rights, potentially alienating Latinos in the process.

With less than four weeks to go, this is not an ideal scenario for Democrats. There's plenty of reason for cynicism in the face of these odds and so many prior disappointments. But with this much on the line, there's little choice but to square up and take a running start at that football again. Better to land flat on your back than be left wishing you'd taken the chance at dispatching the likes of Scott and Cruz."
SCOTUS kicks off historic term under scrutiny amid ethics code debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/scotus-kicks-off-historic-term-scrutiny-ethics-code-debate,2024-10-07T10:05:55Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The Supreme Court begins its new term today amid lingering internal strife over several recent rulings, with details of its thorny internal deliberations selectively leaked to certain media outlets.

All of this as the nine justices have come under increasing public scrutiny and criticism over perceived blatant partisanship on hot-button issues, ethics controversies and its own wilting reputation as a body remaining above politics.

""The Supreme Court, in a sense, is on the ballot this election, or at least the future of the Supreme Court,"" said Thomas Dupree, an appellate attorney and former top Justice Department official. ""So any time the court wades into political waters, it's going to be upsetting people, people who are on the side that loses. And they'll say the court shouldn't have got involved in the political fray. The court recognizes that it's not something that it wants to do, but in some cases, it has no choice.""

JUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON SAYS SHE WOULD SUPPORT AN 'ENFORCEABLE CODE' OF ETHICS FOR THE SUPREME COURT

Here are five questions confronting the Supreme Court:

Directly or indirectly, the nine members of the Supreme Court could again play an outsized role in determining who will be the next president.

There is no indication yet of another Bush v. Gore, the case in which the justices in 2000 ended ongoing litigation over the Florida election results, essentially handing the presidency to George W. Bush.

But the high court four years ago summarily refused to consider a series of lawsuits from Trump and other Republicans in five states President Biden won: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Former President Trump has again promised court challenges if he loses, and in a recent social media post, he said this election ""will be under the closest professional scrutiny"" and ""people that cheated will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law.""

Trump has proceeded with his campaign without the imminent cloud of legal jeopardy hanging over his head. His criminal sentencing in the New York business fraud conviction has been postponed until November at least.

And his two separate federal cases involving document mishandling and 2020 election interference have been deferred indefinitely. Those prosecutions could disappear entirely if Trump is elected and dismisses the Justice Department's special counsel.

All this after the Supreme Court in July ruled former presidents enjoy a substantial amount of immunity for ""official acts"" committed in office. Trump has used that ruling to demand both of his federal cases be dismissed.

Two justices took the unusual step of commenting publicly on its effect.

""You gave us a very hard question,"" Justice Neil Grouch exclusively told Fox News' ""America Reports"" co-anchor Sandra Smith. ""It's the first time in American history that one presidential administration was seeking to bring criminal charges against a predecessor. We had to go back and look at what sources were available to us.""

The Trump appointee said the Supreme Court ruled in Nixon v. Fitzgerald (1982) that civil claims cannot be brought against a president ""presumptively, in his official capacity, after he leaves office. Why? Because that would chill him from exercising the powers and duties of a president while he is president,"" Gorsuch said. ""He would be overwhelmed. His political enemies would simply bring suits against him forevermore.""

But Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who was on the losing side of the 6-3 opinion, has taken another approach.

""I was concerned about a system that appeared to provide immunity for one individual under one set of circumstances, when we have a criminal justice system that had ordinarily treated everyone the same,"" she told CBS News while promoting her new book, ""Lovely One: A Memoir.""

The Supreme Court has already gotten involved in several pre-election challenges: allowing some redistricting maps for congressional seats to go into effect and blocking others.

And the justices last month allowed Arizona to temporarily enforce its law requiring proof of citizenship on state voter registration forms.

'STOP PRETENDING': CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST WANTS DEMS BEHIND SCOTUS ETHICS RULES TO TAKE THEIR OWN MEDICINE

Five days before President Biden withdrew as a candidate for re-election, he made the Supreme Court a major political issue.

Word leaked from the White House on July 16 that Biden was seriously considering proposals to establish term limits for the justices, and an ethics code that would be enforceable under law, amid growing concerns they were not being held accountable.

The proposal was made public days later, including a congressional law limiting justices to 18-year terms despite the Constitution's guarantee of life tenure for all federal judges.

Biden framed it as an effort to address ""recent extreme opinions the Supreme Court has handed down [that] have undermined long-established civil rights principles and protections.""

Public calls for changes came after revelations of previously undisclosed free trips and gifts by the justices and lucrative book deals. Recent public polls support greater ethics reform.

Other federal judges are bound by an enforceable code of conduct, but the high court had long resisted being included.

Under Chief Justice John Roberts' leadership, he and his colleagues adopted a revised code last year, but it still lacks any enforcement mechanism, which critics say makes it feckless and ineffective.

Fox News previously reported that the court had been privately meeting for months on how to structure a new ethics code, one that would address public concerns over its behavior without abdicating what Roberts in particular had said was the court's independence on such matters from congressional oversight.

So, the justices have near-total discretion to decide whether to abide by the new code.

But growing and very public calls for more have come from some justices in recent days.

""A binding code of ethics is pretty standard for judges,"" said Jackson, ""and so I guess the question is: Is the Supreme Court any different? I guess I have not seen a persuasive reason as to why the court is different.""

""I am considering supporting it as a general matter,"" she said. ""I'm not going to get into commenting on particular policy proposals, but from my perspective, I don't have any problem with an enforceable code.""

And Justice Elena Kagan, perhaps the most vocal advocate for an enforcement provision, said this month, ""It seems like a good idea in terms of ensuring that people have confidence that we're doing exactly that. So, it seems like a salutary thing for the court.""

Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin, D-Ill., recently told the chief justice that the unilateral ethics code adopted by the justices falls short and needs an enforcement trigger.

In a closed-door meeting with federal judges attending a semiannual policymaking conference at the high court, Durbin was seated next to Roberts and made clear that failure by the justices to strengthen their judicial code of conduct could prompt congressional intervention.

Sources say Roberts made no commitments but thanked Durbin for the ongoing dialogue on the issue.

But Justice Neil Gorsuch urged caution, telling ""Fox News Sunday"" host Shannon Bream last month that he did not want to get into ""what is now a political issue during a presidential election year.""

He added about the role of an independent judiciary, ""It's there for the moments when the spotlight's on you, when the government's coming after you. And don't you want a ferociously independent judge and a jury of your peers to make those decisions? Isn't that your right as an American? And so I just say be careful.""

TOP DEM PLOTS TYING SCOTUS FUNDING TO 'ENFORCEABLE' ETHICS CODE AMID THOMAS, ALITO CONTROVERSIES

Following the contentious conclusion of the court's term in July, much was written about the ""Barrett Factor"" and the supposedly evolving jurisprudence of Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

She has become something of a recent lightning rod on the right and left over her occasional willingness to depart from her fellow conservatives, especially in cases involving the man who appointed her in 2020.

The 52-year-old Barrett took issue with some conclusions in the former president's historic immunity ruling and criticized parts of the majority ruling keeping him on the ballot in Colorado.

And breaking with conservatives, she separately authored pointed dissents on an obstruction case dealing with a 2021 U.S. Capitol riot suspect as well as an environmental case on federal rules to manage downwind air pollution.

Many court watchers on the left characterized her ""burgeoning"" legal reasoning as an ""independent streak,"" increasingly ready to ""skewer"" her right-leaning colleagues and a ""principled voice in the middle"" with a strong set of principles that present a ""different world view"" from other conservative justices.

But other legal observers say it is too early to dub Barrett the new deciding vote on hot-button cases who would resist walking lockstep with any ideological bloc.

""I don't think she's really trying to become the 'swing' justice or auditioning for that role. She's calling these cases as she sees them, and she's, generally speaking, a conservative justice,"" said Dupree. ""But what we've seen over the last term is Justice Barrett really coming into her own. She has the confidence to write separately and in some cases to break from the other conservatives when she sees the law a little differently. I suspect that will continue.""

And it remains clear Barrett's conservative credentials in most cases are solid: She has ruled to strike down Roe v. Wade, expand gun rights and scale back affirmative action in higher education.

SCOTUS GIVES PARTIAL VICTORY TO GOP TRYING TO ENFORCE PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP TO VOTE IN ARIZONA

We recently highlighted potential Supreme Court nominees in another Biden or Trump administration, based on what sources in both camps exclusively told Fox News.

Now the dynamic has shifted, with Vice President Harris heading the Democrat ticket.

Campaign sources say the whirlwind of taking over the nomination from her boss in recent weeks has left Harris, her legal advisers and campaign team little time to focus on the what-ifs of choosing justices or broader legal policy.

But it is a topic of particular interest to the former prosecutor, state attorney general and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Administration sources say that since taking office, she has been part of the inner circle cultivating an informal White House list of high court possibles. And Harris was deeply involved in spearheading Jackson's selection and confirmation in 2022, Biden's only Supreme Court nominee.

As a senator, her 2018 questioning at the confirmation hearings for now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh were especially contentious, and she later called for his impeachment after unproven allegations of past sexual misconduct.

Harris herself was under serious consideration for a Supreme Court seat during the Obama years, but sources say her percolating ambitions at the time were directed to elected office.

As for Trump, sources close to him tell Fox News he is expected to soon release his own preemptive list of candidates, as the Republican nominee did in 2016. That evolving list of two dozen or so names became a centerpiece of his successful campaign and later presidency.

This time, the former president will rely on those he has already named to the federal bench for the top names he would choose from to fill any Supreme Court vacancy.

VP HARRIS OUTLINES 'ORDERLY AND SECURE' IMMIGRATION PLAN, RIPS TRUMP IN FIRST BORDER STOP SINCE NOMINATION

The Constitution's framers viewed the judiciary as the ""least dangerous branch,"" but to hear some politicians and pundits on both the left and right, the Supreme Court is prepared to lead the country into imminent ruin.

Such attacks on the justices are nothing new, but the tenor of the criticism, especially in a presidential year, coupled with self-inflicted missteps on ethics and docket discretion, have combined to put its nine members on the defensive.

And the public seems to have noticed.

A Gallup poll this summer found 43% approve of how the Supreme Court handles its job, with 52% disapproval. That is a drop of 15 points since 2020 (58%-38%). In 2000, 62% approved of the institution.

Especially concerning the court are continued leaks to the media of its internal, mostly secretive, operations.

A draft opinion of the 2022 ""Dobbs"" abortion case, published two months before the final ruling that struck down nationwide access to the procedure, sent shock waves in Washington in a massive breach of protocol.

That was followed by selective leaks in the past year over how the court decided hot-button issues like affirmative action and election redistricting.

And in recent weeks, the New York Times received leaked internal memos from the chief justice over his leading role in the Trump immunity opinion.

Court sources say the leakers, who have never been publicly identified, have further eroded institutional camaraderie and trust among the justices, long seen as essential to doing their jobs. It has led to outside partisan finger-pointing.

Roberts, who will gavel in his 20th term next week as chief justice, has not publicly responded to the latest controversies or calls for ethics reform, declining repeated invitations from the Senate to testify.

It reflects his ""less is best"" approach to explaining and promoting his own court's resolution of thorny legal and political issues.

In September 2022, after the abortion ruling was issued, he said, ""Simply because people disagree with opinions is not a basis for questioning the legitimacy of the court. I think just moving forward from things that were unfortunate is the best way to respond,"" he said.

And he has carefully glided over his role to force internal change and to defend his court's reputation all while being unable to stop the continuing leaks over their deliberations.

""It seems like at times they're [leakers] motivated to be able to potentially lead to mistrust in the [judicial] branch, attacks on what the branch is doing,"" said Jennifer Mascott, a former law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas and then-Judge Kavanaugh and now a Catholic University law professor.

Added Dupree, ""You can't have a court deliberate and perform its constitutionally assigned function if it can't be ensured of the sanctity of its deliberations, if it thinks that anything that one justice says to another colleague or any memo that they write internally is going to appear on the front page of the newspapers the next day. That's a very, very worrisome trend. It may be the new normal.""

After a three-month recess, the justices met together for the first time this week to reset their docket and discuss appeals that have been filed over the summer.

Sources say the chief justice, who leads the closed-door meeting, had sent a memo to his colleagues indicating some of the controversies surrounding the court, like the leaks and ethics reform, would be privately and candidly discussed.

The Supreme Court in its new term will confront issues like gun rights and transgender care for minors, with pending appeals over the Affordable Care Act, religious freedom, immigration and abortion access.

It is a unique, fast-moving time of change and challenge at an institution used to being slow and deliberate.

""I did learn early on that when you are holding the reins of leadership, you should be careful not to tug on them too much,"" said Roberts in 2016. ""You will find out they aren't connected to anything."""
It's a close race for Michigan. These factors could decide it for Harris or Trump,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/nx-s1-5130163/michigan-2024-election-harris-trump,2024-10-07T09:06:21Z,"A Trump and Harris sign side-by-side in a neighborhood on Oct. 3, 2024 in Hillsdale, Mich. Sylvia Jarrus for NPR hide caption

Michigan is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House.

The state is part of the ""blue wall,"" along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, that she and Democrats need to hold to avoid a second Donald Trump presidency.

It's home to some of the key demographics that both parties are courting this election, from white voters without college degrees to the largest Black-majority city, Detroit, and one of the nation's largest Arab American populations.

But the path to victory is not easy this year. Harris and Trump remain in a close battle, as his populist message continues to resonate with white voters and union and blue-collar workers, particularly on the economy.

Dave Dulio, a professor of political science and director of the Center for Civic Engagement at Oakland University, says ""in places like Macomb County, with many blue-collar voters and union workers, Trump made inroads by pledging to get the U.S. out of bad trade deals and renegotiate NAFTA, which he did.""

""I think they still give him credit for that,"" he added.

Dulio underscores the state's significance by noting that small shifts could lead to substantial changes for candidates: ""If you take a small shift among the Arab American community and a small shift among union workers, those multiple small shifts could drive a very different result.""

Both candidates have heaped attention recently on the Wolverine State. On Oct 4, Harris visited a Redford Charter Township firehouse near Detroit, meeting union representatives. She met with Arab American and Muslim leaders then appeared with United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain in Flint and vowed support for Michigan's auto industry. Trump held campaign events twice in September and took his presidential campaign to Saginaw Valley State University in Kochville Township on Oct. 3.

Michigan also plays to the strengths of the vice presidential nominees, who hail from the Midwest. Both Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have stumped in the state in the last month.

To better understand the key issues shaping voters' decisions -- from the economy and immigration to abortion and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East -- we are in Michigan this week hearing directly from voters and political observers as part of our ""We, The Voters"" series.

A September poll by The New York Times and Siena College found that Michigan voters cared most about the economy, followed by abortion and immigration.

Economy

Michigan's unemployment rate is historically low, according to state data, but it has slowly ticked up in recent months. Meanwhile, inflation has eased, but high costs of living remain a concern.

The state continues to suffer from the decades-long decline of automobile manufacturing, and high interest rates have constricted sales of cars, according to a September study from the University of Michigan.

Both parties are trying to put focus on the economy. GOP attack ads argue that Biden and Harris are responsible for inflation, while the vice president's messaging focuses on plans to uplift the middle class and paint Trump-era tax cuts as benefiting the wealthy.

Meghan Wilson, an expert in public policy and urban development, said Harris could expand the Democratic position on economics by appealing to Black business owners and holders of student debt.

""African Americans in Detroit have a lot of small businesses, and so we're looking for capital for those kinds of small businesses. I think Kamala Harris is doing a great job of bringing the small businesses into the conversation,"" Wilson explained.

Organized labor plays a key role in Michigan's economy. Both parties are making a play for Michigan's union members, who accounted for 13% of workers in the state last year. Exit polls in 2020 showed Michigan's union voters favoring President Biden over Trump, and Biden pledged to be ""the most pro-union president"" in U.S. history, which he backed up with a visit to UAW workers striking in Wayne, Mich.

Michigan pollster Bernie Porn said Biden's visit to striking workers helped him bump up his union support, but his policies to advance electric vehicles with tax credits were unpopular with Independent and Republican voters.

""You have Harris leading among union members with 63% which is almost where Biden was in 2020 with 65%, so she's improving her lot among union members, but still, the EVs are a problem,"" he said.

Still, one encouraging sign for the Harris campaign could be Michigan's local Teamsters union backing her candidacy, breaking with the national union that declined to endorse any candidate for U.S. president, after they had supported every Democratic candidate for president since Bill Clinton.

Abortion

Two years ago, Michigan voters approved a landmark amendment to the state constitution, securing the right to abortion and other reproductive health services.

Democrats won control of all three branches of Michigan's governments since making abortion a central voting issue.

But that success may have made it a less influential issue in the 2024 election. A KFF poll in June found that women in Michigan saw abortion as ""decided"" and they were more concerned about inflation and the rising cost of living.

""The Democrats are putting an awful lot of their eggs in the basket of abortion,"" the pollster Porn said.

Dulio pointed out that Trump's main weakness stems from what has driven Democratic success in every election -- and not necessarily abortion since it's already decided in the state: ""His character remains a key weakness. He's deeply unpopular because of the Jan. 6 spectacle and doubling down on his claims that the 2020 election was stolen. That just turns off persuadable voters,"" he said.

Michigan is home to one of the largest Black populations in the nation, ahead of Louisiana, Alabama and South Carolina, and the largest Black-majority city, Detroit.

Harris would herself be the nation's first Black woman president, but some Black voters may not be as motivated to vote as they were in 2020.

""The main challenge is the enthusiasm gap,"" said Ronald Brown, a political scientist at Wayne State University. He said among Black voters in Michigan, those who were in the ""black leadership class"" -- meaning serving in government, churches, Black fraternities and sororities -- were highly likely to vote for Harris. However, those without deep connections to the party, especially working-class and poor Detroit residents, were susceptible to sitting out elections. In particular, he pointed to Detroit's recent voter turnout -- higher in 2020 than it was in 2016 -- as a key factor explaining the state's pick for Biden after it went for Trump four years earlier.

""What could occur is that among working class and poor Black voters, lack of interest could lead to fatigue and this may drive those voters not to vote. And in Michigan, you don't need many. You need enough,"" he said.

Democratic state Sen. Sarah Anthony has a different perspective. She had seen an encouraging gain among young people to help shore up Harris' base.

""The Biden coalition included many working-class white men, a group Vice President Harris has struggled to win over. While there may have been losses there, the data I've seen shows significant gains due to increased enthusiasm among young people and people of color,"" she said.

U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East

The Detroit Metropolitan area has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the U.S. Dearborn, often called the Capital of Arab America, is home to a majority of Lebanese residents who maintain strong ties to southern Lebanon.

Arab and Muslim voters here were largely supportive of Biden in 2020. However, many have since been alienated by his handling of Israel's deadly war in Gaza and the administration's ongoing military aid to Israel. Many now are similarly concerned about Israel's continuing bombardment of Beirut and ground invasion along the countries' shared border.

Abbas Alawieh, a Dearborn Democratic strategist and one of the co-founders of the ""uncommitted movement,"" backed Biden in 2020. But earlier this year, he and other organizers successfully secured more than 100,000 ""uncommitted"" votes in the Michigan primary to protest Biden's handling of the war in Gaza.

Alawieh, who had advocated for a Gaza ceasefire, told Morning Edition host Leila Fadel that he feels more despair now as the conflict spreads to his family's homeland, Lebanon.

""This is a grieving community. So, for us to give guidance to vote for Kamala Harris, when she is part of the administration that's actively killing their family members, it's like giving a campaign speech at a funeral.""

Professor Dubio said the uncommitted movement has the potential to ""have a huge impact,"" and while he believes many of them will ultimately vote for Harris, he added, ""it can't and shouldn't be ignored.""

Abbas mentioned sending letters to Vice President Harris's team, including her national security advisor, requesting meetings with those directly affected by the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. ""So far, the answer is still no.""

He added that Donald Trump visited the community, took photos with leaders, and invited them to his campaign rally.

Saeed Khan, an associate professor of Near Eastern and Asian Studies at Wayne State University, said Muslim and Arab voters were drifting toward Trump in 2016, and some continue to do so today, not only because of a push away from Democrats, but also a pull toward the Republican party's values. Many Arabs and Muslims, immigrant Muslims, voted for the Republican ticket at least until September 11 and then started to move toward the Democratic Party.

""The Republican message of self-reliance, smaller government or less government intrusion, lower taxes, social conservatism really appealed to many, especially immigrant Muslims and Arabs, because it epitomized the American Dream that they had internalized,"" Khan said."
"Medical debt snares millions of people. States, red and blue are passing laws to help",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5135641/medical-debt-solutions-hospitals-republicans-democrats-state-laws,2024-10-07T09:02:28Z,"While hot-button health care issues such as abortion and the Affordable Care Act roil the presidential race, Democrats and Republicans in statehouses around the country have been quietly working together to tackle the nation's medical debt crisis.

New laws to curb aggressive hospital billing, to expand charity care for lower-income patients, and to rein in debt collectors have been enacted in more than 20 states since 2021.

Democrats championed most measures. But the legislative efforts often passed with Republican support. In a few states, GOP lawmakers led the push to expand patient protections.

""Regardless of their party, regardless of their background ... any significant medical procedure can place people into bankruptcy,"" Florida House Speaker Paul Renner, a conservative Republican, said in an interview. ""This is a real issue.""

Renner, who has shepherded controversial measures to curb abortion rights and expand the death penalty in Florida, this year also led an effort to limit when hospitals could send patients to collections. It garnered unanimous support in the Florida Legislature.

Bipartisan measures in other states have gone further, barring unpaid medical bills from consumer credit reports and restricting medical providers from placing liens on patients' homes.

About 100 million people in the U.S. are burdened by some form of health care debt, forcing millions to drain savings, take out second mortgages, or cut back on food and other essentials, KFF Health News has found. A quarter of those with debt owed more than $5,000 in 2022.

""Republicans in the legislature seem more open to protecting people from medical debt than from other kinds of debt,"" said Marceline White, executive director of Economic Action Maryland, which helped lead efforts in that state to stop medical providers from garnishing the wages of low-income patients. That bill drew unanimous support from Democrats and Republicans

""There seems to be broad agreement that you shouldn't lose your home or your life savings because you got ill,"" White said. ""That's just a basic level of fairness.""

Medical debt remains a more polarizing issue in Washington, where the Biden administration has pushed several efforts to tackle the issue, including a proposed rule by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, to bar all medical debt from consumer credit reports.

Vice President Harris, who is spearheading the administration's medical debt campaign, has touted the work on the presidential campaign trail while calling for new efforts to retire health care debt for millions of Americans.

Former President Donald Trump doesn't typically talk about medical debt while stumping. But congressional Republicans have blasted the CFPB proposal, which House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) called ""regulatory overreach.""

Nevertheless, pollster Michael Perry, who has surveyed Americans extensively about health care, said that conservative voters typically wary of government seem to view medical debt through another lens. ""I think they feel it's so stacked against them that they, as patients, don't really have a voice,"" he said. ""The partisan divides we normally see just aren't there.""

When Arizona consumer advocates put a measure on the ballot in 2022 to cap interest rates on medical debt, 72% of voters backed the initiative.

Similarly, nationwide polls have found more than 80% of Republicans and Democrats back limits on medical debt collections and stronger requirements that hospitals provide financial aid to patients.

Perry surfaced something else that may be driving bipartisan interest in medical debt: growing mistrust as health systems get bigger and act more like major corporations. ""Hospitals aren't what they used to be,"" he said. ""That is making it clear that profit and greed are driving lots of the decision-making.""

Not every state effort to address medical debt has garnered broad bipartisan support.

When Colorado last year became the first state to bar medical debt from residents' credit reports, just one Republican lawmaker backed the measure. A Minnesota bill that did the same thing this year passed without a single GOP vote.

But elsewhere, similarly tough measures have sailed through.

A 2024 Illinois bill to bar credit reporting for medical debt passed unanimously in the state Senate and cleared the House of Representatives 109-2. In Rhode Island, not a single GOP lawmaker opposed a credit reporting ban.

And when the California Legislature took up a 2021 bill to require hospitals in the state to provide more financial assistance to patients, it passed 72-0 in the state Assembly and 39-0 in the Senate.

Even some conservative states, such as Oklahoma, have taken steps, albeit more modest. A new law there bars medical providers from pursuing patients for debts if the provider has not publicly posted its prices. The measure, signed by the state's Republican governor, passed unanimously.

New Mexico state Sen. Steve Neville, a Republican who backed legislation to restrict aggressive collections against low-income patients in that state, said he was simply being pragmatic.

""There was not much advantage to spending a lot of time trying to do collections on indigent patients,"" Neville said. ""If they don't have the money, they don't have the money."" Three of 12 GOP senators supported the measure.

North Carolina state Treasurer Dale Folwell, a Republican who as a state legislator spearheaded a 2012 effort to ban same-sex marriage, said all elected officials, no matter their party, should care about what medical debt is doing to patients.

""It doesn't matter if, as a conservative, I'm saying these things, or if Bernie Sanders is saying these things,"" Folwell said, referencing Vermont's liberal U.S. senator. ""At the end of the day, it should be all our jobs to advocate for the invisible."""

Ruben Gallego and labeling him as ""radical as they come"" after a resurfaced interview of him disparaging Trump voters.

""Isn't that terrible?"" Lake said in response to Fox News Digital reporting of a comment made by Gallego in 2016 where he said that Trump voters were ""dumb"" and the ""worst people in the world.""

""He's been lying about who he is,"" Lake added. ""He's trying to paint himself as a moderate, which is it's laughable if it wasn't so dangerous.""

Lake told Fox News Digital that Gallego ""bullied"" moderate Sen. Kyrsten Sinema out of the race ""because she wasn't liberal enough.""

""Now he is doing all these ads trying to say he's a moderate when, in fact, he's voted to spend our federal dollars, our tax dollars, our money, supporting sanctuary cities and states. He's voted against securing our border every step of the way. He's for an open border America. He's voted to defund the police. He actually co-sponsored the George Floyd legislation, which would have defunded the police nationwide.""

Lake went on to tell Fox News Digital that Gallego has ""never batted an eyelash"" when it comes to spending bills and has not been strong enough defending women's sports.

""He wants biological men to participate in women's athletics.,"" Lake said. ""That means it's an end for girls sports. Anybody out there who played sports? I did for a little bit. It's an end. I mean, if you have to compete with biological men, what's the purpose of having girls sports?""

Lake added, ""It's absolutely crazy and he's as radical as they come.""

Gallego and Lake will both be attempting to sway independent voters, especially in Maricopa County, the largest county in the state, where independents make up a third of the electorate. Lake told Fox News Digital she is optimistic she can win votes from Arizonans who aren't Republicans.

""I do believe that independents are with me, I think we're doing pretty well, our polling is showing that we're building on the independent vote,"" Lake said. ""And I think a lot of Democrats, while he [Gallego] hates Trump voters and he hates Republicans. I don't hate Democrats. I actually believe that disaffected Democrats are going to help us turn the corner.""

""They're realizing, looking at Kamala Harris and Ruben Gallego, and they're saying, wait a minute, this isn't the Democrat Party that I signed up for years ago, the old Democrat Party used to care about the working class.

This Democrat Party is a bunch of globalists, and they are for, they want to spend more money helping people coming here illegally than they do people who are American citizens.""

While the Real Clear Politics average of polls shows Gallego leading Lake by about 7 points, Lake told Fox News Digital she is confident the race is much closer and says her internal polling shows that she is within the margin of error.

""We have to go into it acting like we're ten down, but we're not ten down,"" Lake said. ""This is a very tight race. I'm proud of that, considering, as I said, he spent 75 million. He's been outspending us massively and the fact that this is such a tight race is incredible. Chuck Schumer is in a panic about Arizona. He's dumping 5 million bucks a week into Arizona.""

Lake told Fox News Digital that Democrats are in a ""tailspin"" in Arizona because their efforts to make the election about abortion have not been fruitful because most voters are focused on other issues like the economy.

Lake also criticized Gallego over his record before he entered politics, including his involvement with a bank that worked with illegal immigrants, a harassment claim against him by a 20-year-old intern while he worked at city hall, and his time working for an ambulance company that was being investigated for fraud.

""The people of Arizona know me and they trust me and I love the people of the state, Lake said. ""I want to represent all of them, including people who maybe don't even vote for me. If you choose not to vote for me, I hope I can earn your vote, but I still want to represent you and I want to do a great job for you in Washington, D.C.

Melania Trump says former President Trump was aware of her abortion stance 'since the day we met',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/melania-trump-former-president-trump-aware-abortion-stance-since-day-met,2024-10-06T17:19:22Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Former first lady Melania Trump spoke with former President Trump before writing about her support for abortion in her self-titled memoir, she told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on Sunday.

""He knew my position since the day we met, and I believe in individual freedom. I want to decide what I want to do with my body. I don't want government in my personal business,"" she said in an exclusive ""Sunday Morning Futures"" interview.

""I think it's very important and, as I said in the book, and it's very well explained in the chapter, 'What does my body, my choice mean?' because timing really matters and also the restrictions, so I encourage people to read it because we live in a world that everybody should have individual freedom,"" she continued.

Trump is promoting her upcoming ""Melania"" memoir, which disclosed a shocking truth to many of her husband's supporters regarding her stance on the controversial issue, calling abortion a ""fundamental right of individual liberty,"" according to a report from last Wednesday.

MELANIA TRUMP'S ABORTION VIEWS IN NEW MEMOIR SPUR OUTRAGE FROM PRO-LIFERS: 'SHE IS WRONG'

She reportedly wrote, ""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government.""

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes. Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

MELANIA TRUMP'S PRO-CHOICE STAND ISN'T THAT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER REPUBLICAN FIRST LADIES

The revelation ignited a flurry of responses across the political spectrum, with pro-lifers slamming her for the view they argue fails to align with the Catholic faith, to which she subscribes.

Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America advocacy group, called the view ""anti-feminist"" and the ""opposite of empowerment.""

Others, including Lila Rose and president of pro-life advocacy group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Marjorie Dannenfelser, criticized the stance as well.

On the left, ""The View"" co-host Joy Behar accused Trump of lying about being pro-choice, calling her stance a ""big scam.""

Others have posed the question: why make the revelation just before the election?

""That was not written in the last week or the last month,"" Trump told Bartiromo.

""That book was written months before, and it was in print months before, so that was my belief, and it is my belief, and I wanted to put it in the book because I want to be authentic. I want people to read the book because they could find out a lot of things that were never discussed. I'm very selective in what I do, and when I'm doing interviews or not or where I am or not, and this is my story. This is my perspective and the truth, and there is a lot of misinformation about me and falsehoods written about me, so that book, 'Melania,' will bring out my truth.""

Walz tries to downplay laws he signed granting benefits to illegals in Minnesota: 'Not the VP's position',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/walz-tries-downplay-laws-he-signed-granting-benefits-illegals-minnesota-not-vps-position,2024-10-06T16:46:59Z,"Vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz discusses Israel's right to defend itself and Kamala Harris' economic policies on 'Fox News Sunday.'

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz sought to distance Vice President Kamala Harris from laws he himself signed that granted benefits to illegal immigrants in Minnesota on Sunday.

Walz made the comments during a wide-ranging interview on Fox News Sunday with host Shannon Bream. Bream pressed Walz on his military history and his record on abortion in addition to questioning him on legislation he signed in Minnesota that allows illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses and receive state-funded tuition assistance, among other benefits.

""Are those not magnets to draw people here, many times on dangerous journeys for themselves? And why should your taxpayers in Minnesota or across the states pay for those programs?"" Bream asked.

""Well, that's not the vice president's position,"" Walz admitted, before going on to defend his leadership in Minnesota.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN PUSHES BACK ON 'SNL' SKIT ABOUT ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS: 'DISGUSTING'

""But I will say this, Minnesota ranks as a top five business state. We rank as a top three state for children living, and we're a top state for health care access,"" he said. ""Look, the Vice President has made it clear that she has policies that make a difference. Her border policies are the most strongest, the fairest we've seen.""

Bream also challenged Walz to clarify his ticket's position on abortion access. The exchange ultimately led to Walz flatly accusing former President Trump of lying when he said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law.

Bream began by pointing out that Minnesota's abortion law imposes no limits on abortion procedures through all nine months of pregnancy, something that goes far beyond the provisions of Roe v. Wade, which Harris and Walz said they support.

""You signed the bill that makes it legal through all nine months. Is that a position you think Democrats should advocate for nationally?"" Bream asked.

""The vice president and I have been clear the restoration of Roe versus Wade is what we're asking for,"" Walz responded.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN PLEDGES MORE MEDIA INTERVIEWS AS VOTERS STILL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HER POLICIES

""But that law goes far beyond Roe v. Wade,"" Bream pressed. ""Let's agree, in what you signed there's not a single limit through nine months of pregnancy. Roe had a trimester framework that did have limits through the pregnancy. The Minnesota law does not have that.""

""This doesn't change anything. It puts the decision back on to the woman, to the physicians,"" Walz responded. ""And we know that this is simply something to be brought up - to be very clear Donald Trump's asking for a nationwide abortion ban.""

""[Trump] has said repeatedly that he will not sign a national abortion ban. Are you calling that a flat out lie?"" Bream asked.

""Yes, of course, and Senator Vance has in the past said so too,"" Walz said.

Bream concluded the interview by giving Walz a chance to respond to criticism of his frequent ""misstatements,"" such as his claims about military service and his assertion that he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square massacre.

""Look, I speak passionately. I had an entire career, decades before I was in public office. They know, and I'm very proud of my 24 years in service and my record. I have never disparaged someone else in this, but I know that's not what Donald Trump does. They disparage everyone,"" Walz said.

""I will own up when I misspeak. I will own up when I make a mistake. Let's be very clear. On that debate stage the other night, I asked one very simple question and Senator Vance would not acknowledge that Donald Trump lost the 2020 election,"" he finished."
Want religious freedom? Here's why Kamala Harris is not your candidate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/want-religious-freedom-why-kamala-harris-not-your-candidate,2024-10-06T12:12:31Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A recent poll by the Pew Research Center found that former President Trump is winning the Catholic and Protestant vote.

Conducted from Aug. 26-Sept. 2, the survey found that 52% of Catholics and 61% of Protestants support Trump for president, while 47% of Catholics and 37% of Protestants back Kamala Harris.

As more Americans become aware of how radical Harris is, it's clear to see why Trump has won this support from religious voters.

Harris may have been the surprise replacement for Joe Biden, but her position on issues is far from unknown. She claims to be a future-oriented, change candidate eager to ""turn the page and chart a new way forward.""

DEMOCRATS DRIVING RELIGIOUS VOTE AWAY FROM PARTY AS TRUMP COURTS CATHOLICS: 'ANTI-CHRISTIAN' PARTY

However, Harris is a professional politician with a radical policy record that she can't defend among the religious electorate.

Consider that in 2014, in the case of Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, Attorney General Harris filed an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court and was joined by 13 states and the District of Columbia.

Harris called on the court to force Hobby Lobby to violate its religious beliefs and cover the cost of contraception for its employees. (The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby, protecting the family-owned arts and crafts chain to operate its business in line with its religious beliefs and values.)

5 REASONS KAMALA HARRIS IS SNUBBING THE AL SMITH DINNER, CATHOLICS, AND TRADITION

Also, as attorney general of California, Harris was a vocal advocate and ""proud"" co-sponsor of the Reproductive FACT Act, which Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law in 2015. The law required medically licensed pro-life pregnancy centers to display signs advertising low-cost or free abortions available in California.

The law ""was very clear that it was targeting pro-life viewpoints,"" said Denise Harle, who served as senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom. In a 2018 decision, the Supreme Court agreed with this view and struck down the law.

Writing for the majority in National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra (initially named NIFLA vs. Kamala Harris), Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the majority opinion, ""the FACT Act unduly burdens protected speech.""

As a U.S. senator of California from 2017-2021, Harris introduced and was the lead sponsor of the Do No Harm Act, which would have ended religious exemptions for certain government mandates, such as rules requiring insurance coverage of specific medical procedures. As a legal expert at First Liberty wrote at the time, ""This country was founded on religious liberty. The Do No Harm Act strikes at the heart of that freedom.""

Additionally, the Do No Harm Act would have undermined the bipartisan Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a 1993 landmark law that protects the rights of people of faith to worship freely and in accordance with their conscience.

Further, Sen. Harris was also an original co-sponsor of the ""Equality Act,"" a bill that would have further unraveled the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and enabled the government to prosecute faith-based institutions for refusing to hire employees who openly oppose their religious teachings. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops was clear in denouncing the proposed legislation and said the Equality Act would ""run roughshod over religious liberty.""

Additionally, Sen. Harris questioned three judicial nominees on their affiliation with the Knights of Columbus, suggesting that involvement with the Catholic fraternal organization disqualifies a nominee for potential bias.

When I served as President Trump's ambassador to the Holy See, I witnessed the importance of having a president who stands up for religious freedom. President Trump has a proven track record for promoting and protecting religious freedom at home and abroad. Kamala Harris has repeatedly advanced an anti-faith agenda."
Here's what two undecided Wisconsin voters are holding out for in the 2024 election,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/heres-what-2-undecided-wisconsin-voters-holding-out-2024-election,2024-10-06T08:21:55Z,"WISCONSIN -- With only one month until the presidential election, very few voters are still uncertain about their choice, but in a battleground state like Wisconsin that has flipped in the past two elections, those undecided voters could make the difference.

Estimates of still-undecided voters in Wisconsin are in the low single digits, with the latest Marquette Law School poll reporting that just 4% identified themselves as such.

Fox News Digital spoke with two such voters, who laid out why they are still holding out and what they need to seal the deal.

TRUMP ATTORNEYS ARGUE JACK SMITH'S OBSTRUCTION CHARGES BE DISMISSED, CITING SUPREME COURT'S 'FISCHER' DECISION

""I got to make up my mind when I fill out the paper,"" said 86-year-old Edgar Schiekiera of Waukesha, Wisconsin.

""I'm going to throw a dart,"" he laughed.

Schiekiera is an immigrant from Germany who noted that he grew up during the Second World War. For him, former President Trump's comments on foreign policy have been troubling, enough so to make him hesitate to support Trump for a third time.

""I voted for Trump the first year. I voted for him the second year. I don't -- this time, I don't know,"" he said.

""I'm from Germany, and things that he's said about [the] NATO Alliance -- he wants quit it, and he doesn't know what to do,"" he said of what's making him unsure of Trump. ""A real danger lives overseas.""

Schiekiera was also concerned about what Trump has said with relation to conflicts around the world, particularly involving Ukraine and Iran. ""He can stop the war?"" he asked, in reference to Trump's own claims about the war between Ukraine and Russia. ""He cannot stop the war.""

However, he added that ""Biden or Kamala Harris -- she doesn't know what's going to happen,"" either. According to him, he isn't confident that either of the top candidates can effectively lead on the world stage in the current geopolitical climate.

There are other issues that Schiekiera is taking into consideration as well, such as abortion. ""I got my own ideas,"" he said.

He noted that Trump has appeared to change positions on ""issues nationally [and] worldwide.""

""Trump's gone one way, and then he [goes] to another way. He's undecided what he's going to do, really.""

DEMOCRATS WORRY ABOUT HARRIS' CAUTIOUS MEDIA APPROACH IN TIGHT 2024 RACE: 'VOTERS DESERVE BETTER'

In contrast, Keon Pierce of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, isn't considering Trump at all. But he is not sold on Vice President Kamala Harris either.

""I'm leaning Kamala, but I have to see. She's got to convince me a little more,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""I'm waiting to see who has the best -- the best protection for different groups of people. You know, the best rights and best laws that can help all groups of people.""

Pierce explained that he wanted to be sure the president would ""help all people. Asian people, Indian people, Black people, everybody.""

When Fox News Digital noted that Harris is both Black and Indian, he responded, ""We had a Black president before, and it didn't necessarily translate to helping the people,"" in reference to former President Barack Obama.

TRUMP CAN WIN ON THESE THREE KEY ISSUES, MICHIGAN VOTERS TELL FOX

He said he was ""open to"" Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who will appear on the Wisconsin ballot after a court challenge to see her ousted was denied.

""It's possible that I wouldn't vote as well,"" he added.

As for the Milwaukee area, Pierce explained, ""It's bad here. It's really segregated here, and opportunities are limited.""

He said he needs to hear more about what will be done to bring more ""opportunities, jobs, education, [and] a better school system in the inner city.""

In the latest Marquette Law School poll, Harris beat Trump among Wisconsin registered voters, 49% to 44%, with third-party options included.

For the poll, 882 registered voters were interviewed between Sept. 18 and 26. It had a margin of error of +/-4.4 percentage points."

In the last few years, more than a dozen states have enacted laws that ban almost all abortions. Some include exceptions for rape, incest, and to protect the life of the mother. But a small, vocal group of anti-abortion activists say even these exceptions are morally wrong. They want to see a ban not only on all abortions but also on some fertility treatments, including IVF. They believe an embryo deserves the same rights as any human.

On this episode of The Sunday Story from Up First, NPR's Sarah McCammon takes us to a protest outside an IVF clinic and talks to activists who call themselves ""abortion abolitionists."" These activists say their goal is to turn their beliefs into policy and are heartened by the progress they've made."

Vice President Kamala Harris recently recorded an interview with the raunchy and often-sexually explicit ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, though she continues to play coy with traditional media outlets.

The Harris campaign confirmed that Harris sat down for the interview this past Tuesday where she focused on talking to audiences about abortion and reproductive rights issues. The interview is set to air sometime next week.

Harris' ""Call Her Daddy"" interview comes as she has been criticized for not doing enough traditional news interviews since the start of her presidential campaign in late July.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS IN 'DANGER ZONE' AS AMERICANS WORRY ABOUT COUNTRY'S DIRECTION, SAYS CNN DATA GURU

So far, Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., have done a combined 24 interviews, a number which pales in comparison to the Trump-Vance ticket's combined 63 interviews in that same time frame.

Harris still has not held a formal press conference since replacing President Biden as the Democratic nominee, while Trump has held five since the beginning of September.

The ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, put on by SiriusXM, is hosted by Alex Cooper and reaches a massive, predominantly female audience. According to Spotify, it is ""the most-listened to podcast by women.""

The podcast is well-known for hosting explicit discussions about sex and women's health advice. Axios reported that the vice president's appearance on the podcast ""highlights her campaign's emphasis on appealing to women voters and younger audiences."" According to CNN, the podcast generally has ""a reputation for raunchy sex and relationship conversations.""

Former President Trump and his running mate JD Vance have done multiple interviews on major podcasts shows in recent months, trying to bring their messaging to younger audiences.

Trump recently sat down with podcaster and influencer Theo Von on his podcast and did a livestream with popular influencer Adin Ross that was conducted at the former president's Mar-a-Lago residence. Vance did an interview on the Full Send Podcast in August.

That Harris would opt for a sit-down with the sex-positive show generated some chatter on social media.

Pro-Trump influencer Collin Rugg shared a clip from the show in which Cooper interviewed a porn star. He commented, ""The episode was filmed on Tuesday, in the middle of Hurricane Helene recovery efforts. The conversation reportedly focuses on reproductive rights, abortion & other women issues. Here is a previous in depth conversation Cooper had with a p*rn star.""

What Does Abortion Look Like In Your State? An Alphabetical Guide,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/evaepker/2024/10/05/what-does-abortion-look-like-in-your-state-an-alphabetical-guide/,2024-10-05T13:36:04Z,"In exactly one month, voters across the United States will cast their ballots - and for residents of 10 of those states, those ballots will include questions about the future of abortion. For nearly 50 years, the U.S Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade established that a person's individual right to an abortion was protected by the U.S Constitution. The U.S Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization in 2022, however, overturned that prior ruling, leaving states with the power to regulate abortion.

Since then, 20 states have banned or restricted abortions, seven states have already voted on abortion rights, and multiple states have abortion-related laws and guidelines that simply aren't clear. For example, four states (Arkansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and South Dakota) allow abortions only to save a pregnant person's life but not to improve her health. Healthcare professionals then have to decide - sometimes in the middle of a medical emergency - whether an abortion would qualify as life-saving or, in other words, legal or not. They are then liable if they have found to have broken the law and could face punishments such as fines, jail sentences, loss of license, or a combination of the three.

This state-by-stage guide aims to clear up some unknowns about abortion, such as where it is legal, what exceptions might exist, what lawsuits or laws are pending, and what voters - and the rest of the U.S population - should know in advance of Election Day.

Alabama: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life or health: both physical and mental. Alabama is actually the only state that explicitly includes mental health concerns as an exception to its abortion ban but requires that a psychiatrist both to diagnose the pregnant individual with a ""serious mental illness"" and to document that her mental health condition could cause her to engage in behavior that might threaten her life or that of the fetus.

There are no exceptions to the abortion ban for fatal fetal anomalies or in cases of rape and/or incest.

Alaska: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Arizona: Abortion is legal up to 15 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person counseling from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission before the abortion.

In September 2024, Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs signed the legislature's repeal of an 1864 near-total abortion ban.

Arizona residents will be also be voting on Arizona Proposition 139, the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" will amend the state Constitution to provide the fundamental right to abortion before the point of fetal viability (which is usually between 22 and 26 weeks and marks the point where the fetus has a high chance of surviving outside the uterus without any significant medical intervention) unless ""justified by a compelling state interest"" (such as improving or maintaining the health of the individual seeking an abortion). Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment.

Arkansas: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exception to this ban is to save a pregnant person's life. There are no exceptions for risks to the pregnant person's physical health, for fatal fetal anomalies, or for rape and/or incest.

Arkansans for Limited Government tried to get an abortion rights amendment on the ballot in 2024. If passed, the amendment would've legalized abortion up to 18 weeks and protected abortion access after that time period in the cases of risks to the pregnant person's life or health, for fatal fetal anomalies, and for rape and/or incest. In August 2024, the Arkansas Supreme Court ruled that Arkansans for Limited Government had failed to file the paid canvasser training certification and had failed to comply with state law so the amendment wouldn't appear on the 2024 ballot.

California: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

In 2022, California residents passed California Proposition 1, the Right to Reproductive Freedom Amendment, which supported amending the state Constitution to prohibit the state from interfering with or denying an individual's reproductive freedom, including the right to an abortion. The Proposition passed with 67% support.

Colorado: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian or adult relative (if the minor lives with that relative and not with one or both parents) must be informed at least 48 hours before the abortion.

Next month, residents will vote on Colorado Amendment 89, the Right to Abortion and Health Insurance Coverage Initiative. Voting ""yes"" would both enshrine a right to abortion in the Colorado Constitution and allow the use of public funds for abortion. Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment and would uphold a current constitutional provision that bans the use of public funds for abortion.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, there is no parental/guardian involvement required.

Delaware: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors under 16, a parent/guardian, grandparent, or mental health professional must be notified.

Florida: Abortion is legal up to six weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person counseling from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian must be notified at least 48 hours before and must give permission.

Next month, residents will vote on Florida Amendment 4, the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" would both enshrine a right to abortion in the state Constitution up to fetal viability (or when necessary to protect a pregnant person's health, as determined by their healthcare provider) while maintaining the current law that requires that a parent/guardian be notified if a minor is seeking an abortion. Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive information from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. (They do not have to receive that information in person; it can be mailed to them or read over the phone to them.) For minors, a parent/guardian must be notified.

In September 2024, Georgia Judge Robert C.I. McBurney struck down the prior state law, which prohibited most abortions after six weeks. Georgia's Republican attorney general has already appealed this ruling, though, and the Georgia Supreme Court will likely make the final decision.

Hawaii: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Idaho: Abortion is illegal as of August 25, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life and physical health or for rape and/or incest.

The Idaho Supreme Court ruled in 2023 that there is no constitutional right to an abortion in the state. Since then, two consolidated court cases (Idaho v. United States and Moyle v. United States have argued that healthcare professionals should be able to perform emergency abortions to preserve a pregnant person's physical health - not just save her life. The Supreme Court received this case but dismissed it in June 2024, sending it back to the federal appeals courts for further litigation. Until a decision is made, the exceptions to the abortion ban do currently include preserving the pregnant person's physical health.

In cases of rape and/or incest, an abortion can be legally performed up to 14 weeks but requires a police report or report from child protection services.

There are no exceptions to the ban for fatal fetal anomalies.

Illinois: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Indiana: Abortion is illegal as of September 15, 2022.

In 2023, the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that the state Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion with three exceptions. Abortions can be performed at any time to preserve the life and health of the pregnant person; up to 20 weeks for fatal fetal abnormalities; and up to 12 weeks gestational age for rape and/or incest .

Four residents and the group Hoosier Jews for Choice have argued that abortion is an exercise of religion; banning abortion thus violates Indiana's 2015 religious freedom law. The Indiana Supreme Court is expected to hear the case soon.

Iowa: Abortion is legal up to six weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian or grandparent must be notified at least 48 hours before.

Kansas: Abortion is legal up to 22 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, both parents/guardians (or a singular parent/guardian if that individual has sole custody) must give permission.

Kansas was the first state to vote on abortion rights following Dobbs. In November 2022, its residents rejected the Value Them Both Constitutional Amendment, which would have ruled that there was no right to abortion in the state Constitution, subsequently enacting a near-total ban on abortion. 53% of voters rejected that proposed amendment.

Kentucky: Abortion is illegal as of June 15, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life or physical health (with affirmative defense). There are no exceptions for fatal fetal anomalies or for rape and/or incest.

In November 2022, Kentucky residents rejected Kentucky Constitutional Amendment 2, the No Right to Abortion in Constitution Amendment, which would have amended the state Constitution to say explicitly that it doesn't protect the right to abortion. 52% of voters rejected that proposed amendment.

In February 2023, the Kentucky Supreme Court rejected a request to block the state's abortion ban, ruling that abortion providers lacked the standing to challenge the state's abortion ban. The Kentucky Supreme Court, though, didn't elaborate whether or not the state Constitution secured abortion rights, and abortion remains banned in the state as a result.

In late February 2024, Republican Rep. Ken Fleming of Louisville introduced House Bill 711 that would make abortions legal up to six weeks in cases of rape and/or incest, of fatal fetal anomalies, or of fetuses who died in the womb. No action has been taken on the bill since then.

Louisiana: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life or physical health or in limited cases of fatal fetal anomalies. There are no exceptions for rape and/or incest.

Maine: Abortion is legal until fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Maryland: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must be notified unless the minor doesn't live with a parent/guardian or reasonable efforts to give notice to a parent/guardian are unsuccessful.

Next month, residents will vote on Maryland Question 1, the Right to Reproductive Freedom Amendment. Voting ""yes"" would support amending the state Constitution to establish a right to ""reproductive freedom"". Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment.

Massachusetts: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors under 16, a parent/guardian must give permission.

Michigan: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission.

In 2022, Michigan residents passed Michigan Proposal 3, the Right to Reproductive Freedom Initiative, which supported providing a constitutional right to reproductive freedom, including the right to an abortion. The Initiative passed with 57% support.

Minnesota: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Mississippi: Abortion is illegal as of July 7, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life, for a limited number of fatal fetal anomalies, and for rape and/or incest. For the latter, an abortion can be legally performed up to six weeks gestational age but requires documentation from law enforcement. There are no exceptions for risks to the pregnant person's physical health.

Missouri: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life or physical health (with affirmative defense). There are no exceptions for fatal fetal anomalies or for rape and/or incest.

Next month, residents will vote on Missouri Amendment 3, the Right to Reproductive Freedom Initiative. Voting ""yes"" supports amending the Missouri Constitution to provide the right to ""reproductive freedom"" and allowing the state legislature to enact laws that regulate abortion only after fetal viability. Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment and would oppose allowing the state legislature to enact laws that regulate abortion only after fetal viability.

Montana: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required. In August 2024, Montana's Supreme Court ruled that the law requiring parental/guardian permission for a minor seeking an abortion was unconstitutional.

In 2022, Montana residents rejected Legislative Referendum No. 131 which would've required medical care for ""infants born alive"", such as those born prematurely or those who were born due to a botched abortion. 53% of voters rejected that proposed referendum.

Next month, residents will vote on Montana CI-128, the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" supports amending the Montana Constitution to provide the right to ""make and carry out decisions about one's own pregnancy, including the right to abortion"" and allowing the state to regulate abortion only after fetal viability. Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment and would oppose allowing the state legislature to enact laws that regulate abortion only after fetal viability.

Nebraska: Abortion is legal up to 12 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive information from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. (They don't have to receive that information in person; it can be mailed to them or read over the phone to them.) For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission.

Next month, residents will vote on both Nebraska Initiative 434, Prohibit Abortions After the First Trimester Amendment and Nebraska Initiative 439, Right to Abortion Initiative.

Voting ""yes"" on Initiative 434 would support amending the state Constitution to ban abortions after the first trimester except to preserve the pregnant person's life or physical health or for rape and/or incest. Voting ""no"" would oppose banning abortions after the first trimester.

Voting ""yes"" on Initiative 439 would support amending the state Constitution to provide a right to abortion until fetal viability. Voting ""no"" on Initiative 439 would oppose adding this Amendment.

Nevada: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Next month, residents will vote on Nevada Question 6, the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" supports amending the state Constitution to protect the right to an abortion and to allow the state to regulate abortion only after fetal viability. Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment and would oppose allowing the state to regulate abortion only after fetal viability.

New Hampshire: Abortion is legal up to 24 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before 24 weeks have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must be notified.

New Jersey: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Next month, residents will vote on New York Proposal 1, Equal Protection of Law Amendment. Voting ""yes"" would support adding language to the New York Bill of Rights that would give prevent discriminating against all persons, including due to ""pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy"". Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this language.

North Carolina: Abortion is legal up to12 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 72-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person counseling from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian or grandparent (if the minor has lived with them for at least six months) must give permission.

North Dakota: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive information from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission.

In September 2024, North Dakota Judge Bruce Romanick declared North Dakota's total abortion ban ""unconstitutional"". Republican Attorney General Drew H. Wrigley said that he planned to appeal that decision, though, while the Republican-controlled legislature may try to enact another ban when it reconvenes in January 2025.

Ohio: Abortion is legal up to 22 weeks

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission.

In November 2023, Ohio residents passed Ohio Issue 1, Right to Make Reproductive Decisions Including Abortion Initiative, which supported amending the Ohio Constitution to guarantee the right to abortion until fetal viability as well as the right to other reproductive health decisions. The Initiative passed with 57% support.

Oklahoma: Abortion is illegal as of May 25, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to save the pregnant person's life. There are no exceptions for risks to the pregnant person's physical health, for fatal fetal anomalies, or for rape and/or incest.

Oregon: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors under 15, a parent/guardian must give permission. (A parent/guardian must give permission for any medical treatment in Oregon for those under 15.)

Pennsylvania: Abortion is legal up to 24 weeks

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive information from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. If the person seeking an abortion is 18 or older, that information can be read over the phone to them; if the person seeking an abortion is 17 or younger, they have to receive that counseling in person with a parent/guardian. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission.

Rhode Island: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission.

South Carolina: Abortion is legal up to six weeks (or up to 12 weeks for rape and/or incest as long as the physician reported the rape or incest within 24 hours of performing the abortion).

Those seeking an abortion before six weeks have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive information from their abortion provider and when they can receive the abortion. (They don't have to receive that information in person.) For minors under 17, a parent/guardian or grandparent must give permission.

South Dakota: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve a pregnant person's life. There are no exceptions for risks to the pregnant person's physical health, for fatal fetal anomalies, or for rape and/or incest.

Next month, residents will vote on South Dakota Constitutional Amendment G or the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" would support providing a state constitutional right to abortion in South Dakota using a trimester framework. During the first trimester, the state would be prohibited for regulating abortion; during the second trimester, the state may regulate abortion but ""only in ways that are reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman""; during the third trimester, the state may regulate or prohibit abortion, except ""when abortion is necessary, in the medical judgment of the woman's physician, to preserve the life and health of the pregnant woman"". Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment.

Tennessee: Abortion is illegal as of August 25, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve a pregnant person's life or physical health (with affirmative defense). There are no exceptions for fatal fetal anomalies or for rape and/or incest.

Texas: Abortion is illegal as of July 1, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve a pregnant person's life (with affirmative defense). There are no exceptions for risks to the pregnant person's physical health, for fatal fetal anomalies, or for rape and/or incest.

A group of Texas women who had serious pregnancy complications were the first in the country to testify in court about being denied abortions after Dobbs. And yet, the court has advised Texan physicians only that they should ""meticulously document"" their decision-making around abortions without any clarification about what actions - regardless of documentation - might put them at risk for prosecution.

Utah: Abortion is legal up to 18 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 72-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person counseling from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian must be notified at least 24 hours before the abortion and give permission.

A state law that completely banned abortion in Utah went into effect on June 24, 2022 but was challenged in court by Planned Parenthood Association of Utah. On August 1, 2024, the Utah Supreme Court prevented this total ban from taking effect while the lawsuit continued.

Vermont: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

In November 2022, residents of Vermont passed Vermont Proposal 5, the Right to Personal Reproductive Autonomy Amendment, which supported amending the Vermont Constitution to protect the right to personal reproductive autonomy - such as the decision to receive an abortion - and to prohibit government infringement in these matters unless ""justified by a compelling state interest"". The Amendment passed with 77% support.

Virginia: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion then have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian (or adult family member or parent-like individual with whom the minor regularly lives) must be notified at least 24 hours before the abortion.

Washington: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Washington D.C: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

West Virginia: Abortion is illegal as of September 16, 2022.

The exceptions are to preserve the pregnant person's life or physical health, for fetal anomalies, and for rape and/or incest. For the latter, abortions can be performed up to eight weeks (or up to 14 weeks for minors) as long as the assault has been reported to law enforcement.

Wisconsin: Abortion is legal up to 22 weeks

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person counseling from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian, grandparent, or a sibling or aunt or uncle who is at least 25 years old must give permission.

Abortion opponents have claimed that a law from 1849 bans abortion in all cases except when the pregnant person's life is in danger. Lower level courts have argued that the law in question applies only to infanticide and not consensual abortions. The Wisconsin Supreme Court will hear that case.

Wyoming: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must be informed at least 24 hours before the abortion.

The Wyoming Supreme Court received this case but dismissed it in April 2024, sending it back to the lower courts. Until a decision is made, abortion remains legal in the state up to fetal viability.

What is the status of abortion in your state? Do you Want to change it? If you're a resident of one of the 10 states voting on abortion-related measures next month and you're not yet a registered voter, you can register here.

Opinion | An awful lie about Haitian migrants led to this threat against citizens far away,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/ohio-sheriff-kamala-harris-yard-signs-rcna172572,2024-10-05T11:59:10Z,"There appears to be a campaign among some conservatives to bully everybody else into political inactivity or silence.

The hateful lie pushed by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating their neighbors' pets not only endangered those migrants, it also led to an Ohio sheriff three hours away threatening citizens who show support for the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.

In a Sept. 13 Facebook post that he later claimed ""may have been a little misinterpreted,"" Portage County Sheriff Bruce Zuchowski suggested tracking ""all the addresses of the people who had [Harris] signs in their yards"" so that ""when the Illegal human 'Locust' (which she supports!) Need places to live...We'll already have the addresses of their New families...who supported their arrival!""

There's no misinterpreting the racism in that post, described to me by the county's NAACP president as ""vile and egregious."" There's no excusing the lie from the sheriff that Springfield's Haitians -- who are there as part of a federal humanitarian program for migrants -- are here illegally. On top of that, referring to human beings as pests (ravenous pests, at that) has preceded too many global atrocities for Zuchowski's hateful statements to be excused.

And that's before we get to heart of the matter, which is that Zuchowski veered into unconstitutional territory with the suggestion that residents lawfully expressing a political opinion warrant law enforcement's attention. Zuchowski's defense -- that he has a ""First Amendment right"" to post what he did -- is doubly offensive. His status as a public servant ought to come before his desire to express his opinion, and his post made his constituents afraid their government would be monitoring their constitutionally protected expression of speech.

Zuchowski, who has declined to speak to NBC News and multiple media outlets, took down his post after the Portage County NAACP and the League of Women Voters complained to the Ohio secretary of state, and as the Ohio ACLU was gearing up to sue him. But if Zuchowski succeeded in making people afraid that he and his deputies are watching their political activity, it seems unlikely that his deleting the post is enough to make them breathe easy.

On its face, the story out of Portage County, where I happen to have multiple loved ones who vote, is evidence that a malignant lie about an innocent immigrant population metastasized into a threat against innocent citizens hours away. But it's also part of what appears to be a larger campaign from conservatives to bully everybody else into political inactivity or silence.

In Florida, voters who signed a petition that put that state's abortion referendum on the ballot cried foul at being questioned by Gov. Ron DeSantis' election police unit. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton executed search warrants against members of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), one of America's oldest Latino civil rights groups, about two weeks after LULAC endorsed Harris' presidential campaign. He says he was investigating ""allegations of election fraud and vote harvesting"" in 2022. The Republican National Committee's so-called ""Protect the Vote"" project aims to recruit people from the suburbs to monitor the polls in urban Democratic strongholds, which it has falsely declared are hotbeds of voting fraud.

""I've never felt less protected and more scared than I do right now,"" a resident of Ravenna, Ohio, wrote Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, according to the Akron Beacon Journal. At least 59 residents complained to Yost's office, the paper reported. Zuchowski ""has made me feel unsafe in my home of 24 years,"" a Kent resident said.

Portage County NAACP President Renee Romine said at the emergency meeting her organization held about Zuchowski's post that there were ""people almost in tears"" and ""not wanting to go to the voting polls"" because Zuchowki's office provides security for in-person absentee voting. ""People did not even want to go and vote if they were going to be there.""

The county's board of elections voted to remove the sheriff's office from that security role, which Romine described as a ""big win for the people."" But to Freda Levenson, the legal director of the ACLU of Ohio, the win was Zuchowski removing the offending post.

""We were going to ask a federal judge to make him take down his post. So as soon as he took down his post, we no longer had anything to ask for,"" she said. ""He backed down, which is what we wanted. Not just what we wanted, it's what the Constitution required him to do.""

But what the ACLU counts as a win may be cold comfort to Portage County voters. He made a post about monitoring who's supporting Harris. There's no reason they should believe that his being forced to take the post down has been accompanied by any change of heart."
Why the slow collapse of Harris-Walz won't stop before Election Day,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/why-slow-collapse-harris-walz-wont-stop-before-election-day,2024-10-05T11:27:12Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Ohio Sen. JD Vance, as anticipated, easily won the vice-presidential debate Tuesday, October 1, on demeanor, facts, and analysis. But in fairness to a sometimes herky-jerky and nervous Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, he had the harder task of defending the temporary pseudo-conservative make-over of Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.

His additional burdens were her co-culpability for the last three-and-a-half-years of the Biden disaster, and her unwillingness to implement her supposedly ""change"" agenda in the last months of her vice-presidential tenure.

The CBS News moderators, Nora O'Donnell, and, especially, Margaret Brennan, also as expected, ganged up on Vance. They had learned nothing, and forgotten nothing from the last disastrous, and biased debate moderators.

EMHOFF DENIES REPORT HE SLAPPED EX-GIRLFRIEND OUTSIDE RITZY OVERSEAS MOVIE EVENT

The two moderators shamelessly broke their own rules by fact-checking (wrongly and solely) Vance. They ignored questions of the administration's tardy responses to Hurricane Helene, the Ukraine war, the recent Trump assassination attempts, or crime, while only briefly touching on Iran and a Middle East on the brink of total war. Instead, they concentrated, as also expected, on climate change, abortion, healthcare and childcare.

All were issues they thought might more easily embarrass Vance. And, of course, as also expected, the two ended the debate pressing Vance on January 6. And yet Vance again parried easily and won decisively. In doing so, he dispelled the smear that he was somehow ""mean,"" when, in fact, he proved calm and magnanimous as he methodically dissected Walz.

The nation perhaps learned that a confident Trump selected him to articulate his MAGA positions, and perhaps in a manner superior to Trump's own.

In contrast, an insecure Harris picked Walz. The vice president was assuming that he would not upstage her and perhaps, by his limitations, would make her look competent in comparison.

The debate will give some momentum to Trump-Vance in the last month of the campaign.

It follows the lethargic Biden-Harris reaction to Hurricane Helene, whose toll in human life and property had been initially and vastly ignored by the media.

It follows the growing specter of a theater-wide Middle East war, as a solitary Israel faces off against Iran and its appendages (all empowered after 2020 by Biden-Harris).

It follows the chaos of a longshoremen's strike intended to shut down the entire country. And it follows Harris's continued inability to survive even serial soft-ball interviews without her memorized and banal answers.

As a result, the slow, steady hemorrhaging of support for Harris-Walz will likely still continue in the last month of the election."
"Texas residents express frustration with the economy, trust Trump more than Harris",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/texas-residents-express-frustration-economy-trust-trump-more-than-harris,2024-10-05T09:05:44Z,"Residents in Houston, Texas revealed their preferred candidate to boost the economy in conversations with Fox News Digital.

Fox News Digital spoke with residents just south of Houston, Texas this week about the economy and who they trust more between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to boost the economy as president.

After shopping at Costco, local residents expressed frustration with current overall costs and the economy as a whole, both on and off camera.

""All the prices have gone up,"" Melissa told Fox News Digital.

""No, it's not doing well at all,"" said another resident, originally from Egypt.

Ralph said the economy has resulted in increased costs for his family, stating, ""I think inflation is out of control. Housing and interest rates are out of control. Grocery trips have doubled. And a good grocery trip used to be like 150-125. Now an average grocery trip is now 250-300.""

VOTERS IN CRITICAL MICHIGAN COUNTY FOCUSED ON ECONOMY, CANDIDATE CHARACTER AS 2024 RACE TIGHTENS

Locals also shared who they feel will best handle the economy as president.

""When Trump was in office, you know, things were doing well,"" said Mark.

Ralph said he ""definitely"" trusts Trump more to tackle the economy.

""I don't think Kamala even knows what's going on. I think she's a puppet,"" he said. ""He's got a proven track record, hoping he gets back in and rescuing this Harris economy.""

Another resident also said she trusts the former president more: ""Trump, because he's the only businessman that's capable of running our country.""

Mark cited Trump's time in office compared to the current Biden-Harris administration as a reason for trusting the former president.

""Trump because of what he did the last time, who was in office and what the current administration, what's happened with the current administration over the past four years,"" he said. ""If it's not broke, don't fix it. You know, they tried to fix it. So here we are today.""

No Republican presidential candidate has lost Texas since 1976, but the state has become increasingly competitive in recent elections. Trump won it by less than six points in 2020, a sharp contrast from just 12 years ago when Mitt Romney carried the state by nearly 16.

The economy remains the top issue on the minds of American voters as they prepare to cast their ballot in the presidential election.

A September Fox News national poll also in the field entirely post-debate spotlighted that 39% of voters surveyed said the economy was their most pressing issue, far ahead of immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues tested were in single digits.

While the nation's economic recovery from the pandemic continues, inflation remains a leading concern among Americans.

The former president's up 13 points over the vice president in a post-debate survey from the New York Times and Siena College, and favored by 7 points in an ABC News Ipsos survey also conducted after the showdown.

But Trump's advantage over Harris on the economy stands at only 5 points in the Fox News poll, and just 2 points in the AP/NORC survey.

Harris has touted what she calls the ""opportunity economy"" and said her administration will crack down on price gouging and also lower taxes for middle-class Americans. Trump has pointed to economic performance under his administration as successful and that a return to office would bring back those days.

The Harris ticket was buoyed on Friday by a strong September jobs report. Also, striking U.S. dockworkers returned to work Friday after reaching a tentative agreement with employers on an improved wage offer."
"Three states show how abortion, schools and taxes are at stake in legislature races",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/05/nx-s1-5124638/state-legislature-supermajority-kansas-arizona-minnesota-elections,2024-10-05T09:04:20Z,"Elections for state legislatures don't get the attention that races for president or Congress do but they often have a big impact on our lives. Congress is divided and gridlocked. In contrast, nearly all state legislatures have both chambers run by one party or another. That makes it easy to pass laws.

And they've been passing a lot. More than 20 states have imposed new limits on abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court eliminated the federal right to abortion in 2022. In education, state lawmakers create voucher programs and determine public school funding. Gun laws, taxes, criminal sentences, access to Medicaid and food stamps are just a few other issues decided by state legislatures.

Redistricting and polarization have increased the political tilt of many legislatures -- even where the state might be more balanced overall.

This year, several legislatures could see power shift if just a few seats flip in the election -- maybe just a matter of hundreds of votes in some districts. Here are three states, Kansas, Minnesota and Arizona, that illustrate the stakes around the country.

TOPEKA, Kansas -- Kansas is one of several states where the Legislature sometimes tilts more conservative than the state's voters overall. While it votes Republican for president, it has elected a Democrat for governor twice in a row and voted with 59% to protect abortion rights.

But Republicans hold 29 of the 40 seats in the Senate and 85 of the 125 seats in the House. That gives them the two-thirds ""supermajority"" to pass bills and override vetoes by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.

They've overridden Kelly's vetoes 15 times in the last two years. They used the override to pass a bill requiring doctors to question patients seeking abortions about their reasons. They overrode vetoes to pass laws banning transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports and to limit access to food stamps.

Democrats say they can break the supermajority in this year's elections -- they'd only need to flip two or three seats in either chamber. It would give Kelly a stronger veto in her last two years in office -- and Democrats more leverage over what the majority passes.

""My hope is that with the governor being able to veto and being able to sustain those vetoes, it puts us more at the table for compromise,"" says Democrat Dinah Sykes, the Senate minority leader.

National Democratic party organizations say that goal is within reach. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee is highlighting 10 legislative races in Kansas and helping with campaign logistics.

Kansas Republicans, meanwhile, have scorned that contribution as outside interference. And they defend the supermajority.

Republican House Majority Leader Chris Croft says it's a necessary counterbalance to the governor's veto pen.

""[The] supermajority in this case, while it sounds like it's this huge number, in fact, what it does is just gives us a seat at the table,"" Croft told NPR.

Even with their heavy majority, Republican's priorities aren't always veto-proof. Last session, Kelly successfully vetoed three major tax-cut proposals, including one that fell a single vote shy of an override. The fight forced the Legislature into a special session.

""You can't get everything you want in this business. This business has a little bit of give and take and that's the beauty of the process,"" Croft says. ""It's also the frustrating part.""

Supermajorities, like the one held by Kansas Republicans, have become common. Across the country as of their recent legislative sessions, one party or another held a veto-proof majority in 29 states. Republicans had 20 of those, Democrats nine.

Patrick Miller, a political scientist at Kent State University, says supermajorities have spread in part because of polarization and legislators gerrymandering their own districts.

""One of those consequences of supermajority, is a lot more ideological politics and policy,"" he says.

While the U.S. Congress is often locked in stalemate, Miller says state legislatures that are dominated by one party are able to step into the vacuum to pass laws shaping day-to-day life.

""If you care about education, if you care about health care regulation in your state, if you care about abortion, transgender rights, LGBT rights, if you care about whether your roads have potholes ... you need to be looking at your state legislature,"" he says.

TONKA BAY, Minn. -- On a sunny Tuesday morning, Republican state Senate candidate Kathleen Fowke walks door-to-door near Lake Minnetonka just west of Minneapolis. The tree-lined roads by the water are quiet but when she knocks on a door she's reminded that this is hotly contested territory.

""You're in my YouTube all the time,"" says the man inside -- a reminder of the ads targeting voters here.

The contest to win this legislative district could be the state's most expensive ever -- and key to winning the Senate.

For two years, Democrats have controlled the Legislature and the governor's office under Gov. Tim Walz -- now the Democratic nominee for vice president. They've passed more spending for affordable housing and public schools, and guaranteed protections for patients who seek or provide abortion or gender-affirming care.

Now Republicans see a chance to curb the progressive trend. They're just a few seats behind in the state House. The Senate is tied 33-33 and this vacant seat by the lake could be the tiebreaker that ends the Democrats' so-called ""trifecta"" of House, Senate and governorship.

The GOP wants to slow state spending and focus on the economy overall. Fowke, a real estate agent, says that, while voters don't always know about the work the Legislature does, what she does hear about from them is money.

""It's basically affordability, and they can't afford, you know, just to go to the grocery store anymore,"" Fowke says. ""Taxes are high. Inflation is high. They need to find a way to help lower the costs of everything all around them.""

Republicans promise to cut taxes, tighten up on spending and curb fraud and abuse in state programs. ""With one-party, Democrat control, it was easy just to push through partisan policy and partisan priorities,"" House Minority Leader Lisa Demuth says.

Democrats say they address people's cost of living with laws requiring companies to offer paid time off for illness, family leave and safe time and new money for free school lunches.

""They trust the Democrats are going to do more for their economic well being, whereas what they hear from Republicans is, 'Oh, we have to give more tax cuts to corporations,'"" says Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman. The national Democratic Party is helping fund the state party's effort.

Their candidate facing Fowke is civil engineer Ann Johnson Stewart. She's knocking on doors, too, telling people she stands for maintaining legal protections for abortion in the state. ""One of the reasons I'm running is to make sure we can continue on that track,"" she says.

She hopes Democrats will work now on carbon-free energy sources, local infrastructure, expanding mental health care and reducing gun violence.

Andrew Karch, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota, says candidates face an uphill battle getting voters to pay attention to state issues.

""There's a real tendency for these races to sort of fly beneath the radar,"" Karch says. And many voters don't focus on state issues.

""I think politics in Minnesota specifically may have been more distinctive a generation ago than they are today,"" he says. ""State and local politicians are increasingly being asked to comment on issues that we might think of as national.""

Fowke and Johnson Stewart say they hope to keep the conversations focused on what's going on in their district. But they know that's a big ask in a presidential election year.

-- Dana Ferguson, MPR

PHOENIX -- In Arizona, the party that wins the Legislature could determine where tens of thousands of children go to school or how well their schools are funded. At issue is the state's sweeping vouchers program that gives families tax dollars for use in private schools or for homeschooling.

For Chelsea Ellison, a homeschool parent, the program has helped turn things around for a daughter who struggled in public elementary school.

""It took us a little bit of last year to get her where she should have been, in general, and now she's thriving,"" Ellison says. ""She loves school.""

But parents and teachers sticking with public schools say they've paid the price.

""I notice that the amount of resources available to the teachers, directly, it just is not there, any kind of funding for improvements at the school is not there,"" says Miriam Hoban, whose child attends a public school in Scottsdale. She says teachers or parents are forced to pay out of pocket for basic necessities like pencils and markers.

Arizona's program, called Empowerment Scholarship Accounts, is a national model for what advocates call school choice. In 2022, the Republican Legislature and then-Gov. Doug Ducey took a small program offering vouchers for kids with disabilities or in underperforming schools and made it available for any child.

Enrollment in the program leaped from 12,000 students to 78,000 students and growing. Students got a median of $7,409 per year. That added up to a total of about $718 million from the state budget, which was $93 million more than projected, according to the Arizona Department of Education.

Republicans control the Legislature with just a two-seat advantage in both the House and Senate. The narrow margin was in the national spotlight this year as lawmakers just barely repealed an 1864 law that banned abortion.

If Democrats win control, they pledge to scale back the voucher program and they can rely on backing from Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, elected after the program was expanded. ""The previous Legislature passed a massive expansion of school vouchers that lacks accountability and will likely bankrupt this state,"" she said after taking office last year.

Critics point to stories about voucher money going for private lessons in luxury cars and ski resort passes, supposedly part of a child's education. And they say much of the money goes to families that were able to pay for private schools on their own with kids already out of the public schools.

But as the program has grown and gained support among some swing voters, it could be tougher for Democrats in competitive districts to campaign against it. They'll have to temper their ambitions, says Arizona pollster Paul Bentz.

""I don't expect that they could mount a full-fledged repeal,"" Bentz says. ""I think that would be challenging for some of the swing areas for Democrats. But I certainly think at a minimum, there would be regulation on it, and probably some definite changes to the program.""

Ellison, the voucher mom, says her family did try to make it work in public schools before opting to teach at home with voucher support.

""There was larger class sizes, more budget cuts,"" Ellison says of their old public school. ""We had no STEM teacher, we had no music teacher, we had no art teacher.""

Public school supporters say the vouchers drain the money for just those kinds of needs."
Trump Campaign Thinks Abortion Ballot Measures Might Actually Help Him,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/04/trump-campaign-thinks-abortion-ballot-measures-might-actually-help-him/,2024-10-04T20:11:04Z,"Battleground states' ballot measures on abortion could benefit former President Donald Trump in the election, the Trump campaign's political director told The Washington Post Friday, as polling suggests Republicans are willing to turn out to support abortion rights but still back Trump, despite Democrats trying to use the ballot measures to their advantage.

Polling shows Trump is leading in battleground states even as respondents trust Harris more on handling abortion. A 56% majority of Fox News' Arizona poll respondents said they trusted Harris to do a better job on abortion -- though the respondents still preferred Trump overall -- as did 53% of Arizona respondents in the Times/Siena College poll. Fox News' polling in August found 58% of voters from Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina preferred Harris on abortion, but only 48% overall said they'd support her (compared with 47% who backed Trump).

Politico reports abortion ballot measures may also impact voters in subsequent elections, noting that Democrats are reporting pro-abortion rights voters in Michigan -- where abortion was legalized via ballot measure in 2022 -- aren't as fired up this year because they think their reproductive rights are safe. A KFF poll found in July that 60% of Michigan women believe abortion's legality is now a ""settled"" issue in their state, with Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow telling Politico there's a ""false sense of comfort"" among voters that abortion is no longer under threat. Democratic candidates have had to argue to voters that their rights could still be taken away if Trump wins, Politico reports, as candidates claim Trump would enact national restrictions if elected that would override any state measures.

Democrats have continued to insist they expect their candidates will be buoyed by abortion ballot measures. They hope it will help them in the presidential election and key Senate races, as Democrats face close races in states with abortion ballot measures like Montana, Florida and Arizona. ""Wherever they've been on the ballot, we've had a significant turnout of folks who care deeply about reproductive freedom,"" Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., who leads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told The Post. ""Folks who turn out understand that the Republican candidates tend to be diametrically opposed to that -- and so they vote for the referendum and they vote for the Democratic candidate.""

Harris and Trump are still neck-and-neck in the polls. While polling has largely been in support of abortion ballot measures coming out in favor of reproductive rights -- and no ballot measure since the Supreme Court's ruling has yet come out against abortion rights -- it remains to be seen how the measures in this year's election will fare. Florida's ballot measure will require 60% of the vote in order to pass, meaning it will have to clear a particularly high bar compared with other states that only need a simple majority.

What Trump would actually do on abortion if elected. Though the ex-president has repeatedly said he does not support a national abortion ban, Democrats have been highly skeptical. Anti-abortion advocates have reframed their rhetoric to push for ""national minimum standards"" on abortion rather than ""bans"" -- phrasing restrictions differently to get around the unpopularity of abortion bans -- and the Trump campaign has not yet responded to a request for comment on if he supports a ""national minimum standard."" Anti-abortion groups have continued to push for Trump to enact national restrictions even as the ex-president has said he wants to leave it up to the states, and while the GOP's national platform doesn't call for a national ban, it does call for giving constitutional rights to fetuses, which would ban abortion by default.

The Supreme Court's ruling overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022 has made abortion into a key electoral issue, with Democrats relying on abortion rights as a tool to galvanize the party's base. Abortion ballot measures have been a key part of that strategy, emerging as the primary way for abortion rights advocates to harness public support and protect access even in states with Republican leadership. Republicans have downplayed their anti-abortion views in elections that have taken place since the Supreme Court's decision, with candidates editing their websites and toning down anti-abortion rhetoric so as to not alienate voters who support the procedure remaining legal. Trump said in April he supported abortion being left up to states after previously suggesting he could endorse a 15-week national ban, and has continued to insist he won't restrict abortion and tried to downplay the issue. His running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, has backed a national abortion ban in the past, but has more recently toned down his views, saying he supports Trump's view of leaving the issue to the states and falsely claiming at Tuesday's vice presidential debate that he never supported a national ban. The Harris campaign has continued to insist voters should not take Trump at his word, believing the ex-president would still listen to his anti-abortion base and take steps to ban or restrict the procedure if elected."
"Trump can win on these 3 key issues, Michigan voters tell Fox",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-can-win-three-key-issues-michigan-voters-tell-fox,2024-10-04T17:40:00Z,"Trump supporters in Saginaw, Michigan, told Fox News Digital the top issues Trump should hit as he seeks to win the critical swing state.

Michigan voters attending former President Donald Trump's Saginaw rally Thursday told Fox News Digital that the former president needs to focus on the economy to win the critical swing state, particularly job creation and curbing inflation.

""Opening up the pipelines to get the jobs back,"" one voter who attended Trump's rally on the campus of Saginaw Valley State University said when asked which issue the former president needs to focus on to win Michigan.

The comments come as Trump made yet another visit to the crucial swing state of Michigan, a state that could play a decisive role in determining who wins November's election. It also marked the second time the former president visited mid-Michigan in just a few weeks, a blue collar area of the state where the campaign believes it can make inroads with voters in what promises to be a close race.

TRUMP'S 2ND TERM FOREIGN POLICY LIKELY TO FOCUS ON 'STRENGTH' AND 'DETERRENCE': EXPERT

Vice President Kamala Harris is set to visit the same area of the state Friday, signifying the importance of Michigan as the clock nears the end of a dramatic election season.

Polls show Michigan as a toss up as of Wednesday, with the Real Clear Politics Polling average giving Harris a thin lead of just 0.7 points in the state. However, polls also showed Trump trailing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Biden in Michigan by 5.3 and 5.7 points respectively, numbers that turned out much more favorable to Trump on election day.

Trump narrowly won Michigan in 2016 before dropping it to Biden in another close race in 2020, but voters in mid-Michigan believe Trump's focus on the economy should help put him over the top in 2024.

VOTERS IN CRITICAL MICHIGAN COUNTY FOCUSED ON ECONOMY, CANDIDATE CHARACTER AS 2024 RACE TIGHTENS

""Bring inflation down and safety and security in the state of Michigan,"" one voter told Fox News Digital.

""Illegal border crossings and the economy,"" another voter said. ""Keeping jobs in America, lowering inflation.""

However, other voters signaled that Trump could win on a range of issues, including national security and reducing crime in inner cities.

""Our national security does come first. But if the people at home, if they can't make ends meet, they're living in misery, that's just as important,"" a voter told Fox News Digital. ""Being truthful to the American people, which he has been.""

""Focusing on the inner cities. Putting together ways to decrease the violence,"" another voter said.

Meanwhile, one voter who said she was at the rally to support Trump said that the former president could lead the charge in helping Michigan residents see the issue of abortion differently.

""I think one of the bigger things to look at has been abortion... Michigan has been one of the stronger states in supporting that,"" the voter told Fox News Digital. ""He can do a very good job in getting us to just see the value of life."""
Melania Trump's pro-choice stand isn't that different from other Republican first ladies,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/melania-trumps-pro-choice-stand-isnt-different-from-other-republican-first-ladies,2024-10-04T17:11:57Z,"Former first lady Melania Trump opens up about her life before, during and after the White House in a sit-down interview on 'Fox & Friends.'

Melania Trump is not the only first lady to express pro-choice views. She joins several former Republican first ladies who have shared similar perspectives, often in their memoirs, despite this stance historically contrasting with the GOP platform.

Other spouses of Republican presidents, such as Pat Nixon, Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Laura Bush, have been recorded either during or after their husbands' tenure in office expressing pro-choice views.

""I feel very strongly that it was the best thing in the world when the Supreme Court voted to legalize abortion and, in my words, bring it out of the backwoods and put it in the hospital where it belongs,"" Betty Ford said in a CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" interview in 1975, two years after Roe v. Wade was handed down.

MELANIA TRUMP'S ABORTION VIEWS IN NEW MEMOIR SPUR OUTRAGE FROM PRO-LIFERS: 'SHE IS WRONG'

Following Ford's comments on premarital sex, marijuana and abortion during the CBS interview, then-President Gerald Ford reportedly joked that she had cost him votes.

As a more conservative first lady, Nancy Reagan avoided taking a public stance against abortion that would put her at odds with former President Ronald Reagan. However, she later revealed her personal position on the issue.

""I'm against abortion, I don't believe in abortion,"" Reagan said at George Washington University in 1994, five years after her husband left the Oval Office. ""On the other hand, I believe in a woman's choice. So, it puts me somewhere in the middle, but I don't know what you'd call that.""

Barbara Bush, former President George H. W. Bush's wife, was more reserved in her public statements about abortion and was at odds with her husband's anti-abortion stance. While she was not as outspoken as Betty Ford, she wrote in her 1994 memoir, ""I hate abortions, but I just could not make that choice for someone else.""

Former first lady Laura Bush, wife of former President George W. Bush and daughter-in-law to Barbara Bush, also differed with the former Presidents Bush on abortion.

""I think it's important that it remain legal, because I think it's important for people for medical reasons and other reasons,"" she said in an interview with Larry King Live in 2010.

Pat Nixon, then-President Richard Nixon's wife, told reporters during a 1972 press conference - as Roe v. Wade arguments were being considered by the Supreme Court - that she supported the right to choose an abortion, but opposed ""wholesale abortion on demand.""

Trump, wife of Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump, wrote the memoir entitled ""Melania"" that is scheduled to come out on Oct. 8, per the Amazon release date. In the book, according to a preview by The Guardian, she expresses a viewpoint closely aligned with that of former first ladies before her.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,"" Trump reportedly wrote.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.

""Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

The former first lady drew criticism from pro-life advocates on social media after the excerpts were published just a month away from Election Day. This year, the Republican Party's official platform also softened its language on abortion, as former President Trump also said he would not support a federal abortion ban."
Why the race for control of the U.S. Senate is intensifying,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/race-control-us-senate-intensifying-rcna174013,2024-10-04T17:04:32Z,"Which party will control the U.S. Senate next year? With 11 closely watched contests, the chamber appears to be up for grabs.

As most fair-minded observers would probably agree, the race for the White House remains anybody's guess. No matter who wins the presidential contest, however, he or she is going to look to the U.S. Senate to help govern, and as it turns out, figuring out which party will be in the chamber's majority next year isn't easy, either.

As regular readers know, the Senate Democratic conference currently has a one-seat majority, but with Sen. Joe Manchin retiring in West Virginia, Republicans have, for all intents and purposes, already flipped one seat.

With this in mind, Republicans will need a net gain of just one additional seat to secure a majority, which is hardly unrealistic given the number of tough races in states where there's currently a Democratic incumbent -- including races in states where Donald Trump is all but certain to win easily.

So where do things stand with 32 days remaining? Let's take stock.

There are, by most measures, 11 Senate races that could credibly be described as ""competitive."" Taking them one at a time, in alphabetical order:

Arizona: Incumbent independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema is retiring

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego has led failed Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake in nearly every poll for months, and with an abortion-rights ballot measure likely to boost turnout, Gallego is the clear favorite.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Despite Lake's baggage from her 2022 race, the election denier isn't being blown out, and the fact that the race is competitive is keeping Democratic money flowing into the state, instead of other contests.

Florida: Incumbent Republican Sen. Rick Scott is seeking a second term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: The far-right incumbent is not well liked; he has no accomplishments or record of successes; an abortion-rights ballot measure likely to boost turnout; and polls suggest former Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is keeping this contest far more competitive than most thought possible.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: At the end of the day, Florida is a red state, filled with voters who probably won't care about the senator's awful record; Scott is able to invest heavily thanks to his considerable personal fortune; and Mucarsel-Powell is struggling to keep up financially in a massive state with several expensive media market.

Maryland: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin is retiring

Why Democrats feel good about the race: In one of the nation's reliably blue states, Angela Alsobrooks' polling lead appears to be growing, and it won't hurt that there's an abortion-rights ballot measure on the statewide ballot.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Larry Hogan remains popular in the state, and the former governor is benefiting from massive investments from Republican megadonors.

Michigan: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow is retiring

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Most recent polling shows Elissa Slotkin well positioned to prevail in a state that has elected a Republican senator only once in the past 50 years.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Despite former Rep. Mike Rogers' baggage -- he moved to Florida after retiring from Congress -- he's keeping the race close.

Montana: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester is seeking a fourth term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Tester is a respected and accomplished incumbent, running on a record of success, and it won't hurt that there's an abortion-rights ballot measure on the statewide ballot.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Polls suggest Tester is nevertheless losing to a struggling Republican businessman who's facing controversies surrounding his racist rhetoric, his record of dishonesty about a gunshot wound, and alleged plagiarism in his book.

Nebraska: Incumbent Republican Sen. Deb Fischer is seeking a third term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Independent Dan Osborn has stunned much of the political world by running a strong race -- Republicans have scrambled in recent weeks to start airing ads in a state they expected to ignore -- and polls suggest he's within striking distance of an upset victory. The fact that the ballot will include measures on abortion policy might also help tip the scales.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: At the end of the day Nebraska is a reliably ruby-red state.

Nevada: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen is seeking a second term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Nevada is one of the nation's most closely divided battleground states, but polls suggest Rosen is well positioned to prevail. Nevada is also one of the states with an abortion-rights measure on the statewide ballot.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Republican Sam Brown isn't far behind the incumbent, and there's still a lot of GOP money backing his candidacy.

Ohio: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is seeking a fourth term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Like Tester in Montana, Brown is a respected and accomplished incumbent, running on a record of success. Unlike Tester, recent polling shows Brown hanging on to a small lead.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Bernie Moreno isn't exactly an impressive candidate, and he isn't exactly running a good campaign, but he's still within 3 points of a popular senator, thanks in large part to the fact that Ohio is becoming a reliably red state.

Pennsylvania: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey is seeking a fourth term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Like Tester in Montana and Brown in Ohio, Casey is a respected and accomplished incumbent, running on a record of success. The latest polls also show the senator with modest but steady leads.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: Despite his carpetbagger problem, Dave McCormick is still within striking distance of defeating a longtime incumbent.

Texas: Incumbent Republican Sen. Ted Cruz is seeking a third term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Democratic Rep. Colin Allred is exactly the kind of candidate who can appeal to a broad audience in Texas -- ""Republicans for Allred"" has some established and well-known figures on board -- and many GOP insiders have started to express real anxiety in response to surprisingly close polls.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: For all of Cruz's many troubles, he still has an ""R"" after his name in Texas. With Trump expected to win the state with relative ease, are there really a significant number of voters who will vote for Trump and Allred on the same ballot? GOP insiders believe the answer is no.

Wisconsin: Incumbent Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin is seeking a third term

Why Democrats feel good about the race: Like Tester in Montana, Brown in Ohio, and Casey in Pennsylvania, Baldwin is a respected and accomplished incumbent, running on a record of success. The latest polls also show the senator with modest-but-steady leads.

Why Republicans feel good about the race: In a dynamic similar to the Ohio contest, Eric Hovde isn't exactly an impressive candidate, and he isn't exactly running a good campaign, but he's still within 5 points of a popular senator."
"'Lies throughout': Trump-backed challenger, longtime Dem senator face off in heated battleground debate",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lies-throughout-trump-backed-challenger-longtime-dem-senator-face-off-heated-battleground-debate,2024-10-04T14:14:11Z,"Lackawanna County, Pa., has emerged as a key battleground county this election cycle, with voters on the streets of Scranton speaking with Fox News Digital about their top issues.

Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger Dave McCormick squared off in their first debate Thursday evening, less than five weeks ahead of what is expected to be one of the most closely watched races this election cycle.

Casey and McCormick took the debate stage Thursday at 8 p.m. in Harrisburg, where the two traded barbs over issues such as the economy and inflation, immigration, abortion. The race, which is rated as ""leans Democrat"" by the Cook Political Report, is expected to be one of the tightest Senate races across the country, with Casey himself acknowledging earlier this year that it will be a ""close, tough race.""

Casey has long been a Pennsylvania Democratic stalwart, first winning his election to the U.S. Senate in 2007. The Casey name also has deep roots in the state, with Bob Casey Sr., the senator's father, serving as the Keystone State's governor from 1987 to 1995, following years of serving in various other elected roles.

McCormick is an Army combat veteran and former CEO of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, who served as the Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security as well as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs under former President George W. Bush's administration. Former President Donald Trump endorsed McCormick in April, lauding him as a ""a good man"" who ""wants to run a good ship.""

MCCORMICK SEIZES ON PENNSYLVANIA SENATE RACE GAP, LAYING BORDER BLAME ON CASEY

The Senate race comes as the federal election spotlights Pennsylvania once again as a key battleground state that will likely determine the outcome of the presidential election. Former President Donald Trump narrowly won the state in his successful 2016 election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while President Biden declared victory in the Keystone State in the 2020 election.

As the pair squared off for the first of two debates ahead of Nov. 5, Fox News Digital compiled the top five moments of Thursday's event.

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

Casey and McCormick both weighed in on the federal election, including Casey lauding Harris following his staunch support of Biden before the president ultimately dropped out of the 2024 race as concerns about his mental acuity and age mounted over the summer.

""From your perspective, who is the better candidate for Pennsylvania? Biden or Harris?"" moderator and ABC27 anchor Dennis Owens asked Casey.

""I think Vice President Harris, who's running a strong campaign, I think she'll carry Pennsylvania. It's going to be very close, just like the Senate race will be close. But she's running a strong campaign. But the people of our state have to make two basic decisions - in addition to other statewide races. They have decided in the presidential race, and they have to decide our race, and this race is very clear,"" Casey responded.

When asked whether he believes Biden or Harris would be a better president for Pennsylvania voters, Casey brushed off delivering a direct answer.

""Oh, I don't know, Dennis. I mean, we'll never know the answer to that, but the voters are gonna make a decision,"" he said.

McCormick, on the other hand, was asked if he could offer one example where he does not agree with Trump after slamming Casey during the debate for overwhelmingly voting with Biden over the last three and a half years.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS, TRUMP LOCKED IN TIGHT RACE IN BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

""[Trump] recently said that he wanted to get rid of the ban on SALT taxes, which Sen. Casey supported, too"" McCormick responded. ""Listen, that's a that's a tax break for millionaires in New York and California at the expense of PA taxpayers. So I wouldn't support that.""

""But listen, Senator Casey stood next to Joe Biden when he could hardly finish a sentence. We saw this on the debate stage, he said 'he's ready to go,'"" McCormick continued, referring to Casey's support of Biden remaining in the presidential race until Biden ultimately dropped out. ""Then Sen. Casey said, 'Kamala Harris is great. You're going to love her when you get to know her.' This is a woman who, in the last few years, says she wanted to ban fracking, legalize illegal immigration, give them federal benefits, take away our guns, defund the police. This is her position, so she's flip-flopped on everything, and Bob Casey standing there by her.""

Both candidates accused the other of ""lies"" throughout the debate, including McCormick touting a new website called CaseyLies.com, and Casey accusing McCormick of misrepresenting himself as a Pennsylvanian.

""For your viewers tonight, I have a website that's been established today, it's just been launched, CaseyLies.com. You can go and see the actual facts by third-party sources of all the things he's saying. There will be lies throughout. But you should ask yourself, 'Why is a senator with an 18-year track record, who should be able to run on his record, running his entire campaign with a negative set of attacks on me, most of them lies?'"" McCormick said towards the start of the debate.

McCormick claimed that Casey often launched ""lies"" at him during the debate because he ""doesn't have a track record"" in the Senate to run on.

Casey shot back during the debate that McCormick has misrepresented himself as a full-fledged Pennsylvanian.

""We've heard a couple of times tonight about telling lies, but probably the biggest lie told in this whole election, that probably most Pennsylvanians have never heard a bigger lie, was the lie when my opponent said he lived in Pennsylvania, when he was living in Connecticut. The Associated Press on August the 14th, 2023, did a story that proved that he was living in Connecticut,"" Casey said.

McCormick defended that he was born in Pennsylvania and has spent ""the majority of my life"" there, but also lived in Connecticut for years when he served as CEO of Bridgewater Associates.

PENNSYLVANIA SURVEY FINDS HARRIS LEADING TRUMP NARROWLY, IDENTIFIES HER 'BIGGEST WEAKNESS,' POLLSTER SAYS

The economy is among the top concerns for voters in Pennsylvania, as well as the nation at large, with both candidates outlining how they would tackle spiraling inflation if re-elected or elected to the Senate, and what they believe is behind the rise in consumers' costs.

""Prices are too high, especially when you go to the grocery store to buy food or household items, items that people need every week, or at least every other week. And these big conglomerates, these big corporations, rig those prices and jack them up to levels we've never seen, all while they're getting record profits,"" Casey said, while defending his efforts targeting corporations he has accused of ""greedflation.""

So-called greedflation is understood as corporations allegedly exploiting inflation woes by increasing prices on consumers to produce greater profits.

""We can take it on by passing a price gouging bill to go after those companies, hold them accountable,"" Casey said.

The Democratic senator also addressed his campaign against ""shrinkflation,"" which he explained as corporations shrinking products for consumers while not lowering prices.

""We did a report on shrinkflation, which covered a lot of companies around the country. And if that's happening with regard to a Pennsylvania company or any other company around the country, they should be held accountable. When they take a product, shrink the contents of the product, or what's in a bag, and don't shrink the price, that's deceptive. That's ripping people off,"" he said, adding that such companies should be held legally accountable.

McCormick shot back that higher costs on Americans in recent years is due to ""out of control spending"" at the hands of Casey and other Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris and President Biden.

""When you've spent your entire life in public service, elected office, 30 years, you're like a hammer looking for a nail. The cause of inflation is the policies, the out-of-control spending of Biden, Harris and Casey. Bob Casey voted 100% of the time for that $5 trillion of new spending. The experts at the time, Larry Summers, the San Francisco Fed, said this would create inflation,"" McCormick said.

""Bob Casey doesn't understand how the economy works. That's why he's trying to do all this economic voodoo stuff with price controls,"" he later charged.

Casey and McCormick were both grilled about their current abortion stances during the debate, as abortion once again sits atop many voters' list of election concerns following the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Casey positioned himself as a pro-life Democrat earlier in his career, but he voted to codify abortion protections nationwide following the overturning of Roe.

""In 2022, when the Supreme Court overturned a 49-year right, it overturned Roe v. Wade, I think everyone had to make a decision, including senators. I made a decision to support the Women's Health Protection Act. I don't support Republican efforts to ban abortion across the country,"" Casey said.

BATTLEGROUND STATE DEM DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM DEFUND MOVEMENT, BUT POLITICAL RECORD SHOWS DIFFERENT STORY

McCormick was questioned about his remarks in 2022 that he supports rare exceptions for abortion, such as when the health of the mother is at risk, and has since said that he supports additional exceptions for abortion.

""This is an extremely polarizing issue. As you know, I have six daughters, so this is something we spend time talking about. I believe this should be a state's right. I believe states should decide. Pennsylvania has had a law. It's been supported by Democrats and Republicans, like was signed into law by the Senator's father, Governor Casey. I support the three exceptions. I would not favor an abortion ban of any kind,"" McCormick responded.

Casey recently came under fire from a Pennsylvania sheriff who slammed the Democratic senator's border policies for the influx of fentanyl into the U.S., which the dad said had led to his son's death.

""We can't bring back the people we've lost. But we can get rid of the weak politicians like Bob Casey who let it happen,"" Blair County Sheriff Jim Ott said in a recent McCormick campaign ad.

Casey was asked about the sheriff's remarks during his debate Thursday.

""Mr. Casey, the Blair County Sheriff, blames you for the fentanyl death of his son, saying you have not done enough to secure the border. What is your response to that,"" Owens asked.

""I met so many families across the state, and whether it's a sheriff in Blair County or a mom in Allegheny County, Janet that I met, who talked about her daughter, Brianna, this is an awful, awful tragedy for those families. That's why we need to invest in the strategies that we know work. [McCormick] won't do that, because he's weak in the face of the political pressure from his own party. . . . We can solve this problem by investing in the technology, hiring thousands more Border Patrol, so we can inspect every single vehicle coming across the border,"" he said.

Amid the immigration debate, McCormick blamed the Biden-Harris administration and Casey for the immigration crisis at the southern border.

""The border crisis is the direct result of the weakness of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And Bob Casey supported them every second. What chutzpah to run an ad on how tough he is on the border, when he voted against funding for the Border Patrol. He ran an ad in front of the wall that he voted against. He voted for sanctuary cities, he voted for federal benefits for illegal immigrants. And the fentanyl crisis that's come across our border is the direct result of the weakness of Bob Casey not standing up to these terrible cartels,"" McCormick argued.

The pair have agreed to another debate, next taking the same stage in Philadelphia on Oct. 15."

Former Trump staffer and ""The View"" co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin will join former GOP lawmaker Liz Cheney and other anti-Trump Republicans for an event in Pennsylvania next week warning of the dangers of re-electing former President Donald Trump.

Former Trump administration staffer Cassidy Hutchison - who testified against her former boss in the Jan. 6 Committee hearings - as well as Trump's former deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews will be part of the event that is meant to help deliver the swing state to Vice President Kamala Harris in November.

The panel will ""offer a warning about the threat Donald Trump poses to democracy and the rule of law,"" a source connected to the event recently told CNN.

WORKING CLASS WILL COME HOME TO HARRIS, RALLYGOERS IN POSTINDUSTRIAL PENNSYLVANIANS SAY

The aim of the chat is to convince voters of ""the need for independents, moderates, and Republicans to stop him from getting back in office,"" the source added.

The women-led program will be hosted by liberal super-PAC Democracy First in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania on Oct. 9, and is reportedly the first of many that will feature the four women speaking to voters in multiple battleground states.

Cheney, Hutchison, and Matthews have endorsed Harris for president. Griffin has not, though the media personality is a staunch critic of Trump on ""The View"" and in her role as a CNN political commentator.

The event comes as Trump and Harris are neck and neck in battleground states, with the race being especially close in Pennsylvania.

'ABUSE OF POWER': HOUSE GOP OPENS PROBE INTO UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

Recent Fox News polling in Pennsylvania finds Harris only two points ahead of Trump among registered voters in the state, while they are tied at 49% among likely voters.

""Pennsylvania is not breaking open and shouldn't be expected to,"" says Democratic Pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts Fox News surveys alongside Republican Daron Shaw. ""Both candidates have a little way to go to consolidate their bases and whoever does a better job there could determine who wins the state.""

According to the survey, the economy is the top issue for Pennsylvanians, with 71% of voters having a negative view of it. Trump has a six-point advantage over Harris on the issue, while she is viewed far more favorably on abortion.

A number of the biggest names in Hollywood came out in support of Biden before he dropped out of the race, before turning their support to Harris. Olivia Rodrigo, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris by sharing a video of a speech the vice president gave promising to ""stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans."" Major Democratic fundraiser George Clooney, who used a New York Times essay to call for Biden to drop out of the race, lent his support to Harris and Barbra Streisand said she would support Harris because of her vow to fight for reproductive rights. Musician John Legend, who performed at the Democratic National Convention in 2024, posted he was ""so ready"" for a Harris presidency. Director Spike Lee, ""West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin and director Ken Burns hrew their support behind Harris, along with actresses Rosie O'Donnell and Jamie Lee Curtis. Robert De Niro, who narrated an advertisement for the Biden campaign, praised the president's ""selfless patriotism"" in a statement that did not mention Harris but said ""there is nothing more important for our country than defeating Donald Trump at the ballot box."" British pop artist Charli XCX brought Harris into the Gen Z fold by tweeting ""kamala IS brat,"" an endorsement that was met by Harris' team changing the background photo on her X account to the ""brat"" green color and using the same font used on Charli XCX's album of the same name. Rapper Cardi B, who in May said she wouldn't be endorsing Biden, tweeted ""AHAHAHAHA LETS GOOOOO I TOLD YALLL KAMALA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 2024 candidate...."" Pop musician Kesha said she plans to support Harris in November and, when asked how she felt about Vance, responded ""f -- - that man."" Beyoncé has not made a public endorsement but did give the Harris campaign permission to use her song ""Freedom"" in a video of her first official visit to her campaign's headquarters, a rare approval from the superstar musician. Beyoncé's mom and businesswoman Tina Knowles endorsed Harris with an Instagram post. Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle and former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have also thrown their support behind Harris. Former President Jimmy Carter, 99, reportedly told his son last week he was trying to make it to his 100th birthday so he could cast his vote for Kamala Harris. ""Sex in the City"" actress and former New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon threw her support behind Harris and her Vice Presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, in a post that read: ""I'm Walzing on air!"" Billionaire Mark Cuban, who previously said he was committed to voting for Biden, has also supported Harris and endorsed Walz as her running mate, calling him someone who ""can sit at the kitchen table and make you feel like you have know him forever."" Actor Tony Goldwyn, Republican political commentator Ana Navarro, comedian Mindy Kaling and actress Kerry Washington each supported the Harris-Walz campaign by hosting one evening of the Democratic National Convention. Nick Offerman, Jane Fonda, Ben Stiller, Kathy Griffin, John Stamos, Ed Helms, Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz were among those who appeared on a ""Comics for Harris"" virtual rally via Zoom, which reportedly raised close to half a million dollars for the Harris campaign. Over Labor Day weekend, a fundraiser for the Democratic ticket in Southampton, New York was hosted by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and fashion designer Tory Burch, among others. Actors Matt Damon and Lin-Manuel Miranda will attend fundraiser in New York City in September -- for which tickets are listed at $25,000 per person -- to support the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket, Bloomberg reported. Actress Aubrey Plaza posted a photo of herself on Instagram holding Grumpy Cat -- the face of a famous meme -- with the caption ""HARRIS 🇺🇸 WALZ. Mel Brooks said he was ""all in"" for the Harris and Walz ticket in a post to social media holding his dog, adding ""I don't have a cat, so a dog will have to do!"" Stevie Nicks did not name a particular candidate when she encouraged her followers to vote in an Instagram post this week, but signed her message ""Childless Dog Lady."" Billionaire pop star Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris in an Instagram post minutes after a debate between Harris and Donald Trump wrapped up, with a photo of her holding her cat that has since been recreated by several other celebrities. After declining to endorse a candidate in 2020, Martha Stewart said at the Retail Influencer CEO Forum she will supporting Kamala Harris in the election because she wants a president ""who doesn't hate New York"" and ""doesn't hate democracy,"" the Daily Beast reported. Pop star Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas, a songwriter and producer, made a video about National Voter Registration Day and Billie said they would both be voting for Harris and Walz ""because they are fighting to protect our reproductive freedom, our planet and our democracy."" Famous television scientist Bill Nye, in a video posted to the Kamala HQ TikTok account, called Trump a ""climate change denier"" and encouraged viewers to ""vote with the climate in mind."" Nye participated ""Geeks & Nerds for Harris"" fundraiser on Sept. 28 hosted by ""Wonder Woman"" star Lynda Carter that will also feature ""Star Trek"" actors LeVar Burton and Anthony Rapp, actor Misha Collins of ""Supernatural,"" Star Wars actor Mark Hamill and others.

Former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan ripped off his shirt while on stage at the Republican National Convention last month to reveal a Trump-Vance campaign shirt underneath, and called Trump his ""hero"" and the ""greatest president of the United States."" Musician Kid Rock has been vocal about his support of Trump in the past and at the RNC revamped his song ""American Bad Ass"" to include references to Trump. UFC President and personality Dana White called Trump the ""toughest, most resilient human being."" Rapper and reality TV star Amber Rose gave a speech at the RNC in support of Trump. Country music stars Chris Janson and Jason Aldean also appeared at the convention. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy in January said voting for Trump over Biden was a ""no-brainer."" Public-facing billionaires like Elon Musk and Steve Wynn have also supported the former president. Actress Rosanne Barr, a longtime conservative supporter of Trump, clapped back at Cuban's endorsement of the Harris-Walz ticket and called the VP pick ""another reason Harris is a disaster."" Rapper Azealia Banks last year said she would vote for Donald Trump in Novemebr and she appeared at a rally in Florida this summer. Actor Jon Voight has defended Trump on multiple occasions. 50 Cent's 2023 song ""Many Men (Wish Death)"" started trending online after the assassination attempt of Trump last month. The rapper responded by putting Trump's face on the cover of his ""Get Rich or Die Tryin.'"" While it's hard to call the response an official endorsement, he did appear to support the president in 2020 before apparently backtracking. Other celebrities who have supported Trump in the past, but not outright endorsed him yet this election season, include Lil Wayne and ""Happy Days"" star Scott Baio. Trump thanked Brittany Mahomes, wife of NFL superstar Patrick Mahomes, for her ""defending him"" after she lashed out at social media users who criticized her for liking several pro-Trump posts last month (Mahomes has not formally endorsed a candidate). At a rally in Las Vegas, Trump thanked reggaeton star Nicky Jam for his endorsement, but apparently thought he was a she -- saying: ""Do you know Nicky? She's hot. Where's Nicky?"" -- before correcting himself after Jam climbed to the stage, saying, ""Oh, look, I'm glad he came up.""

Notable names missing from the list of public supporters include billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who called the decision ""too important to rush."""

This was the harshest charge they faced, and a guilty verdict could have resulted in life in prison. The officers were all convicted of obstruction of justice and witness tampering. Haley was also found guilty of depriving Nichols of his civil rights and deliberate indifference resulting in serious bodily injury.

Trump reshares a video portraying himself as God's gift to earth,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/god-made-trump-video-christian-nationalism-masculinity-rcna173945,2024-10-04T10:38:48Z,"""I need somebody with arms strong enough to wrestle the deep state and yet gentle enough to deliver his own grandchild.""

That creepy line comes from a video called ""God Made Trump,"" which Donald Trump has shared in the past and did so again Wednesday. It's essentially an ad that portrays the Republican presidential nominee as God's gift to Earth.

As Phoebe Jones wrote for California's Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey earlier this year, the video -- which plays on Paul Harvey's ""So God Made a Farmer"" speech -- shows how Trump and the Christian nationalist movement he leads are steeped in toxic notions of masculinity:

At one point, the ad literally says God needed a man who cares for the flock, as if to reiterate God's purported preference. Trump has leaned into this kind of messianic masculinity with some of his recent rhetoric.

And evidence suggests that all of this is likely to appeal to Trump's base, given the conservative movement's evangelical beliefs and arcane ideas of manhood and masculinity. A Public Religion Research Institute poll from September, examining the connection between authoritarianism and Christian nationalism in the U.S., found that nearly 7 in 10 Republicans think society has become too soft or feminine.

The poll also found Christian nationalist ""adherents"" or ""sympathizers"" were more likely than others to agree with these statements:

Today's fiercely Christian conservative movement in the U.S. has become a hypermasculine cult of personality with Trump at the helm. He has permitted Christian men to cloak their desires for domination and power in religiosity -- and is even selling Trump-branded Bibles.

And men in this movement have made hay with their shamelessness, openly promoting misogynistic policies like bans on abortion and trying to end no-fault divorces (along with discouraging abused women from divorcing their partners).

This hypermasculinization of the American church has coincided with a perhaps predictable trend. As The New York Times reported last week:

My suspicion is that this is a byproduct of MAGA masculinity pervading American Christianity -- and crowding out young women who, given the choice, don't want to suffer underneath it."
Opinion | Harris could win these three Southern states if late deciders show up,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-florida-georgia-north-carolina-rcna173735,2024-10-04T10:34:05Z,"The polls can't capture the procrastinators who aren't yet engaged in the election.

More than a million Americans have already cast their ballots in the presidential election, but the ones who may prove decisive may not have even started paying attention.

For political junkies like me who have been following every twist and turn in this election for the last two years, the next 32 days are the most stressful as we wait to see what voters will decide.

If you already know which candidate you're supporting in the presidential race between Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris -- not to mention everything from governor down to local school board -- it can be frustrating to wait for these seemingly indecisive, procrastinating Americans to get to it.

But late deciders are important, and this year, I think they are the reason that Harris may have a chance to win Georgia, North Carolina and Florida.

No, that's not a typo. I said what I said. President Joe Biden won Georgia in 2020, and North Carolina has been close for a while. But Florida? The one state where the promise of a ""red wave"" in the 2022 midterms actually materialized? The state that has voted for Trump both times he's been on the ballot? It's still close enough that a late-breaking group of Harris voters could make a difference.

Now, it's important to understand who these voters are. I think of them as intentional voters, because they'll usually tell you what they think of the candidates and the race or that they don't intend to vote at all. Months out from the election, if you were to ask whom they'd vote for, they'll give a reflexive response. They'll cite something they heard in an ad or skimmed in a news article that may or may not closely approximates which candidate they're leaning toward. In fact, that candidate may not be whom they end up supporting.

But, as we get closer to Election Day, these voters become more engaged. Their intentions begin to shift and may even harden into support as they read up on the two candidates, listen closer to their arguments, and shift their attitudes. When they do, they can change the political landscape dramatically in short order.

That's especially likely in the 2024 election, which has seen a lot of tumult so far.

Consider when Biden dropped out of the race and Harris became his successor. The country saw 40,000 new voter registrations in just 48 hours, according to Vote.org CEO Andrea Hailey. That's a 700% increase in the site's daily registrations, and young voters accounted for 80% of them. According to ActBlue, the campaign and its joint fundraising committee raised more than $86 million from online donors, many of whom were donating for the first time. This averaged out to around $65 per person from more than a million people. That's a lot of voters who were activated quite suddenly.

Or look at Taylor Swift's influence. Her Instagram post endorsing Harris and urging her fans to vote regardless of their candidate led to at least 337,000 visits to Vote.org. That's a large group of potential voters who were quickly activated and are not likely to be casting their ballot for Trump.

There are also signs that Trump's own popularity has been slipping. Those signs aren't coming from polls, but from his actual performance in the primaries as his own voters shift in their intentions since the Republican convention, as career political adviser Mike Madrid recently noted.

Finally, there's the potential for local issues to have a dramatic effect on turnout.

North Carolinians may turn out to rebuke Trump-endorsed Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson in the state's gubernatorial race. Robinson recently made headlines for allegedly referring to himself as a ""Black Nazi"" on a porn site forum, among a litany of other disgusting comments, all of which he denies making. That's in addition to his extremist views on abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.

Trump has distanced himself from Robinson but not pulled his endorsement, and it's not clear if that would even help at this point.

Then there's Georgia. In past elections there, we've seen controversial voting policies be met with determination and expanded turnout due to the resilience of Peach State voters, pushing Democrats to statewide victory in a presidential election and three Senate races. It's possible some of the last-minute, ham-fisted changes to election rules by the state Board of Elections will also provoke a backlash.

And in Florida, voters will also be considering ballot measures to legalize recreational cannabis and codify abortion rights -- popular policies that align with the Harris-Walz agenda.

To be clear, I'm not saying that Harris will outright win Georgia, North Carolina or Florida -- or even that she'll win at all. What I am saying is that the polls can't yet capture what these late deciders intend to do. It happened in 2016 when Trump won unexpectedly, in 2020 when Biden won even as down-ballot Republicans did well, and in 2022 when a much-prophesied red wave failed to materialize. Yeah, those late voters can be pretty intentional

So, as you're going over the polls and casting about for some kind of clue as to what may happen, remember that there's still a lot of uncertainty. The only thing you can do is cast your own ballot, encourage your friends and family to do the same and volunteer to help out a campaign and persuade as many intentional voters as you can along the way. After that, all you can do is wait as they make their intentions known."
"New poll reveals Trump has significant lead on immigration, border security in key battleground state",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-poll-reveals-trump-significant-lead-immigration-border-security-key-battleground-state,2024-10-04T08:09:41Z,"Economist Steve Moore comments on the border crisis and illegal immigration on 'Fox Report.'

Former President Donald Trump holds a firm lead in a key state over Vice President Kamala Harris on the question of how to handle immigration -- as the border crisis remains a top issue for voters.

A new poll released this week from Marquette Law School finds Harris leading Trump overall in Wisconsin by 52-48%.

But when it comes to immigration and border security, Trump dominates. Of voters, 49% favor Trump while just 37% favor Harris, with 8% saying they'd be about the same, and 6% saying neither are good on the issue.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

Trump holds a similar 12 point lead on handling the war between Israel-Hamas, while Harris has an 11 point gap on handling Medicare & Social Security and a 17 point lead on abortion.

Of the issues polled, immigration was near the top of the issues, with 15% of voters saying it was their most important issue, the same number who said abortion, and only behind the economy -- which was top issue for 37% of voters.

The poll is the latest indicator that Harris still has a fair way to go in convincing some voters that she is the better candidate on a topic that has dominated the headlines and remains a top issue for voters. Wisconsin, along with states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Arizona could be election deciders in the election on Nov 5.

Harris was put in charge of handling root causes of migration to the southern border in early 2021 as border numbers began to skyrocket. She was eventually dubbed the ""border czar"" by media outlets and critics -- although the White House rejected that title.

HARRIS SHIFTS KEY POSITIONS ON BORDER, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AS CAMPAIGN PROMISES 'PRAGMATIC' APPROACH

Republicans have hammered Harris on the border, saying it was the rolling back of Trump-era policies that led to the record numbers at the border. They have also pointed to her embrace of left-wing positions in her 2019 presidential bid. Since then, her campaign says her views have been shaped by the current administration, including on decriminalizing illegal crossings and closing immigration detention centers.

""Harris can never be forgiven for her erasing our border, and she must never be allowed to become president of the United States,"" Trump said in Wisconsin on Sunday.

Harris has sought to present herself as better situated to handle the border. Her campaign has noted a recent drop in border encounters since President Biden signed a presidential proclamation in June limiting asylum entries. She has also thrown her support behind a bipartisan border security bill that would place similar limits on asylum and provide additional funding and detention beds.

Conservatives said that the bill would enshrine high border numbers, but Harris accused Trump of blocking the bill for political purposes. She did so again on a trip to the southern border in Arizona last week.

""He picked up the phone and calls some friends in Congress and said, stop the bill. Because, you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem,"" she said. ""And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games."""

A Milwaukee man has been accused of swiping items from the same Walgreens store three times during a week's span. The items were mostly cleaning and sanitary items, like soaps, toilet paper, razors, lotions and other household goods.

John Dzwonkowski, 38, now faces two counts of felony retail theft, according to police records and Fox 6.

A criminal complaint indicates that Milwaukee police were first contacted on Sept. 18 at a store on Howell Avenue.

The complaint states that the stolen items were approximately $178 in retail value.

Officers were called to the same Walgreens location just two days later after another complaint of theft, this time with the defendant ""removing razors, lotions and other cosmetic items and placing them into two bags,"" the complaint says. The stolen merchandise this time was valued at $435.

Kamala Harris teams up with Liz Cheney in the birthplace of the Republican Party,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-liz-cheney-birthplace-republican-party,2024-10-04T01:40:14Z,"RIPON, WI - As she turns up the volume on her efforts to court disgruntled Republicans in her battle with former President Trump for the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday teamed up with the most visible anti-Trump Republican in the town that claims to be the birthplace of the GOP.

Harris campaigned in battleground Wisconsin with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, a one-time rising conservative star in the GOP who, in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, has vowed to do everything she can to prevent Trump from returning to power.

""I have never voted for a Democrat but this year I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,"" Cheney told the audience, as she formally endorsed the Democratic presidential nominee. ""As a conservative, as a patriot, as a mother, as someone who reveres our Constitution, I am honored to join her in this urgent cause.""

Harris praised Cheney as a leader who ""puts country above party and above self - a true patriot.""

WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS WHO ADVISED REAGAN AND BUSH BACK HARRIS OVER TRUMP

The campaign event took place in Ripon, Wisconsin, where a one-room schoolhouse was designated a national historic landmark due to its role in holding a series of meetings in 1854 that led to the formation of the Republican Party.

The younger Cheney was once rising in the ranks of House Republican leadership.

But she was the most high-profile of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-president Trump in early 2021 on a charge of inciting the deadly Jan. 6th attack on the Capitol, which was waged by right-wing extremists and other Trump supporters who aimed to disrupt congressional certification of President Biden's Electoral College victory in the 2020 election.

TRUMP UPS HIS ANTE IN THE 2024 FUNDRAISING FIGHT WITH HARRIS

The conservative lawmaker and defense hawk immediately came under verbal attack from Trump and his allies, and was eventually ousted from her number-three House GOP leadership position.

Cheney, who has been vocal in emphasizing the importance of defending the nation's democratic process and of putting country before party, was one of only two Republicans who served on a special select committee organized by House Democrats that investigated the riot at the Capitol.

In 2022, she was ousted in the GOP congressional primary in Wyoming by a candidate that was backed by Trump.

At a speaking event in early September at Duke University in swing state North Carolina, Cheney announced that she would be voting for Harris in the presidential election. Cheney's father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, also endorsed Harris.

Cheney on Thursday warned that ""our republic faces a threat unlike any we have faced before. A former president who attempted to stay in power by unraveling the foundations of our republic.

She argued that Trump ""can never be trusted with power again"" and emphasized that ""in this election, putting patriotism ahead of partisanship is not an aspiration, it is our duty.""

""What Jan. 6 shows us is there is not an ounce, not an ounce, of compassion in Donald Trump. He is petty. He is vindictive. He is cruel. And Donald Trump is not fit to lead this good and great nation,"" Cheney claimed.

WHAT THE LATEST POLL IN BATTLEGROUND WISCONSIN SHOWS

Harris, speaking after Cheney, highlighted that ""anyone who recklessly tramples on our democratic values as Donald Trump has, anyone who has actively and violently obstructed the will of the people and the peaceful transfer of power, as Donald Trump has....must never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States.""

And Harris emphasized that ""I take seriously my pledge to be a president for all Americans.

Cheney was not always a fan of Harris.

The Trump campaign on Thursday repeatedly pointed to a social media post by Cheney during the 2000 election where she argued that ""@KamalaHarris has a more liberal voting record than Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Her radical leftist views-raising taxes, banning gun sales, taxpayer $ for abortion & illegal immigrant health care, eliminating private health insurance-would be devastating for America.""

Trump, speaking with Fox News' Bill Melugin during a rally in Michigan on Thursday, said that Cheney was ""terrible"" and ""a stupid warhawk. All she wants to do is shoot missiles at people.""

On Cheney's backing of Harris, Trump argued ""I think they hurt each other. I think they're so bad, both of them.""

The Cheneys are part of a growing list of prominent Republicans who are supporting Harris.

Two other high-profile anti-Trump Republicans -- former Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan - had speaking roles at the Democratic National Convention, which was held six weeks ago in Chicago.

And Harris is backed by more than 200 alumni who served in both Bush administrations or worked for the late Sen. John McCain and Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2008 and 2012 GOP presidential nominee. She's also supported by more than 100 Republican former national security officials and other prominent Republicans.

Ripon is not the only town that claims to be the birthplace of the GOP. Exeter, New Hampshire also has some bragging rites, as it was the site of meetings in 1853 - a year ahead of the Ripon gatherings - by disenchanted political leaders who discussed the formation of a new party of Republicans.

But officials in Ripon said the group in Exeter never actually formed a political organization, or chose officials, as they did in Wisconsin.

Wisconsin is one of seven crucial battleground states with razor-thin margins that decided Biden's 2020 White House victory and are likely to determine if Harris or Trump wins the 2024 presidential election.

With less than five weeks until Election Day in November, Harris and Trump are locked in a margin-of-error race in the key swing states.

While Trump retains vast sway over the GOP, even a small sliver of Republicans supporting Harris could make an important impact in what will likely be a race within the margins in the battleground states."

James Carville harshly criticized the Harris-Walz campaign for not doing more to combat the claim by vice presidential hopeful JD Vance that former President Donald Trump ""saved Obamacare"" during Tuesday night's debate.

The Democratic strategist unloaded on the Harris/Walz campaign for what he believes to be an ineffective response to Vance's comments that Trump ""salvaged"" the Affordable Care Act (ACA) while he was president.

""[Trump] did everything in his power to destroy it and this is not an issue that people don't care about,"" Carville said. ""It's not a nitpicking thing and I got to tell you, the White House response and I think by and large, to a large extent, the press response is not at all measured to the gravity of this lie, of the importance of this.

Tim Walz attempts to clarify remarks he made about being in Tiananmen Square during the 1989 pro-democracy protests during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Vice presidential candidate Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., has been called out so many times for false claims, one news outlet warned it may unravel his public image.

CBS debate moderators confronted the governor during his vice presidential debate with Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, Tuesday regarding Walz's claim that he had been in Hong Kong in May 1989 during the Tiananmen Square protests, when he actually traveled to Asia in August, a few months later.

Politico observed this is part of a history of factual inaccuracies Walz has told about his past, in an article headlined, ""Tim Walz has a tendency to misspeak. It may haunt the campaign.""

""Since being tapped as Kamala Harris' running mate, the folksy, plain-speaking Minnesota governor has had to explain a growing number of inaccurate statements -- and at times embellishments -- about his past,"" Politico's Meredith Lee Hill and Mia McCarthy wrote. ""They range from comments about his military service to his visit to Hong Kong more than three decades ago to clarifying that his family didn't specifically use in vitro fertilization.""

BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT TELLS DR. PHIL HE SAW 'PANIC' ON WALZ'S FACE DURING KEY DEBATE MOMENT

""It's unclear whether Walz's verbal errors will undercut his credibility with voters. But the need to continually clean up those claims could politically hurt Walz and Harris, who are locked in a tight race with Donald Trump and JD Vance,"" the reporters added.

""And in some cases, key members of Harris' circle weren't aware of some of the inaccurate statements until they became public despite the vetting process, according to four people familiar with the conversations who were granted anonymity to discuss the matter.""

The writers said, ""Walz's misstatements could contradict the image that the campaign has painted of him as an upstanding, everyday Midwest guy.""

During the debate, Walz responded to a question about his Tiananmen Square claim by speaking about how he ""grew up in a small rural Nebraska town, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies 'til the streetlights come on,"" then described joining the National Guard and becoming a teacher. He glossed over his trips to China but acknowledged, ""I've not been perfect, I'm a knucklehead at times.""

When confronted again by one of the moderators for not answering the question, he conceded he ""misspoke"" about the Tiananmen timeline.

The day after the debate, Walz told reporters during a campaign stop in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, ""Yeah, look, I have my dates wrong. I was in Hong Kong in China in 1989... I speak like everybody else speaks. I need to be clearer.""

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

A spokesperson for the campaign defended Walz's record to Politico, noting he ""cares deeply about democracy.""

""As the governor has said, he sometimes misspeaks. He speaks like a normal person and speaks passionately about issues he cares deeply about, including democracy and stopping gun violence in our school,"" the Harris-Walz campaign said, adding former President Trump and Vance ""repeatedly lie and mislead about their plan to ban abortion nationwide"" and other topics."
Melania Trump's abortion views in new memoir spur outrage from pro-lifers: 'She is wrong',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/melania-trumps-abortion-views-new-memoir-spur-outrage-from-pro-lifers-she-wrong,2024-10-03T20:43:32Z,"Former first lady Melania Trump opens up about her life before, during and after the White House in a sit-down interview on 'Fox & Friends.'

Former first lady Melania Trump is drawing heat from pro-life advocates over an excerpt in her memoir where she suggests a woman's right to choose an abortion is a ""fundamental right of individual liberty,"" according to a report Wednesday.

Melania Trump wife of Republican presidential candidate and former President Trump, wrote the memoir entitled ""Melania"" that is scheduled to come out on Oct. 8, per the Amazon release date. In the book, according to a preview by The Guardian, Melania expresses a viewpoint that has historically been at odds with the Republican Party's platform.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,"" Melania reportedly wrote.

TRUMP RISKS LOSING SOME PRO-LIFE VOTERS UNLESS HE CHANGES 'HIS TUNE' ON ABORTION, ACTIVIST WARNS

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.

""Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

The excerpts quickly drew the ire of pro-life advocates who have already been disgruntled by some of Trump's seemingly ambiguous comments regarding abortion.

""Melania Trump's support of abortion is anti-feminist and clearly outside the teaching of our Catholic faith. She is wrong,"" wrote Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America advocacy group.

Lila Rose, founder of leading pro-life advocacy group Live Action, also responded to a promotional video Melania posted for her memoir in which she states, ""Individual freedom is a fundamental principle that I safeguard... what does my body my choice really mean?""

""Who is this Melania Trump, or Kamala Harris? Functionally the same exact position on abortion,"" Rose wrote on X.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

President of pro-life advocacy group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Marjorie Dannenfelser, wrote on X: ""The women of America are capable of great strength and creativity. They are naturally inclined to speak for those who are powerless. Abortion is not the source of their freedom and liberation.""

In August, Trump sparked confusion among pro-life supporters about where he stood on an amendment that would upend Florida's ban on abortions after six weeks' gestation. Trump, after saying ""I think the six-week is too short, there has to be more time,"" to an NBC reporter when asked how he would vote, later walked it back and said he would vote against the amendment.

Other spouses of Republican presidents, such as Pat Nixon, Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Laura Bush, have been recorded either during or after their husbands' tenure in office expressing pro-choice views.

Co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin agreed that it was a ""strategic"" move.

""I think she hates him. Okay, so we can all agree that. That's a given. I also think that she wants to take him out. She does not want to be the first lady anymore. She doesn't want to be the first lady. She destroyed the Rose Garden. Who hates Christmas? Melania Trump hates Christmas. She doesn't want to decorate for Christmas.

The former first lady wrote in her memoir that a woman's fundamental right of ""individual liberty"" grants her the right to have an abortion if she wishes.

""There's no question the discussion around family life, childbearing and pronatalism has gotten a lot more popular and gotten media attention because of JD Vance,"" Brad Wilcox, the director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, told the Associated Press.

The total fertility rate in the United States fell to 1.62 births per woman last year, a 2% decline from the year before and the lowest recorded rate since at least the 1930s. Reasons for the declining birthrate are varied and plentiful -- women are getting married later and pushing off having children as they pursue careers and higher education; the rising cost of living has impacted the economic realities of starting a family; and the U.S. lacks affordable child care and universal paid family leave policies, to name a few. Both Democrats and Republicans have supported policies that encourage family growth -- Republican senators have drafted a plan for monthly cash benefits for working families and Vice President Kamala Harris has proposed a $6,000 tax credit to parents of newborns, for example -- though conservatives tend to be more vocal about the goal of boosting birth rates. Economists have warned that a declining birth rate, and aging population, could spell disaster for the nation's Social Security program -- without enough young, working people to counterbalance the number of Social Security dependents, the existing system isn't sustainable. The same is true of other economic institutions that need to continue to replace retiring workers with those of the next generations. Experts also say that a low birth rate demonstrates an overall decline in American stability -- people aren't expressing a desire to have fewer children, research shows, but they are more worried about the economic and social impacts that they are excited to start a family.

The United States isn't the only developed nation experiencing a decline in birth rates, and it's not the only one to be encouraging reproduction at the government level. France in 2023 had the lowest number of babies born in the country since 1946; the Japanese government has described the situation ""critical"" after years of a declining birth rates; and Italy's birth rate has declined more than 34% since 2008. Each country has implemented new policies to address the situation, including an Italian parental leave that can be taken until a child is six years old and Japan extending public insurance coverage to maternity expenses. Hungary's birth rate, once the lowest in the European Union, has started to increase over the last decade as the country implements policies like exempting women who have more than three children from income tax providing home buying and building subsidies that increase based on their marital status and the number of children per household.

In her forthcoming self-titled memoir, Melania Trump espouses an unflinching belief in abortion rights -- a view on one of the biggest issues of the election that is entirely antithetical to that of her husband and her political party.

In reviewing an early copy of her book, The Guardian reports that Melania Trump says it is ""imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy"" in deciding whether to have children, ""free from any intervention or pressure from the government.""

""Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body,"" she adds.

On Thursday morning, she also posted a video to social media that references her position on abortion rights. ""Without a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth: individual freedom,"" Melania Trump says in the video. ""What does 'my body, my choice' really mean?""

According to the Guardian, Melania Trump's book acknowledges the extreme circumstances in which some people make such decisions, including rape, incest or severe medical conditions in the fetus. But she also defends abortion access later in a pregnancy, which her husband has repeatedly demonized and misrepresented as a ""radical"" Democratic view.

She writes:

The former first lady's revelation is astonishing, given how out of step she is with her party, and in light of her husband's singular role in rolling back the right that she professes is essential to women ""from birth.""

And the timing of her declaration is no less circumspect: Melania Trump chose not reveal that she is pro-abortion when Roe v. Wade was overturned, or after Republican legislatures imposed draconian state abortion bans, which have caused preventable deaths and forced women to travel out of their states for the procedure. Rather, her apparently unwavering belief in abortion rights comes just ahead of a closely contested election in which Republicans are trying desperately to rebrand their extreme abortion views -- and in a memoir she is selling for upwards of $40."

Former first lady Melania Trump says in a self-titled memoir set to be released next week that she supports women's autonomy and the right to control their own bodies -- including abortion, if they choose, according to a report Thursday.

Her stance adds another jolt to a presidential campaign season rife with dramatic events, with Melania Trump weighing in on a topic that is a central issue in her husband's bid for reelection.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy"" when deciding when and whether to have children, Melania Trump writes in the book, according to an excerpt cited by The Guardian. The newspaper says it obtained an early copy of the book.

Those decisions, she said, should be based on women's personal convictions, not on ""intervention or pressure from the government,"" according to the excerpt.

According to the The Guardian Melania Trump also writes:

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.

Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

NPR has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment about Melania Trump's writings, and is seeking independent verification of the excerpt from the book's publisher.

Abortion has long been a key issue in U.S. political campaigns, but the 2024 race comes two years after the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v Jackson that found there is no constitutional right to abortion.

Democrats have used that controversial ruling as a rallying call, emphasizing that pivotal votes on the high court's decision came from justices nominated by then-President Donald Trump.

The former president's position on abortion has been closely analyzed as he seeks to regain the White House.

""After 50 years of failure, with nobody coming even close, I was able to kill Roe v. Wade, much to the 'shock' of everyone,"" Trump said last year on his Truth Social platform.

But this year, Trump has seemingly sought to portray a more nuanced position on abortion, including saying that abortion laws should be left for states to decide.

As NPR's Sarah McCammon reported after the 2022 midterm election:

""Advocates for bans on most abortions - including a wave of state laws passed in recent years that prohibit the procedure within the first several weeks - are at odds with public opinion, according to many years of polling. While most Americans support some restrictions on abortion, most support access earlier in pregnancy.""

Melania Trump's memoir, titled Melania, has a release date of Oct. 8, by Skyhorse Publishing, with distribution by Simon & Schuster.

In its summary of the book, the publisher said of the former first lady: ""She shares behind-the-scenes stories from her time in the White House, shedding light on her advocacy work and the causes close to her heart.""

The former first lady was born in Slovenia in 1970, three years before the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. She moved to the U.S. in 1996 and became a U.S. citizen in 2006."

Vice President Kamala Harris is maintaining her lead over former President Trump in Wisconsin despite Trump leading on the key issues, according to a Wednesday poll.

The new poll from Marquette Law School finds Harris leading Trump in a 52%-48% match-up. The poll also found that voters are deeply invested in the election, with 46% of respondents saying they have stopped talking to someone about politics due to the presidential race.

Marquette conducted the survey from Sept. 18-26, polling 882 Wisconsin registered voters and 798 likely voters. The poll advertises a margin of error of 4.4%.

Despite trailing in the polls, Trump leads Harris in the top issues in the race, including border security, the economy, and handling the Israel-Hamas war.

Trump enjoys a sizable 49-37% lead over Harris on immigration. Meanwhile, 50% of Wisconsinites say he will handle the economy better than Harris, with the vice president getting just 42% support. Trump also enjoys a 45%-33% lead when it comes to Israel's conflict in the Middle East. He also has a narrow lead over Harris when it comes to foreign relations more generally.

Another 49% said Harris would be better for ensuring a fair and accurate election, compared to Trump's 39%.

Body language expert tells Dr. Phil he saw 'panic' on Walz's face during key debate moment,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/body-language-expert-tells-dr-phil-he-saw-panic-walzs-face-during-key-debate-moment,2024-10-03T09:42:56Z,"Body language expert Carole Lieberman, M.D., weighs in on Vance-Walz VP Debate.

Body language expert Scott Rouse called out Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., for panicking and trying to avoid answering a question about his presence at Tiananmen Square during the vice presidential debate Tuesday.

One of the debate's most surprising moments came when the CBS debate moderators confronted the governor about his claim that he had been in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protests, when he actually traveled to Asia in August 1989, a few months later.

Dr. Phil, who previously asked Rouse to analyze body language in September's presidential debate, asked him what to look for when reviewing this clip of Walz.

""I'm going to look for the things that tell us we know he wasn't there, and this, I'll put all my money on this, we're going to see fear, we're going to see panic, we're going to see shame, and the grief muscle as well,"" he said, adding, ""Everything's in this one.""

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

The host then showed CBS' Margaret Brennan confronting Walz about the Tiananmen claim, noting that reports indicate ""you actually didn't travel to Asia until August of that year, can you explain that discrepancy?""

Walz began his response by talking about growing up in rural Nebraska. Rouse said his body language spoke volumes, ""As that head goes sideways, that's panic. Because he's not sure how he's going to defend this. He knows the question's coming, so he's got something ready, but it's not coming out the way he thought about it, so he's got inner dialogue going on, he's thinking about it. That's why I see that head turn, those eyes get really, really wide. I know what that looks like, that's what's happening.""

Rouse noted what he called the upside-down horseshoe shape of the ""grief muscle"" as well as other signs on Walz's face.

""And the rest of this, this is panic, we see his eyes doing this, that's panic,"" Rouse said, drawing on the screen. He added further that Walz's lower face and head indicated he was in ""panic mode.""

He then called attention to what he said was Walz's biggest hand gesture of the night, ""This is the one that's come out further from his body than anything else, because he's trying to make sure- 'I want you to believe me! You gotta believe me!' That's what we're seeing, the panic here. Wide eyes, grief muscle, and everything's far out.""

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

Dr. Phil said a quick and direct answer followed by an explanation immediately seems more trustworthy than starting an answer with a long explanation.

""Don't you want to hear the answer up front?"" Dr. Phil asked the audience. ""And the question was, 'You said you were in Tiananmen Square during that showdown. And were you or weren't you?'"" He then mocked Walz's answer about growing up in a small Nebraska town.

Rouse replied that this tactic of dumping unrelated information is a well-known ploy to change the conversation.

""We call that 'chaff and redirect,'"" the expert said. ""He gives out a lot more information, hoping that your brain will follow that information and not ask any more questions and forget what you're talking about. That's why when you're asking a question, they go, 'Well, listen, here's what really happened. When I get up in the morning, I eat toast every day' and they start talking about stuff that has nothing to do with what the answer is.""

Dr. Phil then proposed a way Walz could have better answered the question.

""Would it have been better off if he'd have said, 'No, I wasn't, and I said I was. Let me explain. I took student groups over there probably 30 or 40 times, 35 years ago. And I remember this being a really big deal, and I just got it confused timing wise. Bad mistake on my part. I apologize. Next question.'""

Dr. Phil then joked, ""But then we wouldn't have known where he was born."""
MORNING GLORY: The VP debate is an example of Kamala Harris's horrible judgment when it comes to picking staff,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-vp-debate-example-kamala-harriss-horrible-judgment-when-comes-picking-staff,2024-10-03T09:09:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The debate between the candidates for vice president -- GOP nominee Ohio Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz -- was dominated by Vance, and all but a handful of hardened partisan pundits agree on that conclusion.

Walz wobbled and panicked from the first question -- which everyone in the world knew would be about Iran's ballistic missile attack on Israel earlier in the day. Yet Walz still fumbled his response, and it got worse from there until the CBS moderators invoked the unwritten mercy rule for left-wing moderators watching the Democrat melt and tossed Walz some softballs on J6 at the debate's close, by which time the internet was howling and laughing at the Minnesota governor.

There were three important takeaways:

NEW YORK POST CALLS OUT CBS FOR 'RIDICULOUS' FACT-CHECK OF JD VANCE: 'SHAMEFUL MOMENT'

First, Vance is a superb and calm debater and a reassuring figure on the national stage.

Second, Walz is not, and he represents the one big decision Vice President Kamala Harris has had to make since President Joe Biden dropped out. It was a terrible decision. Imagine her Cabinet and White House staff if somehow, she wins.

Third, legacy media is irretrievably broken and cannot be reclaimed from its lurch into rote leftism and extreme partisanship, or even pulled back to a minimum level of seriousness on big occasions.

Do executives at these networks -- ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC -- not see what has happened? Americans don't trust the news divisions at the legacy networks. It's as if those divisions are run by a combination of fresh-from-campus-demonstration interns and hardened partisans from the Obama years.

The CBS debate was not, however, as overtly biased against Vance as ABC's earlier debate was against Trump, but it was still very, very biased against the center-right and conservative audience. Viewers saw the question set veer quickly from a world crisis and the border crisis to get to the left's favorite issue of abortion.

With the world tuning in only hours after Iran launched 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, the moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan did open with an obligatory round of questions on that crisis. But, after 10 minutes, they plowed on to a quick exchange on immigration and the Biden-Harris massive fail on the relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene's savaging of North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Virginia in order to get to ... abortion, which had been discussed at length in the ABC debate and about which there are zero mysteries.

Three rounds of questions on abortion, really? And three rounds marked by the rote framing favored by the hard left? Predictable but still shocking.

The debate ended in a morass of childcare questions and then the obligatory ""Wasn't January 6th terrible?"" questions.

What a farce. Not one question on China's vast military build-up and its threat against Taiwan and the Philippines. Not one question on the Chinese Communist Party spies shot through our country, including the office of New York's current and past governor. Not one question on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Yes, there was a quick dash through the consequences of more than 10 million illegal immigrants flowing across the southern border under the Biden-Harris regime, but also a quick cut-off when Vance began what was an obviously embarrassing factcheck of the CBS factcheck on the ""legal status"" of the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio. ""We have a lot to get to,"" was the trigger for cutting off anything uncomfortable.

Walz was asked about his lying about his trips to China -- sort of. It was left hanging. A knuckleheaded answer for a knuckleheaded team of debate organizers. Chinese President Xi Jinping is a sort of Voldemort for the networks -- never to be named -- perhaps because ABC and CBS all have corporate ties to companies that must do business there?

Look, whatever votes were moved by the debate moved toward the GOP because Vance hammered that the costs of everything from food to gas skyrocketed under Biden-Harris, gave a quick tutorial on why construction costs have soared and thus the price of houses, and repeatedly reminded the audience of Harris's failure in her job as ""border czar,"" while also stressing the need for more domestic energy production. Tim Walz provided comic relief.

The loser wasn't just Walz though. It was also CBS, which joined ABC in a legacy media hall of shame. When we get back to debates in four years, the good news is the ""debate commission"" is already dead and that, by 2028, the idea of the big networks hosting debates unchecked by center-right moderators will be as well. The candidates will call on C-SPAN and find some fair moderators. Siri could have done a better job in our past two debates this year.

What has to be dawning in the C Suites of networks -- if they are at all self-aware -- is that their product and their talent are awful, and their audiences have already left or will soon leave. Tuesday night was just the most recent example of why."
Too much presidential politics? State legislatures are also on the ballot,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5129659/abortion-election-michigan-arizona-minnesota,2024-10-03T09:05:03Z,"Some of the most consequential and controversial issues -- abortion and voting access, education, health care and criminal justice -- are largely decided by state lawmakers who are, more likely than not, on your ballot this year.

State legislators wield significant power, which has been amplified with Congress gridlocked and policymaking punted to the fifty so-called ""laboratories of democracy"" to pass laws dealing with abortion, guns, schools, voting, LGBTQ rights and more.

But, increasingly, voters' attention is devoted to narratives spun in national politics, even as legislatures play an outside role in modern policymaking.

Political parties and interest groups are spending millions of dollars trying to sway legislative elections this year. In at least six states, the margins are so close that partisan control of the legislature could flip.

Republicans have more legislative power than Democrats heading into this year's elections, controlling 55% of the nation's 7,386 legislative seats, according to an NPR analysis. Overall, the GOP is on top in 57 of the country's 99 legislative chambers.

Republicans have veto-proof majorities in 20 states, allowing them to override governors' bill vetoes. Democrats have veto-proof majorities in nine states.

The ability to override a governor's veto is especially potent in Kansas, Kentucky and North Carolina -- states where Republicans have supermajority control of the Legislature and a Democratic governor. Democrats in Kansas and North Carolina are hoping to win enough seats to break Republican supermajorities this year.

Here's a look at some of the legislatures where partisan control hangs in the balance this year.

Democrats believe they have a chance to win total control of Arizona's Legislature and governor's office this year with Republicans defending narrow two-seat majorities in both the state House and Senate.

Abortion access has been front-and-center in Arizona after the state Supreme Court ordered a Civil War-era abortion ban into effect and legislators scrambled to repeal it. Democrats are taking aim at GOP lawmakers who voted against repealing the ban.

And voters will decide whether to add abortion protections to their state constitution during a referendum on Election Day -- one of 10 states with a reproductive rights ballot measure this year.

The state's Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs was elected in 2022. She set a record for the most vetoes in Arizona history -- striking down conservative bills involving elections, immigration and transgender people.

But Hobbs has been cuffed by the Republican-led Legislature and hasn't been able to champion many policies on her own. If Democrats were to flip control of the legislature, they say they would scale back a massive $700 million school voucher program passed by Republicans.

Democrats haven't had full control of the governor's office and Legislature since 1966.

Democrats are attempting to preserve the trifecta they gained in 2022 after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer won reelection and the party gained narrow majorities in both legislative chambers.

Whitmer credited the abortion constitutional amendment on the ballot that year for the Democratic victories after she and other candidates made the issue central to their campaigns. Their wins meant Democrats were in full control of the state for the first time in four decades.

Since then, Michigan Democrats have passed progressive policies like abortion protections, gun safety and an expansion of prevailing wage rules while repealing conservative provisions like ""right-to-work"" legislation.

There are no state Senate elections this year and only the House is in play. Republicans argue Democrats have pushed the state too far to the left and they can provide a check on Whitmer's administration.

Republicans are also trying to undermine a trifecta in Minnesota where the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, Democrats' official name in the North Star State, controls both legislative chambers and the governor's office.

Democrats are defending a slim majority in the House and there is a political tie in the Senate after a legislator dropped out to run for Congress. A special election for the district, located in the Minneapolis suburbs, will determine control of the Senate.

Andrew Karch, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota, says it's hard to make voters aware of these elections when there's a splashy presidential race going on.

""I think that there's a real tendency for these races to sort of fly beneath the radar,"" he says. I think in a lot of ways, there aren't that many messages that actually are bubbling up. I think again, these races often tend to get overshadowed by national politics and by other statewide campaigns.""

Under Democratic control the Legislature passed -- and Gov. Tim Walz signed -- bills that provide free meals for kids at school, restore voting rights to some people with felony convictions and reinforce abortion access and transgender rights.

Control of the Granite State's largest-in-the-nation Legislature has bounced back and forth over the years, but Republicans currently have a trifecta. The GOP currently holds a slim majority with 197 of the state House's 400 seats (there are seven vacancies) and 14 out of 24 Senate seats. After five two-year terms, Republican Gov. Chris Sununu is not running again, leaving a rare open election for governor in this state without term limits. The race to succeed him is likely the most competitive in the country this year between Republican Kelly Ayotte and Democrat Joyce Craig.

New Hampshire is one of the few states in New England without abortion protections enshrined in its state constitution and Democrats hope the issue, along with the open election for governor, will boost turnout.

The Keystone State is one of two legislatures with split control -- Republicans control the Senate and Democrats control the House.

Democrats hope recent statewide victories -- the elections of Gov. Josh Shapiro and U.S. Sen. John Fetterman -- will trickle down to local races in a year when the battleground state has been flooded with national attention. That year, Democrats won control of the state House by gaining 12 seats.

If Republicans win a majority in the House and take full control of the Legislature, it likely spells conflict between lawmakers and Shapiro.

Democrats hope new political maps -- redrawn by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers after the state Supreme Court struck down Republican-drawn maps in 2023 -- will lead to a shakeup of the GOP-led Legislature.

Republicans have controlled the Legislature for more than a decade under maps that favored the GOP. According to Wisconsin Public Radio, at least 61 members of the state Assembly and Senate won't run in their old districts -- nearly half of the Legislature. Democrats are running candidates in 97 of the Assembly's 99 races and in each of the 16 open Senate races.

Democrats argue the legislative maps have been out of step with voters after a series of statewide victories, including Evers' reelection in 2022."
"It's harder to pay and travel for abortion care, but support funds are struggling",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5131573/abortion-fund-travel-state-bans-ballot-measures-national-federation-budget-cuts-repro-rights,2024-10-03T09:02:12Z,"Bree Wallace works for the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund. The group uses donations to help people pay for abortion care in Florida, and to travel to other states, but has struggled financially to keep up with the demand.

Getting an abortion can cost hundreds, if not thousands of dollars, especially if a patient must leave a state with a strict abortion ban.

But the organizations that provide financial support, sometimes known as abortion funds, are struggling financially and slashing their budgets, unable to meet the needs of the growing number of people asking for help.

Planned Parenthood of New England is warning of a projected $8.6 million deficit. Funds in Ohio, Chicago, Arizona and Florida don't have enough money to meet demand.

Even the National Abortion Federation, which runs a national hotline that helps cover procedure costs, was forced to cut its monthly budget in half, due to fewer donations.

Previously, the Federation had covered up to 50 percent of an eligible patient's costs in most locations. In July, it dropped that coverage to 30 percent.

""We're in the midst of an abortion funding crisis,"" says Oriaku Njoku, the executive director of the National Network of Abortion Funds, which provides an online search tool for patients to find a local or regional assistance fund.

Njoku and others at these funds point to intersecting pressures: increased demand for financial assistance for abortions, additional expenses due to some patients having to travel across state lines, and a decline in donor interest.

The initial wave of ""rage donations"" that flowed into the national and regional funds, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, has subsided.

""It's weird to see the divestment like, don't you see the crisis anymore?"" says Jenice Fountain, executive director of the Yellowhammer Fund in Alabama.

""We're absolutely, very much still in crisis, potentially even worse crisis than when the ban first happened.""

The Yellowhammer Fund supports pregnancy and prenatal care, and is involved in a lawsuit against Alabama's Attorney General, after he threatened to prosecute groups like Yellowhammer for helping patients travel out of state for abortion care.

""People ask 'Why should we donate if Alabama doesn't have an abortion clinic?'"" Fountain says.

""And it's like, well, that's a reason to double down on support in Alabama. We're fighting the thing. We have to exist the whole time that we fight the thing.""

But abortion hasn't faded from the news, or become less politically potent. In fact, reproductive rights have become a prominent issue in this year's presidential election.

Ten states will put ballot measures on abortion rights before voters in November, and many Democratic candidates have made it a central issue to their campaign.

The cumulative effect has been to divert donations away from the funds that support patients directly -- and towards specific candidates and ballot initiatives.

In August, more than 30 local abortion funds across the U.S. signed an op-ed criticizing national reproductive rights organizations for focusing too much on advocacy rather than patient care.

""I think there's this false hope and illusion with putting the right president in place, or winning this ballot initiative,"" says Eloisa Lopez, executive director of the Abortion Fund of Arizona.

""None of that is actually funding abortion care,"" Lopez says. ""You can have all those things in place and people are still not going to be able to get their care.""

Even after the election ends, Lopez fears that donors will continue to assume that grassroots abortion funds like hers don't need as much support -- especially if voters approve state-level ballot initiatives that affirm reproductive rights.

""I think when people see progress is being made, it's translating into people's minds, like 'We're not going to have struggles trying to get abortion anymore.'""

But advocates say that the struggles to pay out-of-pocket for abortion care, or travel elsewhere for care, will continue in all states.

Bree Wallace, an employee at the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund, typically spends her days glued to her laptop, messaging back-and-forth with pregnant clients who need help paying abortion care -- and fast, if they want to comply with Florida's six-week ban.

One afternoon in July, a woman texted the fund from the waiting room of a clinic. She needed an abortion, but couldn't pay.

The National Abortion Hotline had pledged to cover 30 percent, leaving her with a fee of $490.

""It can be pretty hefty for people,"" says Wallace, 27, the fund's director of case management.

Within minutes, Wallace committed to help. All the woman had to do was share her first name and last initial. The clinic would directly charge the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund for the balance, and the woman could move forward with her appointment.

In Florida, an abortion can cost between $600 to $800, during the first trimester. Florida law requires a mandatory in-person consultation and an ultrasound, followed by a 24-hour waiting period.

Since 1977, the Hyde Amendment has severely restricted the use of federal funds for abortion care. In practice, that means Medicaid doesn't cover it -- unless individual states cover the entire cost with state funds.

Florida Medicaid does not cover abortion care, and state law also bans coverage by insurance plans sold on the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

Many patients must therefore pay for the entire cost, and have little time to gather the funds under the state's six-week ban.

Bree explained that many women don't even know they're pregnant by six weeks. But if they do, they often have just days to act.

""Especially with six weeks right now you're kind of working against time, you don't even have time to even get that money,"" Wallace says.

Before Florida's six-week ban went into effect last spring, some patients could have saved up their own money. But now they need the fund's help, says Wallace.

At the Abortion Fund of Arizona, declining donations have forced spending cuts. In September, the Fund spent about $18,000 assisting patients -- half of what the Fund spent in July.

Often, that monthly allotment is gone in just two weeks, and staffers must turn down requests for aid, or tell patients to try again next month.

""It's a really terrible position where we're having to give people ideas about how to raise money on their own,"" says executive director Eloisa Lopez.

""'Can you ask your family or friends? Do you have a credit card? Could you take out a line of credit? Do you have items in your home you can sell?'""

Since most states near Florida also ban abortion, patients past the state's six-week mark are traveling to places like Washington, D.C. or Illinois for care.

Between last-minute airfare and hotel stays, that can push the price up another $1,000.

""There's also taking off work. That can be hard for a lot of people, finding childcare,"" Wallace says. ""Sometimes this is the first time people have ever been on a plane, ever left Florida...it can be really confusing and stressful.""

Earlier this year, the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund decided it could spend fifty thousand dollars a month helping pay for procedures and travel. But since May, it's regularly blown past that limit.

The fund doesn't want to turn down someone who really needs help, Wallace says. She read out loud a grateful text she recently received from a client.

""'Thank you,' with a million exclamation points,"" Wallace reads from the screen. ""'Thank you so much,' with even more exclamation points. 'I appreciate you for what you do, you just helped me more than you know.'""

The Tampa fund hopes to do more fund-raising this fall. But if future donations don't keep up with spending, it will completely run out of money in 3-6 months, according to Wallace.

Because of the federal Hyde Amendment, abortion funds must turn to private donations from individuals, community groups or foundations.

But in many states, federal and state funds are used to support crisis pregnancy centers that oppose abortion and often try to dissuade people from getting an abortion. In the last 5 years, about $400 million dollars in federal money flowed to crisis pregnancy centers across the country."
"Why Vance easily beat Walz in debate, softening his image in the process",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/why-vance-easily-beat-walz-debate-softening-his-image-process,2024-10-03T07:12:39Z,"A panel of Republicans, Independents, and Democrats react in real-time to claims made by Trump running mate JD Vance in reference to 2020's election results during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Credit: CBS)

And there's no question that JD Vance easily won the vice presidential debate. Tim Walz did better than anticipated - perhaps those expectations were deliberately set low - but despite some strong counterpunching, he frequently stumbled.

Each man had a mission: to defend his running mate and rough up the opposing presidential candidate.

But Vance had a second goal beyond talking up Donald Trump, and that was softening his own image. He made a concerted effort to project empathy, to appear reasonable, to be open to opposing viewpoints.

VOTERS REACT TO GOV TIM WALZ DODGING TIANANMEN SQUARE QUESTION: 'I'M A KNUCKLEHEAD AT TIMES'

There is a caricature of the Ohio senator as a hard-right ideologue with little sympathy for women, as reflected by the famous childless cat ladies comment. But when the subject of abortion came up, he went out of his way to sound sympathetic to the pro-choice side:

""I know a lot of Americans don't agree with everything that I've ever said on this topic. And, you know, I grew up in a working-class family in a neighborhood where I knew a lot of young women who had unplanned pregnancies and decided to terminate those pregnancies because they feel like they didn't have any other options. And, you know, one of them is actually very dear to me. And I know she's watching tonight and I love you.

""And she told me something a couple of years ago that she felt like if she hadn't had that abortion, that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship. And I think that what I take from that as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable, is that my party? We've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they frankly just don't trust us.""

(Vance's website describes him as ""100 percent pro-life."")

Walz countered with specific stories of women who died or whose health was damaged because they lived in states that tightly restrict abortion.

The Minnesota governor hit his talking points, but regularly took a long time to get to his main argument. A question about Kamala Harris' plan to build 3 million housing units produced a detour about how Walz has only bought one home.

Walz often spoke in a clipped shorthand - the ACA, Springfield, Vance creating stories - without explaining, for instance, that he meant the false tale of Haitian migrants eating pets.

The CBS moderators, Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, edged into ABC territory by fact-checking only Vance, despite saying they would try to avoid that. After the senator referred to illegal immigrants in the Ohio town, Brennan said Springfield ""does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected."" That's a point Walz should have made, but didn't.

Many questions were framed from the left. ""Senator Vance,"" said Brennan, ""you oppose most gun legislation that Democrats claim would curb gun violence. You oppose red flag gun laws and legislation to ban certain semi-automatic rifles, including AR-15s.""

Walz's worst moment was one he should have anticipated, a story in the New York Times and elsewhere saying he was not in China for the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests as he had claimed, but got to Hong Kong months later. The governor began with a word-salad answer about growing up in Nebraska before retreating to ""I've not been perfect. And I'm a knucklehead at times.""

Pressed again, he said he had misspoken.

Vance's worst moment was about Jan. 6. O'Donnell began, ""You have said you would not have certified the last presidential election and would have asked the states to submit alternative electors that has been called unconstitutional and illegal.""

POLITICS HIJACKS HURRICANE DEVASTATION IN THE SOUTH, BIDEN CALLS TRUMP A LIAR

The senator countered that Trump ""said that on January the 6th, the protesters ought to protest peacefully. And on January the 20th, what happened? Joe Biden became the president. Donald Trump left the White House.""

This time Walz was ready. Trump ""lost this election and he said he did. 140 police officers were beaten at the Capitol that day, some with the American flag. Several later died.""

He turned to Vance and said: ""Did he lose the 2020 election?""

When Vance tried the ""focused on the future"" line again, Walz called that ""a damning non-answer.""

But Vance largely came off as a Bush-style compassionate conservative. He must figure that win or lose, he'll be running for president in 2028 and needed to combat all the negative coverage.

Walz looked like a man who was happy to survive his turn on the national stage. The debate would have looked very different if Harris had picked Josh Shapiro, given that she's tied with Trump in Pennsylvania.

The Harris campaign has bubble-wrapped Tim Walz, not allowing him to do a single solo interview. JD Vance is constantly doing interviews, podcasts and press conferences, the best kind of preparation for a big debate. And that, in the end, may have been the difference."

Stevie Nicks' first single in four years is an ""anthem"" to abortion rights and the 2022 Dobbs decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

The former Fleetwood Mac singer released the music video for ""The Lighthouse"" on Thursday, though she explained in a statement that the song was years in the making.

""I wrote this song a few months after Roe v. Wade was overturned,"" she said. ""It seemed like overnight, people were saying, 'What can we, as a collective force, do about this...' For me, it was to write a song. It took a while because I was on the road.""

Her statement continued, ""Then early one morning, I was watching the news on TV and a certain newscaster said something that felt like she was talking to me -- explaining what the loss of Roe v. Wade would come to mean. I wrote the song the next morning and recorded it that night. That was Sept. 6, 2022. I have been working on it ever since.""

STEVIE NICKS DETAILS 'CRAZY' MEDICAL EMERGENCY THAT LED TO POSTPONED SHOWS

Lyrics for the song included, ""All the rights that you had yesterday are taken away / And now you're afraid / You should be afraid/ Because everything I fought for long ago in a dream is gone.""

The music video also spliced images and clips of several women's marches.

Nicks emphasized in her statement upon the song's release how important it was to her and other women.

""It seemed like overnight, people were saying, 'What can we, as a collective force, do about this...' For me, it was to write a song,"" Nicks said. ""I have often said to myself, 'This may be the most important thing I ever do.' To stand up for the women of the United States and their daughters and granddaughters -- and the men that love them. This is an anthem.""

Nicks has been outspoken about her support for abortion rights, previously calling it ""my generation's fight."" In 2020, she discussed her own abortion and said it was necessary to keep the band going in 1979.

""I would have had to walk away,"" Nicks said. ""And I knew that the music we were going to bring to the world was going to heal so many people's hearts and make people so happy.""

""And I thought: you know what? That's really important,"" she continued. ""There's not another band in the world that has two lead women singers, two lead women writers. That was my world's mission."""
"Politico: Vance's beard a sign of 'aggression' to women, Walz's 'saucer' eyes showed his 'passion'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/politico-vances-beard-sign-aggression-women-walzs-saucer-eyes-showed-his-passion,2024-10-03T00:07:43Z,"Fox News contributor Joe Concha joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss why he believes the CBS moderators were biased against JD Vance and his reaction to an ABC anchor comparing Tim Walz's performance to President Biden's.

Female voters who watched the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate on Tuesday may have viewed Ohio Sen. JD Vance's beard as a sign of toxic masculinity, according to one body language expert.

Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, faced off against Democratic vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at the Tuesday night debate, sparring for 90 minutes on a wide range of issues including immigration, the economy and abortion.

Former FBI agent and body language expert Joe Navarro analyzed each candidate's body language at the event for Politico Magazine, giving his opinion about how they presented themselves on stage.

The first thing Navarro noticed was Vance's facial hair. He claimed the ""masculine"" trait could turn off female voters.

VANCE OOZED CONFIDENCE COMPARED TO JITTERY WALZ, BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT SAYS: 'CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP'

""As POLITICO Magazine has noted before, Vance is the first White House wannabe to wear facial hair in 80 years. Our appearance is fundamental to our body language, and research indicates that voters see beards as (surprise, surprise) more masculine,"" Navarro wrote. ""That can be positive to some, reading as strength and competence. But to others, especially women, it can be negative, conveying aggression and opposition to feminist ideals.""

Navarro isn't the only media commentator to associate the Republican ticket with negative perceptions of masculinity. Since the Harris-Walz ticket emerged, several journalists, including MSNBC contributor Katty Kay, have argued that Republicans appeal to men with a more ""macho,"" what they consider, outdated version of masculinity.

MSNBC host Jen Psaki and The Washington Post's Catherine Rampell have also made the case that the Democratic ticket appeals to men who are more ""supportive"" of women.

While critiquing Vance's beard, Navarro praised Walz for his bugged-eyed expression throughout the debate, saying it ""showed his passion"" on the issues.

""When Walz felt especially passionate about something, he'd open his eyes wide as saucers. Eye-popping can sometimes be a sign of surprise, but for Walz, it simply revealed his emotional intensity,"" Navarro wrote. ""Early humans would have made such facial gestures to communicate strong emotions, like 'danger is close.' For Walz, it gave extra weight to his feelings and held our gaze.""

CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE

The body language expert spoke positively about how Vance used his hands to convey emotion and leadership during the debate, but claimed a ""little frown"" by the Republican at one point showed where his ""weaknesses lie.""

""When Walz brought up Project 2025, Vance exhibited a little tell that carried a big message: a slight squinting of the eyes and a small frown. Clearly, this was a sore subject,"" Navarro wrote.

""We have to guard against such behaviors in high-stakes interchanges like negotiations or, say, vice-presidential debates -- they reveal to your opponent what topics you want to avoid and where your weaknesses lie,"" he wrote.

At the same time, Navarro gave credit to Walz for frowning to show his disapproval while Vance was speaking.

""During a disagreement over democracy, he furrowed his glabella forcefully at what Vance was saying. Then he held his eyebrows like that, in tension, for some time. While Vance had the floor, this was a way for Walz to silently say, 'No way, that's not right, and I am going to challenge you on this,'"" he wrote.

The only negative assessment of Walz was about his finger-wagging at the camera.

""[H]e pointed at the camera with his index finger, like Uncle Sam in those old 'I Want You' posters. It was a bold, almost accusatory gesture -- which made it great for the poster, but can come across as almost hostile. Our brains immediately perceive a point as 'calling us out' -- in other words, as threatening. Walz wanted our attention there, and he certainly got it,"" Navarro wrote.

Both candidates displayed ""Midwestern politeness"" by tilting their heads and turning their bodies toward the other while speaking, the expert said."
Opinion | JD Vance tried to mansplain his way into the good graces of women. It didn't work.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-vice-presidential-debate-fail-rcna173598,2024-10-02T23:54:23Z,"Vance admits Republicans have a problem when it comes to women's trust. That doesn't mean he has a plan.

Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance arguably had one job going into Tuesday night's debate: convince the American public that he, and his party, don't hate women.

Even with that painfully low bar, I'd say he failed to do the job. The once anti-Trump senator did wear a pink tie, but did not face up to his past comments about menopausal women, ""childless cat ladies"" and a historically low favorability rate. Instead, he used most of his allotted speaking time to mansplain his views to the two women who were moderating, women who vote, and even his own wife.

During a question on immigration, Vance tried to talk over CBS moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, after he regurgitated dangerous lies about Haitian immigrants living in Springfield, Ohio. To Vance's dismay, Brennan reminded the audience that the immigrants in Springfield are there legally.

""The rules that you were not going to fact-check,"" Vance quipped, referring to CBS' statement that it would leave it to Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to fact check each other during the debate. ""And since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.""

Vance talked over and interrupted both O'Donnell and Brennan as they tried to move forward with the debate.

""Thank you, senator, for describing the legal process,"" Brennan said, before the network then muted Vance's mic.

""The audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Brennan said. ""We have so much we want to get into. Thank you for explaining the legal process,"" she added, in a tone every woman sitting in a cubicle, boardroom or classroom knows deep in her bones.

Unlike his windmill-, shark- and Hannibal Lecter-obsessed running mate, Vance deftly wields a very specific type of misogyny that, while far less obvious, is just as insidious -- one that can come off as empathic, but is undeniably condescending as it normalizes the most draconian right-wing policies.

One example of this was Vance consistently referring to Brennan -- a woman he does not personally know -- by her first name rather than addressing her appropriately. The slight-of-hand misogynistic move may have been Vance's attempt to appear likable and down-to-earth, but many viewers saw it differently: condescending, patronizing and rude.

Vance himself admitted that the Republican Party has a problem when it comes to women's trust. He reminded women watching Tuesday that they do not trust Republicans when it comes to abortion and the human right to bodily autonomy -- yet failed to explain how he, his running mate and his fellow party members plan to address the problem.

""We've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue where they, frankly, just don't trust us,"" Vance said, before claiming that is ""one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do.""

To demonstrate his party's commitment to earning that end, Vance lied about not supporting a nationwide abortion ban, the realities of abortion care later in pregnancy, and Minnesota's PRO Act, signed by his opponent, Gov. Tim Walz. Because nothing says ""trust me, I know what's best for you"" like holding an impromptu masterclass on gaslighting.

While Vance was able to appear far more level-headed than Trump in his fateful debate performance against Vice President Kamala Harris last month, it was Vance's faux praise of his wife while discussing the necessity of child care that truly embodied his very specific type of mansplaining and misogyny.

""I speak from this very personally because I'm married to a beautiful woman who is an incredible mother to our three beautiful kids, but is also a very, very brilliant corporate litigator, and I'm so proud of her,"" Vance began. ""But being a working mom, even for somebody with all of the advantages of my wife, is extraordinarily difficult.""

It's telling, when a man publicly laments the challenges his working wife faces, yet doesn't seem to face those same challenges as a working father. While appearing to appreciate all his wife does, Vance still chose to mansplain how hard it is to work outside the home while managing the majority of child care and household responsibilities without structural support -- the exact structural support Republicans have historically opposed.

For his bropropriating coup de grâce, Vance then pontificated on the importance of giving a ""family care model that makes choice possible.""

""The cultural pressure on young families, and especially young women, I think, makes it really hard for people to choose the family model they want,"" Vance said, ignoring how anti-abortion laws make it difficult, dangerous and in some cases impossible for women to choose when and how to start creating a ""family model"" in the first place.

Overall, it's true that during Tuesday's debate Vance succeeded in portraying himself as a level-headed, somewhat ordinary politician (if the definition of ""ordinary"" is calmly discussing the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history). But that is perhaps what makes Vance far more Machiavellian than Trump even. And it's what should put us all on high alert as we prepare to head to the polls in November."

Wade was overturned, 20 states have banned or restricted abortion earlier in the stages of pregnancy than what was established by Roe v. Wade, according to The New York Times. However, the former president stopped short of supporting a national ban on abortion after being coy about the matter, saying in a Truth Social post this week he ""would not support a federal abortion ban, under any circumstances.""

Former Harris advisor complains about Walz's 'niceties' towards Vance: 'Why should they vote for you?',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/former-harris-advisor-complains-about-walzs-niceties-towards-vance-why-should-vote-you,2024-10-02T21:21:30Z,"MSNBC host Symone Sanders-Townsend argued that cordiality and demonstrating common ground between Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio failed to demonstrate differences to the American electorate.

MSNBC host Symone Sanders-Townsend criticized Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., for being too agreeable with his opponent Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, during the vice presidential debate on Tuesday.

The showdown between Walz and Vance was noticeably cordial throughout the evening, despite their ideological differeances. Sanders-Townsend, who served as chief spokesperson and senior adviser for Vice President Kamala Harris before joining MSNBC in 2022, suggested that if Walz and Vance have so much in common, it's a mystery why voters wouldn't support the Republican ticket.

""Debates are about performance, and they are about policy. And why this debate was very important is that there are many Americans out there, not just moderate Republicans, there are base Democratic voters that are saying they want to and need to hear more. Now, I think it is very fair for people to want to criticize those base Democratic voters who say, 'Well, what more do you need?' You can do that. But that is their lived reality, and so if you are trying to win their votes, you have to meet them where they are,"" she said. ""There were so many niceties on that debate stage tonight, I am just kind of like, well, if you agree so much with J.D. Vance, why should they vote for you?""

She went on to argue that both candidates were strategically putting on a dishonest performance.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

""I fully believe that Gov. Walz went out there tonight and did what was practiced in debate prep, did what the strategy was that the team put together. That was not the Gov. Walz that we -- that I had seen out on the campaign trail. That's not the Gov.Walz that I had seen during the veepstakes, right?"" she said. ""That was not the J.D. Vance that I know to be true. I mean, goodness! J.D. Vance was on that stage, he was sorry about Amber Thurman, he was -- he was sorry about -- he was sorry about a lot of stuff. He -- 'We get things wrong.' But do you agree with the policy?""

Sanders-Townsend, who also hosts a weekend show on MSNBC, also took aim at the CBS moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margret Brennan.

""That's not the Margaret and Norah that I know! Margaret don't do that on Sunday morning,"" she said.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

After the debate, Walz was criticized for coming off as nervous and not as polished as Vance.

""I think JD Vance strategically went in to do 'Midwestern nice' to disarm Tim Walz. And Tim Walz kind of took the bait so he wasn't in fighting mode. There were some fact checks he could have done that he dropped the ball on,"" ""The View"" host Alyssa Farrah Griffin said.

""Vance was far nimbler than the nervous Tim Walz, especially in the first half of the debate. But as the debate went on, Vance stumbled on two issues -- abortion and the 2020 election -- where his rhetorical skill could not salvage the very unappealing material he was working with,"" Josh Barro, author of the newsletter Very Serious, wrote."
InnovationRx: This AI Startup Helps Patients Fight Insurance Denials,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/innovationrx/2024/10/02/innovationrx-this-ai-startup-helps-patients-fight-insurance-denials/,2024-10-02T21:19:02Z,"Plus: Here's how Epic founder and CEO Judy Faulkner will keep her medical records company private, independent and employee-owned forever.

ndustry watchers predict generative AI could lead to an administrative battle of the bots between doctors and health insurers over care decisions. That leaves patients in limbo without access to medications or other treatment while institutions duke out prior authorization and denial letters by fax, phone or algorithm. Warris Bokhari is trying to change that by putting the power of AI in the hands of patients.

Bokhari, a physician-executive who has worked at Amazon, Apple and Anthem (now Elevance Health), saw that large language models like GPT-4 could be useful to summarize information for patients at different reading levels. The idea behind Claimable, his startup that launched Wednesday, is to use these models to flip the script. Or in his words, to ""take a patient story and transform it into something compelling to an insurance company.""

The company is starting by partnering with rheumatology clinics, since many patients with conditions like arthritis are on expensive drugs known as biologics, which are often subject to prior authorization. For Bokhari, this fight is personal, his mom had rheumatoid arthritis, but because he grew up in England, his family didn't have to go bankrupt to afford medication.

While building in stealth mode, he found that health insurers are often issuing denials because the guidelines for certain diseases are significantly out-of-date. Bokhari said Claimable is prompting and fine-tuning GPT-4 with the latest clinical guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology, as well as all of the FDA labels and trial data for specific drugs, in order to generate appeals letters for a flat fee of $39.95.

After testing the tech and having it generate ""hundreds and hundreds"" of letters with a human-in-the-loop for quality assurance, the fully-automated software pilot phase has generated around 50 appeal letters for real patients with an 80% denial overturn rate, said Bokhari. Most cases have been resolved in under 10 days. With a seed round led by Walkabout Ventures (he declined to disclose the amount), Claimable is hoping to add more than a hundred conditions in 2025, for patients with multiple sclerosis, cardiac diseases, diabetes, obesity, asthma and certain cancers. ""We think we could achieve a lot just by getting the patients to be heard,"" said Bokhari.

Judy Faulkner, who founded electronic health records giant Epic in 1979, has bucked convention from day one, starting with the company dress code: ""When there are visitors, you must wear clothes.""

While competitors like Cerner (now Oracle Health), Allscripts (now Veradigm) and Athenahealth, grew by taking venture capital money, executing mergers and acquisitions, going public and then private again, Faulkner has eschewed any outside interference. And she intends to keep it that way. Faulkner told Forbes she has set a plan in motion to ensure that Epic remains private, independent and employee-owned in perpetuity with a unique trust structure.

Ali Velshi: Project 2025's plan to globalize the GOP's culture war,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/project-2025-usaid-abortion-climate-authoritarian-rcna173345,2024-10-02T21:11:47Z,"Republicans want to use one of the world's biggest humanitarian organizations to spread their far-right agenda.

No area of government seems to be safe from the clutches of Project 2025; that includes the U.S. Agency for International Development, also known as USAID. Chapter 9 of the far-right blueprint is dedicated to USAID, which distributes aid to more than 100 countries in the form of humanitarian assistance, health infrastructure and economic development.

Project 2025 sees USAID's status as one of the world's biggest humanitarian organizations as an opportunity to export its right-wing culture war obsessions to the world. That includes abortion.

On page 260, Project 2025 calls for reinstating the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy, widely known as the ""Mexico City Policy."" It's an old policy that blocks U.S. federal funding for organizations that perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning in foreign countries, first introduced by President Ronald Reagan.

But if the Mexico City policy's goal was to stop abortion ... it didn't work. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa affected by the policy, for example, saw increased abortion rates, according to a 2019 study featured in the Lancet Global Health Journal.

On page 265, Project 2025 asserts, ""The continued high rate of maternal and infant mortality is a persistent global tragedy. Contrary to current publicity, this problem is not solved by abortion."" That's actually contrary to reality. Decreased access to abortion means increased maternal mortality rates. According to the World Health Organization, nearly half of all abortions conducted worldwide are considered ""unsafe,"" and according to the Guttmacher Institute, nearly 11% of all maternal mortality comes from these unsafe abortions.

As I've said time and time again: Abortion is health care. In America and around the world, restricting abortion means restricting women's health care.

Project 2025 also wants the president to be able to dictate abortion policy worldwide. A section on page 261 reads:

The goal here is to hold the rights of women hostage, with the carrot of U.S. aid in exchange.

This chapter's war on women continues. On page 259, the plan suggests:

This head-in-the-sand approach to those big scary woke words may be in line with right-wing domestic politics, but fighting this culture war on the global stage would be an incredible disservice to women everywhere.

The USAID Office of Population and Reproductive Health actually helps fight child marriage. It also supports programs aiming to end female genital mutilation and gender-based violence. But Project 2025 is so immersed in the right-wing culture wars that it abandons all other reasoning.

Case in point: On climate change, page 257 reads: ""The aid industry claims that climate change causes poverty, which is false. Enduring conflict, government corruption, and bad economic policies are the main drivers of global poverty.""

Again, reality would disagree. The impacts of climate change, like increased frequency of extreme weather, more droughts and harsher heat, could push more than 100 million people into poverty by 2030, according to a report from the World Bank. Yes, you read that correctly: not keep 100 million people in poverty, but push 100 million more into it.

Page 257 is chock full of ideas: It suggests that:

This would be a death blow to the fight against global climate change. USAID's climate strategy is full of goals to reduce emissions, conserve at-risk ecosystems, and develop renewable energy systems around the world. Cutting this funding would hurt the folks already disproportionately feeling the effects of climate change: The 74 lowest-income nations contribute to only one-10th of emissions but stand to be affected the most by climate change.

So there you have it: Women as breeding stock and the world as a dumping ground -- that's international development courtesy of Project 2025."
"MAGA abortion bans are an attack on men's freedom, too",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/maga-abortion-bans-attack-mens-freedom-rcna173625,2024-10-02T19:49:35Z,"Men 4 Choice co-founder Oren Jacobson spoke with The ReidOut Blog about how his group is defying hypermasculine norms and tagging men into the fight for reproductive rights.

This post is the third in ""MAGA and Masculinity in 2024,"" an ongoing series examining the societal fallout from right-wing hypermasculinity -- and the people fighting its toxic messaging by positively redefining what it means to be a man. You can read the first post here and the second post here.

Oren Jacobson, co-founder of reproductive rights advocacy group Men 4 Choice, said he had an ""aha-slash-oh-s--- moment"" in 2015 that led him, a progressive organizer at the time, to shift his focus toward reproductive rights and bodily autonomy.

That was the year he became convinced of the real potential for Roe v. Wade to be overturned and for abortion to be criminalized, Jacobson told me on Tuesday. He cited Pew Research Center data that shows majorities of both men and women support abortion being legal in all or most cases. However, he argued, voices critical of abortion seem to dominate coverage of the issues.

""I was struck by the fact that the men who were speaking were the ones who were trying to criminalize abortion, while the six in 10 of us who thought that was bulls--- were saying nothing and doing nothing,"" Jacobson said. ""And that struck me as this really interesting puzzle.""

Men 4 Choice garnered national attention last year and earlier this year when second gentleman Dough Emhoff invited the group to participate in roundtables on ways to get male allies to help advocate for abortion rights. And the group's ads have drawn support from other prominent activists.

In my interview with Jacobson on Tuesday, we discussed hypermasculinity, men's role in the reproductive rights movement, and the powerful moments at the Democratic National Convention this year, when Josh Zurawski and Derek Cook took the stage as symbols of the righteous impact men can have on the fight reproductive rights.

This interview has been slightly edited for length and clarity.

Jah'han Jones: What are the lessons your work has taught you about men's views on abortion rights?

Oren Jacobson: Number one is that most men don't understand the harm abortion bans cause. It's a little easier now, after Dobbs, because you have Josh Zurawski speaking out or Derek and Anya Cook's story or the couple stories out of Georgia we've seen where women have actually died. So that harm is a little bit more front and center. But especially pre-Dobbs, and in ways that people don't even see still, it wasn't as obvious to many men how people are harmed by the denial of access to care, whether it's like care in an emergency situation or just like, ""Hey, when you start banning and criminalizing abortion, OB-GYNs leave your state and less people have access to all reproductive health care."" So the number one lesson is the need for men to understand harm. How does this actually hurt my family, my community, and my people?

OJ: Number two is that most men don't see this as their issue. It's a woman's issue in their mind. They think, ""It doesn't directly impact me. I'm not affected.""

The third is that most men don't see a natural entry point into this organizing work. Most of the organizations and organizing and messaging and communications and outreach is focused on women and pregnant people, which makes endless amounts of sense. But pick any population in the country and say, ""If you're not engaging them, what are the odds that they actually engage with you civically, right?""

And then the fourth is that men don't have a playbook. They just don't know what to do and don't know what to say. And so even if you get them through the first three pieces, you give them an entry point. You help them see the harm. You help them create ownership. You still need to tell them what to do and how to do it, because they know they're not experts, and they're worried that they're going to screw up.

JJ: What kind of messaging have you seen work in terms of getting men to better understand that abortion is their issue, too?

OJ: We tell men this isn't just about abortion. It's about freedom and power and control. Because no person can be free if they don't have the power to control their own body and reproductive decisions, right? Not if the government has the power to control you, or the power to control the most important decision you could ever make -- which is if, when and how to build a family. So we start in this place of grounding the question in these universal value frames that all of us understand. The word freedom is just such a part of our political and cultural discourse.

JJ: Absolutely.

OJ: The second piece of this is what I would call stakeholder messaging, which is different than allyship messaging and different than beneficiary messaging. Allyship means I stand up for you because you're hurt. Our message is actually different. It's about what men have to lose. It frames them as someone whose body may not be under attack, but someone whose rights are -- whose family is and whose freedom is.

We'll use a story like Josh's as a way to point that out: If the government has the power to control your wife's body, the government has the power to control your family. So your body may not be under attack, but your rights are, your family is, and your freedom. Josh and Derek almost lost everything because their partners were denied access to basic, essential reproductive health care.

JJ: I hear you.

OJ: I should say, men who are LGBTQ+ are quicker on the draw on this. They see the connection between the legal structure of their rights around privacy, around government, and the government attacking and controlling people. If you're a queer man in America and you live in a state that's banning abortion, you probably happen to also live in a state that's attacking your rights.

JJ: Sure, and in that case you might be better equipped with the language to fight back against things like attacks on bodily autonomy and what that means for pregnant people, too.

OJ: Yes, and that's why we focus on terms like freedom, power, control. It's finding a way to center men -- putting men into the center of the [abortion] story without making the story about men, if that makes sense.

JJ: It does. And I appreciate those efforts at a time when the MAGA movement is using those words to promote a toxic masculinity rooted in brutishness and bravado. I see your organization deploying them toward better ends.

OJ: A lot of young men in particular are susceptible to what that movement is doing because the world around them is changing. We're all socialized into ideas. Some of them are good. Some of them are bad. We think that -- not just until Election Day, but beyond this -- we need to build a plan and a movement to win on this question. To win and fight for young men."
MSNBC's Reid says Dem base longing for a 'fist fight' kind of debate with Trump: Give him a 'knuckle sandwich',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbcs-joy-reid-says-dem-base-longing-fist-fight-debate-trump-give-him-knuckle-sandwich,2024-10-02T19:28:33Z,"Despite calls to lower the political temperature following the two assassination attempts against former President Trump, MSNBC host Joy Reid recently claimed that Democratic voters want someone to give him a ""knuckle sandwich.""

Despite calls from both sides of the aisle to lower the political temperature following the two assassination attempts against former President Trump, MSNBC host Joy Reid recently claimed that Democratic voters want someone to give him a ""knuckle sandwich.""

Reid employed the violent imagery during MSNBC's vice presidential debate coverage on Tuesday night, telling a network panel that the Democratic base really want someone to engage in a ""fistfight"" with the former president.

""Democrats want to see someone get up there and give a knuckle sandwich to Donald Trump,"" Reid said to the panel, which included fellow MSNBC anchors Nicolle Wallace, Lawrence O'Donnell, Rachel Maddow and others.

A VISIBLY SHAKY WALZ SAYS THE WORLD NEEDS 'STEADY LEADERSHIP'

Reid began her point by stating that Gov. Walz's, D-Minn., vice presidential debate performance seemed tailored to a ""small, narrow group"" of swing voters, who want ""more substance"" from candidates.

""Tim Walz was very detailed and he spoke the way a governor speaks about really specific issues like gun violence, like health care. He was substantive and knowledgeable, so if you are that person who the thing that is keeping you on the fence is you need more details, he gave you more details.""

She continued, explaining that the base of the party prefers to see a brawl between the two candidates, and their preferred leader taking it directly to Trump with heavy blows.

""No. 2, I don't think that small narrow group of people wanted to see a fist fight. And so, I think that the people who want the fist fight are the base of the Democratic Party.""

Reid noted that it isn't the Democratic base that ""needs this debate,"" but those swing voters who do. She argued that Walz delivered in connecting to these people.

""I think the reason that Tim Walz was effective in the way he did it - he wasn't angry, he was disappointed. And that's actually in some ways stronger,"" she said, elsewhere adding, ""Tim Walz gave you that specificity that I think is going to get those people to feel more comfortable"" voting for the Democratic ticket.

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

Several X users blasted Reid for using the violent imagery against Trump only weeks after he was nearly killed by a second would-be assassin at his golf course in Florida.

Popular conservative account Libs of TikTok criticized the host, stating, ""2 ass*ss*nation attempts and Iran plotting to try to get Trump and Democrats are still calling for violence.""

Conservative commentator Paul Szypula chimed in, stating, ""Joy Reid is an angry person filled with hate. She needs help.""

""Steve Bannon's War Room"" co-host Natalie Winters remarked, ""Wow, @JoyAnnReid just said the quiet part out loud. Democrats want a 'fist fight' and someone to 'give a knuckle sandwich to Trump.'""

The Post Millennial editor-in-chief Libby Emmons commented, ""This is a call for political violence.""

Heavy metal singer and conservative commentator Phil Labonte added, ""there have been two attempts on Donald Trump's life in the past three months."""
Opinion | Why JD Vance's abortion debate answer sounded eerily familiar,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/vance-abortion-debate-trump-ban-rcna173646,2024-10-02T18:55:09Z,"By Susan Rinkunas, freelance reporter covering abortion, reproductive health, and politics

Ohio Sen. JD Vance acknowledged during Tuesday night's vice presidential debate that Republicans have a believability problem on abortion. It's a notable admission, given that he and his running mate are asking voters to trust that they won't enact a national abortion ban after the demise of Roe v. Wade -- the Supreme Court precedent that the GOP swore was safe, until it wasn't.

Vance said during his debate against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz that the GOP has ""got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue where they, frankly, just don't trust us."" He then claimed that Trump believes the proper way to handle the issue is to ""let the individual states make their abortion policy.""

Trump himself fired off a social media post during the debate that stressed this talking point in capital letters. ""EVERYONE KNOWS I WOULD NOT SUPPORT A FEDERAL ABORTION BAN, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, AND WOULD, IN FACT, VETO IT,"" he wrote, ""BECAUSE IT IS UP TO THE STATES TO DECIDE BASED ON THE WILL OF THEIR VOTERS (THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE!).""

It's not the first time Trump and Vance have downplayed the chances of a national ban. But people have zero reason to trust them: A federal abortion ban is absolutely on the table. From the top of the presidential ticket on down, Republicans are using condescending language eerily similar to what conservatives said in past elections: that Democrats and women, especially, are fear-mongering about a federal ban and are being hysterical.

At a Sept. 23 rally in Pennsylvania, Trump said that ""all [Democrats] can talk about is abortion and it really no longer pertains"" because, he claims, abortion is a state issue and ""a vote of the people."" In a bit of wishcasting, Trump added that if he wins, women ""will no longer be thinking about abortion."" That line was a rehash of another deranged, all-caps Truth Social post from three days earlier -- his repetition of this message shows how desperate he is for voters to believe the lie that abortion access won't get worse if they elect him.

During the presidential debate in September, Trump told moderator Linsey Davis that he ""won't have to"" veto a federal ban, because it would never pass Congress. That pat dismissal came after another answer in which Trump said Vance didn't know his stance on a nationwide law, and twice declined to say he'd veto a ban if it came to his desk.

Since that debate, Vance has parroted the line that congressional action was highly unlikely and really dialed up the dismissiveness -- stopping just short of calling women crazy. He told NBC News' Kristen Welker that a federal abortion ban was ""kind of a ridiculous hypothetical,"" adding that it would get about 10 votes in the Senate. When pressed by Welker, Vance said that Trump ""thinks it's ridiculous to talk about vetoing a piece of legislation that isn't going to come before the president in the first place.""

Ohio GOP Senate candidate Bernie Moreno made explicit what Vance kept implicit: At a Sept. 20 town hall, Moreno said suburban women are ""crazy"" for being single issue voters on abortion. Other Republicans have stuck to minimizing voters' concerns. Trump ally and battleground member of Congress, Florida GOP Rep. Anna Paulina Luna claimed: ""The Supreme Court said, as a federal legislator, that my opinion on the matter doesn't really matter."" Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., made a similar argument. Nowhere did the court say that Congress can't pass abortion laws. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, suggested that such a bill wouldn't pass: ""Thinking about the politics, it doesn't seem like that's really on the table.""

All this dodging is reminiscent of conservatives' dismissive reassurances in years past when they said Roe would never be overturned. Then-Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., notoriously said in 2018 that women protesting the Brett Kavanaugh nomination were engaging in ""hysteria."" It was ""absurd,"" he argued, to suggest that the Supreme Court would overturn Roe and women would die as a result. Supreme Court architect Leonard Leo told Fox News even before Kavanaugh was chosen that Democrats only talked about the fall of Roe as a ""scare tactic"" to mobilize base voters.

Trump himself famously claimed in a September 2020 debate that neither Joe Biden nor anyone watching could possibly know how his nominee Amy Coney Barrett would rule on Roe. ""There's nothing happening there,"" Trump said. ""You don't know her view."" (This is the same man who, in 2016, said he would only appoint anti-abortion justices and that Roe would be overturned ""automatically."") Just months after that debate, the court took up an abortion case out of Mississippi and, about a year later, Roe was gone -- with Barrett voting to overturn it.

Another telling debate moment, about the very meaning of the word ""ban,"" epitomized the Republicans' shell game. When the moderators asked Vance about his past support for a 15-week abortion ban, he claimed the proposal wasn't a ban but rather a ""minimum national standard."" Maybe Trump and Vance believe ""ban"" means a total abortion ban but make no mistake: A federal ban at any gestation would override state laws, in direct contradiction to their ""states' rights"" argument. Even more chilling, a second Trump administration could also enact a national ban by enforcing the 19th-century Comstock Act, which could ban abortion pills nationwide, if not all procedures.

Two years ago, a nearly 50-year precedent Republicans had argued was safe was overturned. Now, women are bleeding in hospital parking lots, losing fallopian tubes and, yes, dying. Obscenely yet predictably, they're trying to tell women reporters and women voters across the country that everything is fine but we know it's not. Vance is right that people don't trust Republicans on abortion and they shouldn't."
Amber Thurman's family slams GOP on abortion again after Vance equivocates at debate,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/amber-thurman-abortion-republicans-vance-debate-rcna173630,2024-10-02T18:52:20Z,"""Amber Thurman should still be alive,"" Vance said, as he defended the very circumstances that led to her preventable death in 2022.

On the debate stage Tuesday night, Sen. JD Vance found himself agreeing with his opponent, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, that a woman who died from abortion complications in 2022 due to Georgia's draconian abortion ban should still be alive.

""Governor, I agree with you,"" the Republican vice presidential nominee said. ""Amber Thurman should still be alive -- and there are a lot of people who should still be alive -- and I certainly wish that she was.""

Vance's acknowledgement that Thurman's death was preventable and his expressed desire for the GOP to ""earn people's trust back"" on abortion doesn't square with Republican lawmakers actively restricting people's ability to make such choices for themselves. After the debate, Thurman's family issued a statement condemning the GOP for ""seek[ing] to further restrict women's access to necessary healthcare under the false guise of protection.""

""Amber's tragic death was a direct result of Georgia's archaic and dangerously restrictive abortion laws, which denied her the life-saving care she so desperately needed,"" Thurman's family said. ""We are grieving an unimaginable loss that no family should have to endure.""

In the debate, Vance said that the American people ""just don't trust"" Republicans when it comes to abortion, and that he wanted the GOP to become ""pro-family in the fullest sense of the word."" He also claimed that he has never supported a federal abortion ban (Vance did, however, say as recently as 2022 that he ""would like abortion to be illegal nationally"") and defended the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

After lamenting Thurman's death, Vance immediately went on to talk about ""partial birth abortion,"" a highly misleading political term that refers to an abortion that happens later in pregnancy. He also asserted that allowing states to impose their own abortion laws is the right thing to do, despite that being exactly the circumstance that led to Thurman's death."

""I got a 17-year-old, and he witnessed a shooting at a community center playing volleyball. Those things don't leave you,"" Walz said, eliciting a response of ""awful"" from Vance.

The answer from Walz on shootings began a portion of largely positive reactions from viewers of the debate as Walz explained his stance on gun safety measures, according to Fox News dials of Republican, Democratic and Independent voters that measured their responses to the candidates answers in real time.

""I'm a hunter. I own firearms. The vice president is -- we understand that the Second Amendment is there, but our first responsibility is to our kids to figure this out,"" Walz said, eliciting an increasingly positive response from Independent and Democratic voters while Republicans remained mostly in the middle.

All three groups of voters showed an increasingly positive response to Walz's remarks as he acknowledged Vance in a rare bipartisan moment.

""I 100% believe that Sen. Vance hates it when these kids... it's abhorrent, and it breaks your heart. I agree with that, but that's not far enough when we know there's things that work,"" Walz said.

Independent and Republican voters also started to have a positive response when Vance was given the opportunity to respond to Walz's remarks, with the Ohio senator calling it ""awful"" that the Minnesota governor's son witnessed a shooting.

""Tim, first of all, I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting, and I'm sorry about that. Christ have mercy,"" Vance said, receiving a heartfelt thank you from Walz while garnering a positive response from voters."

Jones visited Steak 'N Egger restaurant in Muskegon after Tuesday night's CBS News Vice Presidential Debate, where many watchers gave Vance the advantage over Walz.

""[Walz] did terrible in many respects, but he is just honest and truthful also. He doesn't know what he's talking about and he kind of admitted it,"" one voter said.

Another voter said Walz appeared ""too nervous.""

""[Walz is] phony. He's too plastic. He doesn't know the topics like Vance.""

A few voters at the diner, however, defended Walz's performance and argued the Democrat won the pair's only debate showdown.

""[Walz is] very articulate. He knows his facts,"" one woman said. ""JD Vance totally switched the script last night. He told untruths. He flipped the switch. He lied throughout the whole entire debate last night. What he said was untrue - his stance on abortion, his stance on housing, his stance on the finance - everything was was not true.""

The woman conceded that Vance's ""experience on public stages"" may have impacted the number of voters and pundits giving the senator the win.

Tuesday's debate covered a variety of subjects ranging from immigration to climate change to abortion as the two lesser known politicians sought to make their introductions to American voters before Election Day.

One Michigan voter said she is voting for Vice President Kamala Harris because she likes the idea that ""we get to vote every four years instead of, 'if you vote me in, you won't ever have to vote again.'""

Another woman voiced her support for Trump ""because he's for America, and he's for me. And he's for the unborn child.""

""If you are for the person who cannot defend themselves, then you are for the rest of us,"" she said. ""And if you don't care about those that are not able to defend themselves, you certainly aren't going to be in charge of us or care for us.""

Does Project 2025 Plan A 'Registry Of Pregnancies'? What To Know After Walz Slams Abortion Plan,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/02/does-project-2025-plan-a-registry-of-pregnancies-what-to-know-after-walz-slams-abortion-plan/,2024-10-02T16:55:47Z,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz claimed at Tuesday's vice presidential debate that the right-wing policy agenda Project 2025 calls for a ""registry of pregnancies,"" repeating claims he's made on the campaign trail -- but that mischaracterizes the conservative proposal, which wants states to report detailed abortion, though not pregnancy, information to the government.

Vice President Kamala Harris described Project 2025's proposal more accurately in her speech at the Democratic National Convention, decrying that Republicans want to ""force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions.""

In addition to monitoring abortions in a more comprehensive way, Project 2025's proposal also calls for the CDC to stop collecting data on gender identity -- part of a broader move away from the federal government supporting transgender rights -- claiming that collecting that data ""legitimizes"" arguments in favor of transgender rights ""and encourages the phenomenon of ever-multiplying subjective identities.""

Project 2025's policy agenda -- which broadly calls for a total overhaul of the executive branch if former President Donald Trump wins the election -- is overwhelmingly opposed to abortion, proposing a total focus by the federal government to push a pro-family agenda that rejects abortion rights. The agenda says HHS should be known as the ""Department of Life"" by ""explicitly rejecting the notion that abortion is health care"" and having a mission statement that protects Americans' well-being ""from conception to natural death."" Project 2025 broadly calls for restricting abortion, suggesting the Food and Drug Administration should rescind its approval of abortion drug mifepristone and the federal government should start enforcing the Comstock Act, a long-dormant 19th century law that would ban abortion pills and any abortion equipment from being sent through the mail.

It's unclear if Trump would take up Project 2025's proposals on abortion or other issues if he's elected. The ex-president has sought to distance himself from Project 2025 and its policy proposals as they've come under controversy, though he does have ties to the Heritage Foundation -- the group spearheading the agenda -- and could always take up its proposals if elected regardless of what he says while campaigning. Trump has said he wants to leave abortion up to the states and said he opposes a national abortion ban, but has not commented on any federal reporting of abortions in states where it is allowed. Vance, who has strong links to the Heritage Foundation, said only at the debate that ""certainly we won't"" create a ""federal pregnancy monitoring agency,"" but did not comment beyond that on any increased surveillance of abortions. Vance has called for banning abortion nationwide in the past -- even as he denied doing so at Tuesday's debate -- but has more recently said he backs Trump's view that it should be left to the states.

625,978. That's the number of U.S. abortions that were reported to the CDC in 2021, the most recent year for which data is available. The CDC already requests data including the pregnant person's age, state of residence, gestational age of the fetus, race, marital status, method of abortion and number of previous births and abortions, though Project 2025's proposals would add more data like why people got abortions and impose consequences if states don't report the data. The CDC's most recent data is from before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and states started banning the procedure, though reports from non-governmental organizations suggest abortion rates have actually gone up despite the restrictions.

Polling shows that most Americans are broadly in favor of abortion rights and the issue has historically galvanized voters since the Supreme Court's June 2022 ruling, with a series of ballot measures all breaking in favor of abortion rights and races in which abortion has been a big focus often breaking in favor of Democrats. Trump has tried to minimize the issue and said he now supports leaving abortion rights up to states after previously floating support for a national 15-week ban, and Vance, who previously touted his anti-abortion views on his website prior to becoming Trump's nominee, has downplayed them since getting on the ticket. The senator said Tuesday he acknowledges Republicans have ""to do so much better of a job at earning the American People's trust back on this issue, where they frankly just don't trust us."" Democrats and the Harris campaign have also used Project 2025 as a key argument against Trump, repeatedly pointing to its extreme proposals as a key reason for voters to oppose the ex-president and insisting he will carry out its plans even as Trump has tried to distance himself."
"WATCH: Voters react in real time to key Vance-Walz debate moments on immigration, democracy, abortion",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/watch-voters-react-real-time-key-vance-walz-debate-moments-immigration-democracy-abortion,2024-10-02T16:27:52Z,"Fox News Digital ranks the top five memorable moments from the 2024 Vice Presidential Debate between Senator JD Vance and Governor Tim Walz.

A Fox News Digital focus group of Republicans, Democrats and independents reacted to key moments from the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate between Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday night, offering real-time responses to the candidates' statements.

In a focus group hosted by Lee Carter, participants across the political spectrum used dials showing their favorable, unfavorable or neutral responses to Vance and Walz. Their reactions gave insights into how the voters who will help decide the election felt about the demeanor, character and policies of the two men, one of whom will be the next vice president.

Here are some of the most significant voter reactions from Tuesday night's focus group.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

Vance's argument that the U.S. needed to ""stop the bleeding"" at the border during Tuesday's debate elicited a mixed response from voters.

Vance received mixed responses when he said, ""Before we talk about deportations, we have to stop the bleeding... we have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies.""

While Republican views of Vance's answers had an immediate positive response, Democratic viewers of the debate went in an opposite direction, the dials showed. Independents, meanwhile, hovered around a neutral response to Vance's answer.

Voters began to see Vance's response in a more positive light when he touched on former President Trump's border policies, arguing that the next administration should return to handling the border similar to how Trump did during his four years in office.

Democrats and independents reacted moderately-to-highly favorable to Walz's rejoinder on the migrant crisis and his criticism of the Trump administration.

Walz touted the bipartisan immigration bill that Trump pushed to kill earlier this year and defended Kamala Harris' record in California on the issue. Republicans were unfavorable to Walz but independents and Democrats gave him high marks throughout his answer.

""Pass the bill, she'll sign it,"" Walz said.

Republican, Democrat and independent voters reacted differently when Vance stated that he and Trump support ""clean air, clean water"" when climate change was brought up at the debate.

""Look, a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns. I think it's important for us, first of all, to say, Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water. We want the environment to be cleaner and safer,"" Vance said.

The Fox News Debate Dial showed support among independents and Democrats dipping downward when Vance made that statement. Support among Republicans remained fairly consistent.

But support among independent viewers began to rise again when Vance referenced how Democrats bring up carbon emissions when discussing climate change.

""This idea that carbon emissions drives all of the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true just for the sake of argument. So we're not arguing about weird science. Let's just say that's true,"" Vance said. ""Well, if you believe that, what would you -- would you want to do? The answer is that you'd want to restore as much American manufacturing as possible, and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world.""

One of Walz's most difficult moments at the debate received poor to middling reviews across the board from the focus group.

Moderators confronted Walz on his prior claim that he was present at the Tiananmen Square protests in Hong Kong in 1989, when he didn't travel to Asia until later that year. Walz gave a meandering answer that showed sub-par responses from Democrats, Republicans and independents almost throughout his entire comment, which didn't directly address the discrepancy.

At one point, he admitted he could be a ""knucklehead."" He eventually admitted he'd misspoke.

Walz's support among Republicans dipped to its lowest point - under 10% - when he said former President Donald Trump would have benefited from participating in one of his China trips, arguing Trump would never have befriended Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Despite CBS announcing that it would not allow live fact-checking during the debate, moderator Margaret Brennan interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming public resources in Springfield, Ohio.

Independent and Republican voters disapproved of the interjection, but independent voters dipped significantly when Vance began explaining his stance.

Independents were mixed, while Republicans were highly favorable of Vance saying he was ""wrong"" about Trump in the past when confronted about his past criticism of his running mate.

""Sometimes, of course, I've disagreed with the president, but I've also been extremely open about the fact that I was wrong about Donald Trump. I was wrong, first of all, because I believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record,"" Vance said.

When Walz was asked whether he supports abortion up until the ninth month as Minnesota is one of the least restrictive states for abortion, he responded, ""That's not what the bill says.""

While Republican voters dipped significantly as Walz spoke, independent and Democratic voters stayed mostly in the approval zone.

""What we did is restore Roe v. Wade, we made sure that we put women in charge of their health care,"" Walz said.

Independents dipped slightly in approval while Democratic voters shot up during his statement. The two eventually evened out and stayed in the approval zone.

""This is a basic human right,"" he later said.

The independent voters stayed slightly under the Democratic approval line, as Republicans significantly disapproved.

Vance received a positive reaction across the board from Democrats, Republicans and Independents when he told Walz he was sorry his son was once a witness to a shooting.

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting, and I'm sorry about that,"" the senator told Walz.

Independents gave Vance an immediate low rating when he said he was focused on the future after Walz asked him if Trump lost the 2020 election.

Republicans on the Fox News Debate Dial had been unimpressed with Walz's line of questioning and the dial went down, with the approval staying generally the same with Vance's answers, but the dials for independents and Democrats took a sharp dive as Vance brushed off the question. It dove the sharpest among independents.

Liberal media pundits repeatedly played and discussed the clip in the debate's aftermath, saying it was one of Walz's strongest moments in a night that Vance otherwise controlled.

Trump says Walz 'embarrassed himself' compared to Vance's 'brilliance' at VP debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-walz-embarrassed-himself-compared-vances-brilliance-vp-debate,2024-10-02T16:05:42Z,"EXCLUSIVE: Former President Trump said Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz ""embarrassed himself"" during Tuesday night's vice presidential debate, while Sen. JD Vance's steady presentation ""reconfirmed"" his choice to make the senator from Ohio his running mate.

Trump spoke exclusively with Fox News Digital on Wednesday morning, hours after Vance, R-Ohio, and Walz faced off in the CBS News vice presidential debate in New York City. The two sparred on issues like foreign policy, border security, abortion and climate change, while introducing themselves and their records to the American people.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

""JD was fantastic last night -- it just reconfirmed my choice,"" Trump told Fox News Digital. ""There was a brilliance to what he did.""

""On the other hand, Tim Walz proved to be a man that doesn't have it in any way shape or form for the office that he is seeking, though I would put him a large number of steps above Kamala,"" Trump said.

The former president and Republican presidential nominee said Walz ""embarrassed himself and the Democrat Party last night but was made to look even worse by JD's brilliant performance.""

""This is what the country needs; smart people, not people that can't put two sentences together,"" Trump said. ""We have to take our country back.""

Vice presidential debates are traditionally seen as second-tier, but with Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris unlikely to debate again before voters cast their ballots on Nov. 5, the stakes were raised for their running mates as they attempted to tackle the most important issues facing the nation.

CBS News anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan moderated the debate in New York City Tuesday night, which was filled with more substantive policy discussion than personal jabs. Tuesday began with nearly 50,000 unionized dockworkers going on strike from Maine to Texas and ended with Iran launching its largest attack on Israel in history, firing nearly 250 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State.

The first question for Walz and Vance was whether they would support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran.

A visibly shaky Walz had a rough start to the debate, pausing and stumbling over his words as he spoke about the need for ""steady leadership"" from the White House. Instead of answering the question, Walz took a shot at Trump.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz said, pointing to Trump's debate performance against Harris last month. ""It's clear, and the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago. A nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment.""

But Vance, in his first answer, defended Trump, saying he ""delivered stability to the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence.""

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""People were afraid of stepping out of line,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States' global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.""

As for a preemptive strike, Vance said, ""It is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe. And we should support our allies wherever they are, when they're fighting the bad guys.""

Walz fired back. He slammed the Trump administration for pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, saying Iran is ""closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership,"" adding Harris is providing ""steady leadership.""

""You blame Donald Trump, but who has been the vice president for the last 3½ years? And the answer is, your running mate, not mine,"" Vance said.

Vance, again defending Trump, saying he ""consistently made the world more secure.""

""Gov. Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump has already done it once before.""

Vance also urged voters to ask themselves, ""When was the last time that an American president didn't have a major conflict break out?""

""The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was president,"" Vance said.

The debate shifted to the ongoing crisis at the southern border, a top issue for voters.

Vance said he has already been to the border more than ""border czar"" Kamala Harris, while touting Trump's plan to secure the border.

But Walz blasted Trump for his alleged efforts to get Republicans to vote against a border bill.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

""As soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this, Donald Trump said no, told [lawmakers] to vote against it, because it gives him a campaign issue,"" Walz said. ""What would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things?""

On the same topic, moderators asked Vance whether he and Trump would support family separation as part of Trump's proposed ""mass deportation"" should he be elected.

""We have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost,"" Vance explained. ""Some of them have been sex trafficking. Some of them, hopefully, are at homes with their families.

""Some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules. The real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris' wide open southern border. And I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, she said she was going to do this. Real leadership would be saying, 'You know what, I screwed up. We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border policies.' I wish that she would do that. It would be good for all of us.""

As for the issue of abortion, another top issue for voters this cycle, Walz maintained that he and Harris are pro-choice, while Vance said Republicans need to ""do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they, frankly, just don't trust us.""

""And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us, as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies,"" Vance said. ""I want to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family. And I think there's so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options right now."""

A majority of the 13 columnists and contributors polled by The New York Times agreed that JD Vance won the debate against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday night.

Multiple New York Times columnists, including Binyamin Appelbaum, said that Vance was overall effective in his presentation on the debate stage. Seven of the columnists and contributors said that Vance defeated Walz in the debate, with two saying that the face-off was a draw and three writers concluding that Walz won.

""He made Trumpism sound polite, calm and coherent,"" Appelbaum said of Vance.

GOP LAWMAKERS, LEADERS REACT TO VANCE, WALZ DEBATE: 'SPITTING COLD, HARD TRUTH'

""Vance was far nimbler than the nervous Tim Walz, especially in the first half of the debate. But as the debate went on, Vance stumbled on two issues -- abortion and the 2020 election -- where his rhetorical skill could not salvage the very unappealing material he was working with,"" Josh Barro, author of the newsletter Very Serious, wrote.

""Walz won,"" Times columnist Charles M. Blow wrote. ""You could tell that he was a teacher, because he clearly did his homework. Anyone afraid that Vance would roll over him could breathe easily.""

Newsletter writer Matt Labash said that ""Nobody truly dominated.""

""But I'm giving the slight edge to Walz, since Vance embarrassingly soft-pedaled Jan. 6 and Trump posted this to Truth Social during the debate: 'More Notes! Why Can't Walz just remember what he has to say? Low IQ!' Reminding us that Vance's boss should watch more Hallmark Channel, less Newsmax.""

VANCE, WALZ FACE OFF ON BORDER, CLIMATE CHANGE AND ABORTION DURING VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Other writers said that the debate outcome was more even.

Contributing Times Opinion writer Jane Coaston wrote that ""Vance seemed smoother and more practiced, but 'won' is a very strong term here.""

Times columnist Gail Collins said that the debate was a ""draw"" because ""Walz was so bad in much of his delivery. Vance was a much more forceful speaker while spewing lies on everything from abortion to Biden's foreign policy.""

Contributing Times opinion writer Peter Wehner said that Vance proved he was ""sharp and in command and ... an excellent debater.""

""At times he tried too hard to appear likable; I came away more convinced that he's a hollow man, radioactive and incendiary one day, conciliatory and agreeable the next,"" Wehner said. ""But the 'good Vance' did a lot to repair his tattered image.""

Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital, ""Senator JD Vance completely dominated the debate and showed why we need to return President Trump to the White House."" He added that Trump's vice presidential nominee ""gave clear answers how the Trump-Vance ticket will turn around our economy, secure our southern border, make our streets safe once again, and restore peace in the Middle East.""

Cheung continued by saying that Vance ""exposed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz for being failed, radical leftists who are all slogans with zero substance.""

""He called out Kamala Harris for destroying our southern border. He called out Harris for creating the record inflation making life unaffordable for millions of Americans. And he called out Harris for enabling Iran, leading to the current attacks on Israel,"" the spokesman added.

Collapse Of Reproductive Rights In America On Exhibit In Dallas,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chaddscott/2024/10/02/collapse-of-reproductive-rights-in-america-on-exhibit-in-dallas/,2024-10-02T14:04:32Z,"Artists from around the South brought together to share stories of a national healthcare crisis.

Tens of millions of Americans found themselves asking that question in spring 2022 when news leaked that the Supreme Court would be throwing out 50 years of supposedly settled law and overturning the Roe v. Wade decision guaranteeing women access to abortion nationwide.

Dallas-based curators Emily Edwards and Sara Hignite were among those in disbelief.

Is it Real? Yes It Is! (1969), the title of Juanita McNeely's multi-panel painting depicting her harrowing illegal abortion experience in the permanent collection and presently on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.

The feeling and artwork gave name to an unprecedented exhibition from Edwards and Hignite, the first organized and mounted in the American South directly addressing abortion access and reproductive rights. The pair has assembled more than 30 artists, most from or connected to the South-where reproductive rights have suffered their greatest assault-most representing marginalized communities-those most at risk from the politicians' and judges' anti-woman cruelties.

Like 28-year-old Amber Nicole Thurman, a Black woman from Georgia who died during childbirth from a preventable infection after being denied life-saving healthcare by the state's draconian abortion laws. Art curators work their entire lives hoping shows intersect with current events, capturing lighting in a bottle, drawing crowds and media attention. Not in this case.

In the case of ""Is It Real? Contemporary Artists Address Reproductive Freedom,"" it's ""ripped from the headlines"" feel represents tragedy. Ongoing tragedy. Needless tragedy.

""The United States is experiencing a reproductive care emergency across the board, and the worst states are in the South, and that's why this exhibition is based in the South,"" Hignite told Forbes.com. ""That's why we're featuring and focusing on artists who have connections to the southern states. If you look at the numbers, potentially every state in the South has a ban on abortion because you've either got total bans or six-week bans. We're living it every single day.""

""Is it Real"" opens at Lagoon Studio in Dallas (1105 Lagoon Drive, Dallas, TX, 75207) on October 5 and runs through October 26, 2024, nine days before Election Day in America.

The symbolism of debuting the presentation in Dallas-where Roe v. Wade was first argued in 1970 before reaching the Supreme Court in 1973-and in Texas-where dogma and control trump safety for pregnant women-is not lost on the curators.

""Is it Real"" examines strategies contemporary artists employ to address the topic of reproductive freedom. Leading with empathy and fact, and challenging often deeply rooted misinformation, the exhibition seeks to destigmatize and humanize reproductive care.

""By transporting people who are experiencing the show into so many different perspectives, into, quite literally, the shoes of some of the experiences, (visitors) are able to see how multifaceted this reproductive freedom crisis is,"" Edwards told Forbes.com. ""(The artists) help foster empathy by rooting (issues) in emotion and in beauty.""

That's what artists can do. They can't wave a magic wand and change laws, but they can change minds.

""Sarah and I both believe in the soft power of art,"" Edwards added. ""If someone comes in and they want to protest the work, they're likely not leaving being like, 'I'm going to vote blue,' but there's a softening that happens, and I think that's the hope for everyone who comes in here who is either on the fence, isn't sure, maybe is not an activist, maybe is just not informed on these issues. I've seen people soften, including my own parents who do not view this topic the same way I do. They've come to every show, and I see them soften, and I see them care, and I see them ask questions, and those questions turn into people changing their minds over time.""

Minds do change. Ballot initiatives related to abortion access nationwide since the repeal of Roe have overwhelmingly gone in favor of more access.

""I have had conversations with people who have started having conversations with family members and friends or people in their community who didn't believe in the right to abortion and maybe we're moving the needle now as they're hearing about this project,"" Hignite said. ""I don't want to overstate it. Obviously, this exhibition is not changing the landscape of abortion access in the country, but if we can just start cracking the window to the idea of coming around to believing in everyone's right to self-determination and bodily autonomy, then we will be so proud.""

While abortion access draws most of the headlines in the contemporary struggle for reproductive rights in America, it's not the only issue, nor the only issue approached in the exhibition.

""It's about the mortality rate of pregnant women, particularly Black women,"" Edwards said. ""It's about rape and sexual assault. It's about trans men who are also experiencing these experiences, and so having these different stories coming together in the show that really all interwoven to show how widespread this is, how this impacts everyone.""

Maternal mortality is on the rise in America. Black women, Native American and Alaska Native people suffer disproportionately. The South, of course, leads the way. Restrictive abortion policies have always gone hand-in-hand with higher maternal mortality. Not that anywhere in America can brag. America ranks 55 globally for maternal mortality, worst of any developed nation.

Broadly speaking, the U.S. is experiencing a reproductive care emergency. From proposed total bans on abortion-including in the case of rape and incest-to threats against birth control, Plan B, and IVF. Abortion access serves as the flash point for a frightening regression of not only reproductive care in America, a subject always impacting women more gravely, but also a frightening regression in how women are viewed, treated, and respected societally.

In November, 70 million or so Americans will vote for Donald Trump for president. He was found liable for rape. His running mate J.D. Vance has verbalized insulting, denigrating, dehumanizing opinions related to women across a spectrum of subjects over many years that would have been cringe-worthy in the 1960s. Comments that would have immediately disqualified a candidate for local office, let alone national office, just 10 years ago.

""Is It Real?"" exposes the harsh realities of the current political climate and envisions a more just country in which every human has the basic right to control their own body and determine their own future.

That hardly seems radical, but in 2024, in Dallas, in Texas, across the South, it is. An advertising poster for the show featuring a Guerrilla Girls Broadband artwork was banned from Dallas Rapid Transit rail stations.

That's why Edwards and Hignite chose to finance and present their project themselves, not in a museum.

""We didn't have to worry about any of the institutional challenges and bureaucracy,"" Hignite explained. ""We wanted to make sure that we could fully realize our curatorial vision, and we decided early on that the best way to do that was to do it independently.""

Why JD Vance's 'fact-checking flashpoint' in the debate mattered,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vances-fact-checking-flashpoint-debate-mattered-rcna173588,2024-10-02T13:23:12Z,"The Ohio senator spent much of the vice presidential debate brazenly lying. No wonder he grew agitated in response to a brief fact-check from a moderator.

About a third of the way into the vice presidential debate, the discussion turned to Springfield, Ohio -- a community torn apart by a racist and false conspiracy theory promoted by the both members of the Republican Party's presidential ticket. It was against this backdrop that Sen. JD Vance, who ostensibly represents the city, referred to ""millions of illegal immigrants"" and parts of the country that have been ""destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border.""

The Republican senator was peddling a multi-layered lie: The border isn't ""open""; the vice president isn't responsible for the nation's immigration laws; and Springfield's Haitian immigrants entered the country legally. Indeed, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic nominee, took the opportunity to note that his rival had ""vilified a large number of people who were here legally.""

At that point, one of the debate's moderators, CBS News' Margaret Brennan, told viewers, ""To clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio, does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status.""

The GOP nominee was not having it. The New York Times referred to it as the debate's ""fact-checking flashpoint,"" and NBC News' report summarized it this way:

""The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" the senator complained.

In reality, even that wasn't quite true: As the Times' report noted, CBS News executives had indicated ahead of the event ""that the moderators may choose to clarify a fuzzy point if they determined it had been left unclear.""

Or put another way, Vance lied about fact-checking after having lied about immigration policy.

But the on-air clash had a larger significance. The Ohio Republican wasn't upset because the debate moderators were wrong; he was upset because the debate moderators were telling the public the truth.

And as Vance made clear over the course of the evening, telling the truth simply wasn't part of his debate strategy.

Much of the post-event analysis has focused on the fact that the young senator appeared polished, smooth, and well-prepared for much of the debate, while Walz, who missed some opportunities, seemed nervous and at times unsteady. Those assessments are largely fair. But more important than the GOP candidate's presentation and style was the fact that he spent much of the evening peddling an alternate reality with little resemblance to the real world.

I recently wrote a book about Republican efforts to rewrite recent history, and even I was amazed at Vance's brazenness when it came to waging war against the recent past.

The GOP nominee lied about Trump and the Affordable Care Act. He lied about the ""peaceful"" transfer of power after Trump's 2020 defeat. He lied about his earlier support for a national abortion ban. He lied about his party's regressive 2017 tax breaks. This is a small sampling from a much longer list of obvious falsehoods.

A separate New York Times analysis said Vance showed ""a knack for revising history,"" which was a polite way of saying the senator spent the evening lying to the electorate about matters large and small. A Washington Post report added that Vance ""dominated on the falsehood meter.""

No wonder he seemed quite agitated about moderators telling the truth: The Republican was busy trying to pull a con on the American electorate, and the CBS News anchors were interfering with his scam.

A couple of weeks ago, Vance conceded that he's willing to ""create stories"" to advance his goals. It was hard not to think of this line during this year's only vice presidential debate."

Media critics pan Walz's 'unsteady' debate performance: 'Clear lack of preparation and execution',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/media-critics-pan-walzs-debate-performance-clear-lack-preparation-execution,2024-10-02T09:07:34Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Members of the legacy media appear to agree that Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz underperformed at the CBS News Vice Presidential debate.

""I think there was a clear lack of preparation and execution on Walz's part,"" CNN anchor Abby Phillip said.

ABC News' Linsey Davis called out Walz's ""uncomfortable, cringey moments,"" linking his debate performance to President Biden's disastrous showing at the CNN debate.

""It kind of reminded me of the June 27 debate when Kamala Harris said that night of Joe Biden 'It was a slow start but a strong finish.' And that's how I felt that Tim Walz kind of did tonight,"" Davis said.

""Dems are fortunate presidential debates tend to matter a lot more than VP debates,"" Cook Political Report senior editor Dave Wasserman reacted on X.

JD VANCE REMINDS CBS MODERATORS OF DEBATE RULES AFTER THEY TRY TO FACT-CHECK HIM

""Where is the Tim Walz who went viral going after 'weird' Republicans? Not showing up on that debate stage so far tonight..."" New Yorker staff writer Susan Glasser posted.

""Gov. Walz is not prosecuting the case rather its a nicefest. If you agree with Vance on so much then why should we vote for you?"" MSNBC host Symone Sanders Townsend asked the governor. ""Sen. Vance is giving revisionist history on Trump's agenda & what they would do & b/c the moderators are not fact checking...it sounds sane.""

""Walz's answers are smart and substantive. But I hate to say it, the delivery is a bit off -- he's just not as engaging as he often is. Hoping he gets a little more energetic and less nervous as this goes on,"" liberal columnist Jill Filipovic said.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

Others made it clear that Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio was the clear winner of the night.

""I would rate that the most successful Republican debate performance of this century, eclipsing Romney in the first debate with Obama in 2012,"" New York Times columnist Ross Douthat said.

""Vance is going home tonight with Walz's wallet. Vance didn't even have to snatch it, Walz just handed it over, along with a bunch of unearned compliments to Vance's fine character,"" The Atlantic's David Frum concluded.

""Vance is winning the debate. He is clearly the best debater of the 4 candidates running for president or vice president. His abortion answer/pivot was masterful,"" former CNN editor-at-large Chris Cillizza said. ""Walz has been fine -- but uneven. His answer on the lie that he was in China during Tiananmen Square was AWFUL.""

""Malpractice that Walz didn't have a sharp, succinct answer to the Tiananmen Square question ready to go,"" The Atlantic writer Tim Alberta similarly noted.

""I say this with love: Democrats are too dependent on friendly treatment from the moderators,"" Washington Post columnist Megan McArdle reacted to Alberta's comment.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

Some critics knocked Walz's lack of media exposure leading to his fumbling performance.

""I think the lack of interviews he has done with national media, with local media, it showed,"" said CNN anchor Dana Bash, the only journalist who has interviewed Walz since he joined the Democratic ticket.

""I think that Walz did seem unsteady,"" ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl said. ""And frankly, what I saw is somebody who has not faced questions on a national stage since he became the Democratic nominee. He was simply out of practice. I mean, I don't know why they've done it, but they've kept him out of the limelight. They've kept him away from reporters. They haven't had him do any interviews. And he was clearly unsteady through much of that debate. In contrast, J.D. Vance was very smooth.""

""Hate to say it but Walz would have benefitted from doing a few Sunday morning shows, as Vance has been,"" Financial Times associate editor Edward Luce said.

MSNBC's Rachel Maddow perhaps offered a more charitable take on the debate.

""I wouldn't describe them as evenly matched because they are so different, so different in style and so different on substance,"" Maddow told her MSNBC colleagues. ""I think the big picture takeaway in this is that one of these candidates is much slicker than the other, much more practiced, kind of professional debate style speaker, and the other candidate won."""
Top 5 moments from only VP debate between Vance and Walz before election,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-5-moments-from-only-vp-debate-between-vance-walz-before-election,2024-10-02T08:11:29Z,"Fox News Digital ranks the top five memorable moments from the 2024 Vice Presidential Debate between Senator JD Vance and Governor Tim Walz.

Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., met face to face on Tuesday night in New York City for the only vice presidential debate before the election.

The event covered a variety of subjects ranging from immigration to climate change to abortion as the two lesser known politicians sought to make their introductions to American voters before election day.

Here are the top moments from the debate:

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

After CBS News' Margaret Brennan offered an impromptu fact-check in response to Vance describing cities being overwhelmed by illegal immigration, noting that many Haitians in Springfield, Ohio have been granted a legal status, Vance hit back at her for violating the terms of the debate.

""Margaret, the rules were that you are not going to fact-check. And since you're fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" he said. ""So there's an application called the CBP one app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand.""

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

Vance told Walz that he was sorry to hear that his son had been witness to a shooting, in a moment of civility that was particularly frequent during the vice presidential debate. This civility has also been less and less common during presidential debates, which have proven contentious in recent election cycles.

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting, and I'm sorry about that,"" the senator told Walz.

JD VANCE REMINDS CBS MODERATORS OF DEBATE RULES AFTER THEY TRY TO FACT-CHECK HIM

""The American citizens have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border. It is a disgrace, Tim,"" Vance said during the debate.

""And I actually think I agree with you,"" the Ohio senator said, adding, ""I think you want to solve this problem.""

""But I don't think that Kamala Harris does.""

Walz claimed there would be ""a registry of pregnancies"" under what he said was Trump and Vance's Project 2025. The Project 2025 is an endeavor of conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation.

""It's going to make it more difficult, if not impossible, to get contraception and limit access, if not eliminate access, to infertility treatments,"" he said.

But Vance denied this claim. ""No, certainly we won't,"" he pushed back at the statement.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

Walz referred back to his notes in one answer on Tuesday night, after frequently scribbling down observations during the debate.

""Economists can't be trusted. Science can't be trusted. National security folks can't be trusted,"" he listed, referencing Vance's skepticism of those heralded as experts. ""Look, if you're going to be president, you don't have all the answers. Donald Trump believes he does.""

Even Trump poked fun at the noticeable amount of notes that the Minnesota governor was taking, writing on Truth Social, ""Walz is taking so many notes - Never seen a Candidate take more! He needs the notes to keep his brain intact."""

Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance took the same stage for their first and only vice presidential debate this election cycle on Tuesday evening, when the pair had a handful of fiery clashes over top voter concerns.

The CBS News Vice Presidential Debate showcased the two vice presidential candidates' platforms on issues such as the ongoing war raging in the Middle East, abortion laws and their respective tickets' economic records. Amid the 90-minute debate, Vance and Walz had a handful of clashes, including moderators turning off Vance's microphone.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

The CBS debate's rules included leaving microphones on for both candidates no matter who was speaking, breaking from the two presidential debates this cycle that muted microphones when a candidate was not speaking. The outlet, however, reserved the right to turn the microphones off if they felt it was warranted.

Moderators Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell did mute the pair Tuesday when Vance spoke up to complain that the moderators were trying to fact-check him on his remarks regarding illegal immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.

""The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border. It is a disgrace,"" Vance said referring to about immigration issues in a city in his home state.

After Vance and Walz both delivered responses regarding immigration, Brennan told viewers that Springfield ""does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status.""

Vance took issues with the on-air ""fact-check"" before he was muted.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS ADMITS FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP WAS BECAUSE CNN LET HIS STATEMENTS 'HANG' AT FIRST DEBATE

""The rules were that you were not going to fact-check, and since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" Vance said. ""So there's an application called the CBP. One app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand. That is not a person coming in. Applying for a green card and waiting for ten years.""

Moderators tried to quiet Vance before cutting his and Walz's mics.

""Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Margaret Brennan said. ""We have so much we want to get to.""

Walz was forced to answer questions regarding his travel to China during Tuesday night's debate.

Walz has said he was in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets, however, are now reporting that Walz actually did not travel to China until August of that year.

CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan asked Walz to explain the discrepancy.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""Look, I grew up in a small rural Nebraska town, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service,"" a visibly shaky Walz said. ""I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher.""

""I came back home and then started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams. We would take baseball teams. We would take dancers. And we would go back and forth to China,"" Walz said, noting the trips were ""to try and learn.""

""Look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community, and I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect,"" Walz continued.

""And I'm a knucklehead at times.""

Brennan pushed back, reminding Walz of the question and again asking him to explain the discrepancy.

""All I said on this was, as I got there that summer and misspoke on this,"" Walz said. ""So, I will just -- that's what I've said. So, I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests, went in and, from that, I learned a lot of what needed to be in in governance.""

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Walz claimed during the debate that a woman in Georgia likely died due to the state's ""restrictive"" abortion laws after Roe v. Wade was overturned, sparking a clash with Vance.

""There's a young woman named Amber Thurman. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurmond died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights, as basic as the right to control your own body, is determined on geography,"" Walz said during the debate while sparring with Vance on abortion laws.

""There's a very real chance that if Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe v. Wade,"" he said.

Walz's remarks come after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits after the women received chemically induced abortions in 2022.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

Vance shot back that a Minnesota abortion law does not require doctors to save a baby who survives an abortion.

""First of all, governor, I agree with you, Amber Thurman should still be alive, and there are a lot of people who should still be alive. And I certainly wish that she was. And maybe you're free to disagree with me on this and explain this to me. But as I read the Minnesota law that you signed into law, the statute that you signed into law, it says that a doctor who presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide lifesaving care to a baby who survives a botched late term abortion,"" he said.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

""That's not true,"" Walz said.

""Choice or not option that is fundamentally barbaric,"" Vance continued.

The pair also sparred over immigration a handful of times throughout the debate, including Vance slamming Vice President Kamala Harris for her handling of immigration.

""First of all, the gross majority of what we need to do to the southern border is just empowering law enforcement to do their job,"" Vance said during a discussion on the Haitian migrant surge in Springfield, Ohio, and immigration overall.

""I've been to the southern border more than our 'border czar' Kamala Harris has been. And it's actually heartbreaking because the Border Patrol agents, they just want to be empowered to do their job.""

Vance continued by saying that, ""of course, additional resources would help,"" but that the issue is mostly about the Biden administration not empowering law enforcement to say ""if you try to come across the border illegally, you've got to stay in Mexico"" and ""go back through proper channels.""

VANCE RIPS WALZ ON ECONOMY, SAYS HE'S FORCED TO 'PRETEND' TRUMP DIDN'T LOWER INFLATION

""Now, Gov. Walz brought up the community of Springfield, and he's very worried about the things that I've said in Springfield,"" Vance said. ""Look, in Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed. You've got hospitals that are overwhelmed. You've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.

Walz repeatedly argued Trump shut down a Senate immigration bill earlier this year that he believes would have made strengthened border security.

""It is law enforcement that asked for the bill,"" Walz said. ""They helped craft it. They're the ones that supported it. It was because they know we need to do this. Look, this issue of continuing to bring this up, of not dealing with it, of blaming migrants for everything.

""On housing, we could talk a little bit about Wall Street speculators buying up housing and making them less affordable, but it becomes a blame. Look, this bill also gives the money necessary to adjudicate. I agree it should not take seven years for an asylum claim to be done.""

""This bill gets it done in 90 days. Then, you start to make a difference in this, and you start to adhere to what we know, American principles. I don't talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about to the least amongst us, you do unto me. I think that's true of most Americans. They simply want order to it. This bill does it. It's funded. It's supported by the people who do it, and it lets us keep our dignity about how we treat other people.""

The pair of vice presidential candidates also sparred over the threat of censorship on Tuesday, as Walz pressed Vance on the 2020 election and Jan. 6, 2021.

""It's really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th, as we have done for 250 years in this country. We are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election,"" Vance said after Walz cited Jan. 6, when Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol.

""We have to remember that for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections. Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time, and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board. But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had, I don't buy that, governor,"" Vance continued.

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

Walz countered that ""Jan. 6 was not Facebook ads.""

""This idea that there's censorship to stop people from doing, threatening to kill someone, threatening to do something, that's not that's not censorship. Censorship is book banning. We've seen that. We've seen that brought up,"" he continued.

Walz continued that Trump has repeatedly claimed he won the 2020 presidential election.

""Did he lose the 2020 election?"" Walz asked Vance of Trump during the last election cycle.

""Tim, I'm focused on the future,"" Vance replied. ""Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 Covid situation?""

""That is a damning non-answer,"" Walz said. ""I'm pretty shocked by this. He lost the election. This is not a debate, it's not anything anywhere other than in Donald Trump's world.""

""It's a damning non-answer for you to not talk about censorship,"" Vance shot back.

""Tonight, Governor Walz showed exactly why Vice President Harris picked him: he is a leader who cares about the issues that matter most to the American people,"" Harris-Walz Campaign Chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a statement. ""In the debate, Americans got to see a real contrast: a straight talker focused on sharing real solutions, and a slick politician who spent the whole night defending Donald Trump's division and failures.""

""On every single issue - the economy, health care, foreign policy, reproductive freedom, gun violence - Governor Walz won. He spoke passionately about the Vice President's vision for a new way forward for the country. And in what was the most critical moment of the entire debate, which came in its final exchange, he stood up for our Constitution, while JD Vance admitted he'd put Trump ahead of the country.""

O'Malley Dillon continued, ""The choice facing the American people in November was on full display tonight: between charting a new way forward, or going backwards. Vice President Harris believes that the American people deserve to see her and Trump on the debate stage one more time. She will be in Atlanta on October 23 - Donald Trump should step up and face the voters.""

The Trump campaign said in a statement that Vance ""unequivocally won tonight's debate in dominating fashion"" in what was ""the best debate performance from any Vice-Presidential candidate in history.""

""Senator Vance spoke the truth, eloquently prosecuted the case against Kamala Harris' failed record, and effectively held Governor Tim Walz accountable for his lies on behalf of the Harris-Biden Administration,"" Trump senior advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said. ""Senator Vance also perfectly articulated the Trump-Vance vision to make America safe again with their plan to launch the largest mass deportation operation in history; to make America strong again with a peace through strength foreign policy agenda; and to make America wealthy again by cutting taxes, unleashing American energy dominance, and ending inflation.""

""Tonight, Senator Vance proved why President Trump chose him as his running mate. Together, they make the strongest and most dynamic presidential ticket ever, and they are going to win on November 5th."""
New Jersey Democrat proposes bill to create travel advisories to inform pregnant women of state abortion laws,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-jersey-democrat-proposes-bill-create-travel-advisories-inform-pregnant-women-state-abortion-laws,2024-10-02T07:37:38Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

A New Jersey Democrat introduced legislation establishing travel advisories informing women of restrictive abortion laws in other states they may be visiting.

The bill, proposed by state Sen. John Burzichelli, would require New Jersey's health and state departments to launch a website that would list color codes for states depending on how restrictive their abortion laws are, according to NJ Spotlight News.

""If you're an individual, a woman, traveling across this country for business -- or if you're thinking about going to school in Mississippi [for instance] -- it will help you to know what kind of medical services are available to you should you need emergency care of some kind,"" Burzichelli told the outlet.

The color codes under the ""Reproductive Health Travel Advisory"" are blue, yellow and red.

GEORGIA JUDGE OVERTURNS STATE'S SIX-WEEK 'HEARTBEAT' ABORTION LAW, CALLS IT 'UNCONSTITUTIONAL'

Blue would mean women can exercise normal caution and access to abortion would be available without fear of civil or criminal prosecution, and yellow would mean women should exercise increased caution as abortion restrictions could result in civil or criminal prosecution. Red would mean women are urged to reconsider travel because abortion access is extremely restricted and could result in medical issues and civil or criminal prosecution.

""Right now, there's no single place to go to say, 'OK I have to travel. I have to go to Texas and then move over and go to Tennessee,'"" Burzichelli said. ""You don't have that info at your fingertips. You can find it, but it's a hodge-podge.""

The proposal comes after the U.S. Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in 2022, returning the power to make laws on abortion access back to the states.

Following the ruling, a number of Republican-controlled states enacted laws restricting abortion access, with some exceptions such as in cases of medical emergencies, while some Democrat-controlled states have approved advanced protections of abortion access.

Vance vs. Walz debate: Top takeaways from VP candidates' face-off,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/vance-vs-walz-debate-top-takeaways-from-vp-candidates-face-off,2024-10-02T05:50:19Z,"In recent weeks, Tim Walz' team tried to lower expectations for his debate with rival JD Vance. Now we know why.

Democratic vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Walz did not turn in a disastrous performance on the debate stage, but he was clearly outclassed by Ohio Sen. Vance. Trump supporters who have questioned the young Ohio senator's qualifications for the nation's second-highest office, or asked why the former president chose him to be his running mate, slept better on Tuesday night. He was sharp, appealing, and policy-savvy. Most important, Vance totally upended the media's unflattering characterization of him by being sympathetic, respectful and likeable.

Vance had the advantage of having held dozens of press interviews in recent weeks; he was ready and tested. By contrast, Walz has done almost no unscripted encounters with the media since he became the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate; his inability to go beyond talking points and delve deep into policy was not surprising.

VANCE, WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENDS WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TOUTING 'NEW' FUTURE

Walz spent much of the debate talking about programs he claimed to have successfully enacted in Minnesota, like paid family leave. What he was supposed to do on Tuesday night was make the case for running mate Vice President Kamala Harris.

Over and over during the nearly two hour debate, Vance asked the most salient question, also posed by Trump during his debate. Harris has been in the White House for the past three and a half years - why hasn't she moved forward on the policies she now claims will solve the nation's problems?

As with the ABC presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, the CBS News moderators embarrassed themselves by clearly favoring the Democrat contestant. Moreover, CBS' Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell affected a grating school-marmish tone, overly eager to chaperone what was an extremely orderly debate.

Their questions featured well-worn Democrat priorities (climate change, abortion) and they largely avoided topics that could have played well for Vance, like crime. O'Donnell challenged the senator on Trump formerly calling climate change a ""hoax"" and then asserted gratuitously that ""the overwhelming consensus is that the climate is changing.""

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

Moreover, having said they would not fact-check the candidates, the two women intervened more than once to question a response from Vance, while doing so only one time with Walz.

Unhappily for the Minnesota governor, that one probing question was calamitous. Asked why he had falsely claimed to be in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Walz launched into a word salad that would have made Kamala Harris proud, talking about his experiences traveling in China. Asked again to answer why he had been untruthful, Walz misfired and looked stunned. In effect, he was caught out in a lie. Since he has a history of spinning falsehoods about his past, and especially about his military rank, this was not helpful.

Vance, like Walz, was meant to argue the case for his running mate, and that he did. When the moderators and Walz derided Trump's claim during the presidential debate that he had the ""concept of a plan"" on health care, Vance said that Trump did not have a plan - he had a record. More than once during the evening he reminded the audience that during Trump's presidency inflation was low, the border was closed and the world was at peace.

KAMALA HARRIS MAKES A DESPERATE MOVE ON A CRITICAL ISSUE TO SAVE A SINKING CAMPAIGN

When moderator Margaret Brennan pushed Vance to explain why Trump had abandoned the Iran nuclear deal, thus purportedly allowing the terror state to speed up its efforts to build a nuclear weapon, Vance noted that for the past three-plus years Harris and Biden have been in charge. He rightly pointed out that they helped rebuild Iran's ability to wage war by not enforcing the Trump sanctions, thus allowing the mullahs to grow their income by $100 billion. With Iran just having attacked Israel with 180 missiles, Vance's referencing the Reagan-Trump doctrine of peace through strength resonated.

While Walz repeated Harris' vague promises about making life better for middle class families, Vance reminded the audience that take-home pay had risen under Trump and inflation was low, while under Harris, prices on everything from food to housing had shot up more than 20%. When Walz claimed economists backed Harris' plan over Trump's, Vance responded that Trump didn't have Ph.D.s on his team, he had common sense.

When Walz accused Trump of wanting to enact tariffs on imports, which would serve as a new tax on Americans, Vance congratulated President Joe Biden on keeping the former president's tariffs on China in place, defusing the issue.

Over and over during the nearly two hour debate, Vance asked the most salient question, also posed by Trump during his debate. Harris has been in the White House for the past three and a half years - why hasn't she moved forward on the policies she now claims will solve the nation's problems?

Vance clearly won the dispute over the border, noting that Harris had bragged for three years about undoing all the restrictions that Trump put in place. When Brennan challenged Vance on how Trump would handle separating families while carrying out deportations, Vance referred to the horrifying report that the Department of Homeland Security has lost track of more than 320,000 children brought across the border illegally - a damning and heartbreaking situation that has resulted from Harris' open border.

Not surprisingly, the debate got heated on the subject of abortion. Vance criticized the Minnesota law signed by Walz that does not require the doctor to do everything necessary for the care of a baby that survives a late-term abortion. Walz disputed the characterization, but Vance is correct. Walz, meanwhile, charged Vance with having earlier backed a 15-week national abortion ban. Vance explained that he shares Trump's view that the states are now charged with setting the regulations.

The candidates sparred on other topics, and took expected swipes at each other's running mates, but both maintained their composure and even agreed that on some issues, like school safety, they could likely find some common ground. Especially given the Harris-Walz strategy of avoiding scrutiny and trying to hide their progressive agendas, it was an unusually useful event for America's voters.

The winner of the night, without a doubt, was JD Vance. Will it matter? After all, many argue that no one votes for the V.P. But voters tell pollsters they do not enough about Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.

Now they know more, and on the basis of Tuesday night's performance, Vance might have won over a few folks. With the race a dead heat, everything matters."
Opinion | Who won the first (and only) VP debate? It came down to one of the last questions.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/who-won-vp-debate-tonight-vance-lied-walz-polls-rcna173558,2024-10-02T05:15:46Z,"JD Vance is clearly a smooth talker, but eventually his lies caught up with him.

Despite a somewhat slow start and an occasionally halting style, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz produced strong answers on health care, gun violence and reproductive rights. But his standout win -- and indeed one of the most compelling moments of the whole night -- came at the end of the debate, when the issue of election integrity took center stage. Vice presidents are tasked with a final ceremonial role in the process of certifying state electors. Former President Donald Trump tried to exploit this role in 2020 and pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to try to stop the certification. Pence refused. Just as concerning, though, is Trump's reluctance to even admit that he lost the 2020 election.

Tuesday night, Walz asked Sen. JD Vance point-blank whether Trump lost to Joe Biden. It was an easy question, which Vance nonetheless whiffed. Instead of answering with a yes or a no, Vance equivocated, deflected and eventually tried to turn the issue into a confusing and nebulous referendum on ""censorship."" Only then did it become clear that Vance, for all his smooth talking points, is still in many ways just a vessel for Trumpism.

During an extended exchange about the consequences of illegal immigration, CBS News co-moderator Margaret Brennan offered a mild fact-check of Vance, who claimed that in ""Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you've got housing that is totally unaffordable, because we've brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.""

Brennan noted that many of the Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, are in fact there legally. This caused Vance to lose his cool. ""Margaret, the rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" he complained. Then, as Brennan's colleague Norah O'Donnell attempted to move on, Vance pushed back again, trying to tie Haitian migrants in Ohio to illegal immigration. Finally, CBS cut his mic.

Putting aside Vance's snarky treatment of the moderators, his seemingly righteous anger here is misplaced. Vance and Trump have repeatedly claimed that Springfield is overrun with Haitian migrants who are causing all sorts of problems, including, incredibly, stealing and eating pets. But according to the city's Republican mayor, Vance's own office called officials in Springfield to check this pet rumor and was told they were baseless.

It was a strikingly emotional reaction from Vance, who attempted to maintain a mostly collegial demeanor throughout the ""Midwestern nice"" debate. And it came off as both overly defensive and disproportionally condescending.

Vance says he ""never supported a national ban"" on abortion. This is, right off the top, not fully accurate. In 2022, Vance said he ""would like abortion to be illegal nationally.""

But in the same breath, Vance admitted he has supported a ""national minimum standard"" for abortion procedures. A ""national minimum standard"" of six or eight or even 15 weeks, however, would restrict abortion access to such an extent that it would become a form of abortion ban. This is a slick rhetorical trick, but it shouldn't fool people who are listening closely."

Ohio Sen. JD Vance's argument that the U.S. needed to ""stop the bleeding"" at the border during Tuesday's debate elicited a mixed response from voters,

""Before we talk about deportations, we have to stop the bleeding,"" Vance argued during Tuesday's debate. ""We have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies.""

According to Fox News debate dials, which measure how Republican, Democrat, and Independent voters are responding to particular answers by candidates during the debate, the response by Vance received mixed responses.

While Republican views of Vance's answers had an immediate positive response, Democratic viewers of the debate went in an opposite direction, the dials showed. Independents, meanwhile, hovered around 50% approval with Vance's answer.

Voters began to see Vance's response in a more positive light when he touched on former President Donald Trump's border policies, arguing that the next administration should return to handling the border similar to how Trump did during his four years in office.

Voters also responded well to Vance's remarks on deportation, where the Ohio Senator argued in favor of focusing on those who have committed crimes in addition to crossing the border illegally.

Voters in Fox News Digital's debate dial group had mixed reactions in real time to VP Harris' runningmate, Gov. Tim Walz's argument in favor of abortion during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate against Sen. JD Vance.

When Walz was asked whether he supports abortion up until the ninth month supported as Minnesota is one of the least restrictive states for abortion, he responded, ""That's not what the bill says.""

While Republican voters dipped significantly as Walz spoke, independent and Democratic voters stayed mostly in the approval zone.

""What we did is restore Roe v. Wade, we made sure that we put women in charge of their healthcare,"" Walz said.

JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walz's performances at the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

The largely civil and arguably quite informative debate between Democratic nominee Gov. Tim Walz and Republican nominee Sen. JD Vance on Tuesday night has underscored one thing. We need another presidential debate.

Both Walz and Vance stuck to familiar positions on the issues on the debate stage, whether it was on the economy, health care, energy or immigration. No new ground was broken, no dramatic changes in policy were unveiled.

Still, the debate, in my estimation, was very important for a fundamental reason: it was civil, it was informative, and it included a surprisingly high degree of bipartisanship that has been noticeably absent from the 2024 presidential race.

It is certain that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump watched the debate. And both, I am sure, concluded that their respective running mates did an excellent job in both underscoring their core positions as well as attacking their rivals.

VANCE, WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENDS WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TOUTING 'NEW' FUTURE

But most importantly, on Tuesday night there was a comment that I think both candidates underscored in their own way: That we can do better as Americans, we can solve our problems and provide leadership as people who disagree, and sometimes vigorously, but have a broader purpose beyond our narrow partisan concerns.

The nearly two-hour event underscored this key point: you can't just run on joy and you can't just run on bitterness about what has happened in the past.

This is not simply a homily. It's much more. It is a large-scale call for a different kind of politics, even if implicitly made by both candidates, it is a recognition of the extraordinary challenges we face, both domestically and internationally, in the wake of Iran's attack on Israel. And most of all, it underscores to me why both presidential candidates need to quickly accept the invitation of various news networks for another debate or more debates in the final 35 days of this campaign.

It's virtually certain that no minds were changed on Tuesday night.

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

To be sure, the pundits will be vetting what the candidates said or didn't say about immigration and abortion. Two topics on which they disagree vehemently. But the two vice presidential candidates were largely repeating and underscoring what their respective nominees have said and believe.

The key now is for the media to focus on what the American people want and require as this extraordinary race comes down to the finish line. The two presidential campaigns need to face off, at least once, if not more times, to discuss and debate their positions on the issues with a greater degree of specificity and precision than they have done previously.

The 2024 presidential race is now an effective statistical tie. This is especially true when one looks at the seven key swing states in this election. There is a degree of uncertainty about precisely where the candidates stand on the important issues facing our country after a raucous presidential debate last month that was more personally divisive than it was informative.

JD VANCE REMINDS CBS MODERATORS OF DEBATE RULES AFTER THEY TRY TO FACT-CHECK HIM

For us to make an informed choice as Americans, we need to replicate what happened on Tuesday night with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The two presidential candidates need to tell us, in programmatic terms, what they will do on the economy, immigration, crime, health care, energy and, of course, on foreign affairs, a critical topic which did not get anywhere near the attention it deserved and required.

The level of dissatisfaction of the American electorate with the candidates and with the political process cannot be overestimated. We saw what the American people deserve but have not received until now in this presidential election.

The nearly two-hour event underscored this key point: you can't just run on joy and you can't just run on bitterness about what has happened in the past.

Both vice presidential candidates were likable on Tuesday night. Vance had heretofore not been seen that way. On the debate stage, it was hard not to empathize with him, even if you disagreed with him. Likewise, Walz delivered as a likable everyman figure.

I came away from the presidential debate last month not wanting to have dinner with either Trump or Harris. After the V.P. debate, I wanted to get to know both candidates better.

My takeaway from Tuesday night is that, for virtually the first time in this election cycle, Vance and Walz quietly acknowledged that the electorate requires something more before Election Day. It's up to Trump and Harris to give it to them--in person--at least one more time, if not more."

JD Vance addresses the Iran Nuclear Deal during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Democrat vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz faced off Tuesday night in their first -- and only -- debate, sparring over issues from foreign policy to border security; abortion to climate change; and introducing themselves and their records to the American people with just five weeks to Election Day.

Vice presidential debates are traditionally seen as second-tier, but with former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris unlikely to debate again before voters cast their ballots on Nov. 5th, the stakes were raised for their running mates as they attempted to tackle the most important issues facing the nation.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

CBS News anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan moderated the debate in New York City Tuesday night, which was filled with more substantive policy discussion than personal jabs, on a day that began with nearly 50,000 unionized dock workers going on strike from Maine to Texas and ended with Iran launching its largest attack on Israel in history, firing nearly 250 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State.

The first question for Walz and Vance was whether they would support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran.

A visibly shaky Walz had a tough start to the debate, pausing and stumbling over his words as he spoke about the need for ""steady leadership"" from the White House. Instead of answering the question, Walz took a shot at Trump.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz said, pointing to Trump's debate performance against Harris last month. ""It's clear, and the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago, a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment.""

But Vance, in his first answer, defended Trump, saying he ""delivered stability to the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence.""

""People were afraid of stepping out of line,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.""

CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING IN THE 2024 ELECTION

As for a preemptive strike, Vance said ""it is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe.""

""And we should support our allies wherever they are, when they're fighting the bad guys,"" Vance said.

Walz fired back, slamming the Trump administration for pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, saying Iran is ""closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership,"" while saying Harris is providing ""steady leadership.""

But Vance fired back.

""You blame Donald Trump, but who has been the vice president for the last three and a half years? And the answer is, your running mate -- not mine,"" Vance said.

Vance, again defending Trump, said he ""consistently made the world more secure.""

""Gov. Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump has already done it once before.""

Vance also urged voters to ask themselves ""when was the last time that an American president didn't have a major conflict break out?""

""The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was president,"" Vance said.

The debate shifted to the ongoing crisis at the southern border -- a top issue for voters.

Vance said he has already been to the border more than ""border czar"" Kamala Harris, while touting Trump's plan to secure the border.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

But Walz blasted Trump for his alleged efforts to get Republicans to vote against a border bill.

""As soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this, Donald Trump said no. told [lawmakers] to vote against it, because it gives him a campaign issue,"" Walz said. ""What would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things?""

On the same topic, moderators asked Vance whether he and Trump would support family separation as part of Trump's proposed ""mass deportation"" should he be elected.

""We have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost,"" Vance explained. ""Some of them have been sex trafficking; some of them, hopefully are at homes with their families; some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules,"" Vance said. ""The real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris's wide open southern border. And I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, she said she was going to do this. Real leadership would be saying, you know what, I screwed up. We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border policies. I wish that she would do that. It would be good for all of us.""

Walz pushed back, saying children have not been used as ""drug mules,"" and defending Harris, saying she was attorney general in California and ""prosecuted transnational gangs for human trafficking and drugs.""

Walz also hit Vance over claims he had made about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, saying he had demonized them.

""Look in Springfield Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans,"" Vance said.

At that point, moderators tried to correct Vance--but the GOP vice presidential nominee pushed back, reminding that the moderators said they would not fact-check the candidates.

The moderators said that many Haitian residents in Springfield, Ohio have legal temporary status. Vance jumped in to ""say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process and tying it to a Harris-backed process, the moderators spoke over him, sarcastically thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Tim Walz attempted to argue with him.

""We have so much we have to get to, thank you so much for explaining the legal process,"" Margaret Brennan said before asking her co-moderator to ask the next question.

As for the issue of abortion, another top issue for voters this cycle, Walz maintained that he and Harris are pro-choice, while Vance said Republicans need to ""do so much better of a job at earning the American People's Trust back on this issue, where they frankly, just don't trust us.""

""And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies,"" Vance said. ""I want to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family. And I think there's so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options right now.""

Vance echoed Trump's view of abortion--supporting the Supreme Court's decision to return the issue of abortion back to the states, while supporting exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: TRUMP MAINTAINS LEAD ON 2 TOP ISSUES AHEAD OF VP DEBATE

""The proper way to handle this, as messy as democracy sometimes is, is to let voters make these decisions,"" Vance said. ""Let the individual states make their abortion policy. And I think that's what makes the most sense in a very big a very diverse. And let's be honest, sometimes a very, very messy and divided country.""

Meanwhile, the moderators switched to questions of leadership -- with the moderators pressing Walz on whether he was actually in China for the Tiananmen Square protests, like he claimed.

A visibly nervous Walz attempted to explain the discrepancy, ultimately saying he ""misspoke"" and was not there until later that year.

And the question for Vance was about his past criticisms of Trump.

Vance said, at the time, he disliked Trump because he ""believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record.""

""Donald Trump delivered for the American people rising wages, rising take-home pay, an economy that worked for normal Americans, a secure southern border. A lot of things, frankly, that I didn't think he'd be able to deliver on. And yeah, when you screw up, when you misspeak, when you get something wrong and you change your mind, you ought to be honest with the American people about it,"" Vance said.

Meanwhile, Vance offered his sympathies to Walz during the section of the debate focused on gun violence, when he learned that Walz's son had witnessed a shooting.

Walz said his 17-year-old son ""witnessed a shooting at a community center playing volleyball.""

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting. I'm sorry about that -- Christ, have mercy,"" Vance said.

The two spoke about school shootings and their plans to solve gun violence.

""We have to make the doors locked better. We have to make the doors stronger. We've got to make the windows stronger, and of course, we've got to increase school resource officers. Because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience,"" Vance said.

Walz said the conversation was a good start but had to go further.

""Even though they have a high gun ownership rate in the country, there are reasonable things that we can do to make a difference. It's not infringing on your Second Amendment. And the idea to have some of these weapons out there, it just doesn't make any sense,"" he said.

And on another top issue this cycle: democracy.

Vance was pushed on his past comments, in which he said he would not have voted to certify the 2020 election results on Jan. 6, 2021.

Vance fired back at the assertion that Trump could pose a ""threat to democracy,"" saying that he believes ""we actually do have a threat to democracy in this country.""

""But unfortunately, it's not the threat to democracy that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz want to talk about. It is the threat of censorship. It's Americans casting aside lifelong friendships because of disagreements over politics. It's big technology companies silencing their fellow citizens,"" Vance said.

Walz redirected the discussion back to Jan. 6, 2021, blasting Trump and Republicans for allegedly denying the events of that day.

""I will tell you this, that when this is over, we need to shake hands this election and the winner needs to be the winner. This has got to stop. It's tearing our country apart,"" Walz said.

But Vance replied, saying it is ""really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th.""

""As we have done for 250 years in this country, we are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election. And of course, I hope that we win, and I think we're going to win,"" Vance said. ""But if Tim Walz is the next vice president, he'll have my prayers. He'll have my best wishes and he'll have my help whenever he wants it.""

But Vance reminded Americans that ""for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections.""

""Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time, and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board,"" Vance said. ""But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had, I don't buy that, governor.""

As the debate came to a close, Vance and Walz both promised voters a new direction for the United States.

""Kamala Harris is bringing us a new way forward,"" Walz said. ""She's bringing us a politics of joy. She's bringing real solutions for the middle class. And she's centering you at the heart of that, all the while asking everyone, join this movement. Make your voices heard.""

Vance also gave a message of change to the voters.

""We need change. We need a new direction. We need a president who has already done this once before and did it well. Please vote for Donald Trump,"" Vance said. ""And whether you vote for me or vote for Tim Walz, I just want to say I'm so proud to be doing this and I'm rooting for you.

Walz came into the debate with better poll numbers than Vance.

According to the latest Fox News national poll, Walz was slightly above water with a 43% favorable rating and a 40% unfavorable rating. Vance stood in negative territory, at 38%-50% favorable/unfavorable.

Heading into the debate, Vance had been very talkative, sitting for scores of interviews and taking plenty of questions from reporters on the campaign trail.

Both running mates get right back on the campaign trail on Wednesday in two of the key seven battleground states that will likely determine whether Harris or Trump succeed President Biden in the White House.

Vance's Republican Party sounds pretty nice. Too bad it's fantasy.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/jd-vance-republican-party-fantasy-vp-debate-rcna173573,2024-10-02T03:53:04Z,"Like most of the most promising words that come out of his and Trump's mouths, it's absolutely too good to be true.

I can't say I recognize the Republican Party that Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, advocated for on stage during Tuesday night's vice presidential debate. In answer after answer, Vance talked about policies that sounded nothing like anything that any Republican has advocated during this election cycle. It certainly doesn't sound like an administration that his running mate, former President Donald Trump, is likely to put into place should he win in November.

Let's start with abortion, an issue that has been a drag on the GOP since the conservative Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Vance waved off the idea that a national abortion ban is something that many Republicans support. Instead, he tried to humanize the issue, talking about a friend of his who felt she had to terminate a pregnancy and pushing for a string of ""pro-family"" policies that could help American families afford to raise kids. Later on, he added that the federal government should be investing in helping families pay for child care, using funding to help entice more child care workers into the field.

Vance further explained that, of course, the GOP wants to save the Affordable Care Act's ban on insurance companies using pre-existing conditions against people. He said there needs to be more housing made available for people to bring down the amount people are spending to have a roof over their heads. And he implied that Trump facilitated the peaceful transfer of power, downplaying the former president's plot to try to overturn the 2020 election.

On the one hand, this could be what the campaign would have looked like if Trump wasn't the nominee. He's kept the most far-right plank of MAGA extremism, falsely blaming the majority of America's problems on immigration. But he's tried to sand off many of the edges, doing what Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis failed to achieve in his primary campaign, presenting a version of Trumpism that could extend beyond Trump.

But recall Vance's nomination acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in July. None of the sort of ""compassionate conservatism"" redux that he pitched on Tuesday night was present in that speech. And when you hold up his statements to what the GOP has done and proposed in the real world, there's no way to make the two versions align. There is no support among Republicans in Congress for a new federal child care program, nor was there any desire to save the ACA among them. Vance was saying whatever he thought Americans wanted to hear -- same as he will do if ever in a position to challenge Trump as his vice president.

Likewise, Vance worked to assure the audience that there was actually a lot that he and his Democratic opponent, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, agreed on and implied that Trump would look for bipartisan solutions if returned to the White House. It honestly sounded nice, a throwback to a semi-mythological era where things got done in Washington as both sides compromised for the good of the country.

But like most of the most promising words that come out of his and Trump's mouths, it's absolutely too good to be true. I'd love it if the Republican Party that Vance promoted was real. But there is no world in which a second Trump administration leads to a new era of common sense solutions. Vance's claim otherwise may be the biggest, most disturbing lie that he told on stage."
Walz repeats Georgia abortion death falsehood decried by doctors as 'fearmongering',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/walz-repeats-georgia-abortion-death-falsehood-decried-doctors-fearmongering,2024-10-02T03:19:45Z,"Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., discusses abortion access during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz claimed during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate that a woman in Georgia likely died due to the state's ""restrictive"" abortion laws following the overturning of Roe, despite doctors previously denouncing such a narrative as ""fearmongering.""

""There's a young woman named Amber Thurman. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurmond died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights, as basic as the right to control your own body, is determined on geography,"" Walz said during the debate while sparring with Vance on abortion laws.

""There's a very real chance that if Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe versus Wade,"" he said.

Walz joined Ohio Sen. JD Vance in New York City on Tuesday evening where the pair squared off on key voter issues this election cycle, including the economy, immigration and abortion.

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Walz's remarks come after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits after the women received chemically induced abortions in 2022. Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

Members of the Democratic Party, including Vice President Kamala Harris, have cited their deaths as evidence for the need to expand abortion access following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.

""Good policy, logical policy, moral policy, humane policy is about saying a healthcare provider will only start providing that care when you're about to die?"" Harris said during an Atlanta campaign event last month, while citing Thurman's death.

OB-GYNs have since criticized the narrative as a misleading story that is being pushed by the media and Democrats.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

""I was not surprised to see this pro-abortion media try to point the blame at Georgia's pro-life laws, but, in fact, Georgia's laws allow doctors to intervene to save the life of the woman,"" Charlotte Lozier Institute Vice President and Director of Medical Affairs Dr. Ingrid Skop recently told Fox News Digital.

""I think the focus of the Democratic Party upon abortion as an issue is only because the American people do not understand the laws. Many times, women are hurt by abortions. It is not necessary for women to live their best life. And, of course, it's the fearmongering and lies that have led us to this place where we are today, where people even think there would be a reason to point at the law.""

Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., and state Rep. Mark Newton have also come out to say they don't believe Georgia laws had anything to do with Thurman's death, but was instead caused by alleged complications from abortion pills, as doctors may have waited too long to intercede.

HARRIS CALLS FOR ELIMINATING FILIBUSTER TO PASS 'ROE' ABORTION BILL INTO FEDERAL LAW

""We never deny a woman an abortion because it's going to harm her in some way. She will always be protected,"" McCormick said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital.

""You have every right to an abortion, even with that heartbeat law,"" he continued. ""So, let's make that very clear right now. When they say there's no exceptions, there's never any law in any state where there's no exceptions. That doesn't exist. That's simply not the way it works. The mother's life is always protected. With that said, it doesn't mean it's easy to get an abortion just because you have a complication or because something goes wrong.""

Tim Walz has the capacity to be 'sharp' during the CBS Vice Presidential Debate on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Republican lawmakers and top voices reacted as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance faced-off in New York City.

""Senator JD Vance spitting the cold hard TRUTH on the debate stage,"" Trump 2024 national press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X. ""Total domination and we are only 20 minutes in.""

The debate in New York City on CBS News was Walz and Vance's only debate prior to the monumental election on Nov. 5.

""Tim Walz is as radical as they come on the issue of immigration,"" Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., wrote on X. ""As governor of Minnesota, he supported free health care, free college tuition, and driver's licenses for illegal immigrants. Innocent Americans have been assaulted & murdered because of this border crisis.""

VANCE, WALZ FACE OFF ON BORDER, CLIMATE CHANGE AND ABORTION DURING VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

The debate began with CBS News moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan asking the candidates about their Middle East policy after Iran attacked Israel with a massive missile barrage.

""Tim Walz's answer on Israel was incomprehensible. Like Kamala--Walz has no idea what he is talking about,"" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X. ""Kamala and Walz would make the chaos in the Middle East worse.""

""Iran rained missiles down on Israel TODAY, 1,350 days into Kamala Harris' tenure as Vice President, so naturally Tim Walz says it's Donald Trump's fault,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Tim Murtaugh wrote on X.

""JD knocks it out of the park with first question!!! Tim Walz implodes on first question in presentation, communication, and substance,"" Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., wrote on X.

Republican voices highlighted the Kamala Harris campaign's immigration policy. Immigration is a top issue for American voters this year, as a record number say the situation at the southern border is a major problem or an outright emergency, according to the latest Fox News national survey.

""Law enforcement has been attacked. Deadly fentanyl has taken the lives of thousands of Americans,"" Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott wrote on X. ""Kamala Harris & Tim Walz support open border policies. They will make the border crisis WORSE.""

""How can Tim Walz pretend Kamala is tough on the border when she allowed more than 16,000 sex offenders and 13,000 murderers to cross the border?"" Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote on X. ""A vote for Kamala and Tim Walz is a vote for open borders.""

The candidates turned their attention to abortion, with Republicans criticizing Walz's abortion stance.

""Democrats always resort to killing babies every time they are losing. And then lie and call it 'reproductive freedom.' There is nothing reproductive about abortion,"" Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote on X. ""Democrats view unwanted babies as a life they can throw away and call it a choice. The truth is motherhood is not something to throw away, neither are babies."""

Ohio Sen. JD Vance ripped Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for the Democratic Party's economic record, remarking Walz has a ""tough job"" simultaneously defending Vice President Kamala Harris' ""atrocious economic record"" while attacking former President Donald Trump on the economy.

""Honestly, Tim, I think he's got a tough job here because you've got to play Whac-A-Mole. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver rising take home pay, which of course he did. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver lower inflation, which of course he did,"" Vance said Tuesday evening during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate in New York City.

Vance was responding after Walz slammed the GOP ticket as one that protects billionaires with tax cuts and pledging that he's a ""union guy"" who wants to keep jobs in the U.S.

Vance continued by saying Walz has to juggle defending Vice President Kamala Harris' economic record while slamming Trump.

""And then you simultaneously got to defend Kamala Harris's atrocious economic record, which has made gas, groceries and housing unaffordable for American citizens,"" Vance continued.

""I was raised by a woman who would sometimes go into medical debt, so that she could put food on the table in our household.

The economy is a top voter concern this election cycle, ranking alongside issues such as the immigration crisis, abortion and national security.

""I hope we have a conversation on health care then, senator,"" Walz said as Vance wrapped up his points on the economy.

""Please,"" Vance responded.

The debate marks the first time the pair have squared off against one another, and will likely be the only vice presidential debate this cycle."
Disgraced ex-CBS New anchor Dan Rather says old network looking to avoid 'blowback' ABC received,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/dan-rather-says-ex-employer-looking-avoid-blowback-abc-received-fact-checking,2024-10-02T01:18:17Z,"""Saturday Night Live"" had some fun at the expense of ABC News and its anchor David Muir for their ""biased"" presidential debate earlier this month.

Former CBS News anchor Dan Rather scolded his former employer for declining to fact-check during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate, saying the network is ""trying to avoid the blowback ABC got"" for fact-checking former President Trump.

Rather stepped down from his role as CBS' evening news anchor in 2005 and eventually left the network the following year after reporting a discredited story about then-President George W. Bush. He took to Substack Monday ahead of his old employer hosting the CBS Vice Presidential Debate between Sen. JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walz, which will be moderated by Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell.

""There are few guarantees in life, but odds are that more than one lie will be told by Donald Trump's protege and running mate, JD Vance. If there's one thing Vance has learned from Trump, it's that lying to get ahead is OK. If you get caught, just double down and lie some more. Who's going to fact check you? Well, apparently not CBS News,"" Rather wrote.

ABC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: MODERATORS DAVID MUIR AND LINSEY DAVIS FACT-CHECK TRUMP 5 TIMES, 0 FOR HARRIS

Rather said he was ""reluctant"" to criticize CBS News, where he worked for 45 years, but he feels it is necessary. His call for fact-checking come after ABC News was widely criticized for correcting Trump multiple times but failing to fact-check Vice President Kamala Harris during the recent presidential debate.

""With that as background, it is necessary to report and comment on the fact that CBS News has decided not to fact-check the candidates in real time. I would love to know what went into this decision, because it feels spineless, especially after ABC's Linsey Davis and David Muir effectively and correctly fact-checked Trump during the debate with Kamala Harris,"" Rather wrote.

""CBS says it is up to the candidates to fact-check, though 'the moderators will facilitate those opportunities' during rebuttal time,"" he continued. ""While both fact-checking (ABC during the Harris-Trump debate) and not fact-checking (CNN during the Biden-Trump debate) have drawn criticism this year, for the most part, the criticism was unsurprisingly partisan.""

Rather noted that CBS News would fact-check the candidates online, but dismissed viewers for being able to follow along in real time.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH ABORTION FACT-CHECK AGAINST TRUMP: 'COMPLETELY INTERJECTS HERSELF'

""Simply put, this 'rule,' imposed by CBS, incentivizes lying. It invites the participants to bend the truth, since their opponent then has to spend his rebuttal time calling out the lie, rather than giving an opposing view. And the calling out of a lie by an opponent rather than an impartial moderator is less credible,"" Rather wrote.

""It seems clear that CBS is trying to avoid the blowback ABC got after the presidential debate. A journalist, much less a news organization, should not be afraid to take heat,"" Rather continued. ""Their responsibility is to call out lies. If they don't do that on live television, during the most consequential election in modern history, they are the lesser for it. But the biggest loser is the American electorate.""

CBS News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Earlier this year, the 92-year-old longtime CBS legend appeared on his old network for the first time in nearly two decades for an interview about his time at the network and his career in journalism.

Opinion | This is the rare vice presidential debate that actually matters,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-tim-walz-vp-debate-vice-presidential-rcna172750,2024-10-01T23:15:15Z,"""Ain't nobody coming to see you, Otis"" is an iconic line from ""The Temptations,"" a 1998 NBC miniseries. Delivered by the actor playing David Ruffin, it's a boast that the audience was not paying to see anyone else in the group, just Ruffin. Conventional wisdom says one could apply this logic to Tuesday's vice presidential debate between Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. JD Vance of Ohio.

In a ""normal election,"" a debate between the No. 2s on the ticket would be interesting but not statistically significant. The rule for a vice presidential debate is generally the same election to election: Stick to the top of the ticket's message, draw a contrast with the challenger anchored in that message and, crucially, do no harm. Conventional wisdom says people do not cast ballots because of whom the Democratic or Republican nominee chose as an eventual governing partner. It's the name on the top of the ticket that matters.

However, this is not a normal election, and I disagree with the conventional wisdom. Running mates matter, and tonight's debate is quite significant!

If the nominees' choice for potential governing partner did not matter, then there would no reason to put them on the stage together before the election. Choosing a running mate is the first presidential-level decision a major party nominee makes. It is a statement about who they are and what their agenda and legacy will be if elected president. In selecting the millennial Vance, former President Donald Trump tripled down on Trumpism, cementing it as a key pillar of the Republican Party apparatus and the bedrock of the GOP's next generation.

In selecting Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris signaled that the Democratic tent is big and that she is serious about making her bold plans on child care, reproductive freedom and the economy a reality. Just look at what her running mate has done in Minnesota when it comes to those issues.

Tonight's debate could be the last time voters hear from the campaigns in a forum at which they are mandated to stand next to each other and defend their plans. A literal split screen where the comments of both participants will take center stage. That alone raises the stakes.

Vance will have to answer for his treasure trove of soundbites on everything from likening Trump to Hitler and the racist conspiratorial lies about Haitian people in his home state, to name just two. Walz will be asked to defend his record in Minnesota (because apparently feeding children is too progressive) and his military service record. Regardless of what the moderators ask, a candidate who is well prepared will answer the question then quickly pivot out of the conversation about themselves and back to the issues and their No. 1. This is not always easy to do, but it is critical.

When we first sat down for debate prep in 2020 with then-Sen. Harris, we initially focused on ensuring she knew what then-candidate Joe Biden had said publicly about each issue. It was important she was well versed in his thoughts, so she knew the contours of where and how far to go in discussing any particular topic.

The last thing a campaign wants is the running mate making unauthorized news.

When Vance sat down with my colleague Kristen Welker on ""Meet the Press,"" he emphatically stated Trump would not sign a national abortion ban into law. And yet, during Trump's second debate this cycle, he walked back Vance's answer on national television. Vance will want to avoid making the same mistake tonight, but a large part of being vice president is speaking for the president. If Vance cannot do that in a debate, why would he be able to do it at the White House?

For Walz, he will have to walk the tightrope of part attack dog and part explainer. This is an area where many voters still say they want to know more about Harris' plans, so Walz will have to use his time wisely, find moments to speak directly to the people at home and explain how a prospective Harris-Walz administration would make a difference for families across the country. Much has been said about Walz not being a seasoned debater, but remember he was a high school teacher and a football coach! One could say he honed his oratory skills in the lion's den.

In 2020, during Harris' debate prep, we had many internal discussions about how to handle the question of age if it came up. Tonight, Walz won't have that problem. Harris will turn 60 this month; however, Vance will have to speak to why Americans should trust 78-year-old Donald Trump to sit behind the resolute desk again and if he himself -- a freshman senator with no legislative accomplishments and no other political or government experience -- would actually be ready to lead the country if duty called.

Tonight, while no one will be looking for Otis, all political eyes will be on Tim Walz and JD Vance."

The vice presidential debate Tuesday between Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will likely be your last chance to see the two campaigns square off before the election.

With the two running mates not as well-known as the tops of the tickets, many people will be watching just to get to know them. Others will be looking for how they represent the tickets.

So what should you watch for?

We asked some MSNBC analysts to weigh in on what they will be watching for during the debate. Here's what they said.

Follow live updates covering the 2024 vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz.

There's an underappreciated point of distinction between Walz and Vance: At their debate, one will find it vastly easier to defend his running mate.

When the vice presidential nominees share the stage, I'll be watching to see just how much the Republican senator struggles, not only to defend Donald Trump's latest scandals, lies and missteps, but also to distance himself from his own condemnations of the former president -- some of which he reportedly voiced as recently as 2020.

It's a challenge the Minnesota governor won't have to worry about: He and Kamala Harris were, are and almost certainly will remain on the same page.

Walz has lived a charmed existence since being tapped for VP, but we're about to learn whether he can take a punch. It will be very interesting to see how he handles real scrutiny and tough questions, which he's so far been able to avoid.

Walz's superpower is his relatability. Vance's biggest liability is his inability to connect with human beings. I'll be looking out for Walz to exploit that difference, especially by highlighting some of Vance's more extreme positions on abortion, marriage, reproductive rights and more. We'll see if Vance is suddenly going to run away from all of those Christofascist views that he was so quick to espouse on the right-wing podcast circuit before he became the Republican vice presidential nominee. My guess is that he'll certainly try.

Vance has a hard choice to make: try to show balance and get his historically low favorability numbers up or please Trump. This means he will have to attack but not cough up a hairball. Gov., aka ""Coach,"" Walz must show that he is more than just a nice guy. He must show command of the issues and not fumble the ball.

Quite simply: Will CBS fact-check the candidates, or will it outsource that to the candidates themselves? This seems like an especially important question given JD Vance's serial lies about Haitian immigrants, but it also goes to the question of whether the media has been browbeaten into eschewing its most important function: the dissemination of truth."
Biden has 'privately complained' about how quickly Democrats have moved on from him: Report,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-has-privately-complained-about-how-quickly-democrats-have-moved-from-him-report,2024-10-01T18:29:04Z,"President Biden had some fun on ""The View"" by pretending to squash former President Trump like a bug and said his former rival has no ""redeeming value.""

A new report disclosed that President Biden is feeling left out in the cold by the Democratic Party after going all in on Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign.

According to the Monday NBC News report, Biden has mentioned to his allies his feeling that his accomplishments and legacy as president are being forgotten by the party, especially as Harris has tried to distance herself away from her boss' policies and forge her own political identity after replacing him on the Democratic presidential ticket.

""President Joe Biden has privately complained to allies that his name and his accomplishments have virtually disappeared from the national conversation and about how quickly the party that he has served for more than five decades appears to have moved on from him, according to six people familiar with his comments,"" the piece reported.

PELOSI DEMURS ON IF 'EVERYTHING IS OK' BETWEEN HER AND BIDEN: 'YOU'D HAVE TO ASK HIM'

According to these sources, the president has commented on Harris not mentioning him during recent campaign speeches, noting that he believes she should acknowledge his economic accomplishments while touting her own vision on the issue.

""Biden has noted at times that Vice President Kamala Harris... hasn't been mentioning him in her campaign speeches lately, including when she talks about an economy he believes his policies set on a positive trajectory, these people said,"" according to NBC.

Additionally, the sources told NBC that Biden ""was particularly stung"" by Harris' recent line during her debate with former President Trump in which she drew a stark distinction between her and her boss.

""Clearly, I am not Joe Biden. And I am certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country,"" the vice president said during the debate, drawing a stark contrast between her and Biden's policies, as Trump was trying to grill her over the current administration's record.

Those familiar with Biden's feelings on the matter acknowledged that he still wants Harris to win and ""that he plans to do whatever he can to help her,"" the report noted.

An anonymous senior Harris campaign official said that Biden ""always just says to her, 'The most important thing is that you win.'"" The official added, ""We have to tell people who she is and what she would do.""

They also noted, ""There wasn't a real interest in hearing about [Biden's] accomplishments when he was running. That's still the case.""

However, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates denied the claims made by these sources, telling the outlet, ""These uninformed claims are the polar opposite of the truth.""

""President Biden welcomes the strong response the American people are having to Vice President Harris' leadership and to policies that move us into the future, away from dangerous agendas from the past like MAGAnomics and abortion bans,"" Bates added.

The spokesperson doubled down on his rejection of these claims, telling Fox News Digital they are ""not"" true.

The sources have said that Biden understands the political reasoning behind shifting away from his record, though they noted it still ""frustrates him at times.""

""But while Biden is attuned to political realities, he also has expressed a range of emotions about his exit from the race -- from feeling his legacy rests on a Harris victory to anguishing over his imprint's vanishing from the national stage, according to the people familiar with his private comments,"" the article stated.

One source described his mixed emotions on the issue, stating, ""It's very complex.""

Another Harris campaign official defended Harris' pivot away from Biden, telling NBC, ""She has to become her own person. She needs to do that to win.""

Despite Biden's acceptance of Harris' candidacy, he maintains that he would have beaten Trump in November if he was still in the race. He told the co-hosts of ""The View"" last week that he was ""confident"" he could have beaten Trump and said he didn't sense an ""overwhelming reluctance"" about his re-election effort from fellow Democrats.

""I was confident I would beat Trump -- he's a loser,"" he declared.

DAVID MARCUS: The Vance vs. Walz debate is best scored using boxing rules,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-vance-vs-walz-debate-best-scored-using-boxing-rules,2024-10-01T17:53:41Z,"DEBATE DAY: Live coverage begins today at 8 p.m. ET for the Fox News Simulcast of the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate.

The first rule of deciding who won a major political debate is that nobody wins a major political debate. There is no final score as the buzzer sounds, no final wink to be tiddled, it is a purely subjective matter. And that will be true of the vice-presidential debate between Republican nominee JD Vance and Democratic nominee Tim Walz.

That having been said, I've recently adopted a method of scoring debates from the world of pugilistics, that I think actually gives a pretty decent assessment of what most American voters see.

My advice in picking a winner is to borrow the scoring system of a boxing match. The basic rules are relatively simple. In each round the boxer who wins the 3 minutes gets 10 points, the loser gets 9, unless there is a knockdown or it is overwhelming, in which case the round is scored 10-8. A tie is 10-10.

Obviously, a knockout ends the fight.

HEIGHTENED 'SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPORTANCE' AS VANCE, WALZ FACE OFF IN VP DEBATE

I first tried this approach last month with the Trump vs. Harris debate. And I wound up with Trump winning 157 to 150. It wasn't the only reason I thought and wrote that night that Trump won the debate, despite overwhelming media insistence that girl boss Kamala had kicked ass. But it was part of it.

And with polling showing no significant bump for Harris since their face-off and the fact that we've even seen some Trump swing state surge since their debate, my ostentatious declaration of a Trump victory looks a little less crazy today.

The legacy news media, who wanted any excuse to hand Harris a W anyway, viewed the tête-à-tête as a kind of Lifetime movie in which Harris had finally spoken truth to power, but I find in most of America that narrative doesn't have a whole lot of purchase. The voters want answers.

THE WHO, WHAT, WHERE, AND WHEN OF TUESDAY'S JD VANCE-TIM WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

That's where boxing scoring comes in. If openings, closings, and each question, are the ""rounds"" of the debate, you wind up with about 15. See what I'm saying? The incremental 10-9 or 10-8 scores of each, mirror the nuance of how swayable voters watch the event.

The basic philosophy behind boxing scoring is that the primary job is to survive the round, so if you manage that, you get an automatic 8 points, winning the round, and can only bump that up by at most 2.

One could argue there is a fundamental unfairness here, that if I am 40 percent better at landing punches in a round than my opponent, I only get a 10 percent point advantage in scoring, but that is also the beauty of the system. Fights aren't just about math.

This actually tracks very well with how political debates work.

The audience, which is to say the voters, do tend to see each question or issue as one round, and if Walz can get a 10-8 on abortion, or Vance can on the border, that goes a long way towards the kind of 7 point win I gave Trump over Harris.

Another way to think of this is that 90 percent of Americans likely already know who they are voting for, only 10 percent can be swayed, and boxing's unique scoring system almost perfectly corresponds to this.

Eighty to 90 percent we are just scoring as a wash.

There is, of course, the chance of a knockout, but these days, that chance seems remote. Back when Reagan said ""There you go again,"" or Obama, in retrospect wrongly, told Romney the 1980s wanted their foreign policy back over fears regarding Russia, the possibility of something near consensus on the question existed.

Those days are no longer with us, if they aren't over forever.

Nobody really wins a debate, but we can still score them, we can still pay close attention to who is and isn't actually answering the questions, and that has a lot of value.

So give a shot, grab a pad and paper, if you still have those, and just jot down your score for each question, 10-10, 10-9 or 10-8. Like a Ouija board your political leanings might push the pen a bit, but even so, you might be surprised by the results.

As Mike Tyson once put it, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. Let's keep a close eye on the flying rhetorical hands of Tim Walz and JD Vance."
"As Healthcare And Politics Intersect, Doctors Urge Patients To Vote.",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/adairalandry/2024/10/01/as-healthcare-and-politics-intersect-doctors-urge-patients-to-vote/,2024-10-01T16:05:11Z,"Five years ago, a young woman with stabbing abdominal pain arrived at my emergency department. Her blood pressure steadily dropped as she developed pale, clammy skin. We told her, ""You are bleeding into your abdomen. We see blood on your ultrasound. We are worried you are having an ectopic pregnancy."" Within minutes, she was in the operating room getting a life-saving surgical procedure for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, a type of pregnancy that is considered non-viable for the fetus.

Remarkably, our pregnant patient survived. Yet, what stands out today is that the legality of our care, years ago, was never a concern. The team was centered only on providing the care she needed.

The Political Landscape of Healthcare

Today, the delivery of healthcare has become increasingly politicized. The recent overturn of Roe v. Wade reversed rights for pregnant people, leaving many vulnerable under recent state abortion bans. In states where exceptions for ectopic pregnancies exist within their abortion ban, women have still encountered hospitals that ""refused to treat their ectopic pregnancies."" This shift in regulation underscores the intersection of healthcare and politics, a reminder of how both physicians and patients should engage in the democratic process.

While a growing number of politicians have healthcare expertise, many lack a nuanced understanding of medical practice and healthcare delivery. This knowledge gap creates challenges when those who regulate medicine are not the ones providing it. ""Doctors and patients should be protected to make collaborative decisions -- without the intrusion of politics"" says Dr. Sharon Malone, physician, patient advocate, and author. The intertwining of politics and healthcare complicates efforts to address fundamental health issues. ""We haven't agreed on the most basic tenant: does everyone in this country deserve healthcare?"" she argues.

Aspects of healthcare influenced by politics extend beyond women's health. Insurance reimbursement, gun violence, criminalization of illicit substances, pharmaceutical cost-regulation are just a few active political issues that affect patient outcomes.

The Need for Voter Registration

As of 2022, there are approximately 162 million registered voters in the United States, leaving millions without a voice in upcoming elections. The journey toward change begins with voter registration. Politicians, like Elizabeth Warren, are working to streamline this process, recently announcing that patients filling out health insurance forms via HealthCare.gov will receive information about voter registration. ""The health of our democracy depends on Americans registering and exercising their right to vote,"" Warren stated.

In Minnesota and Pennsylvania, leaders have designated August as Civic Health Month to emphasize the importance of voting on healthcare. And yet, despite the clear push to increase patients' civic engagement, some critics -- including physicians -- oppose discussing voter registration in clinical settings.

Stanley Goldfarb MD, has been outspoken against doctors speaking with patients about voter-registration. He argues that ""leftists are making the doctor's office a major cog in their voter-registration and turnout machine."" Why the act of registering to vote at the encouragement of a doctor feels threatening or unwarranted is unclear to me, a physician who routinely witnesses the profound and direct impact politics has on patients. His organization, Do No Harm, states that they are focused on ""combating the attack on our healthcare system from woke activists.""

""Many believe that doctors should 'stay in their lane' and not become involved in the political process, as [patients] may see this as a conflict and not get care,"" Dr. Ayana Jordan, Associate Professor at NYU School of Medicine argues. She clarifies that our role is to be non-partisan and avoid swaying patients in our direction. ""Our role is to ensure that patients understand how to register to vote, make this process as easy as possible, and discuss issues most pertinent to them."" she adds.

Critics fear that doctors will abuse their power to sway patients towards their own individual political agenda. ""It's not just ""vote"". It is vote for Joe Biden, if we are honest. Inherently, the doctor's political bias is reflected in the encouragement. What happens if the patient's father is wearing a MAGA hat. Do you still remind them to vote?"" says one physician, Vinay Prasad MD MPH.

I do agree that physicians should certainly not impose their own beliefs onto patients. And that if they ask one patient to register to vote they should indeed ask all, when clinically appropriate. However, it is countercultural to see physicians grossly avoiding the empowerment and education of patients. A physician need only say, ""I'm sorry you can't afford your life-saving medication"" once for it to be clear there's no effective solution in that statement.

Why Clinicians Should Encourage Voting

In 2022, the AMA declared that voting is a social determinant of health. Dr. Alister Martin, physician, CEO and Co-Founder of A Healthier Democracy, a non-partisan organization that is determined to increase voter registration among patients, says that ""data demonstrates that across rural and urban regions, when voting rates are high, health outcomes are better."" While he believes the exact cause is hard to pinpoint, he suspects areas with high voter engagement are better able to pull in resources that help patients access healthcare. ""These communities have more specialty clinics, hospitals remain open, health centers are available. In the rural areas with less civic engagement, there are more hospital closures."" adds Martin.

Martin emphasizes that voting fosters a sense of agency among patients. ""Those who vote generally feel more empowered to effect change in their lives."" He also highlights a concerning statistic: 72 million eligible individuals are not registered to vote, a gap that can influence electoral outcomes and therefore healthcare related policies.

Encouraging voter registration is not only legal but also supported by leading healthcare organizations, such as the AMA. The encouragement should not be invasive, biased, or demanding. Martin advocates for integrating questions about voter registration into patient social histories, asking, ""Do you smoke? Drink? Are you registered to vote?"" He believes that by enabling patients to exercise their voting rights, we can all contribute to a healthier democracy."
JD Vance Vs. 'Childless Cat Ladies': VP Candidate's Views Explained Ahead Of Tonight's Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/01/jd-vance-vs-childless-cat-ladies-vp-candidates-views-explained-ahead-of-tonights-debate/,2024-10-01T16:04:55Z,"Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio is likely to be asked at Tuesday's vice presidential debate about comments he made denouncing Vice President Kamala Harris and others as ""childless cat ladies"" who don't have a ""direct stake"" in the country's future, which reflects a worldview that has affected Vance's policy views as he stands to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.

Vance will face off against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at Tuesday's debate in Philadelphia. The debate comes as the Harris campaign and Walz -- a cat owner himself -- have repeatedly highlighted Vance's ""childless cat ladies"" comments on the campaign trail. Walz has posted videos with cats and said when Taylor Swift endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, ""It's not as if I didn't warn these guys a few months ago: You mess with cat people, you will find out."" The governor attacked Vance for his comments even before he was named Harris' running mate in August, criticizing the senator for apologizing to cats instead of women for his comments and telling MSNBC, ""My god, they went after cat people ... It would be funny if it wasn't so sad.""

In comments to right-wing journalist Megyn Kelly about his ""childless cat ladies"" comments going viral, Vance said his remarks were ""obviously ... a sarcastic comment"" and he has ""nothing against cats,"" but defended his broader views. ""People are focusing so much on the sarcasm and not on the substance ... and the substance of what I said, Megyn -- I'm sorry, it is true,"" Vance said.

Vance's views that emphasize the importance of married families with children echo views espoused by the Heritage Foundation, a private right-wing organization with close ties to Vance that's recently come under fire for its 900-page policy agenda for a second Trump presidency known as ""Project 2025."" The Heritage Foundation has publicly called for ""encouraging marriage at the front end of a woman's childbearing years"" in order to increase the birth rate, and Project 2025 heavily emphasizes the importance of the nuclear family and imposing policies that strengthen it. The policy blueprint calls for ending ""LGBTQ equity"" initiatives and others in the Department of Health and Human Services and ""replacing such policies with those encouraging marriage, work, motherhood, fatherhood, and nuclear families,"" for instance, along with restricting abortion rights and eliminating federal healthcare mandates around contraception coverage. About the Heritage Foundation's proposals, Vance spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk told Forbes, ""The views of any outside group have zero effect on JD's policy positions -- full stop."" Vance's office also directed Forbes to comments Vance has made noting Project 2025 has no affiliation with the Trump campaign and saying he thinks ""there's some good ideas in there"" and ""there's some things that I disagree with.""

Vance's comments denouncing ""childless cat ladies"" have drawn widespread condemnation from the left, particularly from female voters. Actress Jennifer Aniston said in an Instagram post she ""truly can't believe that this is coming from a potential VP of the United States."" Addressing Vance, she added ""I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day."" Swift's post endorsing Harris was accompanied by a photo of the singer holding her own cat. Former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., also criticized Vance on X, saying she is a ""proud mom"" of stepchildren -- like Harris -- and she and husband Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., were trying to conceive through in vitro fertilization before she was shot in 2011. ""To suggest we are somehow lesser is disgraceful,"" Giffords said. While Harris has not commented on his attacks directly, her stepdaughter Ella Emhoff posted an Instagram story saying, ""How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I,"" referring to her brother. ""I love my three parents,"" she added. Harris also garnered a significant amount of high-profile support from female voters in her campaign's opening days as Vance's comments first went viral, with more than 100,000 women joining a Zoom call Thursday to support the Harris campaign and fans of Taylor Swift mobilizing for the vice president.

How Vance's policy views would actually affect a potential Trump presidency. The vice presidential candidate is likely to fall in line with Trump's chosen policy agenda, and the ex-president has publicly espoused more moderate positions than Vance on issues like abortion, calling for the issue to be left up to the states. (Abortion rights advocates believe he may take harsher action if elected, however.) Trump has also publicly distanced himself from Project 2025 and its more extreme proposals, though many involved with his first presidential administration helped author the policy agenda.

Trump named Vance as his vice presidential candidate on July 15 as the Republican National Convention was underway, siding with allies like son Donald Trump Jr., who had pushed for Vance to be the nominee over more moderate choices like Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. Vance was elected to the Senate in 2022 and was previously best known as the author of memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy."" He notably spoke out against Trump in the 2016 election before he ultimately claimed his views had changed and he now strongly supports the ex-president. Trump's selection of Vance has come under increasing scrutiny as his more extreme views have gone viral and as President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and Harris replaced him, shaking up a contest that polling previously suggested could go more easily for Trump. The vice presidential candidate has struggled in the polls, with a FiveThirtyEight analysis finding he is the least popular non-incumbent vice presidential nominee since at least 2004, and The Hill reported even some House Republicans denounced him as Trump's running mate."
"Judge strikes down Georgia's abortion ban, but not quickly enough for some",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/judge-strikes-georgias-abortion-ban-not-quickly-enough-rcna173419,2024-10-01T14:31:15Z,"A court ruling striking down a Republican-imposed abortion ban in Georgia comes too late for Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller.

It's not every day when a judge references ""The Handmaid's Tale"" in a high-profile court ruling, but that's precisely what happened when a judge struck down Georgia's six-week abortion ban. NBC News reported:

As my colleague Lisa Rubin explained in a social media thread that's worth your time, it was quite a ruling from Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who concluded that the meaning of ""liberty"" in Georgia includes ""the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.""

McBurney added that the Republican-imposed ban was ""extreme"" in its ""narrowing of the window of time within which women have the legal ability to end a pregnancy from roughly twenty weeks (i.e., viability) down to a mere six weeks, a point at which many -- if not most -- women are completely unaware or at best unsure if they are pregnant.""

He went on to write that ""for many women, their pregnancy was unintended, unexpected, and often unknown until well after the embryonic heartbeat began. Yet that's too late under the LIFE Act's strictures: these women are now forbidden from undoing that life-altering change of circumstances -- before they even knew the change had occurred.""

""For these women, the liberty of privacy means that they alone should choose whether they serve as human incubators for the five months leading up to viability. It is not for a legislator, a judge, or a Commander from The Handmaid's Tale to tell these women what to do with their bodies during this period when the fetus cannot survive outside the womb any more so than society could -- or should -- force them to serve as a human tissue bank or to give up a kidney for the benefit of another,"" McBurney concluded.

With this in mind, women in Georgia can, for now, terminate unwanted and/or dangerous pregnancies up to 22 weeks.

But in the meantime, it's also worth emphasizing that McBurney's ruling, while heartening and progressive, comes too late for some -- because there's ample evidence to suggest that Georgia's poorly named LIFE Act was responsible for the deaths of at least two local women.

As my MSNBC colleague Sarah Posner recently explained, Amber Nicole Thurman died in 2022 after she failed to receive the medical care she needed -- because her physicians ""were terrified of committing a felony under the state's abortion ban.""

Soon after the public learned of the Thurman tragedy, we were confronted by a related story: Candi Miller also died in Georgia, and as ProPublica reported, maternal health experts have blamed Georgia Republicans' abortion ban.

GOP officials in the state have already vowed to appeal the latest ruling. Watch this space."

JD Vance, R-Ohio, will likely be asked about his opinions on abortion and other major policy issues when he faces off against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at Tuesday's vice presidential debate, amid controversy surrounding his stances since being named as former President Donald Trump's running mate over the summer.

Vance told The New York Times in February that his populist economic vision can be described as ""applying as much upward pressure on wages and as much downward pressure on the services that the people use as possible."" The senator said he supports raising the minimum wage as an incentive to get workers back in the workforce -- and has co-sponsored legislation to raise it -- and other government intervention to boost industries, like providing subsidies or tax credits. He does not support more stringent government regulations on private businesses, however, telling The Times that to boost the economy, ""there's a lot you can do on the regulatory side -- make building nuclear facilities easier, make building natural gas pipelines easier, make building housing easier -- that doesn't cost money and in fact brings in money."" Vance also supports tariffs that impose taxes on foreign goods, saying that while that can result in higher prices, ""when you are forced to do more with your domestic labor force, you have all of these positive dynamic effects."" He told The Times that while he wouldn't want to raise taxes on middle class Americans, he isn't necessarily opposed to raising taxes on the wealthy, but asked, ""How much revenue does that actually raise?"" Vance is also a big proponent of cryptocurrency, holding bitcoin himself and drafting legislation that would help the cryptocurrency industry.

Vance told The Times he supports Social Security, saying, ""I don't know why people think that you solve many problems by taking a bunch of elderly people and saying, 'You're on your own.'"" The senator suggested he believes in raising more money for the program through a combination of tariffs and bolstering the American labor force, arguing that if more Americans are working rather than relying on public assistance, it would mean more money can go toward Social Security.

Vance has been widely criticized for his views on abortion. In 2022 he said he ""certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally"" and opposed the idea that pregnant people could simply cross state lines to obtain an abortion if the state where they reside banned the procedure. He has also compared abortion to slavery, saying in 2021, ""While the people who obviously suffer the most are those subjected to it, I think it has this morally distorting effect on the entire society."" The senator was part of a broader group of GOP lawmakers who asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to enforce the Comstock Act in 2023, a long-dormant law from the 19th century that would ban the mailing of anything related to abortion. While the letter specifically asked to stop the mailing of abortion pills, experts have suggested the law could be interpreted more broadly to ban the mailing of abortion-related equipment altogether, which would effectively ban the procedure in practice by ensuring physicians can't get the necessary materials to perform it. Vance has more recently downplayed his former support for restricting abortion and endorsed Trump's view of leaving the issue up to the states.

Vance has echoed Trump in calling for mass deportations of immigrants from the U.S. and criticized the Biden administration for allowing an influx of undocumented immigrants. He also helped spread false rumors against Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, and disapproved of the Biden administration extending temporary legal protections to Haitian migrants. The senator has denounced using immigrants for cheaper labor in the U.S., saying business owners should instead increase incentives to lure American workers.

Vance has perhaps garnered the most attention for his attacks on childless Americans, with comments resurfacing from 2021 in which he complained about Democrats being ""childless cat ladies"" who ""want to make the rest of the country miserable too"" and don't have a ""direct stake"" in the country's future. While Vance has claimed his comments were a joke, they do reflect his broader views, as the senator has pushed policies that would incentivize people to have children and benefit families. He has suggested there should be a higher tax rate for childless adults and even said in 2021 parents should have more voting power than voters without children, and has touted a policy in Hungary that provides loans to married couples and then forgives those loans if the couple has children. Vance has supported ""universal childbirth"" policies that would provide healthcare coverage for childbirth, though he has opposed ""universal childcare"" proposals, which he said in 2021 are a ""massive subsidy to the lifestyle preferences of the affluent over the preferences of the middle and working class."" He has also supported expanding child tax credits for low-income families, but has been criticized for missing a Senate vote on the issue. The senator made comments in 2021 suggesting he was against no-fault divorce -- though he did not explicitly call for repealing it -- claiming that ""children suffered"" because of more relaxed views around divorce and calling for a return to viewing marriage as ""sacred"" in order to preserve American families.

Vance has deep ties to the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank spearheading the controversial Project 2025 policy agenda proposing an extreme overhaul of the executive branch should Trump win the election. The senator authored the introduction to Heritage president Kevin Roberts' forthcoming book -- which calls for a ""second American Revolution"" and says ""it's time to circle the wagons and load the muskets"" -- and has long been allied with the organization, with Roberts telling Politico in March Vance is ""absolutely going to be one of the leaders -- if not the leader -- of our movement."" Prior to joining Congress, Vance penned the introduction to a Heritage Foundation report that endorses many of the policies also mentioned in Project 2025, promoting heterosexual nuclear families and decrying abortion and public assistance programs. He has also expressed support for a key pillar of the Project 2025 agenda, which calls for replacing career civil servants with political appointees. Vance has not explicitly endorsed Project 2025, however, particularly as the Trump campaign has tried to distance itself from its proposals. He said in July, prior to becoming Trump's running mate, that he thinks ""there's some good ideas in"" Project 2025's policy blueprint, but it also has ""some things I disagree with.""

LGBTQ+ advocacy groups criticized Vance's nomination as Trump's running mate due to his record on LGBTQ+ rights. As a senator, Vance introduced legislation opposing transgender rights, authoring bills that would classify gender-affirming care for minors as a felony and ban ""X"" from being used as a neutral gender designation on U.S. passports. Vance also said in 2022 he would vote no on legislation to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, and has voiced support for policies like Florida's law known as ""Don't Say Gay,"" which restrict what schools can say about sexual orientation and gender identity.

Vance is one of the GOP lawmakers who has vocally opposed providing additional aid to Ukraine, and has come under fire for saying in 2022 that he ""do[esn't] really care what happens to"" the eastern European country. The senator called at the Republican National Convention for the U.S.'s allies to ""share in the burden of securing world peace,"" saying there should be ""no more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer,"" and told The Times in June the U.S. ""should be dealing with other countries based on whether they're good or bad for America's interests."" He criticized the Biden administration's Ukraine policy to The Times, saying the U.S. was not sufficiently working to deter China from invading Taiwan because ""we're sending all the damn weapons to Ukraine,"" though also acknowledged that handling the situation in Ukraine means ""there's going to have to be some American security assistance over the long term."" Vance also agreed that Russia gaining control of Ukraine is ""is not in our interest."" The senator has expressed strong support for Israel in its war against Hamas, saying at a rally on Saturday that his peace plan is ""elect Donald Trump"" and suggesting he aligns with Trump's view that ""the only way to get to peace is to destroy Hamas and let Israel finish the job.""

Vance's views stand in stark contrast to Democratic rival Walz, who has championed progressive policies including abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights and opposing climate changes. Walz is a gun owner but is strongly in favor of gun control measures like universal background checks and banning bump stocks, in contrast to Vance, whom the National Rifle Association described as ""a true Second Amendment champion"" and has opposed gun control reforms. As governor of Minnesota, Walz has signed bills into law that include free meals for school children, expanded protections for workers, restoring voting rights for the formerly incarcerated, climate change initiatives and legalizing marijuana, among other measures. Like Vance, Walz supports expanding the child tax credit, and he helped enact a nation-leading $1,750 tax credit in Minnesota after a federal tax credit expired. Walz's administration also eliminated many beneficiaries' income taxes on Social Security benefits, which Trump has also called for.

While Vance's economic philosophy has a strong emphasis on bolstering the American worker, the senator has come under fire from the left for his mixed record on supporting labor unions. Though Vance made headlines for visiting striking United Auto Workers union members on the picket line, the senator opposed the PRO Act that would have strengthened protections for unionized workers and codified the collective bargaining process. He told Politico in March that he opposed the legislation in part because he favors a system where industries negotiate union deals, rather than individual workplaces or companies, and because he ""think[s] it's dumb to hand over a lot of power to a union leadership that is aggressively anti-Republican.""

Vance has reached across the aisle for several of his efforts in Congress, working with Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, on a bill to improve rail safety standards after the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on legislation regarding banking regulations. The vice presidential candidate told Politico in March that his wariness of big corporations often aligns him with progressive Democrats even as he disagrees with them on other issues, saying, ""If you look at the people that I've worked with most successfully, it's people who, even though they're from the left, recognize that something's pretty fundamentally broken about American society."" Warren, for example, is ""at least thinking deeply about what's going on in the country and why things seem to be going off the rails,"" Vance said. In his June interview with The Times, Vance said ""Bernie Bros"" are the group on the left ""whose politics I'm open to,"" while criticizing ""center-left liberals who are doing very well,"" arguing them and their center-right counterparts ""have an incredible blind spot about how much their success is built on a system that is not serving people who they should be serving.""

34.7%. That's the average number of U.S. adults who have a favorable view of Vance as of Monday, according to a compilation of polls by FiveThirtyEight, versus 45.7% of Americans who have a negative view of him. Polling suggests the Ohio senator is the least popular non-incumbent vice presidential candidate in at least the past 20 years, according to FiveThirtyEight."
A Faux 'October Surprise' -- How Misinformation Could Upend The Election,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/01/a-faux-october-surprise-how-misinformation-could-upend-the-election/,2024-10-01T14:08:23Z,"As we head into the final weeks before Election Day, the political campaigns are likely bracing for an unexpected ""October Surprise"" that could influence voters and impact the results. The term was first coined by William Casey, who served as campaign manager for Ronald Reagan during the 1980 presidential campaign, yet, there have been October election-upending events going back to the 19th century.

What Casey and his predecessors likely never expected was how misinformation -- and even disinformation -- could be employed to sway voters. Advances in technology like Deep Fakes, an overreliance on social media for news and information, and foreign actors who seek to undermine confidence in our elections have created a perfect storm for such a nightmare scenario.

Nearly eight years ago, a video of then-candidate and now-former President Donald Trump surfaced in which he bragged about grabbing women by their genitals. It was an ""October surprise"" that almost derailed his campaign. Four years later, Trump contracted Covid-19 and was forced to cancel a debate with then-candidate Joe Biden and stop all campaigning.

With just weeks to go until Election Day, there could be a similar surprise -- and perhaps even a made-up one. Yet, the consequences could be huge.

""When Hillary Clinton recently warned Kamala Harris about the threat of an October surprise, she knew what she was talking about. Remember James Comey, just 11 days before the 2016 election? That turned out to be a nothing burger -- and Comey was rebuked in subsequent investigations for his actions. Or Pizzagate? That, too, turned out to be false,"" said Susan Campbell, distinguished lecturer in the College of Arts & Sciences at the University of New Haven.

""This year, voters must be on guard for the biggest threat to a free and fair election: Misinformation. They must steel themselves against lies and distortions, particularly on social media,"" added Campbell. ""Recently, an army of bots and trolls took to X(witter) to say that the federal government had not done enough to help the people harmed by Hurricane Helene, which was false.""

The spread of misinformation and disinformation during an election season isn't new and actually dates back to the country's founding. Smithsonian magazine previously reported how in the 1800 election Thomas Jefferson engaged in a ""smear campaign against then-president John Adams,"" which ""climaxed with an unexpected October broadside."" The late-season attack, carried out by Alexander Hamilton -- a critic of Adams and who went on to be Jefferson's VEEP -- remains one of the earliest examples of an effective late-campaign attack on a political rival.

During the 1840 election, rumors circulated that the Whig Party had paid residents of Pennsylvania to cross state lines and cast votes in New York during the 1838 election. There was no basis that this occurred, but people believed it -- just as some today believe illegal immigrants can head to the polls to sway the election results.

It was also 100 years before William Casey coined the term ""October Surprise"" that a disinformation campaign almost impacted the presidential election results.

The New York Truth newspaper published a forged letter on October 20, 1880, allegedly written by Republican candidate James Garfield voicing support for Chinese immigration at a time when many white Americans were opposed to Chinese immigration over fears that they were stealing jobs from American workers. In truth, both campaigns were in favor of immigration restrictions. Garfield went on to win the election by a narrow margin, but there has been speculation if the forged letter was released a little earlier the situation could have been different.

Misinformation/disinformation has clearly existed for a while, but social media could impact how it reaches the masses.

""The World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report highlights that the primary risk for 2024 is the use of misinformation and disinformation by malicious actors to disrupt society and further polarize communities,"" warned

Craig Barkacs, professor of business law and ethics in the MBA programs at the Knauss School of Business at the University of San Diego.

The October surprise may no longer be a single event or revelation. We could already see many at work, with misinformation already circulating about Senator JD Vance and his couch, and Governor Tim Walz supporting post-birth abortions.

But users of social media should be on guard for even more misinformation and disinformation in the coming weeks.

""There may be several October surprises in the works,"" said Barkacs. ""For most individuals, these may not make a significant difference as their opinions are already formed. For a small percentage, however, these surprises could be pivotal. The presidential elections of 2016 and 2020 illustrate how a tiny fraction of votes in crucial swing states can determine the outcome.""

Artificial intelligence may offer the ability to micro-target voters on social media while being strategically timed and aimed at a particular audience to help alter the results of the election.

""These micro-targeted voters are likely to be low-information voters, who are more susceptible to misinformation. These individuals, often unaware of the broader context, are the first to believe and spread unfounded stories,"" Barkacs continued. ""Research indicates that micro-targeting specific groups can influence voting behavior.

Fox News Power Rankings: Trump maintains lead on 2 top issues ahead of VP debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/power-rankings-trump-maintains-lead-two-top-issues-ahead-vp-debate,2024-10-01T13:08:36Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance are hours away from the first and only vice presidential debate.

As the latest Fox News Power Rankings reveal, Vance starts the evening with a lead on the economy and immigration, while Walz has an advantage on abortion.

Vice presidential hopefuls do not attract as much attention as their bosses when they debate, but as Fox News' Arnon Mishkin argued Monday, they have changed the direction of at least six elections in the last 50 years.

In most cases, these debates are won on policy. Voters are not as familiar with these nominees as they are with former President Donald Trump or even Vice President Kamala Harris, and they do not need to make their choice.

The smart play for these vice presidential candidates is to focus on the major issues at stake and how their administrations would solve them.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: HARRIS TICKS UP AND SENATE REPUBLICANS TAKE CHARGE

That is especially true for Walz on the economy and immigration, since the Harris campaign continues to lag on those issues. Vance, meanwhile, has struggled with poor favorability ratings, so his challenge is to hammer the popular parts of the Trump agenda and avoid wading into the culture war trenches.

There are also style points up for grabs. Many voters will only ever see this debate in short clips on social media, so acting like a policy wonk is less likely than ever to get the job done.

Trump continues to hold an advantage on two of the top three issues in this campaign. He leads on the economy by nine points and immigration by 11.

Those numbers have barely budged since Harris and Trump debated. In August, when the Power Rankings last looked at the major issues, the former president led on the economy by eight and immigration by 13.

Harris is far out in front on abortion. She leads by 17 points on that issue, also a negligible movement since the last tracker (Harris +18).

This tracker includes polls from Fox News, Quinnipiac, CNN/SSRS, NBC News and the New York Times/Siena.

Trump lost a point in the horse race after his debate with Harris while the vice president gained one; these modest shifts mirrored those after the first debate in 2020.

Together, these results suggest that the cause of Trump's slight decline was style rather than substance.

Conversely, while Harris won the debate and held on to her advantage on abortion, she has not consistently closed the issues gap, particularly on immigration.

That is not ideal for her, given the economy (38%) and immigration (17%) are two of the top three issues for voters. A recent Fox News national survey showed those issues and abortion (16%) were the only three that a double-digit percentage of voters called their ""most important"" issue in deciding their vote.

According to the same survey, Harris has strong leads in issues outside the top three. That includes health care, helping the middle class and climate change. These are ""bread and butter"" issues that the left has relied on to drag out base voters in previous elections.

The Democratic candidate also has a lead in uniting the country and, as consistent with previous trackers, having the right temperament for the job.

The candidates are evenly divided on national security. Neither has an advantage in handling a crisis that puts the country at risk, being commander in chief or decisions about using nuclear weapons. Trump's temperament deficit should give Harris an opportunity to lead on some of these qualities, but that has not materialized.

ARNON MISHKIN: JD VANCE IS AN EXCELLENT DEBATER AND PRACTICES FOR THE DEBATE EVERY SUNDAY

Finally, voters prefer Trump on foreign policy. He has a six-point lead in handling the Israel/Hamas war and an eight-point lead on the Ukraine/Russia war.

Tuesday is debate night. Walz and Vance will face off at an event hosted by CBS News in New York City. Fox News will simulcast the debate with special coverage anchored by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum at 8:20 p.m. ET.

Fox News Media has proposed a second Harris-Trump debate to be moderated by MacCallum and Baier in October.

Voters can now cast a ballot in more than half of all states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina.

Opinion | Trump's brand of masculinity puts his own followers' health at risk,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-masculinity-gun-violence-suicide-prevention-rcna173360,2024-10-01T10:34:37Z,"Trump leads a movement of men who are indifferent to suffering, averse to health guidance and overly agitated. And it's putting America's men in danger.

This post is the second in ""MAGA and Masculinity in 2024,"" an ongoing series examining the societal fallout from right-wing hypermasculinity -- and the people fighting its toxic messaging by positively redefining what it means to be a man. You can read the first post here.

Former President Donald Trump's MAGA movement is a hypermasculine cult of personality, in which men are encouraged to remain stoic, inflict harm on others and ignore experts in favor of the advice of tough-talking podcasters. We've seen the ways this kind of machismo has hurt the movement's perceived nemeses.

Women have suffered -- even died -- while being denied abortion care. And a recent study from the Trevor Project links state-level anti-trans laws to a spike in attempted suicides by trans teenagers. In the name of upholding arcane gender roles, the male-dominated MAGA movement has relentlessly infringed on other people's health and well-being.

But MAGA masculinity poses health risks to its hosts, too, particularly with regard to mental health and susceptibility to gun violence. The MAGA movement's toxic mix of ignorance, vitriol and bravado poses a threat to the men most likely to be drawn to it.

The Covid-19 pandemic was a clear example. Trump and his supporters portrayed defiance of public health measures, like wearing masks and practicing social distancing, as matters of manhood and toughness. Studies have shown that this kind of toxic masculinity was a major driver of vaccine hesitancy in men, which in turn was a contributing factor to the disproportionately high excess death rate for Republicans after the Covid vaccines became available.

Trump has only leaned in to his hypermasculine anti-science agenda by promoting his ""Make America Healthy Again"" slogan with anti-vax conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an archetype for toxic masculinity in his own right, who has reportedly been promised a role in Trump's administration if Trump wins the election and has promoted the idea of banning U.S. agencies from studying infectious diseases.

In 2022, NBC News reported on a study that linked conservative policies to higher mortality rates among working-age people.

According to the NBC News report:

The overwhelming majority of gun violence in the U.S. is committed by men, and activists and researchers have long pointed to hypermasculinity as key to gun culture and a driver of gun violence -- both self-harm and violence committed against others.

And the MAGA movement has done a great deal to discourage men from receiving the mental health care and attention they need to thrive. We see this in the right-wing attack on suicide prevention programs and ""social and emotional learning"" programs in school, which experts have used to help boys better process their emotions. Evidence shows that fear and stigmatization make men less likely to receive the mental health care they need. And yet it even found a way to stigmatize mental health and demonize immigrants at the same time by falsely claiming the Biden administration is welcoming them from ""insane asylums"" and ""mental institutions.""

MAGA men get the message, and it's just one of many ways they've endangered their own health -- and others' -- thanks to their allegiance to Trump."
Montana GOP Senate candidate Sheehy says he was in Afghanistan while Jon Tester was 'eating lobbyist steak',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/montana-gop-senate-candidate-sheehy-says-he-afghanistan-while-jon-tester-eating-lobbyist-steak,2024-10-01T09:53:21Z,"Montana Senate candidate Tim Sheehy joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the importance of the race and what issues matter most to voters as he fights to oust Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.

Montana U.S. Senate candidate Tim Sheehy, a Republican, ripped his opponent, incumbent Democrat Sen. Jon Tester, for his ties to lobbyists during a debate on Monday.

Tester is seeking to hold onto his Senate seat to continue representing the red state of Montana in a race that could determine which party controls the upper chamber of Congress, and recent polling shows that Sheehy is leading just weeks before Election Day.

During the debate on Monday, Sheehy knocked his Democrat opponent for his relationship with lobbyists in Washington, D.C.

""Sen. Tester knows all about backroom meetings, he's been taking them for 20 years ... While I was fighting in Afghanistan, he was eating lobbyist steak in D.C.,"" said Sheehy, a former U.S. Navy SEAL.

'WHOEVER GETS ELECTED': VULNERABLE DEM TESTER DIGS IN HEELS ON NOT ENDORSING HARRIS

Lobbyists have donated more heavily to Tester during this election cycle than to any other member of Congress, according to the non-partisan group OpenSecrets.

Tester is the last remaining Democrat to hold high office in Montana, where Republicans, including former President Trump, supported Sheehy's campaign with the hope that he could defeat the vulnerable Democrat and help the GOP win back control of the Senate.

Republicans need to gain only two seats in next month's election to win the Senate majority. GOP West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice is considered a lock in his state's Senate race against Democrat Glenn Elliott, meaning the Senate majority could run through Montana.

Trump won Montana by about 17 percentage points in 2020 and, given that the state is overwhelmingly Republican, Sheehy has often sought to tie Tester to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as the Republican candidate looks to take advantage of public dissatisfaction over the administration's struggles to address the influx of illegal immigration at the Southern Border.

JON TESTER CASTS DOUBT ON UNFAVORABLE POLL IN MONTANA SENATE RACE: 'GIVE ME A BREAK'

""Democrats on the Hill refused to hold the administration accountable for the largest mass migration in the history of this country,"" Sheehy said.

Tester, however, has declined to endorse Harris and has attempted to distance himself from her on the campaign trail, and he skipped the Democratic National Convention in August, when she was named the party's nominee for president after Biden dropped out.

The Democrat has also criticized some of the administration's policy decisions. This includes his opposition to the move for tighter pollution rules for coal plants and his calls for more to be done on immigration.

""Look, I'll be the first person to tell you that President Biden has not done a good job on the southern border,"" Tester said Monday.

Sheehy and Tester also addressed abortion, in which the Democrat said he wants to reinstate Roe v. Wade after the landmark ruling was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court two years ago, returning the power to make laws regarding abortion back to the states.

The Republican acknowledged that remarks he made last year about Native Americans were ""insensitive,"" but refused his opponent's request to apologize. Sheehy had told a group of laughing supporters about bonding ""with all the Indians ... while they're drunk at 8 a.m.,"" while working cattle at a ranch on the Crow Indian Reservation.

""Yeah, insensitive,"" Sheehy said. ""I come from the military as many of our tribal members do. You know, we make insensitive jokes and probably off-color jokes sometimes.""

Tester pressed his opponent, ""Tim, the statement you made degrades Native Americans across this country. You're a big guy, just apologize.""

""Will you apologize for opening the border?"" Sheehy shot back."
"Justice Department No. 3 official pledges to fight hate crimes, fueled by personal story",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/g-s1-25489/justice-department-hate-crimes-ben-mizer,2024-10-01T09:17:21Z,"Benjamin Mizer, with Attorney General Merrick Garland (left), speaks during a press conference announcing an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in March 2024. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images hide caption

When the Justice Department's third-in-command announced nearly $30 million in new federal funds to fight the rise in hate crimes last week, he paused to share a personal reflection.

Ben Mizer told the audience he was ""almost exactly the same age"" as Matthew Shepard would have been, another young gay man living in a small college town in the late 1990s. Attackers beat Shepard, tied him to a fence and left him to die in 1998, striking fear and horror across the nation. The law named after him -- and passed more than a decade later -- gave the federal government new tools to prosecute people who are fueled by hate.

""What I would say to members of the LGBTQ community is that the Justice Department is working day and day out on their behalf to ensure that their rights and dignity are protected,"" Mizer said in a recent interview. ""And I'm proud to be a member of that community and at a senior level of the department.""

The FBI reported more than 11,000 hate crimes in 2023, including a steep increase in anti-Jewish and anti-Black incidents. Mizer and other Justice Department leaders have been targeting those and other crime problems with a two-pronged approach: prosecuting offenders and making financial investments in public safety. The Justice Department administers billions in federal grants. Its Office of Justice Programs has already invested more than $70 million into fighting hate crimes over the past several years.

Mizer, 47, oversees an enormous portfolio at the DOJ, from antitrust and the environment to civil rights. In recent weeks, he's helped launch a lawsuit against the operators of a ship that brought down Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge; announce a settlement over the Norfolk Southern train carrying toxic chemicals that derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, not far from where he spent his childhood; and bring blockbuster antitrust cases against Apple, Ticketmaster and Visa.

""I think economic justice means ensuring that everyone has a fair shake, that the playing field is level and that corporations are not using their power in unfair ways to harm competition or to harm consumers,"" Mizer said.

The son of two union workers, Mizer said he went to law school at the University of Michigan to ""help the little guy."" Since then, Mizer has served as solicitor general in his home state of Ohio, and had two separate stints at the Justice Department in Washington.

In the Obama years, Mizer helped implement a U.S. Supreme Court decision that invalidated the Defense of Marriage Act, a law that defined marriage as between one man and one woman. He sat in on the oral argument at the high court for another case, Obergefell v. Hodges, that ultimately legalized same-sex marriage.

""My husband and I enjoy the benefits of the tremendous advances that were made with respect to gay rights during the Obama era,"" Mizer said. ""But that is not to say that those battles are completely won.""

Mizer said he's proud of the work the DOJ has done to challenge state laws that could deprive transgender people of gender-affirming care -- and to protect women's rights to travel to secure health care including abortion services.

It's not clear whether Mizer will stick around at Justice, in the event Vice President Harris wins the White House. But he said working at DOJ has been ""the honor of a lifetime."""
JD Vance's time on the trail has often been overshadowed by self-made controversy,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5060281/vp-debate-jd-vance-haitian-migrants-abortion-childless-cat-ladies,2024-10-01T09:10:12Z,"Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance speaks to a crowd during a rally at the Berks County Fairgrounds on Sept. 21, in Leesport, Penn. Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images hide caption

Republican vice presidential nominee Ohio Sen. JD Vance has been an aggressive messenger for Donald Trump's campaign vision for the future and is a constant fixture on the trail, doing interviews and taking questions from the press.

But in the 11 weeks since Vance joined the GOP presidential ticket, that message has been overshadowed by controversy -- often of Vance's own making.

His acceptance speech in Milwaukee at the Republican National Convention was heavy on biography and nodded towards a more polished take on Trump's often dire rhetoric.

""My friends, tonight is a night of hope,"" he said. ""A celebration of what America once was, and with God's grace, what it will soon be again. And it is a reminder of the sacred duty we have to preserve the American experiment, to choose a new path for our children and grandchildren.""

Vance's selection came at a moment when Trump was leading in key battleground polls after President Biden's poor debate performance and the GOP was rallying around Trump after an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. The freshman Ohio senator was viewed as the MAGA heir apparent to the party's future.

But in the run-up to Tuesday's vice presidential debate between Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, there have been two conflicting forces at work on the trail: the message that Vance wants to get out, and what actually sticks.

Take his first solo campaign rally in his hometown, just days after the RNC, where he delivered a populist speech vowing to help lift up ""forgotten communities all across our country.""

""We're going to fight for every single worker in this country,"" he said. ""If you work hard and play by the rules, you ought to be able to put a good dinner on the table and send your kids to whatever vacation and whatever school you want to.""

But another line that broke through to the public -- and not for good reason -- was a comment about Diet Mountain Dew.

""Democrats say that it is racist to believe -- well, they say it's racist to do anything,"" he said. ""I had a Diet Mountain Dew yesterday and one today. I'm sure they're going to call that racist, too.""

In the days that followed, Trump struggled to quickly pivot his campaign message to address Vice President Harris after President Biden dropped out of the race, but Vance was quick to fill in the gaps to question her record and make her the focus of attacks on immigration, inflation and other top Republican issues.

When Harris named Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate and the pair embarked on a swing state blitz, Vance was there, too, countering the Democratic message with the case for a Republican presidency.

""It is normal people who suffer when Kamala Harris refuses to do her job, and it is normal people who stand to benefit the most when we re-elect Donald J. Trump president of the United States,"" he said in Philadelphia.

But Vance's rapid ascension in politics means he has relatively less experience as a campaigner, delivering stump speeches or handling the intense scrutiny on past and present statements.

So the prebuttal tour came as Vance was also dealing with uproar over old comments he made deriding Democrats in charge as quote ""childless cat ladies.""

""It's not a criticism of people who don't have children,"" Vance said in an interview with Megyn Kelly. ""I explicitly said in my remarks despite the fact the media has lied about this that this is not about criticizing people who for various reasons didn't have kids. This is about criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-child.""

But the damage was done, as Vance's old comments provided Democrats an opening to attack the GOP ticket as sexist and out of touch.

Then, there's more recent remarks, like a weeks-long inflammatory crusade against Haitian migrants living in Springfield, Ohio that Vance has sought to use as a cudgel to attack Democrats over immigration.

""The American media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and I started talking about cat memes,"" Vance said in a Sept. 15 CNN interview. ""If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do.""

State and local Republican leaders in Ohio have rejected claims made by Trump and Vance about Haitian migrants in Springfield. The city's mayor told news outlets that Vance's staff knew the conspiracies about eating pets were false before Trump uttered the lies on the debate stage last month.

Several times, Vance has also staked out policy positions for the ticket that Trump has later disagreed with or shot down, like when Vance said that Trump would veto a national abortion ban.

""I didn't discuss it with JD, in all fairness,"" Trump said on the debate stage. ""And I don't mind if he has a certain view, but I don't think he was speaking for me.""

Where Trump offered a ""concept of a plan"" for health care, Vance answered a question after a Raleigh, North Carolina campaign speech with more details of how Republicans would overhaul health insurance risk pools under the Affordable Care Act, a broadly unpopular proposal.

Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Vance has also been prolific when it comes to messaging campaign goals, frequently doing media interviews, delivering speeches and taking questions after most every stop -- prioritizing local journalists.

But those Q and A sessions can turn contentious, with the crowd often booing questions from journalists as Vance takes the opportunity to paint himself as a pugilist for Trump, whether it be queries about interest rate cuts or questions about the campaign's support of North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who allegedly called himself a ""Black Nazi"" among other things on a porn forum more than a decade ago. (Robinson has denied the allegation.)

Vance, who was a combat correspondent in the Marine Corps, regularly lectures reporters about what he perceives to be unfair coverage of him and frequently directs them to ask Harris questions instead.

Even in more casual campaign settings, Vance has struggled at times to connect. At one stop at a doughnut shop in Valdosta, Georgia, an employee was awkwardly put on the spot by the candidate -- she then asked not to be filmed on camera. On another visit to a Pennsylvania sandwich shop last weekend, Vance was left standing outside in a parking lot after some initial confusion because staff at the shop were never given advance notice of his visit.

All of these things have contributed to Vance having the lowest favorability rating on this year's presidential ballot -- and one of the lowest of any VP pick in recent history."
"Poll workers can be hard to find. In Nebraska, election officials can draft them",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/nx-s1-4990797/nebraska-elections-poll-worker-draft,2024-10-01T09:06:20Z,"OMAHA, Neb. -- Joe Ricceri is busy preparing for the general election with the Douglas County Election Commission. Right now, he works at the customer service desk. But on Election Day, he'll be a district supervisor.

Ricceri is currently a volunteer. But he didn't start out as one. He was drafted.

He was actually drafted when his children were little, but deferred until they were old enough to drive themselves home from school.

""Then immediately, when the youngest was 16, [the county] contacted me. So, they were all over it. They did a good job there,"" he said with a wry laugh.

Finding poll workers is a regular challenge for election officials. But Nebraska has a unique solution: It allows counties to draft workers to fill needs, like it's jury duty.

The secretary of state's office says it's only aware of two Nebraska counties using a poll worker draft this election cycle: Omaha's Douglas County and just south of it, Sarpy County.

In Douglas County, any registered voter is eligible and may receive a letter in the mail requiring them to serve. Even though it's been used for years, Douglas County Election Commissioner Brian Kruse said many voters aren't familiar with the draft and are skeptical when they receive the letter.

""I would say most voters in Douglas County, probably their reaction is, 'Is this for real?'"" Kruse said. ""I mean, one of my best friends is the COO of a company here in Omaha, and one of his employees got [the letter], and he called me up, and he was like, 'Is this for real?' And I said, 'Yes.' And he said, 'Can I get him out of it?' And I said, 'No.'""

Kruse laughed at the memory, but he's not kidding. Voters here can't get out of the draft unless they're over 70 years old, don't speak English, or they take themselves off the voter rolls. Kruse said that is rare.

And if a draftee doesn't show up or doesn't answer that letter, they could face a misdemeanor charge.

In recent years, about half of the county's 3,000 general election workers were drafted.

""We try to get as many volunteers as we can,"" said Election Board Coordinator Brandon Olson. ""Still, we don't want to just go, 'OK, we're just gonna draft everybody.' That's not what we're doing, but ... it gives us a confidence that we aren't going to be worried about finding people.""

That's unlike a lot of the rest of the country, even if the situation has somewhat recovered from a nationwide election shortage during the peak of the COVID pandemic, according to Marta Hanson, national program manager for the group Power the Polls.

""I would say, generally speaking, about 40% of jurisdictions we're in touch with have been like, 'Actually, we're set, we're good, we're fully staffed, we have no issues. Please don't send us more people, because they'll just be disappointed,'"" she said. ""Another 40% are in desperate need of more people.""

Douglas County's draft also fills staffing needs with a more diverse group of people -- especially when many election workers are over 70.

Commissioner Kruse added that those drafted must be balanced in political party, so it's not all registered Republicans or all Democrats. The county works to ensure all five of Nebraska's political parties and nonpartisans are represented.

Carolina Lopez, executive director of the Partnership for Large Election Jurisdictions, was excited to hear about the program.

""I'm going to say it: I was geeking out. I was like, 'Tell me more. I've heard about this in practice. I want to see it,'"" she said.

Lopez said she's rooting for Douglas County and can't wait to see how the draft works this year.

""While this has been in practice in Douglas County for some time, this idea has the potential to be equally impactful for other elections communities across the country,"" she added.

Kruse said some other jurisdictions have shown interest in the method, but he hasn't seen other states employ anything like it -- yet.

Douglas is the only Nebraska county that regularly uses the draft, and Kruse thinks it may be because other jurisdictions are smaller, with fewer polling places, so they don't have as much trouble finding enough workers.

Some voters may view the poll worker draft as a pain, but Kruse said many of the draftees turn into longtime volunteers -- like Ricceri.

And he said the draft also helps more people understand fair elections.

""We have all kinds of processes and procedures in place, but it definitely gives us a broader base and we reach out to a lot more individuals, and so those individuals can see how the process works,"" Kruse said. ""They can go back to their neighborhoods, their PTAs, their schools, daycares, churches, synagogues, country clubs, grocery store, wherever they may socialize, and tell folks about the experience. We do hear over and over: 'I had no idea what all went into the process.'""

Kerri Harris received her draft letter in the mail before the primary election in May. The concept was new to Harris, who had lived in the county for 18 years. She remembered she had mixed feelings about it.

""Because I was like, well, I should serve and be a good citizen. And then it was like, that's a long day, and what if I wasn't available? You know, how do they do all that? Like, what happens to me if I don't do it? You know, it seemed kind of serious, really, like you're supposed to do this,"" she said.

Harris said she never would have volunteered to be an election worker; she does not have a big interest in politics, and she prefers to be outside rather than sitting inside a polling location.

All those who are voluntold must serve not just one election, but four. Once someone serves in four, they won't be drafted again. Harris will serve in the November general plus two more before she completes her draft duty.

Harris' service comes as some voters are questioning elections.

""I've learned a lot that I don't question the integrity of the election at all, because I see everything that everybody has to go through to make sure that the right people vote,"" she said. ""So, I think it says a lot for the integrity of Douglas County.""

Draftee-turned-volunteer Ricceri said he sees value in playing a role in the democratic process.

""You're doing the justice for the people to vote and allowing them to vote and have a voice in the government. So that's important.""

And it's an important election year in Nebraska. Voters can look forward to a packed ballot filled with six initiatives -- including on abortion and marijuana -- as well as two U.S. senators and the president. It's also the first general election in which voters are required to present an ID.

As of now, the drafted election workers and volunteers have completed their online training. But they may still get one more letter telling them they're not needed for this election, and to keep their mailboxes open for the next one."

A judge in Fulton County, Georgia, has overturned the state's ""Heartbeat Law"" on abortion, which made it illegal to terminate a pregnancy after six weeks.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney issued the order on Monday, saying abortions must be regulated the way they were before the ""Heartbeat Law"" went into effect, meaning abortions could be allowed until the 22-week mark.

""The authors of our Constitutions, state and federal, entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning,"" McBurney wrote in his final order. ""A review of our higher courts' interpretations of 'liberty' demonstrates that liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.

""That power is not, however, unlimited,"" the judge added. ""When a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then - and only then - may society intervene.""

McBurney continued, saying a law that prevents abortions after six weeks was inconsistent with those rights as well as the proper balance that a viability rule establishes between a woman's rights and society's interests in protecting and caring for unborn infants.

He then declared the ""Life Act"" as ""unconstitutional.""

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed the ""Heartbeat"" abortion bill, also known as the Living Infants Fairness and Equality Act,"" into law in 2019. The law made abortions after the six-week mark illegal.

GEORGIA GOV. BRIAN KEMP SIGNS CONTROVERSIAL 'HEARTBEAT' BILL INTO LAW

There were exceptions written into the law, including rape and incest, as long as a police report was filed. Another exception to the law allowed for abortions after six weeks if the mother's life was at risk or if a serious medical condition rendered a fetus inviable.

The law signed by Kemp was blocked by a federal judge in October 2019 -- before it went into effect -- and ruled it violated the right to abortion established by Roe. v. Wade in 1973.

The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, which cleared the way for Georgia's law on abortion to go into effect.

McBurney, in November 2022, ruled the law was ""unequivocally unconstitutional"" because it was enacted in 2019 when Roe v. Wade allowed abortions after six weeks.

But in October 2023, the Georgia Supreme Court rejected the ruling in a 6-1 decision, saying McBurney was wrong.

""When the United States Supreme Court overrules its own precedent interpreting the United States Constitution, we are then obligated to apply the Court's new interpretation of the Constitution's meaning on matters of federal constitutional law,"" Justice Verda Colvin wrote for the majority.

How much can the upcoming vice presidential debate impact the election? : Consider This from NPR,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/1202833892/how-much-can-the-upcoming-vice-presidential-debate-impact-the-election,2024-09-30T21:12:17Z,"On Tuesday, two midwesterners will face off in the only vice presidential debate of the election.

Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance (R) and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) will share the stage, exactly five weeks from Election Day, in a race that's very close.

Both candidates will likely lean on their small-town, middle-of-America credentials, Vance from Middletown, Ohio, and Walz, who grew up in Nebraska.

But they have very different ideas about what America should look like. From the border crisis, to abortion, and of course, gun laws.

In a race where so much of the polling is within the margin of error -- it seems as though any one thing could affect the outcome of the 2024 Presidential election.

But have Vice Presidential Debates made a difference in past races?

NPR's senior White House Correspondent Tamara Keith dug into that existential... and political question.

Keith says that vice presidential debates are often forgettable, but the one in 1988 is seared in American popular culture.

Judy Woodruff of PBS did the introductions for Senator Dan Quayle, the Republican nominee, and Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic nominee.

Benson was in his late sixties while Quayle was only 41, and that dynamic led to one of the most iconic lines in debate history, as Quayle compared himself to John F. Kennedy, and Lloyd Bentsen replied:

""I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.""

It was a huge moment in the debate. But it ultimately had no real impact on the outcome of the race. Smackdown notwithstanding, Bentsen and his running mate, Michael Dukakis, lost in a wipe out.

Joel Goldstein is an expert on the vice presidency. He argues that the VP debates do matter.

""It's an important part of their introduction to the American people, along with the sort of the vice presidential rollout and the acceptance,"" he told NPR.

And these two could use more of an introduction. J.D. Vance is a bestselling author but has only been in the Senate for two years. Governor Tim Walz served in Congress but never had a national profile until now. Goldstein says one key test is whether voters can imagine them as president.

""If somebody is not prepared to be president on day one, they're also not likely to be the sort of person who's going to be able to walk into the Oval Office and say no to the president or tell him or her that that the president's wrong."""

""It is damning that here in California, where abortion care is a constitutional right, we have a hospital implementing a policy that's reminiscent of heartbeat laws in extremist red states,"" Bonta said in a statement, to which he added, ""abortion care is healthcare.""

Nearly two dozen US states have banned or severely restricted access to abortion since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. The federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act still requires hospitals to offer abortions in emergency situations, but the Center for Reproductive Rights advocacy organization has said doctors in restrictive states still hesitate to perform the procedure out of fear they'll be prosecuted. In California, abortion is legal through the age of fetal viability (usually between 24 and 26 weeks of pregnancy)."

The controversial law has been facing legal challenges for years. In November 2022, months after it went into effect, McBurney ruled the ban was unconstitutional when it was signed into law because Roe v. Wade had not yet been overturned, and reversed it. About a week after that decision, the Georgia Supreme Court reinstated the ban temporarily, granting the government's request to pause McBurney's order while they appealed it. Then, nearly a year later in October 2023, the Georgia Supreme Court upheld the abortion ban, finding it did not violate the U.S. constitution in 2019 -- though the court focused on the procedural question and did not consider whether abortion was constitutional, meaning the case was sent back to the lower court to answer that question. The case was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of Georgia, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the Center for Reproductive Rights and Georgia-based law firms on behalf of SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective and other women's health care providers.

Biden's old backyard now a key Pennsylvania battleground filled with 'purple' votes,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bidens-old-backyard-now-key-pa-battleground-filled-purple-votes,2024-09-30T20:05:23Z,"SCRANTON, Pa. -- While northeastern Pennsylvania's Lackawanna County has been a Democratic stronghold in state and federal elections, voters on the streets of the old coal mining region say the area runs ""purple"" and will likely be a nail-bitter of an election.

""It's not as blue as people think. It's more purple underneath because people are afraid to say anything around here because they think that there's going to be retaliation. That's an old thing that goes back generations around here,"" David Kveragas told Fox News Digital from a pizza shop on the main drag of Scranton as a storm sloshed rain across the Wyoming Valley last week.

Lackawanna County is home to cities and towns such as Scranton, Carbondale and Throop, mixing cityscapes backdropped by factories of a bygone era, and dotted with suburbs and expansive farms. The county has long voted blue in state and national elections, last throwing its support behind a Republican in 1984 during President Ronald Reagan's blowout election when he won each state except Washington, D.C., and Minnesota -- the home state of Reagan's competitor that year, Walter Mondale.

The county has trended right in recent elections, however, teeing up a heightened election battle that will likely help determine how the key battleground state will swing come Nov. 5.

ECONOMY, BORDER, ABORTION DIVIDE BIDEN'S HOMETOWN AS SCRANTON LOOKS BACK ON NATIVE SON'S FIRST TERM

Between 2000 and 2012, Democratic presidential nominees earned between 56% and 63% of the vote, U.S. News and World Report found. That standard fell below 50% in 2016, when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton unsuccessfully ran against former President Donald Trump, but still carried a win for the Democratic Party's ticket even with the lessened support.

President Biden was born and raised in Scranton until the age of 10, when his family moved to Delaware. Biden's hometown status likely helped boost his popularity among locals in the 2020 election, winning 53.58% of the vote to Trump's 45.23% that year.

As the election cycle comes down to its final five weeks, Fox News Digital spoke to voters on the streets of Scranton to ask about their top election concerns and who they will cast their ballot for come November. Fox News Digital received a mixed bag of responses, with some voters proudly declaring Vice President Kamala Harris' support of abortion access earned their vote, while Trump supporters said voters only need to look at their pay stubs from the 2016-2020 era compared to today to determine their ballot choice.

""If you are a minority and a woman, what is the better choice? I'm not here to knock Trump or any candidate. But as a woman of Puerto Rican descent, I feel it's really important for us to really sit and discuss the pros and cons of each candidate. But especially as a woman,"" a local mom named Adrianna, who is supporting Harris in the election, told Fox News Digital.

BIDEN CLAIMS TO SEE THE ECONOMY THROUGH THE EYES OF SCRANTON, NOT WALL STREET

Adrianna is a mom to a young boy and said that inflation issues and childcare issues have rocked her day-to-day life as she has tried to find a daycare for her son for more than a year. When asked if she believes Harris will correct inflation if elected as president after serving as vice president for three and a half years, she responded, ""I hope so.""

""If you are a minority and a woman, what is the better choice?"" - Pennsylvania mom Adrianna

Adrianna said that while inflation concerns her, abortion is her top voting issue.

""I believe nobody should tell a woman what to do with her body, especially -- not to sound sexist -- but a man. I think that should be an individual decision that a woman should make,"" she said.

For Trump supporters, the economy, inflation, national security and immigration came in as top concerns for voters.

""The price of gas is a big issue with me. I do a lot of driving. And I remember back in the day, you know, when you got $20, it'd fill up your gas tank. It's just going up and up,"" Trump supporter John Soentgerath told Fox News Digital.

""With all due respect to my Democratic friends, I have a lot of them, [under] this previous administration there has been less take-home pay. The prices of gas [is] up, food. And I like to eat like anybody else. You tell me any mother or father that doesn't want to put food on the table for their kids, give them treats, ice cream, goodies and things of that nature,"" Soentgerath added.

Larry West of Scranton told Fox News Digital from a bus stop near The Marketplace at Steamtown that Trump earned his vote for his national security platform as wars continue raging in Ukraine and Israel, saying Harris appears ""weak"" on foreign affairs.

I don't feel that Kamala Harris has what it takes to represent the United States globally. - Scranton voter Larry West

Kveragas told Fox News Digital that he is an independent who ""voted against Hillary"" in 2016, before becoming a Trump supporter while evaluating the 45th president's record in office.

HARRIS SUPPORTERS IN PENNSYLVANIA SAY WORKING CLASS WILL SUPPORT HER

""He straightened out the economy. He got the border under control. He cut regulations. He did pretty much everything you would want a -- a realistic person would want -- a president to do. So with this election, it's primarily the economy, obviously. My retirement was up 40% under Trump. I lost the 40%, plus another 20% under Biden. So things are terrible there. The border, which we're being overrun. Obviously, it's not just a matter of jobs. It's a matter of housing and crime fighting, fentanyl, which has run rampant. Fentanyl is killing more people than guns,"" Kveragas said.

On the flip side, a Harris supporter who identified himself as Michael told Fox Digital that ""women's rights"" is his top priority this election cycle.

""I believe that every woman should have a choice to make their own decision,"" he said.

Michael explained that the economy and inflation have also affected his life, saying that he works two jobs to pay the bills and that expenses were much cheaper a decade ago. When asked if he feels Harris is better equipped to handle the economy over Trump, Michael argued that while Trump is a ""businessman,"" he will ""ruin the country.""

""Donald Trump, he is a businessman, yes. But he's going to ruin the country. He's going to ruin it. And Kamala Harris, you know, she is more steady-handed. She doesn't think with an iron fist, and we don't need that. We're not trying to go to war with China. [We're trying to] actually progress in this life. That's the only thing that we do in this life is to share information and progress,"" Michael said.

GOP GAINS VOTER ADVANTAGE IN PENNSYLVANIA SWING COUNTY NEAR BIDEN'S BIRTHPLACE

Trump's and Harris' campaigns have respectively heaped loads of attention on the Keystone State this year, with both candidates repeatedly visiting the massive state, from its rural areas in the rolling hills to industrial cities in the coal and rust belts that run across the state.

Fox News Digital spoke to both a Trump campaign volunteer and a Harris campaign volunteer, who both work to register Lackawanna voters, door knock and motivate residents to cast a ballot.

Susanne Green is a Trump campaign volunteer and former Democratic voter who began supporting Trump and Republicans in the last decade.

BIDEN'S HOMETOWN SPEAKS OUT ON BIDENOMICS

""I grew up in a Democrat household. Here in the valley in Lackawanna County, we believed in 'Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you could do for your country,'"" Green told Fox Digital, quoting President Kennedy's powerful inaugural address in 1961. ""And it really does choke me up some because it's truthful.""

Green said that her politics have not changed, but that the Democratic Party has morphed into something she can no longer identify with.

""I haven't changed. The Democrat Party changed. I was a Democrat. I registered as a Democrat when I turned 18, and I voted Democrat in every election until 2016, when I really saw that that wasn't the direction that our country needed. Our country really needs to really get back to patriotism and believing that our country is great,"" she said.

Green said that when she speaks to locals about the election to motivate them to vote, many Democratic voters will balk at the GOP's abortion platform. Green said she explains to such voters, most notably suburban women, that Republicans for Choice has long been a powerful vote in the party and that the GOP is not working to place a wholesale ban on abortion.

""I think we can all agree, or most of us can agree, that it should be legal and rare,"" Green said in a hat tip to the famous Bill Clinton formulation that abortions be ""safe, legal and rare,"" a sentiment that has since been purged from the party's platform in favor of more lax abortion access.

""That's how most women that I talk to in my experience over my whole lifetime have said that we wanted abortion to stay legal, but rare.""

Andrew Cutillo, a Harris campaign volunteer in Lackawanna County, spoke to Fox News Digital via a phone call this week and said that he has supported Harris since her campaign launch this summer and touted the VP as someone who can ""intuitively"" connect with Northeastern Pennsylvania voters based on her middle class upbringing.

""Kamala Harris is someone who, you know, intuitively understands what it's like to grow up or live in Northeast Pennsylvania and Scranton, Pennsylvania, as she grew up middle class. Her kind of focus has been on building a strong middle class,"" Cutillo said. ""Her focus is on supporting families and understanding what families and communities need, that they can live their lives, that they can not worry about paying grocery bills, not worry about paying all the expenses that come with just trying to raise your family.""

Cutillo added that when he's out door-knocking or speaking with traditionally Republican voters, including his own dad, people have pulled away from Trump because they are ""concerned for democracy,"" and view Harris as a potential president who would ""govern for the people who don't agree with her, too.""

He said despite the fevered political focus on Scranton and Pennsylvania at large this election cycle, Republican and Democratic neighbors in Northeastern Pennsylvania have and will remain friends no matter how the election shakes out despite any portrayal of ""divisiveness"" in the battleground state.

Voters in the area remarked that they have been inundated with campaign efforts, with West saying he's ignored some of the door knockers.

""I'm flooded with ads, flooded. They have knocked on the door. But I didn't answer the door because I saw what it was. But we are definitely bombarded with ads,"" West said.

Soentgerath said that he's seen ""a big push from both sides. And again, with all due respect to either side, the bottom line is, if you want change, get up, go to work and pull that lever on Nov. 5.""

While Michael remarked that while he hasn't seen ""too much out here yet,"" he noted he has seen more Trump ads than Harris ads.

""So that just means we need to work harder,"" Michael said.

Tony Monopoli is a Scranton native who has since moved to another key battleground state, Georgia, and told Fox News Digital that he is supporting Harris in the election. Monopoli was visiting Scranton with his brothers and spoke to Fox News Digital outside of the Lackawanna County Courthouse, where there is a veterans memorial.

""I think her plans to support small businesses by offering a $50,000 tax credit for small business owners is a big deal. I think her plan to offer $25,000 in first-time homebuyers' assistance is a big deal, given the cost of homes today. And also, the $6,000 child tax credit for the first year of a child's life is a big deal,"" he explained of his support of Harris.

Fox Digital asked Monopoli if he's seen more or less campaigning efforts from either candidate in Pennsylvania vs. Georgia, where both candidates are also heavily campaigning for votes.

""I'd say it's about the same,"" he said. Remarking that he hasn't ""really seen any different"" in either area.

Pennsylvania will again serve as a key battleground state this election cycle as former President Donald Trump and President Biden are anticipated to face a rematch in a state that narrowly voted for Trump in 2016, and elected Biden in 2020 at a 1.17% margin.

For Soentgerath, he encouraged voters to do their own homework before casting their ballots, leaning on his concerns over the economy, he said voters should simply review their pay stubs from just a few years ago to help determine their vote.

Vance-Walz Debate: Here's What To Know -- Including How To Watch,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/09/30/vance-walz-debate-heres-what-to-know-including-how-to-watch/,2024-09-30T19:48:55Z,"Republican vice presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Democratic vice presidential candidate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will debate Tuesday on CBS in their first faceoff and what could be the final debate of the 2024 presidential campaign.

Tuesday, Oct. 1 at 9 p.m. ET on CBS News from the network's studios in Philadelphia, without a live audience. The debate will be broadcast by all CBS local affiliates, simulcast by most major networks and available for live-streaming on the websites of most major news networks.

The candidates will have two minutes to answer questions during the 90-minute debate, two minutes to respond and one minute for additional rebuttals. There will be no opening statements and the candidates will each have two minutes for closing statements. Vance won the coin toss to give the final word. Candidates will not be given questions in advance, nor will they be allowed to interact with campaign staff or have pre-written notes during the debate.

""CBS Evening News"" anchor Norah O'Donnell and ""Face the Nation"" moderator and chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan.

Neither an agreement nor a proposal for a second debate has been made public.

Harris immediately challenged Trump to a rematch at the conclusion of their first debate earlier this month, but Trump has said he won't debate her again, insisting Harris only wants a rematch because he ""won"" the first faceoff.

More Americans view Walz favorably (39% vs. 34%) than they do Vance, and more say Walz is qualified to serve as president if necessary than Vance (35% versus 30%), according to a September Pew Research survey of U.S. adults.

Vance, a former Marine and Iraq war veteran, seized on criticism of Walz's military record soon after Walz's entrance into the race, accusing him of ""stolen valor."" Walz, for years, has faced allegations from some of his fellow guardsmen of retiring from the National Guard to avoid being deployed to Iraq, though others who served alongside Walz have defended him and said he had discussed retiring to run for Congress months before his unit's deployment was announced. Republicans have labeled both Harris and Vance as far-left, and have coined the nickname ""Tampon Tim"" for Walz, in reference to a law he signed as governor requiring menstrual products be available in restrooms used by students in grades 4-12 in public schools to ensure transgender students have access to them.

Vance has faced a string of controversies since joining Trump's ticket. Resurfaced comments he made in 2021 about ""childless cat ladies"" running the Democratic Party drew widespread scrutiny, and he is widely credited with amplifying the baseless claim that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, were abducting and eating residents' house pets, leading to increased threats of violence in Springfield. Walz has repeatedly referred to Vance and Trump as ""weird"" throughout the summer, popularizing the attack line among Democrats. And Harris' campaign has cited Vance's prior public comments in support of making abortion illegal nationwide, as Trump and Vance seek to distance themselves from the idea.

Trump tapped Vance as his running mate in July at the start of the Republican National Convention. Harris chose Walz about three weeks after launching her own campaign on July 21 when President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. Both hail from the Midwest and are relatively new to the national political scene. Vance was first elected to public office in the 2022 midterm, and Walz was relatively unknown to voters on a national level prior to him joining Harris' ticket.

Latest polling shows former President Donald Trump closing in on Harris in the key battleground states of both Michigan and neighboring Wisconsin.

Michigan is once again a key battleground state this year, as Harris and Trump zigzag campaign events across the state, as well as in other key states such as Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin.

The Axios article noted that if Trump secures votes from the Sunbelt States across the southern portion of the U.S., he would only need to win either Michigan, Wisconsin or Pennsylvania to declare victory. While Harris' easiest path to victory is locking down Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

Trump won Michigan in his 2016 election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by a 0.23% margin. President Biden won by 2.78% in the state in 2020 when he faced off against Trump.

"Newsom vetoes slew of bills over the weekend, bucks Dem legislature on progressive initiatives",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/newsom-vetoes-slew-bills-over-weekend-bucks-dem-legislature-progressive-initiatives,2024-09-30T18:01:17Z,"Co-hosts on 'The Big Weekend Show' discuss Gov. Gavin Newsom's latest attempts to continue to expand benefits for illegal migrants in the state of California.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom tossed out a slew of bills over the weekend, bucking several of his Democratic Party's more progressive initiatives on things like standards for transgender care, regulating gas stoves and providing additional benefits for noncitizens.

Newsom, who has had to review more than 1,000 bills over the last few months ahead of Monday's legislative deadline, vetoed AB 2442, AB 2513 and SB 227.

AB 2442, which would have expedited medical licenses for applicants seeking to perform transgender surgical procedures and abortions, was declined by Newsom on Friday.

NEWSOM'S DEEPFAKE ELECTION LAWS ARE ALREADY BEING CHALLENGED IN FEDERAL COURT

""As the number of applicants who qualify for expedited licensure grows through legislation, the benefits of mandated prioritization may start to diminish, at the expense of potential negative impacts to other applicants,"" Newsom said in his veto letter. ""Additionally, the increase in staff needed to ensure expedited applications may lead to licensing fee increases.""

AB 2513 - a bill that would have required gas stoves to be sold with a warning label on them for potential toxins emitted - was also a hotly debated bill in the legislature but ultimately shot down by Newsom and dubbed a ""static approach"" that would fail to allow for timely updates to labeling content according to the most up-to-date scientific knowledge.

""While I appreciate the author's intent to provide consumers with information about the products they purchase, I am concerned that this bill codifies highly prescriptive labeling content that could only be changed by a future statutory amendment,"" Newsom said in the veto letter.

Among the progressive bills shot down was also SB 227, which would've required the Employment Development Department (EDD) to create an Excluded Workers Program to provide unemployment-style benefits to noncitizens.

Newsom said that while ""California has taken taken important steps to advance inclusion and equity for undocumented workers and mixed-status families who contribute significantly to California's economy and local communities,"" Congress must uphold its duty to create solutions that offer a legitimate pathway to citizenship for long-term residents who have made significant contributions.

NEWSOM VETOES BILL THAT WOULD LET NONCITIZEN STUDENTS WORK AT STATE'S PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES

""We can have a fair immigration system that works for families, U.S. workers, and employers, and also have a safe border,"" Newsom said. ""However, this bill sets impractical timelines, has operational issues, and requires funding that was not included in the budget.""

Also on Sunday, Newsom vetoed a bill to create safety measures for large artificial intelligence models, which would have been the first such law in the nation.

Some high-profile bipartisan bills aren't immune to being tossed out, either. Last week, Newsom vetoed a bipartisan accountability legislation that would've required more accountability and data reporting on the state's spiraling homelessness crisis.

Already, Newsom has signed a package of public safety bills aimed at reducing organized retail theft. He's also vetoed a number of progressive bills, including several that would have expanded aid to illegal immigrants through housing loans and permitted employment through the University of California (UC) system, and a reparations package for Black residents.

Promising to tackle the mental health crisis among young people, the blue state governor also signed a historic bill restricting cellphones in schools.

Newsom often vetoes bills if they appear redundant or the cost would further burden the state's budget shortfall, according to a CalMatters analysis.

Former President Trump has narrowed Vice President Kamala Harris' small lead in the battleground states of Michigan and Wisconsin, new polling by the New York Times/Siena College finds.

Among likely voters in Michigan, Harris received 48% support, while Trump garnered 47%, locking the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees in an essential tie well within the poll's margin of error. Harris polled at 49% among likely voters in Wisconsin, while Trump received 47% support in the same state where polls usually overestimate backing for Democrats, according to the Times.

The Times pointed to the economy, which remains the most important issue for voters, as Trump's strength on economic issues helps him edge away at Harris' slim lead in the two northern battlegrounds.

The new poll contrasts with August's New York Times/Siena College survey, which has Harris leading Trump by four percentage points, 50% to 46% among likely voters, in the battlegrounds of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania as well. That poll was the first conducted as the race reshaped with Harris becoming the presidential nominee following President Biden's July departure from the contest.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS, TRUMP IN CLOSE RACE IN NORTH CAROLINA

Now with less than 40 days until the Nov. 5 election, New York Times/Siena College polling places Harris ahead of Trump by nine percentage points in Nebraska's Second Congressional District, whose sole electoral vote could be critical in the Electoral College. The Times says Harris could receive exactly 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House if she picks up that district - given the vice president also wins Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania and Trump is victorious in the Sun Belt battleground states.

Though Ohio does not fall into the battleground state category for the presidential race, it's home to one of the nation's most competitive Senate contests between Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown and GOP challenger Bernie Moreno. New York Times/Siena College polling has Trump six points ahead of Harris in Ohio, whereas Brown leads Moreno by four points.

Democrats have enjoyed an advantage for months in presidential contest polling in Wisconsin, which has been determined by less than a percentage point in four of the last six elections, including the 2020 race, the Times notes. Meanwhile, Biden carried Michigan by three points in 2020, while Trump won that Wolverine State in 2016 by three-tenths of a point.

Abortion was placed as the second most important issue among Michigan and Wisconsin voters.

The new poll found 18% of voters in the two states listed abortion as their top issue, noting an uptick since May when 13% of voters in Michigan and Wisconsin marked it as their determining cause. On abortion, Harris leads Trump by 20 points in Michigan, but now only by 13 points in Wisconsin. Harris had a 22-point lead over Trump in August on the abortion issue in the Badger State."
Maryland seemed poised this year to legalize medical aid in dying. What happened?,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/09/29/nx-s1-5130007/maryland-terminal-cancer-legalize-medical-aid-in-dying-physician-assisted-suicide,2024-09-30T11:03:45Z,"For advocates of medical aid in dying, it seemed like the political stars were finally aligning in Maryland.

Many predicted the legislature had enough votes in the 2024 session to finally legalize the practice, after years of failed attempts and near misses.

State Senate President Bill Ferguson felt like the bill had a good chance.

""I believe it will pass the Senate,"" Ferguson said in January, at the start of the legislative session. ""I expect it to be a topic of important conversation this year.""

In the most recent survey, 74% of Americans believe terminal patients should have the right to painlessly end their lives. A majority of Americans have supported that right in every Gallup poll since 1996.

Oregon first legalized the practice in 1994. Since then nine other states and the District of Columbia have followed suit with similar laws.

Technically, medical aid in dying is ""the act of prescribing lethal medications to a consenting patient who can self-ingest them with the intent of hastening their death,"" according to the Journal of the Advanced Practitioner in Oncology. (Most patients who have used the process have cancer.)

The current state laws lay down similar regulatory guardrails to ensure a patient are making an informed, voluntary decision and are mentally competent to oversee their own medical care.

For example, the Maryland bill required the patient to navigate multiple requests and waiting periods before obtaining the legal medications. The patient must have a prognosis of six months or less to live, and must be physically able to take the medication themselves.

In Maryland, a 2024 poll found 70% of Marylanders support medical aid in dying.

In 2019, a Maryland bill stalled after a tie vote. In 2024, the opportunity seemed ripe for supporters and allied legislators to try again.

Support or opposition to medical aid in dying does not always break along traditional partisan lines. Still, the practice does tend to garner more support from Democrats.

In Maryland, Democrats hold a comfortable majority in both houses of the General Assembly. In 2022, a Democrat, Wes Moore, won the governorship after eight years under Republican Larry Hogan. Moore had indicated he'd sign a bill, if it made it to his desk.

""I think there is a slight partisan element to it,"" said Peg Sandeen, the CEO of Death with Dignity, an organization that advocates for medical aid in dying. ""But, that's not the dominant breakdown here of the vote. We will have Republicans who are voting for this bill in the end, and some Democrats who vote against it.""

In the end, the bill failed by a single vote. The failure shows how controversial medical aid in dying remains, and how Democrats are by no means united around the issue.

Although party affiliation plays a role, cultural and religious beliefs can split and fragment the vote on this issue.

""The Catholics are very much against the bill. Also, a lot of the African Americans don't like it. It seems they feel it's against their religion,"" said Ron Young, a former Democratic state senator, who had previously sponsored and supported medical aid in dying bills.

""Maryland is progressive, but it's also very diverse,"" said Donna Smith, an advocate with Compassion and Choices, which lobbies for aid in dying. ""The African American legislators represent about 30% of the legislators in Maryland. And so it's very hard to get anything passed without some of their support.""

The Black community in Maryland is a formidable voting bloc and one that legislators listen to closely, according to former state senator Ron Young. And a large percentage of Black voters oppose medical aid in dying, Young said.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Maryland is 32% Black, making it the state with the sixth highest Black population in the nation.

While the Black community isn't a monolith, there are enough who balk at the idea of medical aid in dying.

""I'm a Baptist. I don't believe in people killing themselves. Number one rule,"" said Reggie Carter, a Black voter in Maryland.

But other Black voters are open to the idea. Gee Blue, who is Muslim, said he had complicated feelings about the issue.

""It does go against a lot of religion, but I feel like personal choice is beyond religion sometimes,"" Blue said.

State Senator Malcom Augustine, a Democrat, represents Prince George's County, which has the highest Black population in Maryland. He voted against the bill in 2019 and continues to oppose it.

""What I was hearing from constituents was that this was a very, very personal and very difficult policy decision,"" he said.

Augustine said his concerns are based in fears that nursing homes might coerce people into making a decision they hadn't thought through.

Then, there is the Catholic Church, an entity that has fought for what it calls the ""sanctity of life.""

""There's people with a lot of money and a lot of power that oppose it,"" said Thaddeus Pope, a clinical ethicist at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

""Traditionally, the Catholic Church has been one of the biggest opponents. And, they have spent a lot of money in many states opposing this. It's sort of the same parties that are involved with abortion. It's not just the Catholic Church, but it's pro-life advocacy organizations.""

Pope added that after the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade, some of those organizations had more time and resources available to lobby against medical aid in dying.

Political observers and advocates agree that Maryland has a patchwork of cultures and constituencies that legislators still must cater to in their local districts.

Given those nuances, a few ""no"" votes can block any piece of legislation, despite the legislators' shared party affiliation.

""The thing about the legislative process is there's so many little gates a bill has to pass through,"" Pope said. ""The opposition doesn't need all the votes, they just need to be able to block any one of those gates that it needs to pass through and they win.""

In Maryland, the gate shut in the General Assembly when one senator changed her mind.

In neighboring Delaware, which also has a majority Democratic government, a similar aid in dying bill passed the Delaware House and then squeaked through the state Senate with an 11-10 vote on June 25.

But on Sept. 20, Delaware Governor John Carney vetoed it. Carney, a Catholic, said he is ""fundamentally and morally opposed to state law enabling someone, even under tragic and painful circumstances, to take their own life.""

Supporters in both states say they'll keep talking and lobbying, hoping that both voters and their representatives gradually become more comfortable with the issue."
Vance and Walz debate in New York City on Tuesday.

Vice presidential candidates Ohio Sen. JD Vance (R) and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) will face off in a debate Tuesday for the 2024 election cycle.

This will be the only time the candidates meet on stage and simultaneously present their policy positions to the broader American public, which may be less familiar with them than with their partners on the presidential ticket.

The two hold similar roles in their respective campaigns: to appeal to working-class voters in the ""Blue Wall"" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin this fall.

Here's what you need to know about what is historically the only debate between the candidates for vice president.

When and how to watch?

This debate will be hosted by CBS News in New York City at 9 p.m. ET.

CBS Evening News anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell and Face the Nation moderator and chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan will moderate the debate at the CBS Broadcast Center. The debate will air live on CBS, CBS News Streaming Network and Paramount+ and stream live without a cable login on CBSNews.com.

Follow NPR's live blog on Tuesday for the latest updates, analysis, fact-checking and color -- and also watch the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate Simulcast. And you can listen to NPR's special debate coverage on many public radio stations and in the NPR app.

Who are the running mates?

Former President Donald Trump announced Vance as his running mate on the first day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this summer.

The first-term senator, who was once a critic of Trump, came to political relevance when he wrote the book Hillbilly Elegy, blaming Biden and Democrats for the struggles of the rural economy he grew up in. In the Senate, Vance has positioned himself against Republican leadership at times but on issues like abortion, immigration and election integrity, he's closely aligned with Trump.

Vice President Harris chose Walz just weeks after she was tapped to replace President Biden at the top of the ticket.

Walz got the nickname ""Coach Walz"" for being a former football coach and teacher. As governor, Walz secured several progressive wins in his state, including clean energy mandates, universal free school meals, family and medical leave benefits and abortion protections.

What to watch for

Since his nomination, Vance has had to address controversies that are likely to come up again during the debate, including couch-related jokes and criticisms of him calling prominent Democrats ""childless cat ladies."" Vance has also come under fire for spreading the false claim that Haitian immigrants are eating pets in Ohio.

Walz, a two-term governor, has also faced questions about his response to riots in Minneapolis following the 2020 murder of George Floyd and widespread fraud during COVID-19 under a federal program intended to provide food assistance to students after schools closed. Audits have suggested lapses in oversight by the state Department of Education.

Walz has been getting help for the debate from Pete Buttigieg, the U.S. Transportation Secretary. Buttigieg helped Harris with her VP debate prep in 2020. It wasn't immediately clear whom Vance is preparing with.

The military records of both candidates are also likely to come up.

Vance criticized Walz for his military record, including for saying he carried weapons ""in war"" when he had not been in combat.

Walz, who served in the National Guard for 20 years and reenlisted after Sept. 11, only saw wartime deployment to Italy in 2003. Vance, who served in the Marines and did a six-month deployment to Iraq, also has not seen combat.

What are the rules for the debate?

The debate will last 90 minutes and both campaigns have agreed to a set of rules.

There will be no audience in attendance, and the candidates will each take a stand behind podiums. Candidates will have two minutes for closing statements. Vance won a virtual coin toss on Sept. 26 and elected to go second with his closing statement.

Vance and Walz will not be allowed to have prewritten notes or props, and topics and questions will not be shared in advance with campaigns. Unlike the presidential debates, microphones will remain on but CBS News reserves the right to turn them off.

According to CBS News, each candidate will get two minutes to answer each question, and the other candidate will get two minutes to respond. Then, each candidate gets one minute for further rebuttals. At the discretion of the moderators, candidates may get an additional minute each to continue a discussion.

What comes next?

This is likely to be the last debate before Election Day. Across several states, mail ballots have already started going out.

Harris challenged Trump to one more debate on Oct. 23 but Trump declined, saying it was ""too late."""
3 women from different backgrounds detail why they're voting for Harris,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/nx-s1-5123647/kamala-harris-georgia-women-vote-election-2024,2024-09-30T09:06:18Z,"Eustacia McCloud Carter, Latrice Cushenberry and Donna Smith Aranson sat down with NPR in mid September. Nydia Blas for NPR hide caption

The state of Georgia has never elected a female governor or U.S. senator. So, given that fact, we wanted to know: Are Georgians ready to make history and cast their 16 electoral votes for the first woman president?

In mid-September, NPR sat down with three women of different ages, races and religions who have seen politics in Georgia evolve through multiple election cycles. Each said they were voting for Kamala Harris this November, and detailed what her candidacy meant to them.

Read and listen to more of All Things Considered's recent trip to Georgia, including interviews with the secretary of state and Georgia GOP chairman.

For Latrice Cushenberry, Harris feels familiar.

""She is someone that I have seen repeatedly throughout my lifetime in my grandmother, my mother, my aunt -- [a] capable, competent African American person that basically can get the job done with empathy and compassion,"" she said.

So when Cushenberry saw Harris become the Democratic candidate for president, she says she saw someone ascending to a position that has always existed in her life: ""Of authority, of really making certain that everyone is cared for and making certain that everyone is represented.""

The fact Harris is a woman of color also resonated for Cushenberry and made her think of what she had experienced in her own life.

""I'm a person that works in a company where I'm the only person that looks the way I look,"" she said. ""I think it's important for her to be the most capable, to be the most competent. And her gender and her race is just a part of her, of who she is as a person. She shouldn't lead with that, I don't think, but it is critical for people to understand ... that people of color are capable.""

And Cushenberry believes Harris' ascension has helped redefine this narrative around people of color.

""Thank God, because it's quite exhausting, to be honest with you. It's exhausting to have to be in a constant state of proving because of the color of your skin.""

Eustacia McCloud Carter is a 20-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force and has lived in Georgia since 1998. She says it took her some time to come around to the idea of Harris at the top of the ticket.

""I was all-in for Joe Biden. I didn't care if we had to put him in a wheelchair, motorized, five oxygen tanks on his back,"" she said. ""And I was not liking the way that he was being coerced to leave. I just felt like he was a statesman and he deserved a little more respect than that.""

After Biden stepped aside, McLoud Carter said she took some time to grieve what had changed, but that once she came out of her ""mourning period"" she was all-in for Harris.

McCloud Carter believes much of the challenge in getting a woman in the White House has to do with the way that some men view women and their roles in society -- something she qualifies as a ""fallacy.""

""They see it that way, that we need to be barefoot, pregnant, in the kitchen,"" she said. ""I did a canvas of my team of 50 barber and beauty shops, and that is the one thing I heard when I went in there, especially in the African American barbershops, 'I'm voting for Trump.' And they like Donald Trump. He comes out with that machoism.""

McCloud Carter said she doesn't think all men believe this, but that there is a large part of the country that does.

""I was never raised that way. I have a father who always told me and my three sisters, 'You can be anything you want to be.'""

Donna Smith Aranson has lived in Atlanta her entire life and has volunteered for Hillary Clinton and both of Stacey Abrams' gubernatorial campaigns.

She feels the state is ready to elect the first female president.

""It's been an evolution. I think in our last election cycle ... we elected two senators who are unique in their positions, Reverend Warnock and Jon Ossoff,"" she said. ""And I'm proud to say that I voted for both of them and campaigned for both of them. Is it time for a woman? God, I hope so. I do hope so.""

""I think that women have always taken second place. I think the stand on abortion and all of the things that matter to women specifically are strong issues that [Harris] backs. And that's not to say that men don't either. But ... it feels more personal when it comes from a woman.""

Smith Aranson says she has seen a change over time, and that each election cycle she is watching stronger women step up. She is personally excited to see a woman running for the presidency, but adds that she's glad that Harris has not made her gender or race the central focus of her campaign.

""She has to appeal to all people, all genders, all religions,"" she said."

Opinion | This new law is likely to make Louisiana's maternal mortality problem worse,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/louisiana-abortion-pill-law-misoprostol-obgyn-rcna172561,2024-09-29T14:11:25Z,"By Dr. Veronica Gillispie-Bell, board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist

Imagine a mother on the brink of a fatal hemorrhage after childbirth. The medicine that could save her life is delayed -- not because it isn't available but because of new bureaucratic hurdles that make that medicine more difficult to quickly obtain. Beginning Tuesday, Oct. 1, doctors and nurses in Louisiana will be expected to navigate those unnecessary hurdles, and as an OB-GYN whose patients expect me to give the best care to them (and their babies), I'm convinced that this new law endangers them.

Starting Tuesday, misoprostol and mifepristone will be categorized in Louisiana as Schedule IV medications, that is, categorized as drugs with a potential for abuse and risk of dependence. The new law was drafted by a lawmaker whose brother-in-law was convicted and sentenced to jail after secretly putting misoprostol in his wife's (the lawmaker's sister's) water in a failed attempt to induce an abortion. As horrible as that crime was, it doesn't warrant a law that will make it more likely that women in Louisiana will bleed out after childbirth.

But that's what this new law will do. Health care providers and hospitals will be required to secure misoprostol and mifepristone the same way we secure opioids. On the surface, it might seem like a good idea to put such restrictions on medications used to induce abortions. However, misoprostol plays a crucial role in treating complications during childbirth, when every second counts. Though it's not the first-line treatment, misoprostol is used to treat postpartum hemorrhage, one of the leading causes of maternal mortality.

The U.S. has the highest maternal mortality rate of all high-income countries, and those maternal mortality rates are highest in the Gulf South, a region that includes Louisiana. And, according to data on maternal deaths in the U.S. in 2020, hemorrhage was a leading cause of such deaths. Through state perinatal quality collaboratives, we have made strides in improving severe maternal outcomes, including maternal hemorrhage. We've achieved this by implementing Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health (AIM) Patient Safety Bundles that ensure readiness, recognition, response and prevention for every patient, every unit, every time.

The law that goes into effect Tuesday threatens to derail that progress. I'm one of nearly 300 doctors and medical students in Louisiana who expressed this concern to lawmakers during the legislative process and asked them not to pass this bill.

Because misoprostol will now be classified as a Schedule IV medication requiring multiple layers of security to access, the state health department, hospital administrators, attorneys and physicians are left to figure out how to comply with regulations for controlled substances and still keep their patients safe.

This new law is another example of a dangerous trend affecting the medical community -- the creation of laws that impede physicians' and other providers' ability to provide medical care based on their own expertise, using evidence-based guidelines. Across the country, such laws are interrupting the provider-patient relationship -- in ways that are potentially deadly. For example, 15 states have laws that require physicians to tell their patients they can reverse their induced abortion. Not only is there no science to support this claim, a clinical trial to determine the chances of reversal had to be stopped prematurely because so many patients were hemorrhaging.

Not only do laws like the one about to go into effect in Louisiana make childbirth more dangerous, they also accelerate doctor shortages. Public policies that affect physicians' ability to practice medicine are leading to moral distress, fear of imprisonment and plans to stop practicing in specific states. Laws that make criminals of physicians who provide health care consistent with evidence-based practices further contribute to the stressors we physicians already feel. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022, the number of medical students applying for residency programs of any specialty has decreased in the states with the strictest abortion laws. Fewer doctors, particularly fewer OB-GYNS, will further worsen the dismal maternal outcomes in states -- and create more maternity care deserts.

In improving maternal and infant outcomes, there is a role for lawmakers to play. Specifically, we need legislative support for the processes and programs we know are reducing maternal mortality and infant mortality. We need lawmakers to expand perinatal quality collaboratives and encourage more hospitals to implement AIM Patient Safety Bundles. We need lawmakers to address the social factors -- access to education, economic stability, child care and transportation -- that are responsible for 80% of poor maternal outcomes for our patients.

The U.S. is the only high-income country that does not guarantee paid parental leave and the only one that does not provide home visits during the postpartum phase.

I believe that all of us -- including physicians and lawmakers -- want to improve the health of women and children. We will only get there if we work together. But if laws that undermine medical practice aren't changed, and urgently, then the progress we've made reducing maternal mortality will be reversed. Lawmakers must engage with physicians to craft evidence-based policies that protect our patients, not increase their risk of death.

I have spent my career ensuring women have options for their care -- obstetric and gynecologic -- and guiding the implementation of evidence-based best practices. I care about the women of Louisiana and beyond who need doctors to treat them, care for them and speak up for them. I urge our legislators to listen to our expertise."
Inside Democrats' campaign to redefine the word 'freedom',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/inside-democrats-campaign-redefine-word-freedom,2024-09-28T12:07:51Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Democratic presidential candidate current Vice President Kamala Harris used the word ""freedom"" 11 times in a campaign speech this week, emphasizing, as she does repeatedly, the ""freedom of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body.""

It's the latest example of how, according to ABC News and The New Yorker, Democrats are attempting to take ownership of the word ""freedom."" The New Yorker explains: ""Democrats' years-long efforts to reclaim the word are cresting in this year's Presidential race.""

It really takes some nerve for Democrats to try to revamp as ""freedom"" their usual proposals on not just abortion and voting, but also gun control, climate and LGBT issues. In reality, Democrats aim to restrict our First and Second Amendment rights and more.

CNN HOST KASIE HUNT SAYS HARRIS IS 'REPUBLICAN' AND TRUMP IS 'LIBERAL' ON THEIR ECONOMIC POLICIES

Harris has made ""freedom"" the theme of her campaign. She says the word frequently in her speeches. Her campaign's song is ""Freedom"" by Beyoncé. The word ""freedom"" appears 24 times in her campaign website's issues section. Freedom was emphasized in her first campaign video and in her speech at the Democrats' convention.

""In this election, many fundamental freedoms are at stake,"" Harris's campaign website says. Harris and running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz ""will always fight for the freedom to breathe clean air, drink clean water, and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis,"" according to their campaign website.

Harris's presidential campaign website's policy section makes no mention of our most important freedoms, enshrined in the First Amendment -- the ""free exercise"" of religion, ""freedom of speech, or of the press"" (former President Donald Trump's campaign does). Someone should tell the Democrats that those are first in the Bill of Rights for a reason.

Walz has said he sees ""no guarantee for free speech"" related to misinformation and hate speech. But such speech is constitutionally protected, otherwise the government would be in the position of regulating what is acceptable speech and it could suppress dissent or label information it doesn't like as ""misinformation.""

The better approach is to allow for free speech, but to have open debate and condemn hateful speech. We've seen the alternative play out: The Biden-Harris White House pressured Big Tech companies to censor Americans because of their views on COVID-19. In 2019, Harris called on then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to suspend Trump's account.

Americans likely won't have the freedom to use correct pronouns if Harris wins election. The Biden-Harris administration wants to make it a civil rights violation if someone uses scientifically accurate pronouns contrary to a gender-confused person's preferences.

For Democrats, ""reproductive freedom"" is the freedom they most want to defend. The verbal forced marriage of ""reproductive"" and ""freedom"" is another stretch. Try as they might, reproduction, including via in-vitro fertilization, can't be divorced from its many consequences -- such as producing children. That's just science.

In the presidential debate, Harris used the word ""freedom"" only in reference to abortion. ""I will be a president that will protect our fundamental rights and freedoms including the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do,"" Harris said (she's fine with the government telling you what to do on a host of other issues).

But the freedom to abort an unborn child is not real freedom. In a truly free society, one person cannot be free to take another's liberty. An unborn child is not part of a woman's body or her property -- it is a separate human being with its own rights. In taking the life of an unborn child, a woman is taking away the most basic of all rights.

Twisting the word further, Harris says she wants to defend the ""freedom to vote."" But that's no more true of Democrats than Republicans. Both sides want to enact election laws that favor their party. But Republicans want to make our election system more secure.

In fact, Democrats have taken their own voters' freedom this presidential election. It's the Democratic Party that ousted its incumbent, prevented a real primary challenge, and has fought any independent challenger. Nor have Democrats given Republicans the freedom to vote. Democrats, along with other lawfare, have pushed claims to kick Trump off the ballot.

Harris says she'll also defend ""the freedom to love who you love openly."" The reality is she'll take parents' rights.

Her first campaign video shows crowds waving pride flags as Harris says ""we choose freedom."" But the LGBT community is far from closeted - pride parades often feature half-naked adults in public in front of children.

Conservatives want the freedom to protect their children from ideologies that are counter to their beliefs, including sexually explicit books that are inappropriate for children. Democrats misleadingly call these efforts ""book bans,"" but by this logic, movie ratings are ""movie bans"" because young children aren't supposed to see R-rated movies.

Women won't be free under a Harris administration. She won't defend women's rights to keep biological men out of their bathrooms, locker rooms, sports or sororities.

Harris would restrict the Second Amendment, yet her campaign casts gun control in the light of freedom: ""As President, she won't stop fighting so that Americans have the freedom to live safe from gun violence in our schools, communities, and places of worship.""

Americans likely won't have the freedom to use correct pronouns if Harris wins election. The Biden-Harris administration wants to make it a civil rights violation if someone uses scientifically accurate pronouns contrary to a gender-confused person's preferences.

Harris's promises of freedom and joy (another of her themes) sound as vacuous as former President Barack Obama's campaign of ""hope and change."" The Democrats want to impose more government control on Americans, including with expensive and ineffective economic and environmental policies.

Republicans also want clean air, but acknowledge that more environmental regulation costs Americans money in higher energy, housing and other costs. Being energy-independent prevents funding foreign authoritarian governments.

Yes, Democrats believe in the ""freedoms"" of abortion, being LGBT, and voting without ID -- but they don't believe in First and Second Amendment rights, a woman's right to not have men in female-only spaces, parents' rights or energy independence."

Vice presidential debates have produced many memorable moments, but it's hard to say any has made a decisive difference in the election outcome.

This year the anticipation may be higher than in the past, if only because the race is so close and neither candidate seems to have a clear advantage. The debate may provide the moment of decision for some voters and even a tipping point in a closely balanced electorate.

Much of the electorate is still getting to know the running mates chosen by former President Donald Trump and Vice President Harris. Trump's choice, Ohio's JD Vance, has only been in the Senate since last year and Harris' Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota has not previously campaigned for office outside his home state.

All 11 previous running mate debates have taken place in the month of October, just as the media and campaign aficionados find themselves needing a new angle on the presidential race. They have usually been mixed in with multiple debates between the presidential candidates themselves. But after one meeting with Harris, Trump is saying it is too late for another. So the Vance-Walz debate appears to offer the campaign's last live confrontation.

That makes this October 1 match in New York seem far more important than the VP's usual ""undercard"" status: In boxing terms, it could be the main event of the campaign's final month. That expectation and tension have hovered over the Battle of the Twos in every four-year cycle for decades now, and it's worth recalling how much media heat and drama they have generated.

Rewind to the first one

The first vice presidential debate was in 1976, the year of America's Bicentennial, when the political system needed something to restore people's faith. The nation was emerging from a decade of dissension, dispirited by the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandals that forced President Richard Nixon from office.

The 1976 presidential contest was between the unelected incumbent Republican Gerald Ford, who had been Nixon's vice president, and a newcomer named Jimmy Carter, the former governor of Georgia. (Carter will turn 100 on Tuesday, the day of the Vance-Walz debate.)

In that year, both nominees reached out to the disaffected in their own parties with their vice presidential picks. Ford chose Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, a conservative he hoped would placate those who had preferred Ronald Reagan as that year's GOP presidential nominee. Carter, a Southern moderate, chose the well-known liberal Sen. Walter Mondale of Minnesota. Both men would later rise to the top of the ticket in their respective parties, but neither would ever win the White House.

Their debate in 1976 has been remembered chiefly for a phrase uttered by Dole when talking about foreign policy. A decorated veteran of the Second World War, Dole referred to the several conflicts of the 20th century as ""Democrat wars."" Indeed, there had been Democrats in office when each of the world wars and the Korean conflict began, but support for U.S. participation had been generally bipartisan. Dole seemed to be tapping a well of isolationist sentiment long dormant in the GOP - but never extinct.

The Dole controversy lasted a few days and provided videotape for later discussions of his career, but if it did any damage it was hard to discern in November's outcome. Ford, who had been far behind Carter in the early fall, closed the gap in the closing days and nearly won.

1980 and 1984: Mondale, Bush and Ferraro

In 1980 the VP nominees were Mondale and former congressman and CIA Director George H.W. Bush, the No. 2 for Reagan, who had won the Republican presidential nomination on his third try. The debate was scheduled for Louisville, Ky., on October 2 but canceled three days earlier when both Mondale and Bush declined to attend. There had been disagreements over the inclusion of a third candidate, Patrick Lucey, the former governor of Wisconsin who was the running mate of independent candidate John Anderson that year.

Bush was back as the incumbent vice president in 1984 and game for a debate with the first woman ever included on a major party's national ticket, Rep. Geraldine Ferraro of New York. Ferraro, a former prosecutor, was poised and assured and gave Democrats a shot in the arm. At one point she took exception to Bush's dismissive tone: ""I almost resent ... your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy.""

Mondale was also back that fall, at the top of the Democratic ticket, and having done well in his first debate with Reagan, he took to featuring that performance and Ferraro's in his campaign appearances. ""Have you been watching the debates?"" he would ask, and the crowds, such as they were, would roar.

Bush generated a ruckus after the debate when an open microphone overheard him saying he had ""tried to kick a little ass."" But none of the back and forth over the debates that autumn could have mattered much Reagan was cruising toward a second term and won every state but Mondale's Minnesota, where he came within one-fifth of one percentage point.

VP debates' single greatest hit

Perhaps the best illustration of vice presidential debates elevating a candidate who would still lose in the election Lloyd Bentsen, the silver-haired Texas senator who ran with Democrat Michael S. Dukakis in 1988. Bentsen had the stature in Washington and also the appeal to the heartland that Dukakis lacked. He had also taken the measure of the youthful senator from Indiana whom Bush, now his party's pick for president, had added to the GOP ticket.

Quayle had been elected to the Senate at age 33 and was just 41 when he faced Bentsen, 26 years his senior. Answering a question about his experience, Quayle said he'd had ""as much experience in Congress"" as John F. Kennedy had when he was elected president at 43 in 1960.

Bentsen fixed his opponent with an appraising stare as he said: ""Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.""

The crowd whooped. A crestfallen Quayle recovered enough to say: ""That was really uncalled for, senator."" But if there had been a referee he would have stopped the fight right there.

Still, in November, the Bush-Quayle ticket carried 40 states and won easily.

No vice presidential debate since then has produced quite such a dramatic highpoint, but there have been several that left an indelible impression.

In 1992, Quayle was back as the incumbent vice president and as Bush's designated attack dog against the Democratic ticket of Bill Clinton, then governor of Arkansas, and running mate Al Gore, then a senator from Tennessee.

But both Quayle and Gore were upstaged by the presence of a third debater, the only such addition to the format in the history of vice presidential faceoffs to date. He was retired Adm. James A. Stockdale, a hero of the Vietnam War who had been a prisoner of war and an organizer and spokesman for other POWs at the time. Stockdale was the running mate for independent candidate H. Ross Perot, a billionaire businessman who also took part in the presidential debates with Bush and Clinton.

But on debate night, Stockdale looked uncomfortable on stage and had trouble with his hearing aid. His opening -- ""Who am I? What am I doing here?"" - came across not as introductory so much as genuinely confused. It was fodder for parody and was being mercilessly mocked almost before the debate was over.

Did Stockdale hurt Perot? Not visibly. The Clinton-Gore ticket won in 1992, but Perot-Stockdale got 19% of the popular vote in November, the best showing for a third-option ticket since the 1912 ""Bullmoose"" heyday of Theodore Roosevelt.

Surprises abound but prove inconclusive

Gore returned in 1996 as the incumbent vice president to debate Rep. Jack Kemp, the vice presidential choice of Dole, who was back as the GOP nominee against Clinton. Gore and Kemp had served in the House together before Gore's election to the Senate in 1984. Their debate was spirited but cordial, and many Republicans later said their guy should have been more aggressive. In any event, the incumbents won the vote that mattered that November.

In 2000, Gore was at the top of the ticket and surprised many by choosing Sen. Joe Lieberman, a party moderate from Connecticut who had been critical of Clinton. It appeared to be an effort to distance Gore from Clinton, in part because Lieberman had been outspoken in criticizing Clinton for the relationship with a White House intern that led to Clinton's 1998 impeachment.

Lieberman was the government official in his debate with Dick Cheney, who was at the time the chairman of a private company servicing the oil-and-gas industry. But Cheney had also been in the Republican leadership in the House and been Bush's secretary of defense during the first Persian Gulf War. He asserted a kind of seniority over his Democratic rival in the debate, even though Lieberman was just a year younger and a sitting senator at the time. If there had been any doubt about Cheney when picked by GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush, such doubt was dispelled in the debate.

A few weeks later, in one of the closest elections in U.S. history, the Bush-Cheney ticket lost the popular vote but squeaked by in the Electoral College thanks to a 537-vote edge in Florida that took five weeks and a Supreme Court Decision to decide.

As the incumbent vice president four years later, Cheney was every bit as much in command when paired with Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, the running mate choice of Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts. With the memory of the terror attacks of September 2001 still vivid in voters' minds, Cheney had an advantage and kept a grip on it, knowing his reputation for glowering toughness fit the moment better than Edwards' freshness and Southern charm.

That November's outcome was not quite as close as in 2004, but the early exit polls had pointed to a Kerry-Edwards win. It was only when Ohio went for Bush-Cheney late that evening that the Electoral College had a winner.

Renewed interest in 2008

The atmosphere in the country was notably different four years later in 2008. Feeling the wind at their back as a party, Democrats fought almost all the way to the convention over whether to nominate Hillary Clinton, bidding to be the first woman president, or Barack Obama, bidding to be the first Black president. Obama prevailed and chose a Senate colleague old enough to be his father, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware, to be his running mate. Biden had connections to the white, working-class voters Obama had been losing in the primaries that year.

And Biden did well in his debate with the Republican running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who had added verve and excitement to the ticket headed by Sen. John McCain of Arizona. While Palin was bound to be the focus of the debate, Biden had opportunities and made the most of them.

At the time, Wall Street was experiencing a crisis over mortgage-backed securities that would trigger a credit crunch and a downturn soon to be dubbed ""the Great Recession."" So Biden's gravitas as a six-term senator was as welcome as his roots in blue-collar America. A month later he was the vice president-elect.

In 2012, Biden's task was entirely different. Obama's reelection was opposed by former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, and Biden found himself onstage with the brainy and capable Paul Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee and almost 30 years Biden's junior. Ryan had first come to Washington as a congressional intern for Jack Kemp, and like him, he would be criticized for not attacking the incumbent vice president he faced in the debate. In any event, the Biden-Ryan meeting produced no surprises and probably no effect on the Obama-Biden reelection the following month.

This low-impact trend has continued in the last two vice presidential debates. It takes a moment to even remember the 2016 debate between Mike Pence, then the sitting governor of Indiana, and Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia. Pence had little trouble keeping the emphasis on the man who had put him on that stage, Donald Trump, and on the social issues that Trump wanted him to promote.

Kaine, who had been governor of Virginia and chairman of the Democratic National Committee moving on to the Senate in 2012, also made Trump the centerpiece of his debate performance, saying Trump was ""scary"" as commander in chief and far too well-disposed toward dictators and authoritarians in other countries.

But a few weeks later, when Trump-Pence had prevailed over Clinton-Kaine, no one was talking about what had happened in the running mates' debate.

Pence's Democratic rival was Biden's running mate, Kamala Harris, then a sitting senator from California, who was equally loyal when defending both Biden and herself. And she was not shy about taking on the social issues such as abortion that were so important to Pence's portfolio.

Just three months later, a crowd of rioters would chant ""Hang Mike Pence"" and erect a makeshift scaffold on the steps of the U.S. Capitol because Pence had refused Trump's urging to block the certification of the Electoral College results. Pence refused to leave the Capitol that night and in the wee hours of morning he supervised the process by which the Biden-Harris ticket formalized its win.

Pence also returned to the campaign trail to seek the GOP's 2024 presidential nomination as an alternative to Trump. Pence took part in several of the debates among the candidates, separating himself from Trump on the question of certifying the 2020 election but otherwise defending the Trump record. Unable to make much headway in polls or amass a competitive war chest, he dropped out months before the first primary was held.

Despite the frustrations of Quayle and Pence, the TV-era tradition by which former vice presidents have gone on to be their party's presidential nominee is impressive (Nixon, Hubert Humphrey, Ford, Mondale, Gore, Biden and the first President Bush).

And it continues this year with Harris, who will note that four of her seven predecessors in this group made it to the Oval Office."
Mark Cuban spars with Riley Gaines over Harris' handling of the border crisis,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/mark-cuban-spars-riley-gaines-over-harris-handling-border-crisis,2024-09-27T23:59:56Z,"Billionaire investor Mark Cuban unpacks the dueling economic plans pitched by Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump on 'Your World.'

Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban used his X platform Friday to respond to 24-year-old former college swimmer and conservative activist Riley Gaines over criticisms of Vice President Kamala Harris' handling of the southern border.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) released data to lawmakers Friday revealing that tens of thousands of illegal immigrants with sex offenses and homicide convictions have crossed the border into the U.S. under the Biden-Harris administration. These include 13,099 convicted of homicide and 15,811 of sexual assault.

Cuban, who has been a staunch advocate for Harris, Joe Biden in 2020 and Hillary Clinton in 2016, has defended the VP's record on the border. Cuban even said he thinks the actions she has taken to reduce the flow of illegal migrants across the southern border ""have actually worked"" in a recent CNBC interview.

Gaines called out Cuban for his praise of the vice president in a post on X Friday.

""We might have different standards for what qualifies as a 'good job,' but I don't think the illegal entrance of 15,000+ rapists, 13,000+ murderers, and 320,000 missing children fits the bill,"" Gaines, the host of OutKick's ""Gaines for Girls"" podcast wrote.

Gaines' reference to the 320,000 missing children is from another report from the Department of Homeland Security released Aug. 21 that revealed the Biden-Harris administration has lost track of that number of migrant children who crossed the border without parents.

Cuban responded to Gaines in his own X post just 90 minutes later. Cuban admitted the current administration ""waited too long to fix the border."" But he then criticized Trump for his promise to carry out the largest mass deportation in American history if elected.

""I have said many times they waited too long to fix the border. The good news is that the latest crossing numbers are lower than Jan 21 and staying near 1,500 a day,"" Cuban wrote, along with screenshots of two articles covering a statistical reduction in illegal border crossings.

""And the VP has been clear she will sign the bi-partisan border bill. It's a fair argument to criticize them for waiting too long. But you also have to acknowledge that they are now having success. Which leads to the question of deportations. The Republican nominee says he is going to deport the 21 million people here illegally. He hasn't said how he will do it.""

TRUMP'S MEAL FOR ALABAMA-GEORGIA FOOTBALL GAME INCLUDES NEARLY 800 CALORIES FROM MCDONALD'S ALONE

Cuban referenced a border bill that Senate Democrats failed to pass through Congress in May when all but one Republican senator, along with six Democrats, voted to block it.

Democrats argued the bill was intended to reduce border crossings, raise the standard for migrants to qualify for asylum and empower officials to rapidly send away those who fail to meet that standard. It would give the president power to shut down the border if migration levels exceed certain thresholds. But concerns about the bill were raised with earlier drafts having the border provisions attached to funding for Ukraine and Israel.

Gaines responded to Cuban's defense of his praise for Harris in another X post Friday evening, discrediting the statistics Cuban offered and slamming the border bill.

""They're flying in illegal immigrants and dropping them into the heartland of America, often in places we don't even know about,"" Gaines wrote. ""The bi-partisan border bill is a Trojan horse. The first time it was voted on it included funding for Ukraine. She campaigns on securing the border acknowledging (indirectly) the problems that have been created under the Biden Harris Admin. she's been in the White House for 3.5 years. Why not take action now?""

Gaines also called out Cuban for not addressing the 320,000 missing children statistic she mentioned in her first post.

Cuban had not responded to Gaines again at the time of publication.

Cuban's defense of Harris and Democrats has ramped up in recent weeks. He has done several interviews endorsing the VP in the upcoming election, making statements that have raised eyebrows from conservative voters. Cuban has suggested Trump is ""a socialist"" and even said he believes the mainstream media ""leans right"" in a recent CNBC interview.

Earlier this year, when Biden was still the presumptive Democratic nominee, Cuban went so far as to say he would vote for Biden over Trump even if Biden was ""being given his last rites.""

""If they were having his last wake, and it was him versus Trump, and he was being given last rites, I would still vote for Joe Biden,"" Cuban told Bloomberg News in March.

However, Cuban has also said he supported Trump at the outset of his first candidacy in 2015.

""In 2015, I was like, 'He's great. He's not a typical Stepford candidate. I thought that was a positive,"" Cuban told Vivek Ramaswamy in an interview on X Aug. 7.

Gaines has been an advocate for Trump in this election cycle. Gaines even spoke at one of Trump's rallies in Glendale, Arizona, Aug. 23. There, Gaines made a speech in which she claimed she was voting for Trump ""because I'm a woman.""

""They don't believe in school choice; they don't believe in parental rights or the safeguarding of children; they don't believe in freedom unless it's the freedom to have an abortion or chemically and surgically castrate children,"" she said.

""You have one ticket that knows what a woman is and has vowed to take decisive action at protecting our sex-based rights, compared to the other ticket that thinks men can become pregnant, and that tampons belong in boys' bathrooms.""

Harris will make a rare visit to the southern border in Arizona as she seeks to blunt criticism from former President Trump on the matter and renews her call for the bipartisan border bill. Conservatives were not swayed by the visit.

""Border Czar Kamala Harris has had nearly four years to protect America and failed,"" RJ Hauman, president of the National Immigration Center for Enforcement (NICE), told Fox News Digital in response to the data. ""She is allowing tens of thousands of murderers and rapists to roam free. She puts criminals first and the safety and security of you and your family last."""
"Fox News Poll: Harris, Trump in close race in North Carolina",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-harris-trump-close-race-north-carolina,2024-09-27T22:07:39Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Harris has a 2 percentage-point edge over former President Trump in the latest Fox News survey of North Carolina registered voters (50% Harris, 48% Trump). Last month, Trump was ahead by 1 point (50% to 49%), for a 3-point shift in the presidential race.

Among likely voters, the race flips with Trump on top by just a single point, 50% to 49%.

When third-party candidates are included, Harris is up 1 point among registered voters (3% support third party), while Trump is up 2 points among likely voters (3% to others).

NORTH CAROLINA GOP FOCUSING ON 'HAND-TO-HAND POLITICAL COMBAT' TO RAMP UP GROUND GAME IN BATTLEGROUND STATE

The results among both registered and likely voters are within the margin of error.

Harris's strongest support comes from Black voters, urban voters, and college-educated women, while for Trump it is Whites without a college degree (particularly men without degrees), rural voters, and White evangelicals.

Most Democrats (98%) and Republicans (96%) back their party's candidate, while the small group of independents favors Harris by 7 points.

Slightly more Harris supporters (92%) than Trump supporters (89%) are certain of their choice.

Harris is viewed more positively than Trump among Tar Heel voters -- 50% have a favorable view of her vs. 49% unfavorable for a +1 net positive rating. Trump's rating is negative by 7 points (46% favorable, 53% unfavorable).

Just 30% say the economy is in either excellent (7%) or good (23%) condition, while another 70% say either fair (30%) or poor (40%). This negativity is a far cry from November 2019 (late into Trump's term as president) when 54% were positive and 44% negative.

By 7 points, voters are more likely to think Trump can better handle the economy and about the same number give him the edge on making the country safe (+6). He does best on immigration and border security, where he leads Harris by 15 points, down from a 19-point lead in August.

4 MARK ROBINSON CAMPAIGN STAFFERS RESIGN IN WAKE OF REPORT ON PORN WEBSITE POSTS

Harris does best on the issue of abortion, where she is preferred by 16 points. Voters also give her the edge on helping the middle class (+7), protecting democracy (+6), and fighting for people like you (+5).

The candidates tie on who can bring needed change.

""The race here will be close, but Trump still holds the edge on the issues that matter most to North Carolina voters,"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""So long as they think Trump is more likely to make the country more prosperous and safer, he's the odds-on favorite.""

At least 8 in 10 Black voters think Harris is better equipped to handle these issues and actions, except when it comes to immigration, where Trump eats into Harris' lead with 25% saying he would better handle immigration vs. 73% for Harris.

The survey also finds the gap in the gubernatorial race in North Carolina has widened. Democrat Josh Stein (56%) has a 16-point lead over Republican Mark Robinson (40%), a 5-point increase since last month (54% Stein, 43% Robinson).

The survey was conducted after news of alleged inflammatory comments Robinson made on a porn website.

""It is unlikely the toxic nature of the Republican gubernatorial candidate will cause Trump voters to switch to Harris, but it could affect turnout,"" says Anderson. ""It complicates things for the Trump campaign to have to actively avoid the GOP candidate, and there could be some Trump-leaning independents who are so turned off by Robinson they decide it's not worth voting.""

Trump endorsed Robinson in March but has yet to comment on whether he'll pull his support.

Some 14% of Stein supporters split their ticket and back Trump in the presidential race, while just 4% of Robinson supporters back Harris.

A few more things...

-- By 17 points, those who say they will vote early in North Carolina back Harris. Among the smaller group of Election Day voters, Trump leads by 20 points.

--The views of the vice-presidential candidates play out the same as the presidential, with Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz receiving a net positive rating of 5 (46% favorable vs. 41% unfavorable) and Ohio Republican Sen. JD Vance net negative by 6 (41-47%).

--Views of President Joe Biden are net negative by 15 points (42% favorable, 57% unfavorable).

"Fox News Poll: Harris, Trump locked in tight race in battleground Pennsylvania",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-harris-trump-locked-tight-race-battleground-pennsylvania,2024-09-27T22:07:19Z,"Fox News contributor Joe Concha on the media pressing Vice President Harris on her lack of interviews and Sen. Joe Manchin refusing to endorse Harris due to her support for ending the filibuster.

Vice President Harris and former President Trump are locked in a tight race in Pennsylvania, mostly unchanged since July. This despite the array of newsworthy events since then, including the Democratic National Convention, a presidential debate, and a second Trump assassination attempt.

The new Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters finds Harris narrowly ahead of Trump by 2 points (50-48%) among registered voters, while the race is tied at 49% each among likely voters.

The July results, conducted shortly after President Biden dropped out and endorsed Harris, but before she was conclusively the nominee, were deadlocked at 49% each. But even in March, when Biden was the presumed nominee, the contest was close to even.

WORKING CLASS WILL COME HOME TO HARRIS, RALLYGOERS IN POSTINDUSTRIAL PENNSYLVANIANS SAY

Since July, Harris has widened her lead among women (by 9 points), nonwhite voters (+8), and voters under age 30 (+17). Her support has held steady among two other sources of strength: college graduates and urban voters.

Ninety-two percent of Harris supporters are certain of their vote versus 86% of Trump supporters.

Trump's best groups include men, Whites without a college degree, independents, and rural voters. He has nearly doubled his lead among men and the small group of independents since July.

'ABUSE OF POWER': HOUSE GOP OPENS PROBE INTO UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT'S TRIP TO BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

Another reason the race is close is Trump has minimized Harris' edge among suburban voters (+2). This is mostly due to the large gender gap among suburban voters: suburban men support Trump by 14 points (suburban women go for Harris by 17). Meanwhile, Harris has successfully peeled off disaffected Republicans: she has 1 in 4 non-MAGA Republicans backing her.

In 2016, Trump beat Hillary Clinton by less than a point in the Keystone State, while Biden's victory was by just over a point in 2020.

In the expanded ballot (includes third-party candidates) Harris has a 2-point edge among registered voters while Trump is ahead by 1 point among likely voters.

All results for the Harris-Trump head-to-heads and expanded ballot are within the error margin .

""Pennsylvania is not breaking open and shouldn't be expected to,"" says Democratic Pollster Chris Anderson who conducts Fox News surveys alongside Republican Daron Shaw. ""Both candidates have a little way to go to consolidate their bases and whoever does a better job there could determine who wins the state.""

The economy is the top issue for voters this election and most Pennsylvanians have a negative view of the economy (71%).

More voters think Trump can better handle the economy than Harris by 6 points. Still, that's half the advantage he had on the issue in April (+12 points over Biden).

Trump does best on immigration and border security (+17) and is also more trusted to make the country safer (+5).

Harris is seen as better able to handle abortion by 21 points. She also gets the nod on helping the middle class (by 8 points), protecting Democracy (+7), and fighting for people like you (+5).

Neither has a clear edge in bringing needed change (Harris +3)

Harris enjoys better favorable ratings than the former president -- 48% favorable vs. 51% unfavorable for a 3-point net negative rating. Trump is underwater by 9 points (45% vs. 54%). It plays out the same way among the vice-presidential candidates: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's rating is even (44% vs. 44%) while Ohio Sen. JD Vance is in negative territory by 13 points (39% vs. 52%).

Biden's favorable rating is underwater by 16 points (42% vs. 58%).

In the Pennsylvania Senate race, Democratic candidate Bob Casey has a 9-point lead over Republican challenger David McCormick (53% to 44% among both registered and likely voters). McCormick has narrowed the gap by 4 points since July when he was down by 13 (55-42%).

The reversal can mostly be attributed to a 13-point shift among men and a decrease in support for Casey among independents. In July, men supported Casey by 6 points while today they back McCormick by 7 points, while independents supported Casey by 18 points in the summer and it's a 5-point spread now.

Some 10% of Casey backers split their ticket and back Trump in the presidential race while just 4% of McCormick supporters go for Harris.

A few more things...

-- Gov. Josh Shapiro is popular, as 62% approve of the job he's doing while a third disapprove (36%). Most Democrats (92%) and over half of independents (53%) approve of him while two-thirds of Republicans (65%) disapprove.

-- A majority of Pennsylvanians favor the use of fracking for oil and gas production, including 8 in 10 Republicans, 6 in 10 independents, and 4 in 10 Democrats.

"Sean Combs accused of impregnating, threatening woman in new assault lawsuit",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/g-s1-25157/sean-diddy-combs-jane-doe-pregnant-assault-lawsuit,2024-09-27T20:44:05Z,"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - OCTOBER 18: Sean ""Diddy"" Combs appears before students at his Capital Preparatory School in the Bronx on October 18, 2022 in New York City. Mike Coppola/Getty Images hide caption

Sean ""Diddy"" Combs has been hit with yet another sexual abuse lawsuit. The latest filing against the 54-year-old artist and record exec alleges Combs drugged, assaulted, coerced and threatened an unnamed victim over the course of two years with one of their encounters resulting in a pregnancy and miscarriage.

In the new lawsuit filed today (Sept. 27) with the New York County Supreme Court, a Jane Doe plaintiff who resides in Florida and works as a model claims she was forced to travel and ""perform"" for Combs many times in the last few years. The plaintiff alleges that after she and Combs started seeing each other in 2021, she was flown to different states, including California and New York, by his company, Bad Boy Enterprise, to have sex with the rap mogul. According to the filing, the victim often felt coerced into going to see Combs by members of his team, and Combs' chief of staff, Kristina Khorram, was among the agents who would pay for the plaintiff's travel. She says staffers would ""send drivers to her home to pick her up before she agreed to travel, to the point where she did not believe she had a choice.""

The unnamed victim alleges that throughout the spring of 2022 she was ordered to take drugs including ketamine and forced to have sex with Combs in his homes in Los Angeles and Miami. The plaintiff says the heavy drug use caused her to black out intermittently. On one of these occasions, she ""woke up and her feet were purple and bruised and she had a bite mark on her heel"" but had no memory of how she got the injuries. That summer, the plaintiff says she found out she was pregnant and when she told Combs, the label exec's girlfriend at the time, Caresha Brownlee, a.k.a. the rapper Yung Miami, harassed her by repeatedly calling her and ordering her to have an abortion. The plaintiff claims that the stress led her to suffer a miscarriage shortly after.

Additionally, the plaintiff claims to have witnessed Combs slap other women and exhibit controlling, violent behavior. She alleges that he would instruct his staff to record sexual encounters with her without her permission; that he had found a way to track her location and would monitor her phone conversations; and that he would command her to travel to him up until July 2024. The plaintiff says Combs continues to contact her in an attempt to intimidate her. She is seeking unspecified, punitive damages from Combs and Bad Boy Enterprises with the amount to be determined in a trial.

With this new complaint, the tally of civil lawsuits filed against Combs for sexual misconduct rises to 12. In addition to these civil suits, he faces criminal charges of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution in New York. He is currently in federal custody awaiting trial after being denied bail."
Mics Will Be Unmuted During Next Week's Vance-Walz Debate -- Here's What Else To Know About The Faceoff,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/09/27/mics-will-be-unmuted-during-next-weeks-vance-walz-debate-heres-what-else-to-know-about-the-faceoff/,2024-09-27T17:28:57Z,"Republican vice presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Democratic vice presidential candidate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, will debate Tuesday with unmuted microphones, a departure from the rules during the first two presidential debates, debate host CBS News announced Friday.

The candidates will have two minutes to answer questions during the 90-minute debate, two minutes to respond and one minute for additional rebuttals. There will be no opening statements and the candidates will each have two minutes for closing statements. Vance won the coin toss to give the final word. Candidates will not be given questions in advance, nor will they be allowed to interact with campaign staff or have pre-written notes during the debate.

Tuesday, Oct. 1 at 9 p.m. ET on CBS News from the network's studios in Philadelphia, without a live audience. The debate will be broadcast by all CBS local affiliates, simulcast by most major networks and available for live-streaming on the websites of most major news networks.

""CBS Evening News"" anchor Norah O'Donnell and ""Face the Nation"" moderator and chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan.

Neither an agreement nor a proposal for a second debate has been made public.

Harris immediately challenged Trump to a rematch at the conclusion of their first debate earlier this month, but Trump has said he won't debate her again, insisting Harris only wants a rematch because he ""won"" the first faceoff.

More Americans view Walz favorably (39% vs. 34%) than they do Vance, and more say Walz is qualified to serve as president if necessary than Vance (35% versus 30%), according to a September Pew Research survey of U.S. adults.

Vance, a former Marine and Iraq war veteran, seized on criticism of Walz's military record soon after Walz's entrance into the race, accusing him of ""stolen valor."" Walz, for years, has faced allegations from some of his fellow guardsmen of retiring from the National Guard to avoid being deployed to Iraq, though others who served alongside Walz have defended him and said he had discussed retiring to run for Congress months before his unit's deployment was announced. Republicans have labeled both Harris and Vance as far-left, and have coined the nickname ""Tampon Tim"" for Walz, in reference to a law he signed as governor requiring menstrual products be available in restrooms used by students in grades 4-12 in public schools to ensure transgender students have access to them.

Vance has faced a string of controversies since joining Trump's ticket. Resurfaced comments he made in 2021 about ""childless cat ladies"" running the Democratic Party drew widespread scrutiny, and he is widely credited with amplifying the baseless claim that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, were abducting and eating residents' house pets, leading to increased threats of violence in Springfield. Walz has repeatedly referred to Vance and Trump as ""weird"" throughout the summer, popularizing the attack line among Democrats. And Harris' campaign has cited Vance's prior public comments in support of making abortion illegal nationwide, as Trump and Vance seek to distance themselves from the idea.

Trump tapped Vance as his running mate in July at the start of the Republican National Convention. Harris chose Walz about three weeks after launching her own campaign on July 21 when President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. Both hail from the Midwest and are relatively new to the national political scene. Vance was first elected to public office in the 2022 midterm, and Walz was relatively unknown to voters on a national level prior to him joining Harris' ticket.

"Big Sean, Drew Afualo And More Share The Importance Of Mental Health, Community And Connectivity At The Under 30 Summit",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/zoyahasan/2024/09/27/big-sean-drew-afualo-and-more-share-the-importance-of-mental-health-community-and-connectivity-at-this-years-under-30-summit/,2024-09-27T12:01:35Z,"Think this is nice? It's a version of the weekly Under 30 newsletter and would be even better in your inbox.

Big Sean was 11 years old when he started dreaming of making it big in music. He wanted to be the Black artist that would represent his hometown of Detroit. And with Grammy nominations and seven BET awards, he says he stands proud today.

But what did it take? A long battle with his mental health, he told the audience at the 2024 Forbes Under 30 Summit this week, where he detailed his journey of using Adderall and losing himself to the momentum of the industry. ""I was so addicted to the music industry that I didn't even realize what I was into anymore,"" Big Sean said. ""I had to step away from everything, from music, from all the obligations I had. I just had to rediscover who I was.""

This year's Under 30 Summit, which kicked off Sunday, explored themes of vulnerability and lessons learned -- translating into invaluable advice for the audience members who came to Cincinnati, Ohio from 66 different countries and 44 U.S. states. Speakers from across different sectors of business and entertainment took the Under 30 stage on Monday and Tuesday after a Sunday night music festival featuring performances from singer-songwriter Shaboozey, DJ and producer Metro Boomin and Cincinnati-native DJ Xandra.

The record-producing star Metro advised all the young people in the crowd to make the most of their 20s: To surround themselves with like-minded individuals and hustle every single day, but to do it with patience. ""Stay down, stay patient,"" he said to the twentysomethings. ""Look at it like you're a piggy bank. Keep depositing, keep depositing, keep depositing.""

Business legends like former American Express CEO Ken Chenault and Ken Frazier, the former chairman and CEO of Merck, talked about how leaders focus on the people and not the money. Rare Beauty chief marketing officer Katie Welch and fellow panelist Robyn Delmonte, A.K.A. GirlBossTown on social media, lent their marketing genius: They both emphasized how the most successful brands will build a community that tells them their next big move.

The Summit also featured talks from creators like Drew Afualo, Bobbi Althoff, Dani Austin and billion-dollar advice from high net-worth individuals like Josh Harris and Ankur Jain, among many more icons. Other than taking home a notebook's worth of thoughts to reflect on, attendees also enjoyed experiences like book signings with Forbes Top Creator Afualo and poet Rupi Kaur, a live recording of Althoff's The Really Good Podcast, city-wide tours of Cincinnati and the first ever Women in Sports Summit hosted by ForbesWomen publisher and president Moira Forbes.

We can't do four days of experiences, learning and networking justice without a larger word count on this newsletter, but you can read about it all in our live blog here. And yes, we're already gearing up for next year's Under 30 Summit in Columbus, Ohio. See you there?!

Women with unwanted pregnancies are turning to one another for pills and herbal remedies on Facebook. Forbes found nearly 800 groups and pages (across 76 countries), and at least 300 of the groups operate in countries where abortion is at least sometimes illegal. But many of the group members say they are getting scammed instead of supported.

-Once on track for Forbes' Billionaires list, record-making producer Sean 'Diddy' Combs is facing a long and growing list of allegations that have reduced his empire to rubble. Over the last two decades, he'd expanded his businesses across lifestyle categories like the Sean John fashion and fragrance lines, a Cîroc vodka partnership with British spirits conglomerate Diageo and founded the Revolt TV network, earning nearly a billion dollars. But Forbes took a look inside the rise (and recent fall) of his empire. (Forbes)

-More than four years after we were sent home for Covid lockdowns, countless companies are still determining what makes the most sense for their workforce. Amazon, along with multiple tech firms, recently announced it wants workers back in the office five days a week starting in the new year. So much for the life of a digital nomad. (Forbes)

-We can all relate to asking a question to a chatbot and getting back an answer that, well, doesn't make any sense. Sometimes it doesn't actually address the question at all, while other times the bot will contradict itself or change its mind halfway through. But OpenAI is attempting to create a more intelligent, and intentional, LLM. Nicknamed ""Strawberry,"" its latest o1 model will use a ""think, then answer"" approach to responding to prompts and allegedly ""performs similarly to Ph.D. students on challenging benchmark tasks in physics, chemistry, and biology,"" according to the company.

Harris heads to southern border looking to flip script on immigration criticisms,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-heads-southern-border-looking-flip-script-immigration-criticisms,2024-09-27T10:05:57Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Harris stops in battleground Arizona on Friday to hold a campaign event along the U.S. southern border with Mexico as the Democrat presidential nominee works to turn the issue of immigration and border security from a negative into a positive.

Harris has faced frequent attacks from her Republican opponent, former President Trump, and his allies who argue she's weak on border security, an issue that many Republicans see as the vice president's political Achilles' heel. Harris has faced intense criticism over the surge of migrants across the nation's southern border during the first three years of President Biden's administration.

The Trump campaign, on the eve of Harris' first border visit as a presidential nominee, called it a ""political ploy.""

But Harris, with a stop in Douglas, Arizona, aims to show that she's better prepared than Trump to tackle the combustible issue of immigration and what Republicans have spotlighted as the crisis at the southern border.

HARRIS LEANS IN ON BORDER SECURITY AND TRUMP RELISHES THE FIGHT

The vice president is expected to speak about how she is pushing what she describes as the toughest bipartisan border security plan in a generation, a measure that includes new border agents and technologies to stop fentanyl trafficking.

And she's expected to reiterate her argument that Trump ""has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk.""

CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS IN THE 2024 ELECTION

She has repeatedly pointed to a border security bill with some bipartisan support that had been making its way through Congress this year before Republicans turned against the measure after prompting from Trump.

Harris has said that the former president ""tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election"" and has pledged that ""as the president, I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed.""

Since replacing Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket more than two months ago, Harris has described herself as a former ""border state prosecutor"" who took on international gangs and criminal organizations behind illegal drug, gun and human trafficking across the border.

The description comes as Harris and her campaign have also spotlighted a tougher stance on border security while still pushing for a pathway to citizenship for some migrants.

""We need a comprehensive plan,"" Harris said Wednesday in an interview with MSNBC. ""That includes what we need to do to fortify not only our border but deal with the fact that we also need to create pathways for people to earn citizenship.""

Biden tasked Harris in 2021 with leading the diplomatic outreach to tackle the ""root causes"" of migration in Central American countries. It led to her being dubbed the ""border czar"" both by the media and some Republicans, although the White House has rejected that description. And the vice president has been pilloried over her role as ""Biden's border czar"" by Trump and his allies.

Trump, as he runs to win back his old job in the White House, is calling for a major crackdown at the U.S.-Mexico border and has suggested using police and the military to carry out mass deportations of undocumented migrants.

Speaking at a campaign event in North Carolina on Wednesday, Trump said Harris was traveling to the southern border for ""political reasons.""

""When Kamala speaks about the border, her credibility is less than zero,"" Trump said. ""I hope you're going to remember that on Friday. When she tells you about the border, ask her just one simple question: 'Why didn't you do it four years ago?'""

And Trump has said the policies of the Biden-Harris administration have allowed millions of people to enter the U.S. illegally.

In June, after the collapse of the bipartisan border security bill, Biden announced rules that bar migrants from being granted asylum when U.S. officials say the U.S.-Mexico border is overwhelmed. Following the implementation of the new rules through executive orders, arrests for illegal border crossings have plummeted.

Polls indicate that immigration and abortion are two of the top issues on the minds of American voters, following the economy and inflation.

And public opinion surveys, including those from Fox News, indicate that by double digits Americans believe Trump would do a better job than Harris handling the issue.

Trump last visited the border during a stop last month in Arizona, which is one of the seven crucial battleground states that will likely determine the winner of the presidential election.

OB-GYNs decry the 'fearmongering' about Georgia's abortion laws: 'The lies are hurting women',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/ob-gyns-decry-fearmongering-about-georgias-abortion-laws-the-lies-hurting-women,2024-09-27T09:06:13Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Charlotte Lozier Institute Vice President and Director of Medical Affairs Dr. Ingrid Skop is calling out the ""fearmongering"" and ""lies"" of the media that are hurting women who don't understand new abortion laws.

A recent piece from ProPublica blamed the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, following chemically induced abortions in 2022, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits.

Since the story's publication, many members of the Democratic Party, including Vice President Kamala Harris, have been attacking Georgia's laws by suggesting they prevented the women in these cases from receiving lifesaving care.

Skop is one of multiple OB-GYNs Fox News spoke to who have criticized what they see as a misleading story being pushed by the media and Democrats.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

""I was not surprised to see this pro-abortion media try to point the blame at Georgia's pro-life laws, but, in fact, Georgia's laws allow doctors to intervene to save the life of the woman,"" Skop told Fox News Digital.

She continued, ""I think the focus of the Democratic Party upon abortion as an issue is only because the American people do not understand the laws. Many times, women are hurt by abortions. It is not necessary for women to live their best life. And, of course, it's the fearmongering and lies that have led us to this place where we are today, where people even think there would be a reason to point at the law.""

Skop emphasized that Georgia's abortion laws, as well as those of every other state, are ""very, very clear"" that an abortion can be done to save the life of the mother. Further, she said the laws do not apply to abortion procedures such as dilation and curettage (D&C) if the unborn baby is already dead, as was the case for Thurman.

""The law states again that a miscarriage is an exception. It also states that an ectopic pregnancy is an exception. So we should never be reading of women not getting miscarriage care or not getting ectopic pregnancies treated because they are clearly an exception in every pro-life state's laws,"" Skop said.

Skop said that it's the distortions of the laws that have done harm to women, not the laws themselves, leaving women like Miller unsure about seeking life-saving care and doctors unsure about giving it.

""The lies about pro-life laws are hurting women. The pro-life laws are not hurting women, but the lies are hurting women. Because in many cases, the women do not understand. And we've seen that sometimes even the doctors don't understand. They're not reading the law. They're listening to the pro-abortion media,"" Skop said.

Dr. Christina Francis, CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), made similar comments on ""Fox & Friends Saturday.""

""We are seeing the direct results of spreading lies and misinformation about these laws. Women are being harmed by that because they are delaying in seeking care. And so I think it's really important, no matter where somebody stands on the issue of abortion, we should all want women to have accurate information so that they seek care immediately if they're experiencing complications from things like these high-risk abortion drugs,"" Francis said.

ABC NEWS REBUKED BY PRO-LIFE GROUP, ASKED FOR CORRECTION OF ABORTION CLAIM BY DEBATE MODERATOR

In a statement to Fox News Digital, AAPLOG board member Dr. Susan Bane expressed outrage over Thurman's death and the media's lack of interest in properly informing doctors.

""If her care was delayed because of her physicians' understanding of the law, they were misinformed. This highlights the importance of giving medical professionals and the public accurate information about abortion drugs and abortion laws,"" Bane said.

ProPublica defended their story in a statement to Fox News Digital, saying, ""We stand by our reporting. The state's committee of more than 30 experts concluded that the deaths of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller were preventable, a newsworthy finding. Our ongoing reporting is illuminating the challenges doctors face in caring for patients with pregnancy complications in states with restricted access to abortion."""
Kamala Harris isn't alone: Vulnerable Dems want current filibuster gone,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-isnt-alone-vulnerable-dems-want-current-filibuster-gone,2024-09-27T08:15:22Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Harris' controversial filibuster comment isn't out of line with a group of vulnerable Democrat senators vying to keep their seats in the upper chamber who are also willing to do away with the legislative filibuster.

In fact, Sens. Jon Tester, D-Mont., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, Bob Casey, D-Pa., Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., all voted to change the rules in 2022 to allow a bill that would loosen federal voting requirements to be passed by a simple majority, which Democrats had in the Senate.

""I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe,"" Harris, a former senator, told Wisconsin Public Radio this week, referencing changing Senate rules to codify the precedent set in Roe v. Wade into law and protect the ability to get an abortion federally.

SENATE PASSES FUNDING BILL WITHOUT SAVE ACT, AVOIDING POTENTIAL SHUTDOWN

Immediately afterward, Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.Va., said he would not endorse her for president: ""I'm not endorsing her,"" he told Fox News.

The legislative filibuster requires 60 votes to end debate on a bill and advance to a final vote. If a measure is unable to meet this threshold on a cloture vote, it cannot move forward for final passage consideration.

In 2022, both moderate Sens. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., and Manchin bucked Democrats to join Republicans in preventing the rule change that would have allowed Democrats to pass the voting requirements bill with the party's razor-thin majority. The senators were both Democrats at the time but subsequently left the party to become independents. They each later announced they wouldn't seek re-election.

Ahead of the filibuster standoff, Brown told one outlet in 2020, ""We've got to eliminate the filibuster.""

Rosen remarked to another in 2021 that she supported suspending the filibuster's rules ""in the case of protecting democracy,"" such as passing the voting requirements bill.

GOP SENATORS EYE COMPREHENSIVE CHINA STRATEGY TO CURB CCP INFLUENCE

Also in 2021, Casey said the threshold was ""an arcane Senate procedure"" and added, ""If the choice comes down to the filibuster or democracy, I know which side I'm on.""

Tester told MSNBC during the same summer that if the filibuster continued being ""weaponized,"" he would be left with few choices.

Baldwin backed scrapping the legislative filibuster as far back as 2013, co-sponsoring a bill to do so at the time and reinstitute a ""talking filibuster."" Under this change, the 60-vote threshold or legislative filibuster would be eliminated and those who want to filibuster a measure would be required to speak on the chamber floor. If and when those lawmakers stop speaking, a final vote by simple majority would take place.

A spokesperson told Fox News Digital earlier in the year that ""Senator Tester does not support ending the filibuster.""

But Tester told Fox News Digital on Wednesday, ""Talking filibuster, that's what I want, period.""

The talking filibuster would effectively eliminate the current legislative filibuster.

TOP SECRET SERVICE AGENT IN PITTSBURGH SAYS HE WAS KEPT IN DARK ON 'CREDIBLE' THREAT AHEAD OF BUTLER RALLY

Casey also reiterated his interest in voting on the 60-vote rule to Fox News Digital in the spring.

Baldwin on Wednesday told Fox News Digital she agreed with Harris' recent comment and still backs returning to the talking filibuster.

In response to their interest in a talking filibuster, Manchin told Fox News Digital, ""There's only one filibuster, 60-vote threshold.""

Both Brown and Rosen ignored questions about whether they agreed with Harris' comment from Fox News Digital on Wednesday.

Representatives for Casey, Rosen and Brown did not respond to questions from Fox News Digital regarding whether they agreed with Harris or if their positions had changed.

JOE MANCHIN SAYS HE WON'T ENDORSE HARRIS OVER SUPPORT FOR ELIMINATING FILIBUSTER

Tester is considered the most vulnerable Democrat seeking re-election as top political handicappers predict a Republican win and polls show the Montana senator losing traction.

The Ohio race is considered a toss-up by the Cook Political Report as Brown competes to keep his seat.

Baldwin, Casey and Rosen's races in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Nevada are rated ""Lean Democrat.""

In 2021, voters were somewhat divided on the filibuster and many were unsure what they thought about it. According to an April 2021 Fox News Poll, 27% supported eliminating the filibuster while 29% opposed doing so. However, 39% didn't have an opinion at all.

In the aftermath of the dispute over Senate rules in early 2022, even fewer voters reported having an opinion. In a July 2022 Fox News Poll, those who supported eliminating the filibuster and those who opposed it were tied at 26% each, while nearly half, at 47%, said they didn't have an opinion."
Judge blocks NY AG Letitia James from trying to silence pregnancy centers that promote abortion pill reversal,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-blocks-ny-ag-letitia-james-silence-pregnancy-centers-promote-abortion-pill-reversal,2024-09-26T22:59:50Z,"New York Attorney General Letitia James addressed a crowed rallied outside the Supreme Court in support of the FDA's approval of an abortion pill during oral arguments on Tuesday.

A federal judge this week issued New York Attorney General Letitia James a preliminary injunction that bars her from taking action against pregnancy clinics that promote abortion pill reversal on the grounds it would restrict protected free speech.

The ruling came amid a lawsuit by the Thomas More Society on behalf of two pro-life ministries, Summit Life Outreach Center and the Evergreen Association. The lawsuit argues that James has targeted pregnancy centers with threats of prosecution for sharing information about abortion pill reversal, which she has said is unproven.

""These small nonprofits, which exist to compassionately serve women and offer them alternatives to abortion, deserve to have their speech elevated -- not chilled,"" Peter Breen, Thomas More Society's executive vice president and head of litigation, said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""This court order makes clear Ms. James cannot censor pro-life speech purely because she dislikes it.""

HARRIS CALLS FOR ELIMINATING FILIBUSTER TO PASS 'ROE' ABORTION BILL INTO FEDERAL LAW

Fox News Digital has reached out to James' office.

In his order, Judge John Sinatra Jr., a Trump appointee, wrote that James is barred from preventing the clinics from promoting abortion pill reversal on their websites and social media platforms.

Medicinal abortion involves taking mifepristone and following it with treatment of misoprostol days later, but pregnancy clinics have advised that those who change their minds and want to continue the pregnancy can do so by abandoning the second drug and instead taking doses of progesterone.

In May, James filed lawsuits against 11 pregnancy centers that promoted the abortion pill reversal procedure, accusing them of engaging in fraud, deceptive business practices and false advertising. She claimed the groups were ""spreading dangerous misinformation by advertising ... without any medical and scientific proof.""

DEMS LOOK TO FORCE VOTES ON EMERGENCY ABORTION AS ABORTION PILL DEATHS MAKE HEADLINES

Despite not being named in James' lawsuit, Summit Life Outreach Center and the Evergreen Association said her targeting of other pregnancy centers had put them at risk.

Barbara Bidak, the executive director of Summit Life Outreach Center, said her staff works ""tirelessly to provide life-affirming options for women in need.""

""We're incredibly pleased a federal judge has now made clear that Attorney General Letitia James' legal attacks on our state's pro-life ministries unconstitutionally chills our First Amendment right to share the lifesaving message of Abortion Pill Reversal -- which gives pregnant moms in the middle of a chemical abortion a second chance to choose life.""

Breen said the pro-life ministries have a constitutional right to share information about abortion pill reversal, and that ""their message is saving thousands of lives.""

The Thomas More Society is representing the 11 clinics in a separate case. Last month, a federal judge in that case ruled the clinics were protected by the First Amendment.

""Based on a careful application of the preliminary injunction factors, especially as they relate to Plaintiffs' First Amendment Free Speech claim, motion for a preliminary injunction is granted,"" the judge wrote.

Fox News Poll: Voters' choice has flipped in Arizona since last month,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-voters-choice-flipped-arizona-since-last-month,2024-09-26T22:06:37Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Former President Donald Trump is narrowly ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential contest in Arizona, as the Democratic nominee loses ground among women, Hispanics, and young voters.

A new Fox News survey of Arizona voters finds Harris trails Trump by 3 percentage points among likely voters in both the two-way matchup (48-51%) and the expanded ballot that includes third-party candidates (47-50%, with 3% backing other candidates). While 9 in 10 say their vote choice is locked in, both Harris and Trump have a handful of supporters saying they may change their mind.

In August, Harris was up by 1 point in the horserace among registered voters (50-49%), while she's down by 2 points today (48-50%). All of these matchups are within the margin of error.

The 3-point shift among registered voters is mainly due to movement among young voters, women, and Hispanics.

Since August, Harris' 18-point lead among Hispanics has narrowed to 11 points and her 14-point edge among women is down to 8 points. What was a 13-point advantage for Harris among voters under age 30 is now a 12-point deficit, a 25-point shift. These changes are notable, even given that estimates among subgroups are more volatile.

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: THE EDGE IS CLEAR ON THIS KEY ISSUE

Trump tops Harris among Whites without a college degree, rural voters, and independents. He has a narrow edge among suburbanites because more suburban men back him than suburban women favor Harris. And, by just a touch, more of his 2020 voters stick with him than Biden's 2020 voters back Harris.

Harris has strong support among those ages 65 and over, voters with a college degree, and urban voters, and still receives majority backing among women and Hispanics. Plus, one in four non-MAGA Republicans favors Harris over Trump.

By a 51-46% margin, Trump leads among new voters, defined as those who haven't voted in the four most recent elections.

""Arizona is looking tougher for Harris than a month ago,"" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts Fox News surveys with Republican Daron Shaw. ""If young voters and Hispanics don't make a U-turn, it's hard to see how she walks away with a win.""

More Arizona voters trust Trump than Harris to handle immigration (by 15 points) and the economy (+8). Those are significant leads, and they match where things stood last month -- but compared to his June leads over President Joe Biden, Trump's advantage is down 5 points on immigration and down 7 points on the economy.

Trump is also seen as being better at making the country safe by 7 points.

There's little difference between the candidates on who will better protect democracy (Harris +3), help the middle class (Harris +2), fight for people like you (Harris +2), and bring needed change (Trump +1).

Harris leads Trump by 15 points on handling abortion, down from her 22-point lead last month.

More than 7 in 10 Arizona voters favor the state's proposed constitutional amendment establishing the right to an abortion, including more than two-thirds of independents and half of Republicans.

The two candidates are about equal in personal favorable ratings. Harris gets net negative marks by 3 points (48% favorable, 51% unfavorable), while Trump's are negative by 5 points (47%-52%). For the vice-presidential candidates, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's ratings are negative by just 1 point (42-43%) with 15% unable to rate him. Ohio Sen. JD Vance's favorable rating is underwater by 7 points (40-47%) and 12% have no opinion.

Trump won Arizona in 2016 by about 3.5 percentage points, while Biden's 2020 victory was by less than half a percentage point.

In the Senate race, Democrat Ruben Gallego tops Republican Kari Lake by more than 10 percentage points: 55-42% among likely voters and 56-42% among registered voters. Gallego is preferred across most demographic groups, but women voters are a big part of what gives him the advantage as they back him over Lake by a 23-point margin. He also receives the support of 6 in 10 independents and nearly 2 in 10 Republicans.

FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS CITE HIGH PRICES AS BIGGEST MOTIVATOR TO VOTE

Some 15% of Gallego supporters split their ticket and back Trump in the presidential race. Some of the biggest ticket splitting is among independents, who are 16 points more likely to back Gallego than Harris, and Republicans (10 points more for Gallego). Among those voters favoring Lake, only 3% go for Harris.

Poll-pourri

Early voters are more likely to back Harris by 11 points, while Trump is favored by 30 points among the smaller group of Election Day voters.

Biden's personal favorability is negative by 21 points, 39% favorable vs. 60% unfavorable. That's a big decline from four years ago when his ratings were positive by 2 points (June 2020).

In a head-to-head matchup, Vice President Kamala Harris tops former President Donald Trump by three percentage points in a Fox News survey of Georgia voters.

Harris receives 51% support to Trump's 48% among both registered and likely voters. While her advantage may be narrow (inside the margin of error), it is steady. Last month, she was up 50-48% among registered voters.

Roughly 1 in 10 of each candidate's supporters say they may change their mind.

More Georgians see Harris as the candidate who will help the middle class and protect democracy by a 7-point margin on each. She is also seen as the candidate more likely to fight ""for people like you"" by 6 points. Harris' largest lead is on handling the issue of abortion, where she is favored by 18 points.

Trump's largest lead is on handling immigration (+15 points).

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: THE EDGE IS CLEAR ON THIS KEY ISSUE

The two candidates are rated more closely on bringing needed change (Harris by 4 points), making the country safe (Trump +3), and handling the economy (Trump +4). His advantage on the economy today is half what it was last month.

Large majorities of Black voters trust Harris over Trump on each issue and trait, with as many as 85% saying she will ""fight for people like you.""

Among independents, 6 in 10 see Harris as helping the middle class, while nearly as many say Trump is better able to handle the economy.

""Georgia is looking like a true battleground with a slight lean toward Harris,"" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts Fox News polls with Republican Daron Shaw. ""More voters see her fighting for them and standing up for the middle class, and she has almost neutralized Trump's advantage on the economy.""

Party loyalty is also a factor. By a 4-percentage point margin, more Democrats back Harris than Republicans back Trump. One in five non-MAGA Republicans supports Harris.

Independents favor Harris over Trump by 13 points.

Trump won Georgia by 5 percentage points in 2016, but Biden took the state in 2020 by less than half a point.

By a wide 30-point margin, Georgia voters like the job Gov. Brian Kemp is doing, 64% approve vs. 34% disapprove (August 2024).

""The pathway for Trump is pretty obvious,"" says Shaw. ""He has to make nice with Governor Kemp and non-MAGA Republicans -- and if he does that, he probably has the edge.""

Harris gets her best numbers from Black voters, urban voters, those under age 30, and women.

Majorities of Whites without a college degree, rural voters, men, and voters ages 65 and over support Trump.

New voters split 50-50% (those who haven't voted in the four most recent general elections).

Married voters go for Trump by 15 points, while those who are unmarried favor Harris by 21.

Most voters who say they will cast their ballot early prefer Harris, while Trump is favored among those planning to vote on Election Day.

FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS CITE HIGH PRICES AS BIGGEST MOTIVATOR TO VOTE

Meanwhile, Harris is generally more popular than Trump. By a 3-point margin the vice president receives net positive ratings, as 51% have a favorable view of her and 48% unfavorable. Trump's ratings are net negative by 6 points (47% vs. 53%).

The same goes for the vice-presidential candidates. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is in positive territory by 1 point (43-42%), while Ohio Sen. JD Vance is underwater by 3 (43-46%).

"Opinion | American women don't need a ""protector""  --  especially not one like Trump",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-speech-protect-women-gaslighting-101-rcna172883,2024-09-26T21:05:05Z,"Activists rally during a protest against Donald Trump for his 'treatment of women' in front of Trump Tower in 2016 in New York.Drew Angerer / Getty Images file

Donald Trump is a well-documented liar. From crowd sizes and the outcome of the 2020 presidential election to the estimated 30,573 false or misleading claims the former president told while in office, trying to convince the American public that he has a plan to help them is Trump's political bread and butter.

His falsehoods have been dangerous, inciting riots, bomb threats and foiled kidnapping plots. Others have felt more like performance art, like Trump's comments about the alleged increase in the number of toilet flushes or assertion that windmills cause cancer.

Yet somehow, none of those lies and absurd statements have been as outlandish as Trump's latest attempt to gaslight American women.

On Monday, at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, Trump spoke directly to them, claiming that if elected president he will be their ""protector:""

The man accused of sexual misconduct by at least 26 women and found liable for sexual abuse in a court of law went on to claim that if he is elected president, women ""will no longer have anxiety from all the problems our country has today."" (Trump has denied all such claims of sexual misconduct.)

""You will be protected, and I will be your protector,"" he reiterated. ""Women will be happy, healthy, confident and free. You will no longer be thinking about abortion -- that's all they talk about, abortion -- because we have done something nobody else could have done.""

This pronounced if perhaps ill-advised attempt to appeal to women is intentional. A recent 19th News/SurveyMonkey poll suggests female voters are the reason Vice President Kamala Harris holds a slight 3-point lead over Trump nationwide.

""I always thought that women liked me,"" Trump told the Pennsylvania crowd. ""I never thought I had a problem, but the fake news keeps saying women don't like me. I don't believe it."" (The lady doth protest too much, methinks.)

Another New York Times/Siena College poll conducted in August found that a growing number of voters in swing states consider abortion to be their key voting issue in November. Since June 2022, when Roe was overturned, abortion has been on the ballot in seven states -- and people have voted to protect abortion access every single time.

Of course, as is often the case, Trump's recent comments were also rooted in some truth. For example, Trump claimed that ""women are less healthy"" than they were four years ago. And in a post-Roe world, that is in some ways true. An estimated 25 million women live in a state without access to abortion care, thanks to our would-be ""protector,"" leaving women to bleed out in hospital parking lots, slip into comas due to preventable infections, and in the cases of Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, die, all as a direct result of their states' near-total abortion bans.

Trump claimed that women are ""more stressed and depressed and unhappy, and are less optimistic and confident about their future than they were four years ago."" There is also some truth there. While Trump was busy pontificating on the effectiveness of injecting disinfectant to ""clean the lungs"" during the onset of the pandemic, women were experiencing an increase in depression, anxiety and burnout as they tried to work from home while facilitating virtual learning for their children.

Over 170,000 of us have endured the stress of traveling out-of-state for abortion care. An estimated 5.6 million of us are living in a county with limited or no access to prenatal care. Many of us are choosing to travel significant distances so we can safely give birth in a state that will not force a physician to deny us a life-saving abortion if we experience a devastating pregnancy complication, trying to navigate a world where we have less reproductive rights than our mothers.

So yes, many women are scared and tired and worried about their futures -- at least in part because of Donald Trump, his party and their wildly unpopular policies. And while Trump is seemingly hellbent on trying to cast a spell over women voters, conjuring up lie after lie about how his policies will somehow make us healthier, safer and more free, he is not as powerful as the women past generations of sexist patriarchs burned at the stake.

It's not surprising that a man who chose the president of the He-Man Woman-Haters club as a running mate would cling to the misogynistic belief that women are innately helpless. It's not a shock that instead of listening to women voters when they say, in overwhelming numbers, that they want access to abortion care, Trump continues to misdiagnose both the symptoms and the cure to our post-Roe health crises.

What is shocking is that in spite of all of this, some women -- predominantly white women -- will continue to believe they need a ""protector"" to save them. What they really need is the freedom to protect and save themselves."

She said of her mother, ""(She) never thought she'd see a Black person president in her life. She did. Now, Kamala Harris is (running) for president. My mother says she doesn't care what she does, let's just get her in there. And I simply don't feel the same.""

CNN's John King spoke to a group of voters throughout Georgia about their intentions in November. The state helped propel President Biden to victory in 2020.

However, Willis said that she agreed with Harris on abortion and argued that sometimes Trump talked down to Black people.

Kim Cavaliere, a Gwinnett County resident who leans Democrat but voted third party in the previous two elections, told CNN she wasn't pleased with either choice.

""But did she convince me she has what it takes? No,"" Cavaliere said of Harris, despite conceding the vice president won her debate against Trump. ""Right now, I am not settling and am not pleased with the choices.""

Christine Nguyen, who plans to vote for Harris and owns a small business in Decatur, told CNN that the economy could be a problem for Harris' chances.

""That comes up very often,"" she told King. ""I hear it a lot, even in my family of entrepreneurs, it comes up every now and then, right, that Trump just knows business better, that he's, you know, more savvy. ... But I think at the end of the day, it's what you value and, like, what your beliefs are in terms of your ethics.""

She said Harris' connection to the Biden administration could hurt her chances.

""It definitely has hurt our business in the past couple of months, seeing the prices go up for our supplies, and us not being able to adjust the prices accordingly,"" Nguyen said. ""I think that could highly impact her chances, because she has been part of the administration in the past four years."""
Undecided voters could sway the election. Here are the issues that matter to them.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/alex-wagner-michigan-union-workers-swing-state-undecided-voters-rcna172727,2024-09-26T17:33:46Z,"Alex Wagner sat down with union workers in battleground Michigan to find out what's really going on in the minds of undecided voters.

On Tuesday, MSNBC host Alex Wagner hosted a live show from the critical battleground state of Michigan. With less than six weeks to go until Election Day, both Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have made the state a top priority.

Victory in the Great Lakes State is still within reach for both campaigns: A USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll published this week found Harris narrowly leads Trump there, 48% to 45%, well within the poll's 4.4% margin of error.

Wagner sat down with voters from a key constituency being courted by Harris and Trump: union members. According to NBC News exit polls, 21% of people who cast a ballot in Michigan in 2020 came from a household with one or more union members.

Wagner described her conversations with the group as a ""fascinating, complicated snapshot from the frontlines of the 2024 election,"" and said their thoughts were ""critical at understanding why this race remains so very close.""

While some union members Wagner spoke with had already made up their minds on the candidates, many remained undecided. That same USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found 4% of voters in Michigan were still unsure whom they would vote for in November.

""I'm undecided because I haven't seen enough of it yet. I need to pay closer attention and kind of do more independent research before I make my judgment,"" one voter told Wagner.

Immigration was a top concern listed by several undecided voters, especially among those casting their ballot for the first time. Those voters told Wagner they were concerned about the southern border and believed immigrants were taking jobs away from U.S. citizens. (Studies have shown immigrants to the U.S. create more jobs than they take.) Housing and wages were also top issues among first-time, undecided voters.

But, as Wagner noted, perhaps what was just as interesting was what was not on the minds of these voters. The union workers expressed little interest in stories that have dominated media coverage of the campaign, like abortion or Trump's legal troubles.

""I'm not familiar with the charges that are being brought against him"" in connection to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, one voter told Wagner. ""I'm not following that.""

Only one voter in the crowd of nearly 60 raised their hand when asked if they were familiar with the Dobbs decision, the Supreme Court ruling that eliminated the constitutional right to abortion.

""What matters most and what may ultimately determine their votes this year are the conversations they have in their community,"" Wagner observed.

There was also a stark generational divide among the union members, with several older, veteran members throwing their support behind Harris. Younger members tended to be undecided or leaning toward Trump.

""We have to move our country forward,"" one Harris supporter told Wagner, adding: ""Donald Trump is pulling us backwards.""

Another Harris voter referred to his fellow union member's concern over the economy but argued that preserving democracy was a more important issue. ""I'm not going to lose my democracy over the price of a gallon of gas or the price of a loaf of bread,"" he said. ""Democracy is too fragile, and it's too important."""
'Against our daughters': Cruz challenger hit with blistering 7-figure ad over transgender sports bill vote,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/against-our-daughters-cruz-challenger-hit-blistering-7-figure-ad-over-transgender-sports-bill-vote,2024-09-26T16:28:42Z,"FIRST ON FOX: A conservative super PAC is blanketing the airwaves with a new advertisement slamming Texas Democratic Senate candidate Rep. Colin Allred, who is locked in a high-profile race against Republican incumbent Sen. Ted Cruz.

The pro-Cruz Truth and Courage PAC is rolling out a $3 million dollar ad buy in Texas hitting the Democratic congressman over his previous support of allowing biological males to compete in sports against female opponents.

""Texas girls are tough,"" the 30-second version of the ad says, as it shows young women training for various sporting events. ""But they're facing a new opponent they can't beat by digging deeper.""

""Colin Allred could have stopped men from competing in women's sports, but instead, he voted against our daughters,"" the ad continues before it shows a man resembling Allred with the name ""Allred"" on his jersey, tackling one of the girls.

CRUZ INTERRUPTED BY ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATOR WHO YELLED, 'F---ING JEWS' DURING HEARING ON 'HATE'

""What kind of man does that?""

There is also a 60-second version of the ad that shows him in a couple of photos with then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. As the ad shows the photos, the narrator says Allred ""voted against the Protection of Women and Girls Act of 2023. He stood with woke progressives and radical Democrats, not our daughters.""

The ad, which will also run in Spanish, cites Allred's vote in Congress against The Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2023, which passed the House on a party line vote with President Biden saying he would veto it if it got to his desk.

""This is a disgusting, false attack, and another example of how Ted Cruz only wants to divide Texans,"" Allred campaign spokesperson Josh Stewart told Fox News Digital.

""He'll say anything to distract from his dangerous abortion ban that is putting women's lives at risk, trying to raise the retirement age for Social Security and Medicare and fleeing to Cancun during a deadly winter storm.""

Cruz won his last Senate race by about three points in 2018, and some experts believe that this year's race could be close again.

While the Real Clear Politics polling average shows Cruz with a five-point lead in the race, there are some troubling signs for the Republican incumbent, including recent polls showing Cruz with a lead close to within the margin of error.

TEXAS DEM'S SENATE AD FEATURES BORDER WALL HE ONCE BLASTED AS 'RACIST'

""Texas will stay red this November and Ted Cruz will win re-election,"" Jimmy Keady, the founder and president of JLK Political Strategies, recently told Fox News Digital.

""But Republicans should not take the threat of losing this state lightly. As the Republican Party makes a play for blue states, Democrats are going to start making a play for red states... to hold these seats, Republicans will have to stay disciplined on messaging and prioritize candidate recruitment.""

Larry Hogan highlights how it's important people remain focused on the issues and not alienate swing voters, on 'Your World.'

The Democratic candidate for senate in Maryland has pulled significantly ahead of her Republican rival, according to a recent poll.

The Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released Thursday shows Democrat Angela Alsobrooks holding an 11% lead over her rival, Republican Larry Hogan.

Alsobrooks is leading Hogan 51% to 40%, according to the Washington Post-University of Maryland poll.

ACCUSATIONS OF IMPROPER TAX BREAKS FLY IN CRUCIAL SENATE RACE: 'RULES DON'T APPLY'

The gap between them among likely voters is surprising, given that both candidates enjoy a similar level of popularity with respondents.

Approximately 53% of respondents expressed favorable impressions of Hogan, compared to 27% who reported an unfavorable impression. Respondents gave Alsobrooks a 50% favorability rating, compared to 22% unfavorability.

Registered voters in the poll ranked the economy as the most important issue of the November elections, followed by immigration and then abortion.

MARYLAND SENATE RACE POLL SHOWS DEMOCRAT ALSOBROOKS LEADING GOP'S HOGAN, DESPITE ONE IN THREE NOT KNOWING WHO SHE IS

The Washington Post-University of Maryland poll was conducted between Sept. 19 and Sept. 23 with a sample size of 1,012 registered voters.

It has a reported margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

With Democrats outnumbering Republicans by a roughly two-to-one margin in the state, Hogan will need a good chunk of cross-over voters to have a chance and has been highlighting his opposition to Trump and his independence from his party as he runs for the Senate.

Hogan, who flirted with a 2024 White House run before deciding against it, stood out from most other Republicans this spring for publicly calling for the guilty verdicts in Trump's criminal trial to be respected.

Hogan skipped July's Republican National Convention, where Trump was formally nominated, and has said he would not be voting for the former president. Hogan's campaign, after the former president's comments, spotlighted in a statement that ""Governor Hogan has been clear he is not supporting President Trump just as he didn't in 2016 and 2020.""

Republicans are also aiming to flip seats in Ohio and Montana, two states Trump comfortably carried four years ago. And five more Democratic-held seats up for grabs this year are in crucial presidential-election battleground states.

Will Cain breaks it all down. Plus, the Ruthless Podcast guys join Will to discuss if Trump can defeat Harris, the future of the GOP, and if sports are 'bread and circuses.'

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are virtually tied in three crucial battleground states, according to new statewide surveys from Marist College.

The Marist Poll released Thursday finds that Harris and Trump are tied at 49% among likely voters in North Carolina who were asked which candidate they were leaning toward. Of those polled who have made up their minds, 91% said they strongly support their choice.

The race is tight in Arizona as well, where Trump polls just one point ahead of Harris, 50% to 49%, according to the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. The same goes for Georgia, where 50% of likely voters are leaning towards Trump and 49% say they are more inclined to vote for Harris.

The Marist Polls were conducted from Sept. 19-24, surveying 4,643 registered voters across all three states who report they are definitely voting in this year's election.

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: THE EDGE IS CLEAR ON THIS KEY ISSUE

There are 43 Electoral College votes up for grabs between Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina. Trump, a Republican, won all three in his 2016 victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, but lost Arizona and Georgia to President Biden in his 2020 defeat. North Carolina, a swing state that Trump won twice, has an incumbent Democratic governor and appears more competitive this year as the Republican candidate for governor, Mark Robinson, is mired in scandal over posts he allegedly made on a porn website and polls poorly against state Attorney General Josh Stein, the Democratic candidate.

""North Carolina, with its 16 electoral votes, is both the Harris and Trump campaigns' backup plan after the hard-fought battle over Pennsylvania,"" said Dr. Lee M. Miringoff, Director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. ""North Carolina is so close that the five regions in the state line up now almost exactly as they did four years ago. It's as if the Biden years and the 2024 campaign haven't happened.""

Harris and Trump are tied at 48% among North Carolina independents who are likely to vote. Biden carried Tar Heel independents by four points in 2020, according to the 2020 Presidential Exit Poll. Harris leads Trump among Black voters 86% to 13%, but underperforms compared to Biden, who earned 92% of the Black vote in North Carolina in 2020. Trump has an advantage over Harris with white voters, 59% to 40%, though Harris has improved with this demographic over Biden, who won 33% of the white vote in 2020.

The top issues for North Carolina voters are inflation (32%), preserving democracy (28%), immigration (14%) and abortion (11%), according to the poll.

HARRIS AND TRUMP DEADLOCKED IN PENNSYLVANIA AS FORMER PRESIDENT TRAILS IN OTHER 'BLUE WALL' STATES: POLL

Over in Arizona, Harris edges Trump among independents 51% to 47%. Biden won Arizona independents by 9 points four years ago, 53% to Trump's 44%. Again, Trump leads Harris among white voters 51% to 48%, while the Latino vote is competitive, with 51% leaning towards Trump and 49% towards Harris.

The top issues for Arizona voters are preserving democracy (27%), inflation (26%), immigration (21%) and abortion (14%), the survey said.

""Arizona's 11 electoral votes are up for grabs, but the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate (Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz.) has a double-digit lead,"" said Miringoff. ""Voters in the state, like elsewhere, are willing to split their ticket this time unlike the straight party voting that occurred in 2016 and 2020.""

Harris also leads Trump among Georgia independents by five percentage points, 51% to 46%. Similar to Arizona, Biden won Georgia independents by 9 points in what was the first presidential election win for Peach State Democrats since 1992. Trump heavily contested the 2020 results in Georgia and continues to make unproven allegations of widespread voter fraud that have been rejected by Georgia officials, including Republican Gov. Brian Kemp.

EARLY VOTING BEGINS IN ILLINOIS, NORTH DAKOTA, FLORIDA AND MICHIGAN

""Georgia was ground zero for election controversies in 2020. Yet, the overwhelming majority of Georgians express confidence that elections will be fair and accurate,"" said Miringoff. ""Interestingly, most Democrats and Republicans share this view despite the results last time.""

Georgia voters rank inflation as the top issue (34%), followed by preserving democracy (24%), immigration (13%) and abortion (11%).

A Fox News national poll taken after the first debate between Harris and Trump spotlighted that 39% of voters surveyed said the economy was their most pressing issue, far ahead of immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues tested were in single digits.

""An increasing number say grocery prices and housing costs are tough for their family,"" the Fox News poll notes.

Trump led Harris on the economy by 5 points in the Fox News poll.

""The issue profile of this election continues to favor Trump,"" said Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Democrat Chris Anderson.

But Shaw added that Trump's ""edge on economic issues has decreased, probably due to Harris' messaging on housing costs and taxes, both of which target the middle class and appear to be paying off.""

A Forbes review of Facebook found nearly 800 groups offering to connect women to abortion remedies -- at least 300 of which operate in countries where abortion is at least sometimes illegal, or even a criminal offense. But the groups are something of a double-edged sword, says Katy Mayall, the director for strategic initiatives at the Center for Reproductive Rights. While they may get some women help, they can be a gateway to scams and fraudsters and carry health and privacy risks for people in restrictive countries.

TOPLINE Philip Morris International is rehabilitating nicotine's image with its wildly in-demand flavored Zyn pouches, embraced by celebrities, entrepreneurs and star athletes.

By the end of 2024, PMI, which owns Zyn manufacturer Swedish Match, expects to sell as much as 580 million cans of Zyn, a 50% increase over the 385 million sold last year. Forbes estimates that Zyn sales, which PMI does not break out in public filings, generated $1.3 billion last year (about 3.7% of PMI's $35 billion in total revenue) and could hit $1.9 billion this year.

Zyn is six times more profitable than PMI's cigarette division, says Bonnie Herzog, an analyst for Goldman Sachs who covers the tobacco industry. And unlike cigarettes, which have been steadily declining in volume for the last decade, Zyn is in hypergrowth mode. Shipment volume in the U.S. has jumped a staggering 238% since 2020.

But while pouches have successfully divorced nicotine from the cigarette, they still have health risks. Plus, the FDA has not authorized them for sale, although Swedish Match filed an application in March 2020. This means the products are technically illegal, but the FDA is allowing them to stay on the market while the agency reviews applications.

And at least five lawsuits allege that PMI is marketing Zyn to minors. ""Zyn is Juul 2.0,"" says Scott Schlesinger, a Florida-based attorney who recently filed a class action against PMI and Swe­dish Match.

But Stacey Kennedy, head of PMI's U.S. operations, insists that PMI is marketing Zyn only to adults who already smoke or use nicotine. ""I think Zyn is proof that nicotine can be used [to replace] more harmful products,"" she says.

WHY IT MATTERS ""Zyn has become a runaway success for PMI. Its newest nicotine product will generate nearly $2 billion in sales this year, Forbes estimates,"" says staff writer Will Yakowicz. ""But the nicotine pouch is more than just a financial juggernaut -- Zyn has spawned its own culture online (also known as the Zynternet), with viral memes and celebrities touting the brand. And it has even entered the presidential election: Ohio Senator JD Vance has been photographed holding a container of Zyn, while on the other side of the aisle, Tim Walz levied a 95% tax on Zyn and other nicotine products as governor of Minnesota.""

Morning Glory: Why is Kamala Harris skipping the Al Smith Dinner in New York City?,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-why-kamala-harris-skipping-al-smith-dinner-new-york-city,2024-09-26T09:20:40Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris should reverse her decision to skip the biggest Catholic-sponsored fund-raiser for the poor and the vulnerable in the country's biggest city and not just for her own political benefit. She should do so stat. The event is October 17, so there is plenty of time to change her mind but it should not be a poll-driven choice. It's the right thing to do.

Cardinal Francis Spellman founded and hosted the the first Al Smith dinner honoring New York's legendary political figure, the first ever Catholic nominated to be president by either major party. Smith was nominated by Democrats to become president in 1928 and lost in spectacular fashion to Herbert Hoover. Hoover garnered 444 Electoral College votes by winning 40 states to Smith's 87 votes and 8 states.

Smith had been elected governor of New York four times before his second presidential run in 1928 which got him the Democratic nomination that year. Smith had been turned back in 1924 in his first run for the nomination and his quest for a second Democratic nomination was blunted by FDR who got the Democratic nod in 1932 and blew out Hoover as Hoover had blown out Smith four years earlier. After leaving politics, Smith oversaw the construction of the Empire State Building, helped lead the early anti-Nazi movement in the states, and overcame his personal enmity for FDR to help with the war effort. This great figure in American political history died in 1944.

Cardinal Spellman inaugurated a dinner honoring Smith in 1946 as a fundraiser to benefit New York's most vulnerable women and children. Since 1960, the nominees of both major parties have attended the dinner with one exception: Walter Mondale skipped the dinner in 1984. The dinners are jovial, light-hearted affairs and, during the presidential campaigns, both major party candidates gently mock themselves and their opponents. Is it a surprise that Mondale declined to try and entertain opposite President Ronald Reagan? Taking on an incumbent president is a tall order even when there is a Cardinal serving as de facto referee, especially when that president is ""the Great Communicator.""

Kamala Harris has said ""No."" As of this writing she won't go to the Al Smith dinner. The ever-available ""scheduling conflicts"" has been cited as her reason. Think on it a bit. Why wouldn't she go?

It's a capital ""C"" Catholic and a small ""c"" catholic affair. Like all giant fundraisers it begins late and often goes on too long and getting home can be a problem, but the national media turns out in great numbers as does New York's business and Catholic elite. It's the Metropolitan Museum Gala minus the Hollywood and Broadway celebrities and a red carpet. The Al Smith dinner is held in midtown and has already sold out. White tails are expected for the men on the dais.

Every four years the ""earned media"" for the candidate who can be funny about themselves along with a deft light jab or two at their opponent is immense. And there we have the first of the hurdles preventing Vice President Harris's from attending.

There is a major reason and two minor reasons for Harris to skip this ritual.

First, Kamala Harris doesn't do ""light humor."" She doesn't actually ""do"" humor at all. Her timing is awful and even with Oprah as her wingman she crashed in last week's special event. At one point Oprah turned directly toward camera during the seemingly endless closing soliloquy by the Vice President and appeared to be giving a stoney-faced glare at the stage manager in the hope that he or she would do the big wrap motion for the Veep. Kamala drafted Hollywood superstars and the country's most successful communicator for that event and still stumbled her way into a fiasco. The chances of an even worse performance with Donald Trump two seats down probably seemed too great and accepting the invite just too risky when she made her initial decision to reject the invite.

She may also be leery of an overtly Catholic celebration that would have her seated next to Cardinal Timothy Dolan. Given Harris's extreme views on abortion -- no limits at all on abortion and opposition to ""Born Alive"" acts at the state and federal level -- Harris has got to be afraid of her hard-left supporters' objections to appearing in public with a ""Prince of the Church,"" a church that is as pro-life as any organization or faith. The left wing of the Democrats are busy demonizing Israel right now, but the Catholic Church is their second favorite target.

KAMALA HARRIS TO SIT FOR INTERVIEW WITH MSNBC DAYS AFTER HOST DEFENDED VP DODGING ON POLICY

""We're disappointed,"" Cardinal Dolan commented on Harris's rebuff. ""We're not used to this. We don't know how to handle it.

""This hasn't happened in 40 years, since Walter Mondale turned down the invitation, and remember he lost 49 out of 50 states,"" the Cardinal added, and noted that both Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and New York Governor Kathy Hochul were trying to get the Vice President to change her mind.

Don't count on it. Because of reason three: Kamala Harris cannot afford one more face plant. The ice is already breaking under her, forcing her into the MSNBC studios for a taped and almost certainly heavily edited ""interview"" with Stephanie Ruhle.

That's a safe place for the Veep but it won't register on any electoral scoreboard. It is MSNBC for goodness sakes. The last real center-right much less conservative host on that network left long ago. Harris is so insecure about her ability to field questions she's only going to talk to Oprah and MSNBC hosts. She's fears live extemporaneous remarks, (and even a teleprompter wouldn't make her into what she isn't.)

But she should try. If she can't show up for a fundraiser in Manhattan, how does she expect people to believe she can deal with the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping much less Russia's Putin or Iran's Khamenei?

Change your mind Madame Vice President. Cross this very low hurdle even though you won't have two moderators to help you over it."

Next week's highly anticipated vice presidential debate between Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Democrat Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, while sure to generate buzz, is unlikely to make much difference in pushing undecided voters toward either presidential candidate, former President Trump or Vice President Harris, insiders agree.

Even so, experts who spoke to Fox News Digital did say there could be some indirect impact that can't be completely discounted in a very close race.

""The VP debate is usually pretty [low-profile], they usually don't get as much attention as the presidential debates,"" Christopher Devine, author of ""Do Running Mates Matter?: The Influence of Vice Presidential Candidates in Presidential Elections,"" told Fox News Digital in an interview.

Devine suggested that while the upcoming debate will probably result in some viral moments, it won't have the same level of interest or influence on voters as the 2008 VP debate when Sarah Palin on Republican John McCain's ticket stole the spotlight in her matchup with then-Sen. Joe Biden.

""But the running mate does have what we call an indirect effect on vote choice in that it influences what people think of the presidential candidate, knowing that Donald Trump could have picked anybody and chose JD Vance or that Kamala Harris could have picked anyone and chose Tim Walz, and how they perform on the debate stage,"" Devine added.

Tevi Troy, a presidential historian and a former George W. Bush Cabinet member, agreed but said their performances will reflect more of an impact on the public's view of themselves.

""Many VP debates are completely forgettable,"" Troy told Fox News Digital.

JD VANCE DEBATE PREP STRATEGY INCLUDES TAPPING PROMINENT LAWMAKER TO PLAY WALZ

""This year might be different, and it might be different because of the whole Harris-Walz hide-the-ball campaign where she didn't run for the nomination, so she wasn't scrutinized,"" he continued. ""Then she's been very reluctant to have any unscripted interviews since then, and when she does, it's usually with a very friendly reporter, and even in the debate against Trump, there's a perception that the moderators were harder on him than they were on her.""

""There have been a number of instances where Walz has [been] asked about her views, and he kind of ducks what her views are because if they say what she's been in the past, which is pretty liberal, [one of the] most liberal U.S. senators, then that's not popular and not helpful to her political prospects,"" Troy added. ""But Vance also has a number of things from his past that have surfaced, that have led to bad stories, like the cat-lady thing, for example, and Walz has not been shy about willing to go after Vance and criticize.""

With no further presidential debates in the works before November, the running mates will likely be making the final head-to-head case to voters for their respective campaigns.

Each candidate is sure to jab the other, with Vance likely zeroing in on Walz's progressive policies in Minnesota and Walz likely to paint Vance as extreme, citing earlier statements on abortion prior to joining the Trump ticket.

John Leguizamo says Trump is gaining support among religious Latinos because they're 'homophobic',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/john-leguizamo-says-trump-gaining-support-among-religious-latinos-because-theyre-homophobic,2024-09-26T01:45:53Z,"Small business owners Shana Gray, Ryan Sprankle and Rafael Arroyo share the impact inflation has had on their companies and weigh VP Harris and former President Trump's economic policies.

Actor and comedian John Leguizamo said that religious Latinos who support former President Trump were ""homophobic.""

During an interview with TMZ, Leguizamo was asked about Vice President Kamala Harris polling lower with Latino voters than President Biden had when he was the 2024 presidential nominee. The ""John Wick"" and ""Encanto"" actor said Harris needed to be more ""aggressive"" and ""court"" Latinos, suggesting the VP needed a big-name celebrity to endorse her and encourage younger people in this demographic to vote.

When asked about Latinos in the Sun Belt trending toward Trump, Leguizamo suggested Harris would have a difficult time winning over religious Latinos due to their views on abortion and LGBTQ issues.

""Latino people are not a monolith,"" said Leguizamo. ""No group is, right? So, religious Latinos, they are anti-abortion and homophobic,"" he said, adding that these voters might be swayed on jobs and housing instead.

CNN DATA GURU SAYS HARRIS IS 'STRUGGLING AMONG VOTERS OF COLOR' IN THE SUN BELT: 'REALLY INTERESTING'

""You might get them, because the thing Latinos care most about is jobs and housing,"" he continued.

""So if you're talking about start[ing] businesses, Latino women are No. 1 start-up businesses in America. And we Latinos poll very large [sic] on keeping the housing market going...and Kamala Harris brought up those points and she's gotta keep hitting those points,"" he said.

Leguizamo also suggested Latinos who support Trump on immigration don't have ""sympathy or empathy"" for those coming into America seeking asylum or those who cross the border illegally.

""I think a lot of immigrants who came here are competitive with other immigrants coming in for some weird reason and have no sympathy or empathy for people looking for a better life,"" he said.

""Nobody wants to come to the border that way...you only do that if you have no other option. If you're running away from violence, starving to death,"" he continued. ""They're only coming here to work. To get a job -- no American would risk their life for a job.""

HISPANIC VOTERS IN NEVADA SAY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAKING SOME CONSIDER VOTING TRUMP

In an interview with Salon last May, the politically outspoken actor said that Latino Americans don't understand that Trump was responsible for ""damaging"" the economy.

""Because Latinos, they're blaming him [Biden] for the economy, which they shouldn't be because COVID was the culprit and Trump not handling COVID was the culprit in damaging our economy,"" he told the outlet.

Leguizamo also compared Latinos who support Trump to roaches supporting insecticide.

""Latin people for Republicans are like roaches for Raid. Let's just get real,"" Leguizamo said on an episode of ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" in October of 2020. ""I think there's a level of self-hate or just lack of care for the rest of your Latin brothers and sisters who are in cages, who are being demonized by this president.""

Hispanic voters give Trump a 42% to 37% advantage over Harris regarding immigration policy, Reuters/Ipsos polling from late August shows. These voters also prefer Trump's platform on the economy by 45% to 36%, but they give Harris a double-digit advantage on the issues of health care and climate change, according to the poll.

Actress Jennifer Lawrence spoke to People Magazine about how abortion access is the key issue driving her support for Vice President Kamala Harris.

Lawrence, an Oscar-winning actress, rose to fame as the protagonist in the film adaptation of ""The Hunger Games"" franchise, has frequently spoken out about her feminist views. This election, she told People Magazine, is one where ""abortion is literally on the ballot.""

""I'm voting for Kamala Harris because I think she's an amazing candidate and I know that she will do whatever she can to protect reproductive rights,"" she told the celebrity news outlet. ""That's the most important thing, is to not let somebody into the White House who is going to ban abortion.""

Lawrence has continued her career of storytelling by both producing and promoting films through her production company, Excellent Cadaver. She spoke about two upcoming documentary films her company will release in 2024, one of which is Zurawski v Texas. This documentary will shed light on abortion providers who sued the state of Texas in 2023, and is reportedly co-produced with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton.

JENNIFER LAWRENCE FLAMED FOR CLAIMING SHE WAS FIRST-EVER FEMALE ACTION MOVIE LEAD: 'OH HONEY, NO'

""Women are dying,"" Lawrence said, suggesting the film project could ""enlighten people's idea of what abortion is and why certain people need abortions -- and why it's so important to keep lawmakers out of families and out of people's doctors' offices... These laws are made by random [W]hite men, and they're not made by healthcare providers.""

The other documentary film, Bread and Roses, is from Afghan filmmaker Sahra Mani, and shows the plight of Afghan women under Taliban rule.

People Magazine reported on how Lawrence hopes these film projects can have a political impact, ""Lawrence hopes both films inspire audiences to contact their leaders, donate, volunteer -- and most of all, she says, exercise their civic duty. 'Take action by voting,' she says. 'The most important thing that we can do right now is just vote.'"""
Opinion | 5 takeaways from Kamala Harris' first solo interview as the Democratic nominee,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/5-takeaways-kamala-harris-msnbc-interview-stephanie-ruhle-rcna172740,2024-09-25T23:49:19Z,"The vice president made a convincing case for why voters should trust her more than Donald Trump to care more about their economic worries.

MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle spoke with Vice President Kamala Harris following the Democratic presidential nominee's speech at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, where she laid out an economic vision for her administration if elected.

If there was an overarching theme to the interview, it was the disconnect between the two parties' records on the economy, the public's perception of those records and the irony that some middle-class people -- including some union members -- believe former President Donald Trump has a greater understanding of their struggles than the vice president.

Here are five takeaways from this exclusive interview, her first solo sit-down since she became the Democratic nominee.

Ruhle pointed out during the interview that ""most likely voters still think Donald Trump is better to handle the economy."" But Harris articulated how she comes from a background that's far more relatable to the struggles of most Americans.

""Part of the reason I even talk about working at McDonald's is that there are people who work at McDonald's in our country there who are trying to raise a family. I worked there as a student. I was a kid who worked there."" Harris added that some families are ""trying to raise families and pay rent"" based on that income. ""I think part of the difference between me and my opponent includes our perspective on the needs of the American people and what our responsibility is to meet those needs.""

As Helaine Olen noted in an MSNBC column in April, after California's $20-an-hour minimum wage for fast-food workers became law, the era of mostly teenagers working fast-food jobs after high school was rendered obsolete, and ""well over half of California's fast-food workers are people of color and over 25.""

In an interview in which Harris often stuck to well-rehearsed talking points, her answer about her time at McDonald's came off as the most genuine, and it was the best evidence that she sees struggling people not as abstractions but as real human beings.

Harris won her debate against Trump by triggering him into a rambling rage after she characterized his ""big, beautiful"" rallies as small, boring affairs that have many attendees seeking the exit. It was amusing, then, to see her sandwich that same point in an answer about how she's going to keep reminding people that Trump is lying about his economic record and lying when he says he stands with workers.

Harris described the ""challenge"" she faces to ""earn the vote of everybody."" She argued that ""regardless of what somebody says in a small rally somewhere ... part of what I'm doing in this campaign is to remind people, just like here in Pittsburgh, of the reality of who has stood with union labor, who stands for American manufacturing, who stands for American jobs.""

The only two words Trump is likely to hear are ""small rally.""

When the vice president said Trump had ""left us with the worst unemploy,et rate since the Great Depression,"" Ruhle pointed out that that dramatic downturn happened during the height of the pandemic.

""Even before the pandemic, he lost manufacturing jobs,"" Harris countered. His raison d'être as president, Harris essentially argued, was to provide ""tax cuts for the billionaires and the top corporations in our country.""

When Ruhle asked Harris about the most recent time she'd made a gut decision, she answered, ""Probably the biggest gut decision I've made most recently is to choose my running mate. There were lots of good, incredible candidates, and ultimately that came down to the gut decision.""

Though Republicans tried to make hay with the preposterous claim that antisemitism made Harris (who is married to a Jewish man) pick Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, picking Walz has proven to be a smart political choice, and it demonstrated she can make wise decisions in a limited amount of time.

Trump has recently boasted that he'll be women's protector. Harris, who has made abortion rights a centerpiece of her campaign, said that's rich coming from a man who once said women who get abortions should be prosecuted and whose Supreme Court appointees helped dismantle Roe v. Wade.

But Ruhle's question about Trump's statement prompted what was perhaps Harris' best line of the interview: ""I don't think the women of America need him to say he's going to protect them. The women of America need him to trust them."""
"Senate passes funding bill without SAVE Act, avoiding potential shutdown",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-passes-funding-bill-without-save-act-avoiding-potential-shutdown,2024-09-25T22:39:19Z,"Fox News' Chad Pergram on the House rejecting a GOP spending bill that would also require proof of citizenship to vote and what the next steps are.

The Senate passed a short-term spending bill on Wednesday, avoiding a partial government shutdown at the end of the month and allowing lawmakers up for re-election to head home early to campaign.

By a vote of 78 to 18, senators approved a spending bill that will keep funding steady until Dec. 20, known as a continuing resolution (CR).

It passed in the House hours before being taken to the floor in the upper chamber, with representatives approving the spending bill 341 to 82.

132 Republican House members voted in favor of it. The bill saw 82 votes against it, all of which were cast by Republicans.

Lawmakers avoided a partial shutdown with only days to spare, despite a GOP demand that the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act be included. Several Republicans in Congress had insisted the SAVE Act be attached to the spending bill, including some in the Senate.

GOP SENATORS EYE COMPREHENSIVE CHINA STRATEGY TO CURB CCP INFLUENCE

The SAVE Act would require proof of citizenship in order to register to vote.

A short-term bill that included that measure failed in the House of Representatives when Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., brought it for a vote last week, effectively killing hopes for a CR with the SAVE Act attached.

The House voted down the stopgap bill 202 to 220, with several Republicans voting against it and two voting ""present."" Three vulnerable Democrats voted in favor of it.

A CR with the SAVE Act had also been backed by former President Donald Trump, who urged Republicans not to accept a spending deal that did not include it. But while Trump encouraged it, Republicans both publicly and privately worried that their party would be blamed for a shutdown.

JOE MANCHIN SAYS HE WON'T ENDORSE HARRIS OVER SUPPORT FOR ELIMINATING FILIBUSTER

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., even laid the groundwork for blaming the GOP for a potential shutdown in recent floor remarks, labeling the possibility as a ""Trump shutdown.""

""Democrats and Americans don't want a Trump shutdown,"" he claimed.

Republicans decided not to prolong the fight over the CR and potentially risk a government shutdown, which is attributed by some in part to incoming severe weather that would make it difficult for senators to get back to their home states and looming competitive elections that they want to get on the campaign trail for.

While the CR will keep the government in full operation past the initial appropriations deadline, it sets up another potential standoff before Christmas and a GOP-dreaded omnibus measure that squeezes several necessary legislative items into one massive bill."

Last week, the 2024 Lasker-Bloomberg Public Service Award was granted to married duo Quarraisha Abdool Karim and Salim S. Abdool Karim.The South African-born researchers began their work while both were at Columbia University in New York during the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. That disease wasn't the focus of their research at the time, but that changed quickly. ""HIV absolutely dominated New York in 1988,"" Salim told Forbes. And the two realized that the disease wasn't going to stay there. ""When we got back to South Africa, we committed ourselves to work on HIV,"" he continued.

Back home, their research led them to realize that preventing the spread of HIV meant empowering women to protect themselves. So they began their research into a wide variety of different types of prophylactic treatments that might help. They spent the next 18 years ""failing repeatedly,"" Salim said, while also through the years working on advocacy and education about HIV/AIDS to bring help to those who needed it and to find other ways to prevent its spread.

In the early 2000's, the pair turned their attention to tenofovir, a drug originally directed at herpes which was approved in 2001 by the FDA for treating HIV. The couple wanted to see if it might also be used to help prevent infection in the first place. After a years-long study, the couple presented the results that the drug could lower the risk of infection for women at an AIDS research conference in 2010. They received a standing ovation at the presentation of their results, and this work became the foundation for current HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (aka PReP), which has helped slow down the spread of HIV/AIDS throughout the world.

The Lasker Awards are sometimes called ""America's Nobel Prize"" - recognizing some of the most important advancements in medical science. Which makes receiving it ""humbling at one level, but also inspiring,"" Quaraissha said. ""Because what we're being recognized for is a combination of science, contribution to policy and service to humanity at different levels. I think it really gave more meaning to what we've contributed to date.""

In the ultra-competitive world of cancer medicines, Summit Therapeutics is a relative minnow. The 21-year-old biotech company has just 130 employees, no revenue and no approved drugs. But in the past two weeks, its market capitalization has exploded following positive news about its most promising drug candidate.

Shares of Nasdaq-listed Summit Therapeutics nearly doubled since September 6, lifting the company's market capitalization to nearly $17 billion. That has in turn made its co-CEO, Maky Zanganeh, with a stake just under 5% plus a slew of options, a new billionaire -- worth an estimated $1.1 billion. She's one of just 34 self-made U.S. women billionaires, and one of three American women to have made a billion-dollar fortune in the healthcare sector. The other two: Bio-Rad Laboratories cofounder Alice Schwartz and United Therapeutics founder Martine Rothblatt.

Neuroscience: The FDA has approved arimoclomol, marketed by Zevra Therapeutics as Miplyffa, for treating Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) in combination with miglustat. NPC is a neurodegenerative disease and arimoclomol is the first approved treatment for it.

Genomics: Synthetic genomics company Constructive Bio announced it raised a $58 million series A round.

Generative AI: Novartis announced a research collaboration with Generate:Biomedicines to leverage the latter's generative AI for drug discovery platform to discover new treatments for multiple diseases. Generate:Biomedicines will receive $65 million upfront for the agreement, which is worth up to $1 billion in milestone payments plus royalties from any approved drugs.

Radiopharma: Radiopharmaceutical company Telix announced that it's acquiring U.S-based RLS in a deal worth up to $250 million, pending regulatory and shareholder approval, which will give it access to the latter's network of 31 radiopharmacies in 18 states. This will be Telix's third acquisition of 2024.

Medical Tech: MedTech startup Route 92 Medical announced it's raising $50 million in a series F extension.

Cell Therapy: GC Therapeutics, founded by a group of researchers in George Church's lab at Harvard, announced its launch along with a $65 million series A that brings its total capital raised to $75 million. The startup will be focused on developing a new generation of cell therapies.

A Forbes review of Facebook found nearly 800 groups and pages across 76 countries offering to connect women to abortion remedies -- at least 300 of which operate in countries where abortion is at least sometimes illegal, or even a criminal offense. All told, the groups have nearly 1.8 million members. Forbes found that Facebook groups and pages selling abortion drugs were present in nearly every major region around the world, including abortion-restrictive population centers.

Seventeen groups and pages claimed to provide abortion pills to women in the United States, though it is unclear how many of them actually make the pills available. The largest, which has more than 117,000 members, directed users to an abortion-related URL that subsequently redirected to an adult website. The Facebook groups are something of a double edged sword: while they may get some women help, they can be a gateway to scams and fraudsters into the picture, and carry health and privacy risks for people in restrictive countries.

What If We're Not As Divided And Polarized As We Think?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/marymeehan/2024/09/25/what-if-were-not-as-divided-and-polarized-as-we-think/,2024-09-25T20:21:19Z,"As we get closer and closer to the election, the insults are getting more heated, and the accusations more shocking. And for those paying attention, the political polarization is stretching our emotional and democratic seams to the point of shredding. But are we really as divided as social and news media tell us we are? Or is the content designed to keep us huddled in our ideological bubbles and hating ""the other""? Studies are showing that we all agree on much more and share more values than we think, but we believe everyone else is wrong, convinced by the tiny minority that is the loudest, most outraged, and most convincing.

On September 23 Gallup reported that ""a record-high 80% of U.S. adults believe Americans are greatly divided on the most important values, while 18% believe the country is united. The percentage seeing the nation as divided has ticked up from 77% the last time Gallup asked the question in 2016. It is more than 10 percentage points higher than in prior 2004 and 2012 measures.""

It's depressing to learn that we feel that way about each other, that we don't understand how other people think and vote the way they do. But there's hope, as studies tell a different story.

Reality shows us something very different from perception.

Last April Axios posed this thought experiment, ""What if we've been deceived into thinking we're more divided, more dysfunctional, and more defeated than we actually are?"" They acknowledge that deep divisions exist but debunk many culture war assumptions that dupe us into making the other side the enemy. They report statistics around topics like Christian nationalists, abortion, college professors, support for Israel, and immigrants. They went on to cite that most Americans, Republicans and Democrats, agree on the right to vote, freedom of speech, press, and religion, and the right to privacy.

TIME recently reported on this same issue. A professor named Todd Rose conducted a study on how people ranked specific topics and how they thought other people would rank the same topics.

""When the results were tallied, the surprise was not that ""People have individual rights"" came in first, or that ""People have high-quality health care"" finished second. The surprise was the third highest priority: ""Successfully address climate change."" We know that's a surprise because, on the list of what ""other people"" considered important, climate came in 33rd. In other words, no one thought their fellow Americans saw climate as the high-priority item nearly everyone actually considered it to be.""

""Much of what news reports, politicians, and pollsters call polarization, Rose understands as ""learned divisiveness"" -- ­division propagated by the assumption that it exists even where it does not.""

Another 2021 study in the Journal of Politics, found that when respondents identified someone they thought had a negative view, it was typically talking heads on a cable news show, not another regular person.

Market researcher, Diane Hessan's work adds to these findings. Her book, Our Common Ground: Insights from Four Years of Listening to American Voters, published in 2021, relates the findings from 500 voters over a four-year study. She found that ""An overwhelming majority of voters believe in commonsense gun licensing and regulation. They are pro-immigration. They believe climate change is real and the coronavirus is deadly. They care deeply about their families and are willing to work hard to make ends meet. And, they believe that Washington is slow, bureaucratic, and not working in their best interests.""

Path to Unity

With all these studies and insights there must be a way out of this negative spiral. It turns out the solution is up to us. We all need to consider the source of our information, listen more, drop the assumptions, and remember we share many of the same values and have a lot in common.

Here are a few suggestions from the experts.

- Axios posed this idea: ""In a given year, you meet scores or more people you spend enough time with to appraise their character. Think about them: How many do you think are decent, normal people who do volunteer work, help shovel after a storm, look out for family and neighbors?""

- Diane Hessan suggests: ""The path to healing our divided nation is both simple and profound. We must turn down the heat. We must begin to listen, to stop presuming, to try to understand, to treat each other with dignity, and to know that most Americans are not crazy radicals. We truly share common ground. If we can pull together, we can have a much better America.""

- The TIME article states that ""Fortunately, when people learn the truth about the other side, they feel better."" ""In so many studies, people register surprise that their assumptions about their rivals are wrong. ""They're like, 'Oh, I didn't know that,' and then they feel better about the other side,..."""
Trump has adopted the creepy rhetoric of pickup artists to woo women voters,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/trump-protector-women-pickup-artists-rhetoric-rcna172681,2024-09-25T19:38:48Z,"It's a big red flag that Donald Trump's ""protector"" line sounds like the misogynistic ""pickup artists"" who are popular in the MAGA movement.

Former President Donald Trump's paternalistic remark about his intention to be a ""protector"" for women -- who he claimed are lonely, stressed, depressed and unhappy -- has garnered predictable backlash since the weekend.

""You will no longer be abandoned, lonely or scared. You will no longer be in danger. ... You will no longer have anxiety from all of the problems our country has today,"" Trump said. ""You will be protected, and I will be your protector.""

Trump made the context for those assurances crystal clear when he added that women will ""no longer be thinking about abortion"" if he's elected. New York magazine's Jonathan Chait had an insightful analogy when he compared the comment to ""creepy abuser logic.""

Chait is spot-on, and when I heard Trump's comments, they reminded me of the pickup artists who've become popular in the MAGA movement. These characters are men who market themselves as tutors for men who want to learn how to attract women. Their tactics usually rely on infantilizing women and their desires, promoting the idea that men need to police women's behavior, and, oddly enough, using insults (known as negging) to manipulate women's affection. It's misogynistic stuff.

And Trump's well-documented spiritual alignment with this community has been ongoing for years, most notably when Esquire asked in 2016 if Trump was ""the World's Greatest Pickup Artist."" But more links between Trump and pickup artists have become apparent in recent years.

Zak Folkman, a business partner in Trump's latest cryptocurrency scheme, is a controversial pickup artist whose courses purportedly teach men how to ""Become the Ultimate Alpha Male."" Wired recently reported on the ways in which Trump's rhetoric mirrors notorious pickup artist Andrew Tate's. Another pickup artist, Tariq Nasheed, is known for peddling pro-Trump propaganda and leads the MAGA-friendly group Foundational Black Americans, which works to pit Black Americans against immigrants. Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, also has plenty of ties to the ""manosphere,"" a group of misogynistic content creators that includes several self-styled pickup artists. And back in 2021, Jezebel noted a pair of pickup artists who appeared at the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection.

Indeed, Trump's portrayal of himself as some kind of superhero who can solve every single American woman's problems is emblematic of a broader movement of misogynistic men who see women as meek targets for their manipulation.

It's a topic the ReidOut Blog will explore in more depth over the next few weeks. Stay tuned."
GOP senators eye comprehensive China strategy to curb CCP influence,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-senators-eye-comprehensive-china-strategy-curb-ccp-influence,2024-09-25T18:53:24Z,"FIRST ON FOX: Republican senators introduced a series of measures on Wednesday aimed at taking a comprehensive approach to curbing the Chinese Communist Party's influence in the west.

Sens. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., and Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., led the introduction of several pieces of legislation in the Senate, all focused on targeting different aspects of China's involvement in America, including at universities and in the U.S. agricultural sector.

""The CCP is the single greatest threat to America's national security and financial independence,"" Ricketts told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""A CCP-led world would mean coercion instead of choice, tyranny instead of liberty, and dictatorship instead of democracy. The only way to combat this threat is with a strong, strategic, all-of-government approach. These bills move us closer to that.""

JOE MANCHIN SAYS HE WON'T ENDORSE HARRIS OVER SUPPORT FOR ELIMINATING FILIBUSTER

The Nebraska Republican introduced five bills: to protect domestic food supply chains; to disincentivize university endowments from investing in ""adversarial entities""; to prevent tax breaks for investing in Chinese, Russian, Iranian, North Korean, or Belarussian companies; to stop U.S. market participation and ownership in businesses that are sanctioned for human rights violations; and to prohibit index funds from purchasing Chinese stocks.

Schmitt also introduced a measure that would bar members of the CCP and their relatives from obtaining student visas to attend American universities.

""The Chinese Communist Party remains our most significant adversary, both militarily and economically. It makes no sense for American universities to continue educating the children and other family members of CCP officials. These more than 100,000 admission slots should go to American students,"" Schmitt told Fox News Digital in a statement.

The senators' legislation comes as Republicans continue to sound the alarm over CCP influence and current U.S. vulnerabilities.

Thurman died in Georgia after taking abortion pills and suffering complications. According to ProPublica reporting, doctors at Piedmont Henry Hospital waited a prolonged period of time before performing the necessary dilation and curettage (D&C) procedure to remove the dead fetus, which is not an abortion, out of reportedly being in fear of facing legal backlash due to the state's abortion law.

HARRIS CALLS FOR ELIMINATING FILIBUSTER TO PASS 'ROE' ABORTION BILL INTO FEDERAL LAW

But Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., and state Rep. Mark Newton don't believe the law had anything to do with Thurman's death, but rather the complications allegedly caused by the abortion pills, as doctors may have waited too long to intercede.

""We never deny a woman an abortion because it's going to harm her in some way. She will always be protected,"" McCormick, who previously served as emergency department head in a Navy deployment in Afghanistan, said in an interview with Fox News Digital.

""You have every right to an abortion, even with that heartbeat law,"" he continued. ""So, let's make that very clear right now. When they say there's no exceptions, there's never any law in any state where there's no exceptions. That doesn't exist. That's simply not the way it works. The mother's life is always protected. With that said, it doesn't mean it's easy to get an abortion just because you have a complication or because something goes wrong.""

Once a baby's heart has stopped, McCormick said, there are no restrictions on performing a D&C to ensure the safety of the mother.

NEW POLL INDICATES WHETHER HARRIS OR TRUMP HAS THE EDGE IN THIS KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE

""In my understanding, is, this baby was already in demise. There was no reason that it had anything to do with whether she could have a D&C or not. That's actually irrelevant to the baby's life because the baby's already gone,"" McCormick said. ""If the heartbeat stopped it's not about this law. Remember, it has nothing to do with this law at that point. It has everything to do with doing the best care for the woman.""

Newton, a board-certified emergency physician, added that there are complex decisions doctors face regarding the risks of surgery versus the risks of not performing it, especially in life-threatening emergencies.

""I do not think there's anything in Georgia's law, unless someone had a complete misunderstanding or just failed to be aware of what Georgia's law was, has nothing to do with the timing of the decision-making,"" Newton said. ""This situation in which the woman presented was clearly a medical or a life-threatening emergency""

Georgia's law should not affect the timing of medical decisions, he said, adding that cases involving septic shock due to complications from a miscarriage or abortion present high mortality risks, and physicians often have to make quick decisions to stabilize patients for surgery, which typically happens immediately in emergency situations.

DEMS LOOK TO FORCE VOTES ON EMERGENCY ABORTION AS ABORTION PILL DEATHS MAKE HEADLINES

Democrats and pro-choice advocates have since blamed so-called ""abortion bans"" for the cause of the two deaths and are seeking to force votes on abortion-related bills on Capitol Hill.

The advocacy group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America released a six-figure ad on Tuesday ""calling out Vice President Kamala Harris and pro-abortion Democrats for spreading misinformation"" relating to the fatalities.

""Amber Thurman and Candi Miller died after they suffered complications from dangerous abortion drugs and did not receive appropriate, completely legal emergency care,"" president Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement. ""The laws do not penalize women who have abortions and they use plain, commonly accepted legal language.""

Opinion | Joe Manchin has refused to endorse Kamala Harris for the most preposterous reason,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/joe-manchin-endorse-kamala-harris-filibuster-rcna172529,2024-09-25T14:38:57Z,"Joe Manchin said he can't endorse Kamala Harris. The reason is terrible.

Sen. Joe Manchin, I-W.V., has announced he won't be endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris for president. Unfortunately, he's refraining from backing her for one of the most empty-headed reasons imaginable.

While earlier this month Manchin seemed to hint that he'd considering endorsing Harris, he said on Tuesday that he had decided against it because of her call for ending the filibuster to pass federal legislation protecting abortion rights.

""Shame on her,"" he told CNN. ""She knows the filibuster is the Holy Grail of democracy. It's the only thing that keeps us talking and working together. If she gets rid of that, then this would be the House on steroids.""

He continued: ""I think that basically can destroy our country, and my country is more important to me than any one person or any one person's ideology. ... I think it's the most horrible thing.""

Manchin's announcement was peculiar in that Harris has called for modifying the filibuster in order to pass abortion rights (and voting rights legislation) for years. Why is he focusing on this now? Manchin told CNN that he had hoped that as a Democratic presidential candidate she might reverse course on that position, but when she called for eliminating ""the filibuster for Roe"" during a recent interview with Wisconsin Public Radio he decided that he could no longer consider endorsing her.

But on a more substantive level, Manchin's conception of the filibuster as ""the Holy Grail"" of democracy is, well, perplexing.

The bedrock principles of democracy are popular representation and majority rule. The filibuster, however, has effectively become a way for the minority party in the Senate to thwart simple majority rule. It is an idiosyncratic procedural tool designed to delay or block a vote on a bill. While, theoretically, the filibuster could be used to encourage broader consensus on particularly big and thorny issues, in modern times it has effectively become a burdensome 60-vote supermajority threshold for passing all legislation, and a bottleneck that kills most significant bills and makes major reforms virtually impossible.

What makes the filibuster even worse is that it is used in a legislative body that already shuns the principle of popular representation and disenfranchises millions of Americans because it overrepresents certain communities (people in small states and rural areas), while essentially making the votes of people in more populated states and areas count less. In other words, Manchin's democratic ""Holy Grail"" is in fact a way for minority parties in a minoritarian institution to hold the governing party hostage.

Manchin and many other advocates for the filibuster use language that can imply that the filibuster was part of the foundational vision for American democratic life.

It was not. The filibuster is not in the Constitution, and it was not some key part of the Founding Fathers' vision for America. (Some scholars have even argued that it is unconstitutional.) As the political scientist Sarah Binder has pointed out, the filibuster was an accidental byproduct of an attempt to simplify rules about cutting off debate in the Senate in the early 19th century. One indicator that it wasn't deliberate is that the first live filibusters didn't take place until decades after the rule change that allowed them to even emerge as a legislative strategy; it was discovered as a way to block legislation by creative lawmakers.

Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., piled onto Harris with a post on X saying that eliminating the filibuster to pass abortion rights was a ""an absolutely terrible"" idea because ""eliminating the filibuster to codify Roe v. Wade also enables a future Congress to ban all abortion nationwide.""

Sinema is right that the elimination of the filibuster could cut both ways. But most Republicans -- including former President Donald Trump -- know that seeking a federal elimination of abortion rights could be an extinction-level event for Republicans in federal office. Moreover, if Democrats succeed at enshrining abortion protections in the law, it will become far more politically toxic for Republicans to seek their removal, since it is easier politically to defend widely used rights and services than it is to dismantle them. (Consider, for example, the resilience of Obamacare; as flawed as it is, Democrats have succeeded in mobilizing voters against the GOP based on the argument that Republicans want to eliminate it.)

But Manchin shouldn't have to agree with all my points about the filibuster to see how he's lost sight of the bigger picture about drawing lines in the sand over American democracy.

There are only two candidates with a chance of winning on Election Day. One of them has committed to abiding by the results of the election, the other has not. We can debate the trade-offs of filibuster reform, and filibuster reform can itself be rolled back. But there is no debate to be had about accepting vote counts, and it's a lot harder for America to come back from a potential second coup attempt in two elections. Manchin's rhetoric about Harris undermining American democracy looks mighty short-sighted in light of the clear and present danger that Trump poses to it."
Inside Facebook's Scammy Abortion Access Network,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilybaker-white/2024/09/25/inside-facebooks-scammy-abortion-access-network/,2024-09-25T12:29:34Z,"In hundreds of groups across the social media app, women with unwanted pregnancies turn to one another for pills and herbal remedies. Many say they are getting scammed instead.

a Facebook group of more than 8,000 strangers, Brazilian women plead for help.

""I'm 15 weeks pregnant I don't know what to do anymore. I tried the medicine at 8 weeks and it went wrong,"" says one message.

""I'm 9 weeks and 4 days pregnant. I've tried all the possible teas that I saw on the internet, and some of them really hurt. I already have two small children, and this one came from carelessness .... Time is passing and I am desperate,"" says another.

A third woman says she cannot afford abortion medicine, so she's seeking other remedies. A fourth says she spent the only money she had on a sale she now fears was a scam.

The group hosting these messages is called ""Safe Abortion -- Helping Women."" In Brazil, where abortion is illegal in most cases, nearly two hundred thousand women have joined similar groups devoted to buying and selling mifepristone, misoprostol and a variety of homemade remedies that they hope might terminate their unwanted pregnancies.

The groups are not for the faint of heart. Many feature photos of bloody sanitary pads and fetal solids, and many more feature cries for help from women fleeing abusive partners or fearing for the health of their existing children. Posts warning of scammers and fake pills are common, as are side-conversations about unprotected sex and contraception. Occasionally, a person opposed to abortion chimes in advising the women to consider adoption.

Brazil is one of many countries where women have turned to a muddied Facebook landscape to seek abortion care. A Forbes review of the platform found nearly 800 groups and pages across 76 countries offering to connect women to abortion remedies -- at least 300 of which operate in countries where abortion is at least sometimes illegal, or even a criminal offense. All told, the groups have nearly 1.8 million members.Forbes found that Facebook groups and pages selling abortion drugs were present in nearly every major region around the world, including abortion-restrictive population centers like Brazil (111 groups; >191,000 members), Kenya (50 groups, >111,000 members) and the Philippines (57 groups; >37,000 members). We also found them in Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Japan, Germany and Norway.

Seventeen groups and pages claimed to provide abortion pills to women in the United States, though it is unclear how many of them actually make the pills available. The largest, which has more than 117,000 members, directed users to an abortion-related URL that subsequently redirected to an adult website. The two admins for the group, one of whom sells live fowl in the Philippines from their Facebook profile, did not respond to interview requests. (Disclosure: In a previous life, I held content policy positions at Facebook and Spotify.)

Many of the groups have made use of a new Facebook feature that enables group members to post in groups as an ""anonymous participant,"" rather than under the name they use on Facebook. Of the group members selling, rather than seeking, drugs and remedies, many have taken other steps to disguise their identities -- which, if revealed, could threaten their safety and liberty. One private group in Brazil listed 10 admins, all of whom used apparently AI-generated profile pictures and four who listed their surnames as ""cyto"" or ""cito"" -- short for cytotec, the Pfizer brand for misoprostol. While some of the groups claim they are run by doctors, many are clearly not, and instead provide places for women to buy and sell pills and other products without a prescription.

Abortion bans don't make people less likely to end a pregnancy, but they do make it harder for them to do so safely. Katy Mayall, the director for strategic initiatives at the Center for Reproductive Rights, told Forbes that there are reliable websites where people can learn how to self-manage abortion and order safe, authentic pills. (She recommended Women Help Women, Women on Web, and INeedAnA.com.) But the Facebook groups, she said, are something of a double edged sword: while they may get some women help, they can be a gateway to scams and fraudsters into the picture, and carry health and privacy risks for people in restrictive countries.

One risk for people in these groups is that Facebook could be required to share their personal information with law enforcement. In August 2022, after the United States Supreme Court made abortion illegal in dozens of US states, Facebook was required to turn over messages between a mother and daughter to Nebraska law enforcement officials, who used them as evidence in prosecution of the women for their purchase and use of abortion pills to terminate a pregnancy. The daughter subsequently pleaded guilty to a felony charge of removing, concealing or abandoning a dead human body, and the mother pled to that charge and an additional one: performing an abortion beyond 20 weeks.

After the U.S. Supreme Court decision, Facebook began removing groups, pages, and posts between women trying to buy and sell abortion drugs. But ongoing policing of that activity has been tricky for the platform: many of the groups no longer refer to the drugs by name, instead using euphemisms like ""candy"" and ""caramelos.""

Facebook's parent company, Meta, does allow businesses in some countries to run advertisements for prescription drugs, including mifepristone and misoprostol, as long as the ads are not targeted to people under the age of 18. Advertisers promoting prescription drugs must provide evidence to Meta that they are properly licensed to sell them and must receive pre-approval before running ads.

Meta does not prohibit women from talking about their experiences self-managing abortions on its platforms, and in the groups and pages reviewed by Forbes, it appears the actual sale of drugs rarely happens on Facebook itself. Instead, sellers typically direct potential buyers to contact them on WhatsApp, Meta's encrypted chat service; ""DM me for candies"" is typical of this type of solicitation. When a person reaches out to the Whatsapp numbers posted in some of these groups, they'll sometimes get an automated welcome message asking for details about where they are located and how far along their pregnancy is.

One provider quoted Forbes with a range of prices between $80 and $200 USD, for various purported drugs and remedies. Women on Web, one of the websites that Mayall recommended, offers combinations of mifepristone and misoprostol for between 70 and 90 euros, depending on the patient's location.

When Forbes reached out to dozens of these numbers on WhatsApp, few responded after we identified ourselves as journalists. One provider we messaged said they were ""saddened to see the death toll from abortion in women."" Another person whose number had been posted in the groups said they weren't a provider, but they ""receive messages every day asking for remedies.""

Meta spokesperson Ryan Daniels said in a statement, ""We want our platforms to be a place where people can safely discuss the issues that matter to them, including topics around health. At the same time, we have specific rules and policies on buying, selling, or trading prescription drugs and protections to keep people safe from scammers, whether in health or other matters. We will take action against any pages and groups we find to violate our policies.""

In some groups, women ask and advise one another about how to end pregnancies with home remedies. While most of these remedies are harmless (though ineffective), some can lead to health problems. Several of the groups reviewed by Forbes contained advice recommending that women use a combination of over-the-counter medication and Coca Cola to end their pregnancies. The remedy does not cause abortion, but can cause vaginal infections and other health problems.

The groups are also filled with warnings about various Facebook profiles that either take money for pills they never deliver, or deliver medicine that is fake. One account -- an admin of several groups in Brazil -- made a series of formulaic posts that appeared to recycle the same desperate story of an eighteen year old woman seeking help as part of a scaled effort to reach other women in need.

In addition to claims of one-off scammers, Forbes also found evidence of larger, more coordinated efforts to reach -- and potentially deceive -- women seeking care. In Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, and other locations, a network of several hundred pages offers ""abortion kits"" using the same set of profile pictures, descriptions and phone numbers.

Some of the groups and pages specifically sought out women with difficult abortion needs -- like those who are 6, 7, or even 8 months pregnant. In a group for South Africa, where abortion is legal, one participant wrote: ""I was 6 months! Now I'm free after being scammed 3 times don't give up ladies."" Several other members of the group also mentioned having been repeatedly scammed, and ultimately terminating later-term pregnancies as a result.

Other groups speak specifically to teen girls who are not ready to become parents -- dozens of posts made by a group admin identifying as a doctor promoted a Zimbabwean service to its more than 800 members: ""Teens welcome & no parental consent."" The message was also included on the group's ""about"" page. Abortion is only legal in the country in cases of rape, incest, when the pregnancy threatens the life or health of the pregnant person, or if the fetus is at risk of serious physical or mental defects.

Groups for buying and selling abortion remedies have also flourished in South Africa, which -- unlike most other countries on the African continent -- has broadly legalized abortion. Of the groups analyzed by Forbes, 142 offered services in the country, with many promising hand delivery of pills or herbal remedies.

A recent post in a 39,000-person South African group read: ""Thank God I'm free but it's painful guys."" A thread of comments followed beneath the post, where others asked what method the original poster used, how to get care for themselves, and how much it would cost. More than 30 comments down, one user questioned the premise of the group at all.

""Just so you know guys the pills are free in hospital and it's safe."""
Jen Psaki: Donald Trump wants to control the narrative. We shouldn't let him.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/harris-trump-distraction-haitian-immigrants-lies-abortion-rcna172285,2024-09-25T10:45:41Z,"I think it's safe to say that right now Donald Trump would desperately like us -- and all of you -- to be talking about certain things, like the crazy conspiracies about the Haitian community in Springfield, Ohio, or his blatantly antisemitic remarks about Jewish voters.

Trump wants all of us to focus on the circus, and on Saturday, both the ringmaster and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, brought that circus to their rallies.

At an event in North Carolina, Trump accused migrants of ""attacking villages"" throughout the Midwest. In Pennsylvania, Vance doubled down on those conspiracy theories. ""I challenge you to go to Springfield, Ohio, which has been overwhelmed by 20,000 Haitians. Go to any community that has been overwhelmed by Kamala Harris' illegal alien policies and tell me that these are stories made up by politicians,"" Vance told supporters.

To set the record straight, no, ""villages"" aren't being attacked by migrants and yes, politicians, like them, are making things up about Springfield, but that's because Trump wants that to be the focus right now. It's what he wants everyone talking about.

I know that may bend the mind; I mean, why on earth would a presidential candidate want to draw attention to his xenophobia, racism, antisemitism and misogyny? Well, of course, Trump is not a normal candidate. To him, all press is good press. All attention is good attention. To Trump, the only way to win is to own the spotlight no matter how harsh it is.

His theory goes a little like this: If we are all talking about his crazy and offensive comments, if we are talking about the circus, then we're not talking about everything else.

Because there is a whole lot that he doesn't want us to be talking about right now. He doesn't want us to talk about Harris inching ahead in the polls after beating him like a drum on the debate stage. Like the new national poll from NBC News that shows Harris leading Trump 49% to 44% -- while that result is within the margin of error, it shows a clear shift in Harris' favor. Or the number in that same poll that shows her favorability rising more quickly than any politician since George W. Bush after 9/11. Or the one that shows voters increasingly see her as the candidate of change.

And he doesn't want us to talk about how he's too chicken to debate Harris again after she accepted an invitation for a rematch from CNN on Saturday.

He certainly doesn't want us to talk about his dangerous and unpopular opposition to abortion rights and the preventable deaths we are learning about in Georgia. I mean, he literally posted this weekend, in all caps, telling women that if he wins, ""YOU WILL NO LONGER BE THINKING ABOUT ABORTION."" Trump was apparently so pleased with that ridiculous statement that he repeated it verbatim on Saturday in North Carolina.

Trump also doesn't want us to talk about the overt effort from his supporters to tamper with the election if they don't like the outcome. And that's exactly what the Trump-friendly election board in Georgia did on Friday when they ordered the hand-counting of ballots -- a move that is likely to cause chaos and delay the reporting of results in a critical state.

And Trump definitely doesn't want us to talk about his handpicked guy running for governor in North Carolina, Mark Robinson. You know, the guy who, according to CNN, called himself a ""Black Nazi"" on a porn site and who, according to The Washington Post, praised Mein Kampf on that same site.

So yes, Trump wants attention but he wants it on his rhetoric, not his record. On his words, but not their consequences. Because the consequences are a town like Springfield getting torn apart, a Republican Party represented by guys like Robinson and a country where women die waiting for medical care.

That's what Trump really does not want us talking about. But as voters begin voting and Election Day gets closer and closer, that is where our focus should be."

Sinema lambastes Harris over call to scrap abortion filibuster: 'Absolutely terrible, shortsighted idea'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-sinema-lambastes-harris-over-call-scrap-abortion-filibuster-absolutely-terrible-shortsighted-idea,2024-09-24T21:36:56Z,"Tricia McLaughlin and Roma Daravi join 'Fox News @ Night' to discuss how former President Trump is nationally polling ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris.

Arizona Independent Senator Krysten Sinema criticized Vice President Kamala Harris after the presidential nominee voiced her support for eliminating the Senate filibuster in an effort to pass a law restoring abortio protections nationwide.

""To state the supremely obvious, eliminating the filibuster to codify Roe v Wade also enables a future Congress to ban all abortion nationwide,"" Sinema, who left the Democratic Party in 2022, wrote on X.

""What an absolutely terrible, shortsighted idea,"" she added.

JOE MANCHIN SAYS HE WON'T ENDORSE HARRIS OVER SUPPORT FOR ELIMINATION FILIBUSTER

Sen. Joe Manchin (I-W.V.), a strong supporter of the filibuster, echoed Sinema's comments, saying that the filibuster is the ""Holy Grail of democracy.""

""Shame on her,"" Manchin said at the Capitol, CNN reported. ""She knows the filibuster is the Holy Grail of democracy. It's the only thing that keeps us talking and working together. If she gets rid of that, then this would be the House on steroids.""

Sinema's sharp criticism came after Harris voiced her thoughts about ending the filibuster on Wisconsin Public Radio (WPR).

The filibuster is a Senate rule that allows a minority to block legislation pending a supermajority vote, so ending it would make it easier to pass laws related to abortion rights.

""I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe,"" Harris said during a WPR interview Tuesday. ""And get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do.""

In the interview Harris also said it was ""it is well within our reach"" to keep a Democratic Senate majority and ""take back the House.""

""I would also emphasize that while the presidential election is extremely important and dispositive of where we go moving forward, it also is about what we need to do to hold onto the Senate and win seats in the House,"" Harris said.

Harris, who has made abortion access a central issue in her campaign, said in 2022 that Congress needed to codify Roe v Wade into law and, ""if the filibuster gets in the way, the Senate needs to make an exception to get it done.""

""With just two more seats in the Senate, we can codify Roe v. Wade, we can put the protection of Roe into law,"" Harris said in September 2022. ""With two more seats in the United States Senate, we can pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Two more seats.""

""You know, our President, Joe Biden, he's been clear. He's kinda done with those archaic Senate rules that are standing in the way of those two issues,"" Harris said of the Senate filibuster in 2022. ""He's made that clear and has said that he will not allow that to obstruct those two issues. And, you know, for me, as vice president, I'm also president of the Senate.... I cannot wait to cast the deciding vote to break the filibuster on voting rights and reproductive rights. I cannot wait! Fifty-nine days.""

Democrats would need to maintain control of the Senate to change rules affecting the filibuster.

A new poll of young voters shows Harris with a commanding 31 point lead over Trump,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/24/nx-s1-5124957/kamala-harris-donald-trump-young-voters-harvard-youth-poll,2024-09-24T21:28:44Z,"Vice President Harris speaks to student volunteers during a stop at the Community College of Philadelphia during a voter registration training session, in Philadelphia.

President Biden had a young people problem. Vice President Harris may not.

In a new poll from the Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics, Harris holds a 31-point lead over former President Donald Trump among likely voters ages 18 to 29.

The poll, released Tuesday, shows Harris ahead of Trump, 61% to 30%, in a match-up that includes third-party candidates. Among only registered voters, Harris' lead drops slightly, but Trump still trails her by 23 points.

The findings represent a marked improvement for Democrats since Harvard's spring youth poll, which found Biden ahead of Trump by 13 percentage points among likely voters and just seven percentage points among registered voters under 30. At the time, young, left-leaning Americans around the country told NPR they were unhappy with their presidential options.

""This poll reveals a significant shift in the overall vibe and preferences of young Americans as the campaign heads into the final stretch,"" John Della Volpe, the polling director of the Institute of Politics, said in a statement. ""Gen Z and young millennials' heightened enthusiasm signals a potentially decisive role for the youth vote in 2024.""

It's a promising sign for Harris, who is banking on high levels of youth support. Voters under 30 played a decisive role in several key battleground states with tight margins in 2020 and overall voted for Biden by a 24-point margin nationwide.

The latest poll, which surveyed more than 2,000 individuals under 30 from Sept. 4 through Sept. 16, underscores a noticeable shift in engagement after Harris took over the ticket. Political strategists point to spikes in voter registrations in the week Biden dropped out of the race, with the highest numbers coming from young Americans, especially women and women of color.

While it's unclear who those individuals may ultimately vote for, these are groups that tend to vote for Democrats. And that interest, particularly among young women, is reflected in the latest Harvard youth poll.

In the spring poll, young female likely voters sided with Biden over Trump by 22 points, but in this latest survey, their support for Harris is even more pronounced, with a margin of 47 points. Harris also increased support among young men, but at comparatively lower rates. Biden held just a five-point lead in the spring. Under Harris, it's risen to 17 points.

What's more, an increasing amount of young Democrats also say they will definitely vote this fall, moving from 66% in the spring to 74% in this latest survey. Republicans have less interest -- in the spring poll, 64% committed to voting, versus 60% now.

Roughly a third of independents said they would definitely vote, which is a drop from four years ago at this time.

Linked with Harris's rise in enthusiasm following the launch of her presidential campaign was a series of viral internet memes remixing her past comments and speeches. It's a style the campaign went on to embrace in its digital organizing and social media.

Despite the likes and shares, the poll found that half of young Americans feel that memes about Harris had no effect on their opinion of her, and six in 10 also said memes about Trump had no effect on their views of him.

On the issues, the poll found that young Americans continue to trust Trump at higher rates on topics relating to the economy, national security, immigration and the Israel-Hamas war -- but his edge is razor thin at just a few percentage points.

Harris holds wide leads on issues relating to climate change, abortion and education. And despite trailing Trump on certain issues, Harvard researchers argue that Harris has increased trust among voters overall, compared to Biden.

""It's pretty much across the board on every issue,"" said Harvard student Anil Cacodcar, who chairs the Harvard Public Opinion Project. ""We're seeing a move toward Harris."""

Manchin told Fox News, ""I'm not endorsing her,"" stressing the importance of the legislative threshold.

Manchin has devoted his last several years to protecting the filibuster, which prevents most measures from proceeding to a vote if they cannot clear a procedural hurdle with 60 votes. He has previously described it as crucial to democracy and said if Democrats successfully did away with it, it would be ""the saddest day in the history of the United States of America.""

The West Virginia senator and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., both of whom decided not to seek re-election, were largely credited with preventing Democrats from taking down the filibuster with their slim majority in 2021. Both senators subsequently left the Democrat Party and registered as independents, despite still caucusing with Democrats in the Senate.

In a statement released on Tuesday, Manchin said, ""This threshold stabilizes our democracy, promotes bipartisan cooperation and protects our nation from partisan whiplash and dysfunction. I have always said: 'if you can't change your mind, you can't change anything' and I am hopeful that the Vice President remains open to doing just that.""

Dems look to force votes on emergency abortion as abortion pill deaths make headlines,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-look-force-votes-emergency-abortion-abortion-pill-deaths-make-headlines,2024-09-24T18:55:07Z,"Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich has the latest on the vice president's efforts to highlight the death of a Georgia woman who took an abortion pill on 'Special Report.'

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Senate President Pro tempore Patty Murray, D-Wash., and others revealed on Tuesday their plans to force votes on abortion-related bills in the wake of two pregnant women's deaths after taking abortion pills.

In floor remarks, Schumer said, ""What happened in Georgia is a direct example of how abortion bans continue to exacerbate the racial disparities in maternal death. Amber's doctors didn't perform the medical procedures they knew she needed because of Georgia's law.""

""It was the law overruling their good medical judgment. She went into septic shock and her heart stopped - all while doctors did everything except the medically-sound treatment she needed,"" he said, in reference to ProPublica's reporting on the deaths of Candi Miller and Amber Nicole Thurman.

Both of the women died in Georgia after taking abortion pills and suffering complications. In Thurman's case, according to ProPublica, doctors waited a prolonged period of time before performing the necessary dilation and curettage (D&C) procedure, which is not an abortion. Miller was found unresponsive by her family after suffering from the pill's complication.

""Today, as you heard from the leader, we're going to try and pass this resolution, and we're going to see if the Senate can come together with one voice and tell women, 'women, we want to put your health first,'"" Murray said at a press conference.

The Washington Democrat will attempt on Tuesday afternoon to advance her resolution to affirm ""the basic right to emergency health care, including abortion care"" for a vote by unanimous consent. However, this is expected to be objected to by a Republican.

ACCUSATIONS OF IMPROPER TAX BREAKS FLY IN CRUCIAL SENATE RACE: 'RULES DON'T APPLY'

The Democrats' plan to seek forced votes on abortion items comes in response to the deaths of Miller and Thurman, which have caused a dispute over what is to blame.

""Amber Thurman and Candi Miller are two Black mothers who lost their lives in Georgia due to the state's Draconian abortion ban. Women who could have survived if they had been able to get the health care they needed. These are the consequences of Trump abortion bans,"" Murray claimed earlier this month.

Roe v. Wade was overturned in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision in 2022, which turned the authority to determine limitations on abortion back to the states. Former President Trump's appointment of Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett is largely credited for giving conservative justices the majority and pushing the decision over the edge.

ENIGMATIC VOTER GROUP COULD SPLIT TICKET FOR TRUMP, DEM SENATE CANDIDATE IN ARIZONA

Other Democrats have echoed Murray's sentiment, including Vice President Kamala Harris, blaming the overturn of Roe v. Wade for the women's deaths.

Some conservative leaders and groups have pushed back on Democrats' characterization of the women's deaths, including top pro-life organization Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.

SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement, ""Pro-life laws are clear, yet politicians and the media are sowing confusion at women's expense. Across the nation, pro-life laws allow doctors to provide emergency care, and doctors who fail to provide necessary medical care should be held accountable.""

""Pro-abortion Democrats and the abortion industry fearmonger and exploit tragedies resulting from abortions themselves, like the deaths of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller - leaving women confused about the law and scared to get care in emergency situations. These lies have real consequences, and we urge pro-abortion Democrats to value women's safety over limitless abortion,"" she said.

James Lankford, R-Okla., questioned Dr. Christina Francis, an obstetrician and gynecologist, and CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, on the safety of the abortion pill.

""Obviously, we have recent cases of Candi Miller dying from a chemical abortion. FDA has changed the rules of late, to be able to say, 'don't give us information about consequences. Don't even report that. Don't turn it in.' You don't have to get to a doctor to be able to get access to a chemical abortions. There's been lots of conversations I've heard from my Democratic colleagues saying chemical abortions are as safe as Tylenol. Can you tell me a little bit more about chemical abortions?"" he asked.

""Incomplete abortion, where all of the tissue, from all of the fetal tissue and placental tissue don't pass after taking these drugs, occurs in 5 to 10 percent of women. That may sound like a small number, but when you look at the number of chemical abortions that are done in this country every year, that's a significant number of women that are experiencing this complication,"" Francis responded.

She further warned that abortion pills are not on par with Tylenol, remarking, ""These are not safe drugs, and women deserve to have accurate information about that."""
Harris calls for eliminating filibuster to pass 'Roe' abortion bill into federal law,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-calls-eliminating-filibuster-pass-roe-abortion-bill-federal-law,2024-09-24T17:49:14Z,"Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich has the latest on the vice president's efforts to highlight the death of a Georgia woman who took an abortion pill on 'Special Report.'

Vice President Kamala Harris said she backs eliminating the 60-vote filibuster requirement in order to reinstate Roe v. Wade, which would federalize abortion access nationwide, during a Wisconsin Public Radio (WPR) interview Tuesday.

The filibuster is a Senate rule that allows a minority to block legislation pending a supermajority vote, so ending it would make it easier to pass laws related to abortion rights.

""I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe,"" Harris said on the ""Wisconsin Today"" show. ""And get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do.""

YOUNG SWING STATE VOTERS DELIVER ADVICE FOR KAMALA HARRIS: 'THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE TRANSPARENCY'

The vice president's comments come amid her fourth campaign visit to the battleground state.

Harris also said in the WPR interview that, ""It is well within our reach"" to keep a Democratic Senate majorirty and ""take back the House.""

""I would also emphasize that while the presidential election is extremely important and dispositive of where we go moving forward, it also is about what we need to do to hold onto the Senate and win seats in the House,"" Harris said.

NEW POLL INDICATES WHETHER HARRIS OR TRUMP HAS THE EDGE IN THIS KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE

While Harris first said she would support ending the filibuster to reinstate Roe v. Wade era abortion protection in 2022, she has since made abortion a major issue in her Democratic bid for presidency this election cycle. She also supported ending the filibuster to pass the progressive Green New Deal climate legislation in 2019.

""With just two more seats in the Senate, we can codify Roe v. Wade, we can put the protections of Roe in law,"" Harris said in September 2022. ""With two more seats in the United States Senate, we can pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Two more seats.""

""You know, our President, Joe Biden, he's been clear. He's kinda done with those archaic Senate rules that are standing in the way of those two issues,"" Harris said of the Senate filibuster. ""He's made that clear and has said that he will not allow that to obstruct those two issues. And, you know, for me, as vice president, I'm also president of the Senate....

Josh Shapiro blasted for signing missile alongside Zelenskyy in Biden's hometown: 'Party of war',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/josh-shapiro-blasted-signing-missile-alongside-zelenskyy-bidens-hometown-party-war,2024-09-24T16:38:56Z,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy provides an update on the war in Ukraine to Fox News anchor Bret Baier on 'Special Report.'

Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was lambasted online after he took time to autograph a missile over the weekend that is potentially bound for Russian assets in the Ukraine war.

Shapiro, considered the runner-up to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to be Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, posted a video of him signing the missile at the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant (SCAAP), in President Biden's hometown.

""We must all do our part in the fight for freedom - from the workers in Scranton who make Pennsylvania the arsenal of democracy to the brave Ukrainian soldiers protecting their country,"" Shapiro captioned his video.

""We stand with Ukraine in their just defense of their homeland in the face of Russian aggression.""

However, response from the right was brisk - with conservative commentator David Harris Jr. saying the situation showed ""Democrats are now the party of war, and they're proud of it. Sad.""

""The U.S. should be negotiating peace not fueling war,"" added Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga.

""I am 100% against this and so are most Americans,"" she wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. ""The U.S. is funding the Ukraine Gov at $1 billion/month to keep it running and funding most of the war by providing weapons, ammo, and equipment.""

ECONOMY, BORDER, ABORTION DIVIDE BIDEN'S HOMETOWN AFTER NATIVE SON'S FIRST TERM

Other critics contrasted the autograph with Shapiro's criticisms of former President Trump.

""Zelenskyy just essentially endorsed Kamala in Pennsylvania while with Josh Shapiro autographing ammunition,"" wrote Philadelphia commentator Joey Mannarino on X.

""He called Trump and Vance 'radical'. He also said Trump has no idea how to end the war. How is this not some sort of violation from a man who we are funding?""

Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa. - locked in a tight re-election race with businessman David McCormick - was seen shaking hands with Zelenskyy as Shapiro wrote a message on the missile.

Other critics pointed out that chaos was erupting elsewhere in the commonwealth while Shapiro, Zelenskyy and Casey were touring the ordnance plant.

SCRANTON OPENS UP ABOUT 'BIDENOMICS'

Philadelphia native Jack Posobiec, a right-wing commentator and senior editor at Human Events, shared video of that city enveloped in illegal ""car meets"" and the responding police activity.

At least three people were arrested and a police official told WCAU they have photos of numerous others who took over Center City, set off fireworks, did donuts with their cars, injured police officers and caused mayhem into the wee hours of the morning, disrupting neighbors.

Video posted to X also appeared to show an Apple Store in Center City being looted Monday night.

""This was going on in Philadelphia while Josh Shapiro was taking selfies with artillery shells and Zelensky,"" Posobiec said on X.

In an official statement, Shapiro said Pennsylvania is the ""birthplace of American freedom"" and Pennsylvanians therefore stand with Ukrainians in their fight against ""naked aggression.""

He also noted Pennsylvania will sign an agreement with the Ukrainian state of Zaporizhizhia that will ""foster collaboration for years to come.""

In regard to the agreement, Pennsylvania Secretary of Community & Economic Development Rick Siger told WHTM that the pact will ""help support the future economic revitalization of Ukraine, while boosting our economy and creating jobs for Pennsylvanians.""

Here's What To Know About Next Week's Vance-Walz Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/09/24/heres-what-to-know-about-next-weeks-vance-walz-debate/,2024-09-24T16:12:20Z,"Republican vice presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Democratic vice presidential candidate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are set to debate next week in what could be the final faceoff of the 2024 presidential campaign.

Oct. 1 at 9 p.m. ET on CBS News. The debate will be broadcast by all CBS local affiliates, simulcast by most major networks and available for live-streaming on the websites of most major news networks.

""CBS Evening News"" anchor Norah O'Donnell and ""Face the Nation"" moderator and chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan.

It's unclear, but they could follow the same rules as the first two presidential debates, including muting candidates' microphones when they're not speaking and no live audience.

Neither an agreement nor a proposal for a second debate has been made public.

Harris immediately challenged Trump to a rematch at the conclusion of their first debate earlier this month, but Trump has said he won't debate her again, insisting Harris only wants a rematch because he ""won"" the first faceoff.

More Americans view Walz favorably (39% vs. 34%) than they do Vance, and more say Walz is qualified to serve as president if necessary than Vance (35% versus 30%), according to a September Pew Research survey of U.S. adults.

Vance, a former Marine and Iraq war veteran, seized on criticism of Walz's military record soon after Walz's entrance into the race, accusing him of ""stolen valor."" Walz, for years, has faced allegations from some of his fellow guardsmen of retiring from the National Guard to avoid being deployed to Iraq, though others who served alongside Walz have defended him and said he had discussed retiring to run for Congress months before his unit's deployment was announced. Republicans have labeled both Harris and Vance as far-left, and have coined the nickname ""Tampon Tim"" for Walz, in reference to a law he signed as governor requiring menstrual products be available in restrooms used by students in grades 4-12 in public schools to ensure transgender students have access to them.

Vance has faced a string of controversies since joining Trump's ticket. Resurfaced comments he made in 2021 about ""childless cat ladies"" running the Democratic Party drew widespread scrutiny, and he is widely credited with amplifying the baseless claim that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, were abducting and eating residents' house pets, leading to increased threats of violence in Springfield. Walz has repeatedly referred to Vance and Trump as ""weird"" throughout the summer, popularizing the attack line among Democrats. And Harris' campaign has cited Vance's prior public comments in support of making abortion illegal nationwide, as Trump and Vance seek to distance themselves from the idea.

Trump tapped Vance as his running mate in July at the start of the Republican National Convention. Harris chose Walz about three weeks after launching her own campaign on July 21 when President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. Both hail from the Midwest and are relatively new to the national political scene. Vance was first elected to public office in the 2022 midterm, and Walz was relatively unknown to voters on a national level prior to him joining Harris' ticket.

Harris spoke to a capacity crowd of 10,500 during the event. Scott Olson/Getty Images hide caption

Vice President Harris says she would support eliminating the filibuster in the U.S. Senate in order to bring back federal protections for a woman's right to an abortion as they existed under Roe v. Wade.

Harris outlined her position during an interview Monday with NPR member station Wisconsin Public Radio, saying that when it comes to the issue of abortion, she believes the Senate should do away with the filibuster rule that requires a 60-vote threshold for most legislation to pass.

""I've been very clear, I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe, and get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do,"" Harris told WPR host Kate Archer Kent.

Harris' comments came as she works to sharpen the distinction between herself and former President Trump on one of the most pivotal issues facing voters in this year's presidential election. And while she has voiced support for ending the filibuster before -- including on the issue of reproductive rights -- it's a topic she has rarely addressed since President Biden's decision to abandon his reelection bid and endorse her instead.

Her message could carry particular weight in Wisconsin, a crucial battleground state where virtually no legal abortions were performed for nearly 15 months in the aftermath of the Supreme Court's decision in 2022 to strike down Roe.

Harris has blamed Trump for the fall of Roe, saying as recently as Friday that he is the ""architect"" of a health care crisis caused by the Supreme Court's decision in Roe -- a law that Trump's three Supreme Court nominees voted to overturn. In the same speech, she referenced recent reporting from ProPublica about two Georgia women whose deaths, after implementation of the state's new abortion law, were deemed ""preventable"" by a state committee of maternal health experts.

Trump has sought to push back against Harris, telling an audience in Pennsylvania on Monday that ""women will be happy, healthy confident and free"" if he is elected to a second term in office.

""You will no longer be thinking about abortion, it's all they talk about, abortion, because we've done something that nobody else could have done. It is now where it always had to be, with the states and they [sic] vote of the people,"" Trump said.

During her interview, Harris was also pressed on a number of other issues facing Wisconsin voters. On housing, she reiterated her plans to provide $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers, and said she would work with the private sector and home builders ""to build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term.""

Harris said she would reach that goal through a combination of tax credits for builders and eliminating red tape in the construction process.

The vice president was also asked about toxic chemicals known as PFAs that are contaminating drinking water around Wisconsin, and whether she would press for stricter regulations of these chemicals.

Harris said the Biden administration is funding billions in water infrastructure projects around the country in order to clean up drinking water and replace lead pipes. Nearly $2 billion of that funding is going to Wisconsin, she said."
DAVID MARCUS: It's been 25 years since 'The West Wing' ruined American politics,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/its-been-25-years-since-the-west-wing-ruined-american-politics,2024-09-24T14:59:03Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

On Monday, the cast of the TV show ""The West Wing"" appeared at the White House, with President Joe Biden posting a photo saying ""Always a pleasure welcoming President Bartlet and his staff back to the White House.""

It was like seeing two fake presidents at once, and neither the fast-fading current commander in chief nor the make-believe one have been anything but terrible for American politics.

In life there are many things that are fun, or tasty, or stimulating that really aren't very good for you. It is now clear that ""The West Wing,"" Aaron Sorkin's seminal drama set in the White House was one of them.

ROB LOWE COMPARES FILMING 'THE WEST WING' TO A 'SUPER UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIP'

What Sorkin, and a supremely talented cast, tapped into back in 1999 was a new way of looking at politics in which the two major parties were no longer seeking common goals through different approaches and policies.

Too many of us are still stuck in Aaron Sorkin's black and white world of politics, still enemies of our own fellow citizens.

Instead, each party was first and foremost a team, one of which represented moral goodness and progress, and almost always won, while the other was regressive, and even sometimes tinted with evil.

The pretend Democratic president, Jeb Bartlet and his tireless, plucky staff are unquestionably the heroes of the show, and in a way, were like a shadow presidency during the rocky eight years of George W. Bush, which it more or less coincided with.

This was how it was supposed to be, with the good, decent people in charge, not the Donald Rumsfelds or Dick Cheneys of the world, and miraculously, unlike real life, there was usually a solution to the crisis or problem if only the Bartlett administration did the right thing and stuck to its moral, neoliberal worldview.

Even lying could be justified for these fictional high priests of the Democratic Party.

In an incredibly prescient example of this, Good 'Ol Jeb Bartlet, it turned out, was hiding the fact that he had multiple sclerosis from the American people during his first election. Season two ends with him being asked if he will run again, despite the lie. Sound familiar?

Well, he ran again. And won.

BIDEN ADDRESSES UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY FOR LAST TIME AS DICTATORS, DESPOTS COME TO NEW YORK

Yes, he accepted Congressional censure and there were other mild punishments, but the clear message from Sorkin was that telling the truth is irrelevant, it only matters that the good guys win and the bad guys lose.

The political realignment we have seen this century, with the Democrats lurching to the left, especially on social issues, is in part a product of this quasi-religious view of the parties. New orthodoxies emerged around gay marriage and trans treatment for kids, abortion, became something to be celebrated, not to be kept safe, legal and, rare.

Two years before ""The West Wing"" launched, in 1997, the movie ""Wag the Dog"" came out, written by Hillary Henken as well as David Mamet, in whose shadow Sorkin has long labored. What is telling in this behind the scenes look at covering up an election scandal, starring Robert De Niro, is we are never told which party the president he works for represents. It's irrelevant.

In a way, ""Wag the Dog"" is far more realistic than ""The West Wing"" in this respect. Political operatives are driven by a desire to win. That's also what they are paid for. Their job is to attain power, not ""do what's right,"" even if they believe the two are one and the same.

Today, for many Americans, politics is not about what is effective, but is more like an identity.

Most of the voters I have met across the country couldn't even dream of voting for someone of the opposite party, the mere notion hits them on an emotional level.

One could argue that the West Wing was a 7-year ad for the eventual presidency of Barack Obama, the series even ended with the election of the first non-white president. Since then, especially with the arrival of Donald Trump on the scene, this personal and emotional relationship with politics and politicians has persisted.

But in my conversations with voters this year, unlike the two previous presidential cycles, I see more cracks in the West Wing worldview of the political universe.

In Ohio, recently, I met Nick, a knife maker in his 30s from Maine on his way to a convention in Indiana. He told me ""We agree on 85 percent of things, but instead of doing anything about them, we focus on the other things."" He's far from the only American I've met who just wants nothing to do with party membership being a big, intimate part of his life.

The last actual presidential candidate that Nick voted for was John McCain, in 2008, just two years after the West Wing went off the air, now he always writes in Willie Hugh Nelson.

If either of our parties can move beyond the destructive us vs them politics of the last 25 years, exemplified by the West Wing, there are voters who might be interested again, voters who can win elections.

But for now, too many of us are still stuck in Sorkin's black and white world of politics, still enemies of our own fellow citizens, and still frustrated that everything doesn't simply work out how it should because of our high morals and good intentions."
GOP's Moreno: Women's focus on abortion rights is 'a little crazy',MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/gops-moreno-womens-focus-abortion-rights-little-crazy-rcna172405,2024-09-24T14:08:09Z,"Just when it seemed Republicans' rhetoric on abortion rights couldn't get much worse, Donald Trump and Ohio's Bernie Moreno weighed in with new comments.

By all accounts, Republicans' optimism about taking control of the U.S. Senate is reaching new heights. Axios reported this week, for example, that GOP senators are privately telling major donors that the party will flip a seat in West Virginia; the Montana race is nearly in the bag; and the contest in Ohio against Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is looking increasingly good for the GOP.

The party might want to hesitate, however, before getting too excited about that last one. WCMH, the NBC affiliate in Columbus, Ohio, reported:

""You know, the left has a lot of single-issue voters,"" Moreno said late last week at a town hall-style event. ""Sadly, by the way, there's a lot of suburban women, a lot of suburban women that are like, 'Listen, abortion is it. If I can't have an abortion in this country whenever I want, I will vote for anybody else.' ... OK. It's a little crazy by the way, but -- especially for women that are like past 50 -- I'm thinking to myself, 'I don't think that's an issue for you.'""

The Republican candidate's campaign spokesperson later clarified that Moreno was making ""a tongue-in-cheek joke.""

Yes, how hilarious. A far-right Senate candidate described women's interest in abortion rights as ""a little crazy"" and suggested post-menopausal women should probably be indifferent to the future of reproductive rights in the United States -- because, you know, they can't get pregnant.

What a cut-up.

In case this isn't obvious, it was just last year when voters in the Buckeye State voted on a statewide measure on abortion, and reproductive rights advocates scored a big victory, despite Ohio's shift to ""red state"" status. Those are, of course, many of the same voters Moreno is appealing to now.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump, who spent much of the weekend telling women they'll soon ""no longer be thinking about abortion,"" kept the rhetorical push going at his latest rally in Pennsylvania, assuring women voters, ""You will be protected, and I will be your protector,"" apparently unaware of how creepy that sounded. It was also a curious message, given that a jury last year found the former president liable for sexual abuse.

In the same remarks, the Republican candidate added, in reference to Democrats, ""All they can talk about is abortion. That's all they talk about. And it really no longer pertains.""

Ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, Republicans were heavily invested in the idea that abortion rights simply didn't matter that much to the American public. Ahead of the 2024 elections, prominent GOP voices are pushing a slightly different line, arguing that women shouldn't care that much about abortion rights.

Two years ago, the party's assumptions proved faulty. We'll learn in six weeks whether Republicans have made effectively the same mistake twice."
Opinion | Kamala Harris knows how to talk about guns  --  she should do it more often,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-guns-second-amendment-oprah-interview-rcna172298,2024-09-24T11:19:37Z,"Here's one I didn't have on my bingo card for 2024: Vice President Kamala Harris teaching liberals how to talk about guns. For a politician with a reputation for word salads and evasions, her recent comments on the Second Amendment have been refreshingly clear and straightforward, even if they were also relatively brief.

The first of those came during the debate with former President Donald Trump earlier this month, following his charges that she ""wants to confiscate your guns."" A few minutes later, she answered the hyperbolic accusation, though it was easy to miss in the midst of a chaotic exchange. ""Tim Walz and I are both gun owners,"" Harris said. ""We're not taking anybody's guns away.""

Nobody could be surprised that Walz, a quintessential Minnesota Guy, owns guns. Harris, though, is supposed to be a California communist -- at least in the minds of a lot of her MAGA haters. In fact, Harris has spoken about gun ownership before. She just wasn't the Democratic presidential nominee at the time.

A few days after the debate with Trump, Harris appeared at an event with Oprah Winfrey, where she went into a little more detail about what her gun was for.

""I'm a gun owner, too. If somebody breaks in my house, they're getting shot,"" she said. Laughing along with Winfrey, Harris seemed to recognize how her comment could be construed. ""I probably should not have said that. My staff will deal with that later,"" she went on to say dismissively, convulsing with genuine, unrehearsed laughter.

Actually, Madame Vice President, and with all due respect, you should have said that much earlier. And you should say it again.

Democrats have struggled to talk about the Second Amendment for ages. In one highly controversial moment during the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama mused that people in the Midwest ""cling to guns or religion"" as a salve for the ruined economy of their region. It was an arrogant, dismissive remark that suggested a lack of intellectual curiosity.

I'm not a gun owner, but I've shot for sport in eastern Montana, western Virginia and elsewhere. I've spent enough time in the Mountain West to know that guns are as commonplace there as Ford F-150s. Friends and family in the New York area own guns, too. None of them are simplistic rubes of the kind Obama seemed to imagine. Neither is Harris, for that matter.

It's worth noting that even as she has touted her own gun ownership, Harris has made clear that she supports a ban on assault weapons, a Clinton-era policy that massively reduced mass shootings. Reinstating a ban would do nothing about the thousands of handgun deaths, including suicides, but it would still help. So would background checks, which Harris also supports.

The American people support these measures, too. In fact, we are much closer to a consensus on guns than partisans on either side would have you believe. And that consensus resides where Harris appears to already be: Let's keep guns legal, but let's also do what we can to keep guns out of the hands of people who are demonstrably dangerous, abusive or mentally ill.

After every mass shooting, conservatives say that the last of these is the root cause. It's better than ""thoughts and prayers"" but still insufficient. After all, our incidence of gun deaths are so much higher than that of other developed nations that no disparity in psychiatric diagnoses could account for them. And many experts say that access to guns, not mental health, is the key determinant in gun violence rates.

Yet if conservatives are committed to this approach, Harris should acknowledge as much, making more thorough psychiatric treatment -- and record-keeping -- part of her gun control policy package. That package will go nowhere without Republicans, many of whom know perfectly well that we need stricter gun laws but are afraid to say so because they fear that the National Rifle Association will run a primary challenger against them. The more she can do to soften these reasonable conservatives' fears, the further she will get.

Gun control is one of many issues -- abortion, taxation, etc. -- where Americans are far less divided than you might believe if you spent an evening imbibing politics-related social media, rife with furious takes and outrageous clips, everyone dunking on everyone else with the latest memes. That isn't real life, though. In many ways, we remain a centrist nation, moving cautiously to the left on social and economic issues while retaining a fundamentally conservative temperament that makes us allergic to rapid change.

The carefree way Harris discussed her own relationship to the Second Amendment made clear that she grasps this essential quality of the American mainstream -- certainly more than Trump does. MAGA understudies like Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis are especially out of the norm, representing a creepy authoritarian nationalism that plays a lot better on 4chan than it does in Peoria.

Harris, on the other hand, is the suburban normie, the soccer mom in Philadelphia or Milwaukee -- in other words, an ordinary American."

Vice President Kamala Harris is ""struggling"" with Black and Latino voters in the Sun Belt compared to former President Biden in 2020, CNN data guru Harry Enten said Monday.

On ""The Lead with Jake Tapper,"" CNN's senior political data reporter noted that, according to NYT/Sienna polling, former President Trump has a slight advantage over Harris in the Sun Belt states of Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, the former two of which Biden won.

What's more, Harris is trailing Biden's numbers with Hispanic and Black voters in the region.

""I think this is really interesting,"" Enten said, showing a breakdown of support for Harris today compared to support for Biden in 2020 in the three Sun Belt states.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS CLOSES GAP WITH TRUMP IN SUN BELT STATES

""Hispanic voters, four years ago, Joe Biden won that vote 66% in the Sun Belt,"" he said. ""Look at where we are now, Kamala Harris at just 52%, so Kamala Harris struggling among Hispanic voters. Donald Trump doing considerably better than he did 4 years ago.""

""How about Black voters?"" Enten continued. ""Kamala Harris, again, leading here by a significant margin, right? She's getting 83% of that vote, but that is significantly short of Joe Biden's 92%.""

""So the bottom line is, in the Sun Belt, which is much more diverse than the northern battleground states up in the Great Lakes, Kamala Harris is struggling among voters of color,"" he added.

Enten also highlighted how, among Sun Belt voters, 31% are most concerned about the economy/inflation, 16% about immigration, and another 16% about abortion. He observed that the first two of these issues are ""great for Donald Trump.""

FOX NEWS POLL: 87% CONSIDER SITUATION AT SOUTHERN BORDER A PROBLEM

Tapper asked what would happen if Harris maintained her hold on the less diverse blue wall states up north while Trump maintains his advantage in the Sun Belt.

""Oh my goodness, look how close this race is. 276 electoral votes to Donald Trump's 262 because she carries these Great Lake battleground states, even if she loses in North Carolina, Georgia, and Arizona,"" Enten replied. ""But the bottom line is this, Mr. Tapper, this race is way too close to call based upon the polling that I currently see."""
Piling on: A tsunami of anti-Trump pieces offer a stark contrast with Kamala's upbeat coverage,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/piling-on-tsunami-anti-trump-pieces-offer-stark-contrast-kamalas-upbeat-coverage,2024-09-24T07:11:51Z,"Fox News national correspondent Griff Jenkins discusses the impact of former President Trump and vice presidential candidate JD Vance's efforts to 'create' focus on migrant crisis in Springfield, Ohio.

In just the last few days, there's been a tremendous media pile-on against Donald Trump.

Whether you think that's warranted or not - much of it is based on his own words - we are back to a Trump-centric universe. Kamala Harris is making little or no news, despite such spectacles as the Oprah show, and Trump, as usual, is back to driving each news cycle.

I have been telling people since 2015 that negative stories are good for Trump because the ensuing debate then unfolds on his terms. In fact, he deliberately uses provocative or inflammatory language as catnip for the press, knowing that even if he's denounced that will drive coverage for at least a couple of days.

The vice president generally gets such favorable press that many people assume she's got this race wrapped up. When an NBC poll shows her leading Trump by 5 points, she's said to have the momentum, although national surveys are basically meaningless.

SCANDALS, FAILED ASSASSINATIONS AND POLITICAL RHETORIC: BOTH SIDES GO HIGH AND LOW

And a New York Times poll shows Trump leading in the key Sunbelt states that the Harris camp hoped to pick off. He has a 5-point lead in Arizona, a 4-point lead in Georgia and a 2-point lead in North Carolina.

That's within striking distance and in some cases a statistical tie. But the Times piece says that many voters believe Trump ""improved their lives when he was president - and worry that a Kamala Harris White House would not.""

That's the thing. Trump's already had four years in the Oval Office. And while there was no shortage of chaos - two impeachments, January 6th - plenty of folks remember a strong economy. And they want more details about whether Harris would take the country in a more liberal direction, even as she puts her rhetorical focus on the middle class and small business (as well as abortion rights).

Plus, it's hard to run as a change candidate when you're part of the incumbent administration and large numbers see the country as being on the wrong track.

Virtually everyone in America has a set-in-stone view of the former president. His MAGA loyalists have been with him since he said in his first campaign that ""I could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue"" and not lose support.

That takes on a more ominous tone now that Trump has barely escaped assassinaton twice - and, after the Florida golf course attempt, blamed the attacks on ""danger to democracy"" language by Harris and the Democrats. Many in the media have made Hitler comparisons, and the truth is both sides have used incendiary language.

Sometimes Trump just resorts to trolling - ""I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!"" - to get chattering classes chattering, even though he much wanted her endorsement.

Let's look at the coverage in recent days:

TRUMP INDICATES HE WON'T MAKE ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN 2028 IF UNSUCCESSFUL THIS TIME

The Washington Post describes ""Donald Trump's imaginary world,"" where ""Americans can't venture out to buy a loaf of bread without getting shot, mugged or raped. Immigrants in a small Ohio town eat their neighbors' cats and dogs. World War III and economic collapse are just around the corner. And kids head off to school only to return at day's end having undergone gender reassignment surgery.

""The former president's imaginary world is a dark, dystopian place, described by Trump in his rallies, interviews, social media posts and debate appearances to paint an alarming picture of America under the Biden-Harris administration.

It is a distorted, warped and, at times, absurdist portrait of a nation where the insurrectionists who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to deadly effect were merely peaceful protesters, and where unlucky boaters are faced with the unappealing choice between electrocution or a shark attack. His extreme caricatures also serve as another way for Trump to traffic in lies and misinformation, using an alternate reality of his own making to create an often terrifying -- and, he seems to hope -- politically devastating landscape for his political opponents.""

Trump also accused Tim Walz speaking positively about ""execution"" after a baby is born-though Washington Post's Fact-Checker says the governor never said that, and that fewer than 1 percent of abortions are performed after 21 weeks of pregnancy.

In the New York Times, conservative writer David French uses self-described ""Black Nazi"" and pro-slavery GOP candidate Mark Robinson, who's running for North Carolina governor, to slam Trump.

French says he's endorsed Kamala ""because I believe that a Harris victory gives Republicans 'a chance to build something decent' from the ruins of a Trump defeat.

""After enduring weeks of lies about the Haitian immigrants who live in Springfield, Ohio, and an entire news cycle devoted to covering Trump's connection with Laura Loomer, one of the most overtly racist figures in MAGA America (she once spoke at a conference of white nationalists and declared, 'I consider myself to be a white advocate, and I openly campaigned for the United States Congress as a white advocate') -- I'm hardening my view. Trump loses now or the Republicans are lost for a generation. Maybe more...

""This has changed the composition of the party. While many decent people remain -- and represent the hope for future reform -- Trump's Republican Party has become a magnet for eccentrics and conspiracy theorists of all stripes.""

64 DAYS: KAMALA HARRIS HAS YET TO DO FORMAL PRESS CONFERENCE SINCE EMERGING AS DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE

Back at the Washington Post, the Trump campaign is described as imploding:

""In a single 24-hour span at the end of last month, for example, he amplified a crude joke about Harris performing a sex act; falsely accused her of staging a coup against President Joe Biden; promoted tributes to the QAnon conspiracy theory; hawked digital trading cards; and became embroiled in a public feud with staff and officials at Arlington National Cemetery.

""The Swift attack was especially concerning to Trump's advisers, who are worried about attracting female voters.""

And there are his constant tributes to ""the late, great Hannibal Lecter,"" the movie serial killer.

""Some campaign advisers are eager to move on from Trump's and Vance's unverifiable claims about Haitian immigrants eating cats and dogs -- a potentially detrimental news cycle that has stretched into its second week -- but also acknowledge that Trump rarely retreats, even when it might be politically advantageous to do so.""

The piece describes Corey Lewandowski, Trump's first campaign manager, as playing a divisive role, to which he responded: ""Same old nonsense that has already been written by the Washington Compost. Your obsession with my volunteer efforts just demonstrates your continued hatred of Donald J. Trump and prove you will stop at nothing to try and prevent him from becoming the 47th President of the United States.""

Post op-ed columnist Ruth Marcus says Trump is ""crossing a hazardous new line"" by saying it will be the fault of Jewish people, insufficiently grateful for his pro-Israel policies, if he loses the election:

""They threaten, if he does lose, and especially if he continues this line of argument, to unleash the fury of disappointed Trump supporters on Jews. It does not take much to imagine the backlash, and the violence, that could ensue. We Jews know something about being scapegoated...

Trump has long had an unnerving habit of bringing up the fact of people's Judaism -- sometimes mistakenly -- on occasions when it seems irrelevant at best. 'Who would have thought my top guys are Jews?' Trump observed to aides Jared Kushner, Stephen Miller and Jason Miller aboard Air Force One, according to the New York Times's Maggie Haberman. (In fact, Jason Miller, as he told Trump, is not Jewish.)""

By contrast, a Times piece on Harris' record as a prosecutor soberly finds ""a coherent record that is for the most part consistent. Ms. Harris seemed particularly focused on protecting the most vulnerable victims by cracking down on violent offenders while seeking alternatives to incarceration for less serious criminals.""

It's not that each individual story isn't based on reported facts. But the tsunami of anti-Trump pieces is a reminder of how relentlessly negative his coverage is - his supporters just don't trust the media - when compared to the general praise for the Democratic nominee.

Footnote: As I was typing this column, I got a statement from Trump saying ""the Kamala Harris/Joe Biden Department of Justice and FBI are mishandling the second assassination attempt on my life since July."" He says Gov. Ron DeSantis and the state of Florida should handle the investigations and prosecutions instead."
U.S. officials say Russia is embracing AI for its election influence efforts,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/nx-s1-5123927/russia-artificial-intelligence-election,2024-09-23T23:07:59Z,"Russia is the most prolific foreign influence actor using artificial intelligence to generate content targeting the 2024 presidential election, U.S. intelligence officials said on Monday.

The cutting-edge technology is making it easier for Russia as well as Iran to quickly and more convincingly tailor often-polarizing content aimed at swaying American voters, an official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told reporters at a briefing.

""The [intelligence community] considers AI a malign influence accelerant, not yet a revolutionary influence tool,"" the official said. ""In other words, information operations are the threat, and AI is an enabler.""

Intelligence officials have previously said they saw AI used in elections overseas. ""Our update today makes clear that this is now happening here,"" the ODNI official said.

Russian influence operations have spread synthetic images, video, audio, and text online, officials said. That includes AI-generated content ""of and about prominent U.S. figures"" and material seeking to emphasize divisive issues such as immigration. Officials said that's consistent with the Kremlin's broader goal to boost former President Donald Trump and denigrate Vice President Kamala Harris.

But Russia is also using lower-tech methods. The ODNI official said Russian influence actors staged a video in which a woman claimed to be a victim of a hit-and-run by Harris in 2011. There's no evidence that ever happened. Last week, Microsoft also said Russia was behind the video, which was spread by a website claiming to be a nonexistent local San Francisco TV station.

Russia is also behind manipulated videos of Harris's speeches, the ODNI official said. They may have been altered using editing tools or with AI. They were disseminated on social media and using other methods.

""One of the efforts we see Russian influence actors do is, when they create this media, try to encourage its spread,"" the ODNI official said.

The official said the videos of Harris had been altered in a range of ways, to ""paint her in a bad light both personally but also in comparison to her opponent"" and to focus on issues Russia believes are divisive.

Iran has also tapped AI to generate social media posts and write fake stories for websites posing as legitimate news outlets, officials said. The intelligence community has said Iran is seeking to undercut Trump in the 2024 election.

Iran has used AI to create such content in both English and Spanish, and is targeting Americans ""across the political spectrum on polarizing issues"" including the war in Gaza and the presidential candidates, officials said.

China, the third main foreign threat to U.S. elections, is using AI in its broader influence operations that aim to shape global views of China and amplify divisive topics in the U.S. such as drug use, immigration, and abortion, officials said.

However, officials said they had not identified any AI-powered operations targeting the outcome of voting in the U.S. The intelligence community has said Beijing's influence operations are more focused on down-ballot races in the U.S. than the presidential contest.

U.S. officials, lawmakers, tech companies, and researchers have been concerned about the potential for AI-powered manipulation to upend this year's election campaign, such as deepfake videos or audio depicting candidates doing or saying something they didn't or misleading voters about the voting process.

While those threats may yet still materialize as election day draws closer, so far AI has been used more frequently in different ways: by foreign adversaries to improve productivity and boost volume, and by political partisans to generate memes and jokes.

On Monday, the ODNI official said foreign actors have been slow to overcome three main obstacles to AI-generated content becoming a greater risk to American elections: first, overcome guardrails built into many AI tools without being detected; second, develop their own sophisticated models; and third, strategically target and distribute AI content.

As Election Day nears, the intelligence community will be monitoring for foreign efforts to introduce deceptive or AI-generated content in a variety of ways, including ""laundering material through prominent figures,"" using fake social media accounts or websites posing as news outlets, or ""releasing supposed 'leaks' of AI-generated content that appear sensitive or controversial,"" the ODNI report said.

Earlier this month, the Justice Department accused Russian state broadcaster RT, which the U.S. government says operates as an arm of Russian intelligence services, of funneling nearly $10 million to pro-Trump American influencers who posted videos critical of Harris and Ukraine. The influencers say they didn't know the money came from Russia."

A number of the biggest names in Hollywood came out in support of Biden before he dropped out of the race, before turning their support to Harris. Olivia Rodrigo, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris by sharing a video of a speech the vice president gave promising to ""stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans."" Major Democratic fundraiser George Clooney, who used a New York Times essay to call for Biden to drop out of the race, lent his support to Harris and Barbra Streisand said she would support Harris because of her vow to fight for reproductive rights. Musician John Legend, who performed at the Democratic National Convention in 2024, posted he was ""so ready"" for a Harris presidency. Director Spike Lee, ""West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin and director Ken Burns hrew their support behind Harris, along with actresses Rosie O'Donnell and Jamie Lee Curtis. Robert De Niro, who narrated an advertisement for the Biden campaign, praised the president's ""selfless patriotism"" in a statement that did not mention Harris but said ""there is nothing more important for our country than defeating Donald Trump at the ballot box."" British pop artist Charli XCX brought Harris into the Gen Z fold by tweeting ""kamala IS brat,"" an endorsement that was met by Harris' team changing the background photo on her X account to the ""brat"" green color and using the same font used on Charli XCX's album of the same name. Rapper Cardi B, who in May said she wouldn't be endorsing Biden, tweeted ""AHAHAHAHA LETS GOOOOO I TOLD YALLL KAMALA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 2024 candidate...."" Pop musician Kesha said she plans to support Harris in November and, when asked how she felt about Vance, responded ""f -- - that man."" Beyoncé has not made a public endorsement but did give the Harris campaign permission to use her song ""Freedom"" in a video of her first official visit to her campaign's headquarters, a rare approval from the superstar musician. Beyoncé's mom and businesswoman Tina Knowles endorsed Harris with an Instagram post. Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle and former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have also thrown their support behind Harris. Former President Jimmy Carter, 99, reportedly told his son last week he was trying to make it to his 100th birthday so he could cast his vote for Kamala Harris. ""Sex in the City"" actress and former New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon threw her support behind Harris and her Vice Presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, in a post that read: ""I'm Walzing on air!"" Billionaire Mark Cuban, who previously said he was committed to voting for Biden, has also supported Harris and endorsed Walz as her running mate, calling him someone who ""can sit at the kitchen table and make you feel like you have know him forever."" Actor Tony Goldwyn, Republican political commentator Ana Navarro, comedian Mindy Kaling and actress Kerry Washington each supported the Harris-Walz campaign by hosting one evening of the Democratic National Convention. Nick Offerman, Jane Fonda, Ben Stiller, Kathy Griffin, John Stamos, Ed Helms, Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz were among those who appeared on a ""Comics for Harris"" virtual rally via Zoom, which reportedly raised close to half a million dollars for the Harris campaign. Over Labor Day weekend, a fundraiser for the Democratic ticket in Southampton, New York was hosted by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and fashion designer Tory Burch, among others. Actors Matt Damon and Lin-Manuel Miranda will attend fundraiser in New York City in September -- for which tickets are listed at $25,000 per person -- to support the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket, Bloomberg reported. Actress Aubrey Plaza posted a photo of herself on Instagram holding Grumpy Cat -- the face of a famous meme -- with the caption ""HARRIS 🇺🇸 WALZ. Mel Brooks said he was ""all in"" for the Harris and Walz ticket in a post to social media holding his dog, adding ""I don't have a cat, so a dog will have to do!"" Stevie Nicks did not name a particular candidate when she encouraged her followers to vote in an Instagram post this week, but signed her message ""Childless Dog Lady."" Billionaire pop star Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris in an Instagram post minutes after a debate between Harris and Donald Trump wrapped up, with a photo of her holding her cat that has since been recreated by several other celebrities. After declining to endorse a candidate in 2020, Martha Stewart said at the Retail Influencer CEO Forum she will supporting Kamala Harris in the election because she wants a president ""who doesn't hate New York"" and ""doesn't hate democracy,"" the Daily Beast reported.

Former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan ripped off his shirt while on stage at the Republican National Convention last month to reveal a Trump-Vance campaign shirt underneath, and called Trump his ""hero"" and the ""greatest president of the United States."" Musician Kid Rock has been vocal about his support of Trump in the past and at the RNC revamped his song ""American Bad Ass"" to include references to Trump. UFC President and personality Dana White called Trump the ""toughest, most resilient human being."" Rapper and reality TV star Amber Rose gave a speech at the RNC in support of Trump. Country music stars Chris Janson and Jason Aldean also appeared at the convention. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy in January said voting for Trump over Biden was a ""no-brainer."" Public-facing billionaires like Elon Musk and Steve Wynn have also supported the former president. Actress Rosanne Barr, a longtime conservative supporter of Trump, clapped back at Cuban's endorsement of the Harris-Walz ticket and called the VP pick ""another reason Harris is a disaster."" Rapper Azealia Banks last year said she would vote for Donald Trump in Novemebr and she appeared at a rally in Florida this summer. Actor Jon Voight has defended Trump on multiple occasions. 50 Cent's 2023 song ""Many Men (Wish Death)"" started trending online after the assassination attempt of Trump last month. The rapper responded by putting Trump's face on the cover of his ""Get Rich or Die Tryin.'"" While it's hard to call the response an official endorsement, he did appear to support the president in 2020 before apparently backtracking. Other celebrities who have supported Trump in the past, but not outright endorsed him yet this election season, include Lil Wayne and ""Happy Days"" star Scott Baio. Trump thanked Brittany Mahomes, wife of NFL superstar Patrick Mahomes, for her ""defending him"" after she lashed out at social media users who criticized her for liking several pro-Trump posts last month (Mahomes has not formally endorsed a candidate).

Notable names missing from the list of public supporters include billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who called the decision ""too important to rush."""
Trump to women: You'll soon 'no longer be thinking about abortion',MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-women-ll-soon-no-longer-thinking-abortion-rcna172219,2024-09-23T15:13:26Z,"Exit polls from the 2016 elections suggest Donald Trump lost women voters to Hillary Clinton by roughly 12 points. Four years later, exit polls found the Republican lost women voters to Joe Biden by roughly 15 points. Could the trend become even worse for the former president?

It's a distinct possibility. Election Day is still six weeks away, but the latest national NBC News poll showed Trump trailing Kamala Harris by 21 points among women voters.

The good news for Republicans is that their party's candidate appears to be aware of the problem is taking steps to address the gender gap. The bad news for the GOP is that Trump's solution is a cringeworthy mess. The Wall Street Journal reported:

Former President Donald Trump claimed women won't think about abortion anymore if he wins the election, a day after Vice President Kamala Harris argued he was the ""architect"" of a reproductive healthcare crisis. ... The comments underscored Trump's anxiety over the issue, which has proven to be a powerful motivator for women and could play a major role in the suburban areas that may decide the election.

Shortly before midnight on Friday, Trump published a 183-word screed to his social media platform, published entirely in capital letters, which is worth reading just to fully appreciate his hysterics.

To briefly summarize the Republican's pitch, however, Trump apparently wants women voters to know a few things:

In case that was too subtle, a day later, the GOP nominee held a rally in North Carolina, where he echoed the missive he published online the night before, reading it nearly word for word.

The Wall Street Journal's report noted that the Harris campaign ""quickly circulated his remarks"" -- and when a rival candidate wants everyone to know what you've said, it's probably not because you've said something smart.

To be sure, Trump covered a lot of nonsensical ground with his message. He began by telling women how awful their lives are, prompting a Harris campaign spokeswoman to say, ""After ripping away our reproductive freedom, now he's trying to tell us how to think.""

His brazen lie about Democrats and infanticide was obviously no better.

What's more, the idea that women will simply stop thinking about abortion, because it will be a state-based issue, doesn't make any sense at all, since it's currently a state-based issue, and millions of American women continue to make clear that they're still thinking about reproductive rights.

But one of the most striking parts of the Republican's pitch was his insistence that he'll make their lives ""happy, beautiful, and great.""

In case anyone has forgotten, Trump was actually president in the recent past, and to the extent that he tried to make women's lives happy, beautiful, and great, he failed spectacularly. In fact, polls suggest he remained unpopular with most women throughout his White House tenure, and it was women who helped show him the door in the 2020 elections.

Trump appears to be under the impression that women have forgotten all about this. His 21-point deficit against Harris suggests they have not."
Opinion | JD Vance just gave Kamala Harris another huge opportunity,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-harris-vance-health-care-rcna171735,2024-09-23T12:34:49Z,"Donald Trump's running mate is reviving health care as an issue -- and it's a huge opportunity for Democrats.

When Donald Trump stammered at the recent presidential debate that he had ""concepts of a plan"" for Americans' health care, he came across like a child who had forgotten his homework. But thanks to his campaign and his running mate JD Vance, we know now the Republican ticket really does have some ""concepts."" Those concepts are bringing health care into the election -- and presenting a tremendous opportunity to Vice President Kamala Harris.

Last Sunday, Vance raised the eyebrows of anyone familiar with health care policy when he told NBC's Kristen Welker about Trump's ""deregulatory agenda."" ""A young American doesn't have the same health care needs as a 65-year-old American,"" he told Welker. ""We want to make sure everybody is covered. But the best way to do that is to actually promote some more choice in our health care system and not have a 'one size fits all' approach that puts a lot of people into the same insurance pools, into the same risk pools, that actually makes it harder for people to make the right choices for their families.""

It wasn't clear in the moment whether Vance's views matched Trump's. As is often the case, the former president didn't mention any specifics in his nonanswer at the debate, and Vance has run ahead of Trump before. When asked at the debate about Vance's claim that Trump would veto a national abortion ban, the latter responded, ""Well, I didn't discuss it with JD.""

But it soon became clear that Trump and Vance are singing from the same hymnal. In a story from Semafor published Wednesday, a Trump spokesman refused to provide specific details but ""did tell Semafor that the president and Vance were broadly aligned on health care policy."" That afternoon at a campaign stop in North Carolina, Vance reiterated the proposed overhaul. ""If you only go to the doctor once a year, you're going to need a different health care plan than somebody who goes to the doctor 14 times a year,"" he argued, ""because they've got chronic pain, or they've got some other chronic condition. That's the biggest and most important thing that we have to change.""

In other words, Vance confirmed that Trump wants to revive one of the worst aspects of American health care before the Affordable Care Act.

Unlike the U.S., other developed countries' health care systems run the gamut from government-run single-payer programs to private, heavily regulated insurers. As journalist Jonathan Cohn notes in his book chronicling the ACA's conception and passage, these varied systems share several features: ""Most importantly, everybody pays into these systems, and everybody gets coverage from them, so that money from the young and healthy effectively covers bills for the old and sick.""

The American system developed differently. Beginning in the 1930s, employers offered their workers insurance plans, which allowed some pooling of risk. But for individuals who had to buy coverage directly, insurers could charge them based on so-called pre-existing medical conditions and risk factors like their age, where they worked and their family history. ""By the late 1950s, in large swaths of the country,"" Cohn writes, ""people at high risk of medical expenses had no realistic way to get comprehensive insurance."" When Democrats, notably President Harry Truman, sought to establish a national insurance program, it was blocked by an alliance of Republicans, conservative Southern Democrats and business lobbies.

Lyndon Johnson's presidency chipped away at this state of affairs via the establishment of Medicaid and Medicare. (To oppose the latter program, the American Medical Association enlisted actor Ronald Reagan, who predicted that Medicare's passage would herald the end of an America ""when men were free."") But by the time Barack Obama became president, millions of Americans again could not afford insurance. Millions more were stuck with plans that were either incredibly expensive or provided little actual coverage -- or both.

The ACA addressed these issues by prohibiting discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions. It required all plans to offer certain ""essential benefits"" and limited premium increases based on age.

The Trump-Vance proposal would undo all of this. If you're old or sick, you'd pay more, likely much more. If you're young and healthy, you'd pay less in the short term -- until you inevitably become old and/or sick. The only way to keep the high-risk pools from falling apart would be massive government subsidies, which Republicans oppose.

Few voters want to return to the pre-ACA system. More than 60% of Americans now hold a favorable view of the law. The protections for pre-existing conditions are its most popular aspect, with majority support even among Republicans. No wonder then that for nearly a decade, Trump has promised to replace the Affordable Care Act with ""something terrific"" -- without having articulated a single program in all that time.

""The Harris campaign had already scheduled a week of events focused on Trump's debate comments and past record on health care"" before Vance's comments, reports The Washington Post. So this proposal to go back to the days before the ACA is a gift to the vice president, who has made ""not going back"" a mantra of her campaign. Obamacare is more popular than ever, voters trust Harris more on health care, and most voters still remember the many deficiencies of the pre-ACA system. She can even point out its echoes of a Project 2025 proposal, which would ""separate the subsidized ACA exchange market from the nonsubsidized insurance market.""

And health care's salience as an issue goes beyond the electioneering of the campaign's final six weeks. Health care may not be voters' top concern anymore, but the cost of living is. The ACA, for all its positives, did not change the fact that Americans still pay more than citizens of peer nations for health care, only to have worse outcomes to show for it. Harris herself knows much remains to be done, having proposed a universal coverage plan when she ran for president in 2020.

The groundwork for the next great, overdue reform of American health care starts now."
"In Florida, A School District Puts Books Back On The Shelves",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petergreene/2024/09/23/in-florida-a-school-district-puts-books-back-on-the-shelves/,2024-09-23T10:47:06Z,"Facing a federal lawsuit over their removal of 36 books from schools, the Nassau County School District reached a settlement agreement to return the books to library shelves.

The books on the list included works by Ellen Hopkins and Sarah Maas as well as works by prize-winning author Toni Morrison. Oft-challenged works such as The Kite Runner, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and The Hate You Give were on the list, as well as the children's book And Tango Makes Three, the true story of two male penguins who adopt a penguin nestling.

The board's action was picked up by local news in late January, and that local news story caught the attention of Tango authors Peter Parnell and Justin Richardson, who are no strangers to having their book challenged.

The challenge to the books was brought by the Nassau County Chapter of Citizens Defending Freedom. That chapter's executive director Jack Knocke said in February ""School districts that are breaking the law should be held accountable. In this case, we are very pleased with the cooperation and professionalism of the Nassau County School Board, who respectfully worked with us every step of the way to help protect our county's children.""

Citizens Defending Freedom was founded as County Citizens Defending Freedom in 2021. Jack Jenkins at Religion News Service reported that the inspiration came from hearing Rand Paul speak to a group of faith and business leaders meeting at Mar-a-Lago. The group also has names ties to other conservative groups, particularly the Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian conservative group that has exercised considerable influence in opposing LGTBQ rights and abortion.

CCDF started out in Polk County, where the group challenged 16 books as illegal in 2022. It soon expanded to other counties and states, changing its name to reflect its greater reach. In its IRS filing, CDF lists a threefold mission:

To equip and empower American citizens to stand for and preserve freedom for themselves and future generations. To resolve breaches of liberty through local awareness, local light, and local action. To educate the American citizen on the value of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and its influence on America's founding.

Founder Steve Maxwell is the CEO of a company that makes produce packaging, and most of the visible members of CDF are also Christian businessmen. One critic called them ""Moms for Liberty in suits.""

CDF Nassau has previous experience with the Nassau school board. CDF Nassau board member Rich Lamken was a ""regular speaker"" at board meetings and had pushed for a Citizens Budget Advisory Committee. The board resisted but eventually created the committee, giving it oversight of just 5% of the budget. They did not appoint Lamken to the committee. The headline in the conservative Citizens Journal Florida read ""School Board Selects Leftist Extremist Over a Qualified, Experienced Candidate for Review Board.""

CDF Nassau's request to remove the books could not have come as a surprise to the board. But Lauren Zimmerman, attorney for the Tango authors, says it came as a surprise to those outside the board. ""There was no public hearing. There was no real announcement about what was going on."" But when the news broke, the authors and several parents and students in the district filed suit in federal court.

The district had claimed that Tango was removed due to ""lack of circulation,"" but Zimmerman says that examination of district records showed that the book had been taken out by students, and that other books that showed no circulation were not removed. In a press release protesting the board's decision to pursue settlement, CDF doubled down on its challenge to the book:

Suggesting that children find their values from the abnormal animal kingdom behavior is manipulative and confusing to young minds. Values taught is school should come from the Judeo-Christian values ordained by God on which the United States of America was founded.

In the press release, CDF also objects to Ghost Boys, which promotes ""racial division, hatred, anti-police themes, and directs students to even more radical writings.""

The other books, argued CDF, were in violation of Florida statute 847.012, which broadly forbids exposing minors to any depiction of ""sexual conduct.""

The list appears to have been drawn from the website BookLooks.org, a site that highlights objectionable content in books; the site has been linked to many book challenges in the U.S.

The lawsuit charged that the school board used ""unlawful censorship"" to remove ""the children's book behind closed doors and without community involvement or comment"" in violation of Florida's sunshine laws. Zimmerman says the district has a book challenge procedure in place, but it was not followed in this case.

Shortly after the suit was filed, the school board centered negotiations to settle the suit, and soon after the parties reached a settlement. That settlement requires the board to restore the books, to refrain from making any future removals behind closed doors, and to acknowledge that Tango contains no obscene material.

Zimmerman argues that suit was important because ""it's a playbook that we're seeing"" in which some organization steps in and decides ""its views on what our children should and shouldn't read should rule the say."" Why would successful authors whose work is often challenged but rarely removed bother with this? Zimmerman explains, ""Freedom of information, the importance of education, diversity, and viewpoints that students can be exposed to those. It's just all very important. It's kind of the cornerstone of American education.""

CDF Nassau executive director Jack Knocke called the settlement ""a dark day for Nassau County Schools."" CDF called on Governor Ron DeSantis to remove the Nassau County School Board and Superintendent. They have also notified the Nassau County Sheriff, sharing district findings as evidence ""that they are distributing materials in violation of Florida's child obscenity laws."" Says Sarah Calamunci, CDF Florida State Director, ""We intend to hold them accountable.""

At this time, the school board has not replied to a request for comment."
We're talking to Nevada voters. Here's what role the state could play in the election,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/nx-s1-5114992/nevada-vote-election-voters-swing-state-trump-harris,2024-09-23T09:06:03Z,"The Arts District in Las Vegas, Nevada on Sept.18, 2024. Krystal Ramirez for NPR hide caption

How Nevada swings on Election Day could tip the 2024 presidential election.

The southwest state -- with two Democratic senators, a Republican governor and a quickly growing population that looks to be politically purplish -- has just six Electoral College votes.

But in the race to reach 270 -- and given how close the race is in other battleground states -- Nevada's handful of votes could deliver The White House to either Vice President Harris or former President Donald Trump.

In the last two presidential elections, 15 of Nevada's 17 counties voted Republican. But the two counties that didn't -- Clark and Washoe -- make up almost 90% of Nevada's population, according to Census data.

The state voted Democrat in recent presidential elections, but not by much. Voter registration for the two main parties are pretty equally split and even more are technically registered as ""Non-Partisan.""

NPR's Morning Edition is reporting from Nevada all week telling stories about the state and its voters.

Of the six states that NPR is visiting that could determine who wins the White House in November -- Georgia, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Pennsylvania -- Nevada has the fewest Electoral College votes.

But that doesn't mean it's the least important state to the candidates.

Jon Ralston, founder and editor-in-chief of the nonprofit news site The Nevada Independent, said there's a surrogate from Harris' team in Nevada ""almost every day.""

For Republicans to win the state, they'll need to focus efforts on the two largest counties, as the 15 smaller counties voted overwhelmingly Republican in recent elections and are expected to do so again.

""While we may not be the deciding state, it's also not impossible,"" Ralston said. ""There are plenty of scenarios where Nevada could decide everything.""

Depending on how other key states vote on Election Day, Nevada could put either Harris or Trump over the 270 mark to win the election.

The state has a hefty chunk of people who haven't chosen a side. Around 40% of registered voters don't identify as either Democrat or Republican -- since many were automatically registered as ""Non-partisan"" when going to the DMV for things such as driver's licenses under a state law that took effect in 2020.

Some of these voters may not know -- or care -- that they're registered to vote, Ralston said. Candidates up and down the ticket will have to find out whether these voters lean left or lean right in order to reach them.

Among Republicans, Ralston said immigration is a big concern, though Nevada isn't a border state.

Democrats hope that an amendment protecting abortion rights that will be on the state ballot will drive their voters to the polls.

There's bipartisan support for protecting abortion rights in the state constitution, according to Joe Schoenmann, host of KNPR's State of Nevada in Las Vegas. Polls show that nearly 70% of Republicans and 90% of Democrats in Nevada oppose criminalizing abortion.

Schoenmann said the economy is top of mind. Most here have experienced cost of living increases since the pandemic.

Nevada also has the highest unemployment out of any state in the country at 5.4% with 6.7% in the Las Vegas area, compared to the national average of 4.2%.

With much of Southern Nevada -- which includes Las Vegas -- living on tips, higher prices ""can really hit home,"" Schoenmann said.

In addition, Nevada is growing fast -- with an estimated 30% of new residents moving from California.

""They're selling their homes in California for large sums of money. So they come here, they are buying homes over the asking price. And they're driving up housing costs,"" Schoenmann reported.

While efforts to build affordable housing for seniors are underway, he said virtually no affordable housing for the rest of the population is being built.

Farther north in Reno, KUNR political reporter Lucia Starbuck said voters are also concerned about the cost of living -- everywhere from the gas pump, grocery store and paying utility bills and child care.

Healthcare access is also a big concern for rural voters. In some parts of the state, residents have to drive over an hour to give birth, to get emergency care or get specialty care, Starbuck said.

Starbuck has spoken with Democrats who are ""afraid to be super public"" about their politics.

""People are wanting to have civil conversations with their neighbors about politics, but really feel that they can't,"" she said.

Across the political spectrum, Schoenmann and Starbuck say Nevada voters are concerned about safeguarding democracy. Democrats have said Trump is a threat to democracy -- especially in his rhetoric after the attack on January 6, 2021 -- and Republicans say the same thing about democrats."

Gun rights, medical marijuana use, regulation of e-cigarettes and gender transition medical procedures for minors are just a few of the issues awaiting the Supreme Court when it comes back to work from its summer recess two weeks from today.

Last term, the court decided a series of politically charged cases like former President Trump's presidential immunity case, a challenge to the government's regulation of the abortion pill and free speech in the digital age.

The high court will kick off the 2024 term on Oct. 7 as it also navigates pressure from Democratic lawmakers for Congress to impose a new code of ethics and term limits.

Here are some cases to watch:

LEGAL EXPERTS WARN THAT LATEST SUPREME COURT LEAKS ARE 'ENORMOUSLY DESTRUCTIVE'

In a challenge to the Biden administration's regulation on so-called ""ghost guns,"" the Supreme Court will decide whether the federal rule is constitutional.

The rule in question was issued in 2022 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to regulate ""buy build shoot"" kits that are available online or in stores that allow any individual to assemble a working firearm without a background check or the usual serial numbers required by the federal government.

The Biden administration argued the rule is necessary to respond to rising numbers of untraceable guns. The Justice Department had argued in court that local law enforcement agencies seized more than 19,000 ghost guns at crime scenes in 2021, a more than tenfold increase in just five years.

However, gun rights groups say the rule is ""unconstitutional and abusive.""

In this case, a truck driver, Douglas Horn is suing a medical marijuana company after he took one of its CBD products for chronic pain.

But after he failed a drug test and lost his job, he sued the company using the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) - a federal statute used to fight organized crime. The justices will decide whether Horn can continue his suit.

ALASKA MAN ARRESTED FOR THREATS AGAINST 6 SUPREME COURT JUSTICES

In this case, two veterans sued after they were repeatedly denied medical care for post-traumatic stress disorder after the Department of Veteran's Affairs said they did not qualify for care. The case could expand benefits for thousands of veterans.

This case will decide whether to allow the FDA to deny approval for fruit-flavored e-cigarettes. The FDA asked the high court to overturn a ruling that overruled the agency's denial, warning that the decision has ""far-reaching consequences for public health.""

The agency has authorized the marketing of four e-cigarette products in the U.S., including the first menthol-flavored vaping product. But the FDA has routinely denied applications for fruit-flavored products, claiming the risks of addicting children outweigh any benefits for the rest of the population.

This case will review the Biden administration's ""equal protection"" challenge to Tennessee's ban on puberty blockers and transgender surgeries for minors.

APACHE TRIBE TAKES FIGHT WITH FEDS OVER SACRED LAND TO SUPREME COURT

Judge temporarily halts Tennessee law banning adults from helping minors get abortion without parental consent,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-temporarily-halts-tennessee-law-banning-adults-from-helping-minors-get-abortion-without-parental-consent,2024-09-23T05:45:05Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

A federal judge temporarily blocked Tennessee's law that prohibits adults from aiding minors in obtaining abortions without parental approval.

U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger said in a Friday ruling that the state cannot ""make it a crime to communicate freely"" about legal abortion options even in a state that bans abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions.

The law will now be placed on hold as the case moves through court.

""The Tennessee General Assembly apparently determined that, when the topic at hand is 'abortion trafficking,' the best interests of the pregnant child are not merely a secondary consideration, but unworthy of particularized consideration at all,"" Trauger wrote.

TENNESSEE SUED OVER LAW BANNING ADULTS FROM HELPING MINORS GET ABORTIONS WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Tennessee's Republican-controlled Legislature passed legislation that was then signed by GOP Gov. Bill Lee making it illegal for an adult who ""intentionally recruits, harbors, or transports"" a pregnant minor within the state to obtain an abortion without consent from the child's parents.

Anyone convicted of breaking the law would be charged with a Class A misdemeanor, which requires nearly one year in jail. The law does not include exemptions for minors who may have been raped by their parents, but a biological father who raped his daughter and caused her pregnancy cannot pursue civil action.

The Tennessee law, which took effect July 1, mimicked Idaho's ""abortion trafficking"" law that was enacted last year, the first state to enact such legislation. But a federal judge has since temporarily blocked Idaho's law as the case moves through court.

Shortly before Tennessee's law was set to take effect, Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn and Nashville attorney Rachel Welty filed a lawsuit challenging the statute on the second anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's June 24, 2022, decision overturning Roe v. Wade, returning the power to make laws regarding abortion back to the states.

TRUMP MAKES PLAY FOR WOMEN'S VOTE, VOWS TO ENSURE 'POWERFUL EXCEPTIONS' FOR ABORTION

Trauger's ruling sided with the argument from Welty and Behn that the law was ""unconstitutionally vague,"" particularly pointing out that the word ""recruits"" is undefined in the law.

The judge also raised concerns about the First Amendment restrictions that she argues the law would impose.

""The freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment is not simply a special protection that the Constitution grants to a few, high-profile speakers so that those speakers can hear themselves talk; it is a protection available to everyone, for the interconnected benefit of everyone, because messages do not gain their fullest power by being uttered, but by being spread,"" Trauger wrote.

Behn called Friday's ruling a ""monumental victory"" for free speech and the fight for abortion access.

""This ruling doesn't just protect Tennesseans -- it safeguards the freedom to discuss abortion care across state lines, ensuring that we can continue to offer support, share accurate information, and stand up for the rights of those seeking essential health care everywhere,"" she told The Associated Press.

Abortions are banned in Tennessee at all stages of pregnancy, with exemptions in cases of molar pregnancies, ectopic pregnancies or to save the life of the mother. Doctors must use their ""reasonable medical"" judgment in determining whether performing an abortion can save the life of the mother or prevent major injury.

A group of women is currently suing in a separate case to clarify the state's abortion ban."

Former President Trump indicated during an interview Sunday that he would not make a run for the Oval Office in 2028 if his current bid falls short in November.

Trump was a guest on Sinclair Broadcast Group's ""Full Measure,"" hosted by Sharyl Attkisson, which aired Sunday morning.

At the end of the interview, Attkisson asked Trump if he was not successful in his bid for president in November, could he see himself running again in four years?

""No, I don't. No, I don't. I think that that will be, that will be it. I don't see that at all,"" the former president answered. ""I think that hopefully we're gonna be successful.""

HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN: THE EDGE IS CLEAR ON THIS KEY ISSUE

Trump, 78, is on his third run for president, having beaten Hillary Clinton for the Commander in Chief seat in 2016, and losing to President Biden in 2020. He now faces Vice President Kamala Harris for a second, four-year term in office.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the Trump campaign for clarification on the former president's comments. The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on Trump's statements.

With over six weeks to go until Election Day on Nov. 5, and early voting and absentee balloting underway in a growing number of states, a number of public opinion polls agree that the race in key battleground states that will decide the 2024 Presidential election is within the margin-of-error.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS IN THE HARRIS-TRUMP 2024 SHOWDOWN

The polls also show Harris has a healthy advantage among voters when it comes to the issue of abortion, while Trump has an equally large margin in dealing with the border and immigration.

When it comes to the economy, the polls show the issue remains the top issue on the minds of American voters as they prepare to cast their ballot in November.

A Fox News national poll also in the field entirely post-debate spotlighted that 39% of voters surveyed said the economy was their most pressing issue, far ahead of immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues tested were in single digits.

HEAD HERE FOR ALL THE MOST RECENT FOX NEWS POLLING IN THE 2024 ELECTION

Trump spoke with Attkisson about several issues, including his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which he said he did ""an amazing job"" handling.

""I never got the credit for it. Remember that more people died under Biden-Harris than died under Trump,"" he said. ""And they had a much easier time because when it came in here, nobody knew what it was. It came from the Wuhan labs, which I always said. But nobody really knew what it was, where it came from...nothing. They knew nothing, and we got hit.""

Trump also said he got credit with the military and knocking out ISIS, saying, ""we rebuilt the military.""

TRUMP VOWS TOUGH APPROACH TO SANCTUARY POLICIES

After speaking about his accomplishments, Attkisson asked him what he does to stay healthy.

""I used to play golf a little bit...but it seems to be quite a dangerous sport, in retrospect,"" Trump said, referring to a recent incident in which a man hid in the bushes with a gun before being shot at by Secret Service and fleeing. The man was later arrested, and the matter is being handled as an assassination attempt on Trump.

""I try and eat properly,"" Trump told Attkisson, getting back to her question.

The host told Trump she though he ate hamburgers and drank soda, which the former president acknowledged he did.

""But proper hamburgers,"" he said. ""But I like, perhaps, all the wrong food. But then I say, 'does anybody know what the right food is?""

He continued, saying people lectured him for years on what to eat, and they're gone because they passed away.

""And here I am,"" Trump said. ""So, I'm not sure I wanna make too many changes.""

Third-party voters face a tough choice in a tight election,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/22/nx-s1-5113108/third-party-voters,2024-09-22T17:46:52Z,"Voters considering a third-party candidate face the same dilemma every presidential election cycle: should they vote their values and get behind a candidate who likely won't win, or settle and support a Democrat or Republican nominee they see as flawed.

This year, Pope Francis weighed in.

""One must choose the lesser of two evils,"" he said during a news conference on the papal plane in September. He didn't say who -- between Vice President Kamala Harris or Former President Donald Trump -- was less evil. But he did describe both candidates as anti-life, citing Harris' views on abortion and Trump's on immigration.

Still, many voters can't swallow supporting either candidate. Every four years, millions of American support third-party candidates. While their candidates don't win, these voters can be influential in elections with razor-thin margins.

""It's extremely close and the third party candidates, though very low in percentage numbers, are still factors,"" Tim Malloy, polling analyst for the Quinnipiac University Poll, said. ""When you are looking at a race that could be determined by three or four percentage points, or maybe less, they are still there.""

Most polls, including the latest one from NPR/PBS News/Marist, show Trump and Harris locked in a tight race.

Third-party voters are often dedicated to single issues, Malloy said. Topics like abortion, the environment or the war in Gaza ""can determine where they go,"" he said.

GOP's 'messing around on' abortion

John Quinn of Maryland, is a millennial and self described pro-life voter. This year, he plans to vote for the American Solidarity Party -- a Christian democratic political party that opposes abortion rights.

Quinn said he knows candidates Peter Sonski and Lauren Onak -- the ASP's ticket -- will lose, but he says he believes his vote means something.

""If the American Solidarity Party's few votes for a truly pro-life vision are what costs the Republican ticket the election, hopefully in 2028 they take pro-lifers more seriously and aren't messing around on the issue the way they are this year,"" Quinn said.

Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and handed abortion back to the states, reproductive rights have become a galvanizing political position. During the 2022 midterms, voters supported the abortion-rights option on ballot measures in five states -- including Kentucky and Montana, which typically have more conservative voters

Harris has made reproductive rights a key part of her candidacy. Meanwhile, Trump has flip-flopped on his abortion stance. Just last month, he indicated he would vote in favor of an abortion-access amendment in Florida, before later clarifying he'll vote no.

For Quinn, these two options left him no choice but to vote third party.

""I wouldn't even know how to weigh which is the lesser of two evils,"" Quinn said.

It's unclear how many voters Trump stands to lose over his position on abortions, but Onak -- who is the vice presidential candidate on the ASP ticket -- said her campaign has seen an increase in interest.

""After the GOP changed its platform language on abortion, we saw an increase in people reaching out to us, following us on social media, volunteering for the campaign,"" Onak said. ""We saw an increase in donations.""

In July, the Republican Party, in new platform langue, removed references to supporting a national 20-week ban and a constitutional amendment restricting abortion.

Beyond abortion, voters are also struggling with the Republican party's shifting economic and foreign policy position. Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is a self-described ""Reagan conservative"" who supports Ukraine in its war against Russia and believes in the rule of law. He also unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination this cycle.

""I expect to write in a good Republicans name on the ballot,"" Hutchinson said. ""I'm going to stick with my pledge that I'm not going to support a convicted felon [Trump], and that's the reasons for it.""

Several high-profile Republicans, including Trump-era officials, have said they will back Harris, but Hutchinson said he believes many Republicans are in the same position as him: and will write in the name of another candidate.

Green Party 'earned my vote' over war in Gaza

In white text on a black background, Anton Navaso posted a paragraph on Instagram explaining his support for the Green Party's Jill Stein -- and his rejection of both Harris and Trump.

""First and foremost, I'm opposed to both the Republican and Democratic support for the Israeli government's actions in Palestine, and I like that the Green Party is too,"" Navaso said in a phone call while packing up for a move to Seattle.

Navazo voted for Biden in the last election. He has little hope Stein will win in 2024, but said it could matter for 2028.

""If either the Democrats or the Republicans think that the Green Party or a third-party vote is why they lost the election, then I think that the next election cycle, they need to try harder to earn the votes of those people,"" Navazo said.

Roman Fritz, a 20-year-old college student in Wisconsin, said he largely agreed with Navaso, but is conflicted.

""In November, I think I plan to vote for Harris,"" Fritz said pausing. ""I do plan to vote for Harris. However, I'm not going to campaign for Harris. I'm not going to encourage anybody to vote for Harris.""

Fritz was the only delegate from the badger state to vote ""present"" during the nomination of Harris at the Democratic National Convention. And he supports the Green Party's Stein on the issues, but can't stomach a Trump victory .

""I think that the only candidate that could win are Trump or Kamala Harris,"" Fritz said. ""Kamala Harris is the better of the two. My heart definitely, like, isn't fully there just because of the lack of a coherent cease-fire plan"" in Gaza.

Last Thursday, leaders of the ""uncommitted"" movement, a Democratic group that opposes Biden's policy toward Israel and Gaza, said they won't endorse Harris -- but encouraged Americans to vote against Trump.

Hundreds of thousands of voters cast ""uncommitted"" ballots during the Democratic primary in several states -- including Michigan and Wisconsin. Biden was at the top of the ticket then, and while Harris has garnered support from younger more liberal voters, it remains unclear how many will vote against Harris over her support of Israel.

'Wednesday morning' thought experiment

Single-issue voters feeling left in the lurch by both Harris and Trump face a dilemma in an election with high stakes.

Archon Fung, a Harvard political science professor who teaches a course titled Politics and Ethics in Unstable Times -- offered a solution to voters caught in indecision.

""If you're not in a close state, it's probably OK to really vote your values and vote for a third-party candidate,"" Fung said because that vote won't throw the election either way. ""But if you're in a state that is very close Electoral-College wise, then it's a much, much more difficult decision for you.""

Regardless, he said voters have to ""own that choice"" if they cast a ballot for a third-party candidate -- say Stein -- in a swing state like Wisconsin and their least preferred candidate wins -- Trump, for example.

In this case, Fung suggested the voter close their eyes and imagine it's Nov. 6.

""It's Wednesday morning and it's a Trump win in Wisconsin, and Wisconsin is decisive in the Electoral College,"" Fung said. ""What do you say to yourself when you look yourself in the mirror?""

If the answer is ""I'm OK"" -- then vote third party, Fung said. But if your answer is ""what have I done?"", then vote for the best between the major candidates.

""I would like for everyone to kind of run through that thought experiment,"" the Harvard professor said. ""What do I say to myself on Wednesday morning?"""
DAVID MARCUS: Project 2025 lies make it to Hershey before the truth can get its pants on,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-democrat-media-lies-about-project-2025-inundating-country,2024-09-22T15:42:08Z,"HERSHEY, Pa. - I hear it everywhere I go, in every corner and crevice of the country that I have covered during this election, menacing talk about Project 2025. Never mind that Donald Trump has nothing to do with Project 2025, never mind that the canard that he does is a coordinated lie between Democrats and the media, the fact is, it is working.

In this town of 15,000 known for chocolate, I met Mark and his service dog. He is retired military and told me, ""Nobody does research, people just believe what they are told,"" adding, ""I'm Gen X, we had actual libraries, we had to look things up with the the...""

TRUMP, HARRIS LOCKED IN TIGHT RACE IN CRITICAL BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA, POLLS FIND

""Dewey Decimal System?"" I chimed in.

""Exactly, thanks,"" he replied. ""Now people just accept whatever Google spits out at them.""

Mark might have a point, because typically, in fact almost always, voters who bring up Project 2025 to me have no real understanding of what it is or what's in it.

It may be the case that, aside from a handful of wonks at the Heritage Foundation where this Frankenstein monster of a policy project came to life, nobody on earth knows what's in it.

""I've heard it's like a list of rights that Republicans want to take away, like on abortion,"" a woman in Virginia recently told me. When I pressed for specifics, she admitted she was only relying on generalizations from the Democrats and the media.

But, far more important than what is or isn't in the 900-page policy tome, which is mostly a set of Human Resources guidelines, is that it has absolutely, positively nothing to do with Donald Trump and never has.

At every turn since Project 2025 became a major campaign issue, Trump has disavowed it, said it will have no impact on his presidency, and frankly, that he doesn't even know what is in it.

So on what basis do Democrats and their feckless media allies continue to try to tie this albatross around The Donald's neck? Only through the worst kind of half-truths and prevarications our democratic system has to offer.

JD Vance wrote the forward! Trump's critics insist, and he did, in 2022, not only long before anyone thought he would be Trump's vice presidential nominee, but at a time when many people thought Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, not Trump, would be the presidential nominee.

Then we are told that dozens of former Trump officials are involved with the project, and yes, Heritage is a think tank, it doesn't have a college draft or use Indeed dot com to hire, it is staffed with, gasp, former political policy officials.

You can't shake a stick at liberal think tanks like Center for American Progress without pointing at a former Obama or Biden staffers, but nobody says Kamala Harris is planning to hand over the keys of the federal government to them.

No, Trump's alleged connection and fealty to Project 2025 is simply a flat out lie, and probably the best argument why he should not accept a second debate with Kamala Harris, especially on CNN which pushes this particular prevarication daily.

In the first debate, when Harris brought up the nonsense claims about Trump and the project, neither of the moderators broke in to fact-check it, as they did over and over and over with Trump. It is almost as though the ABC anchors were in on it.

This desperate and constant lying about Project 2025 from the Harris campaign and the other Harris campaign known as the liberal press has come about precisely because Harris is incapable of making a positive argument for her candidacy.

Fighting price gouging fell flat. On a host of issues, she refuses to say where she stands, except that it is closer to the center than where she used to stand, and she refuses to do serious interviews to clarify her positions.

So, what does that leave in the campaign arsenal? Basically, vice presidential nominee Tim Walz fixing old cars while lying about Project 2025.

Sadly, from what I can tell in my travels and conversations it is working, something that rankles Gen X Joe who is voting for Trump. ""It's just like the white supremacists, and everything else,"" he told me, ""Trump denounces it over and over and it's never good enough.""

It was Mark Twain who said that a lie travels the world before the truth can get its pants on. If so, the Project 2025 is the heart print boxers shorts of the 2024 election, and time is running out to clothe the issue in the truth."

Trump, in the lengthy late-night missive to his Truth Social in all capitalized letters, said ""women are poorer than they were four years ago, are less healthy than they were four years ago, are less safe on the streets than they were four years ago, are more depressed and unhappy than they were four years ago, and are less optimistic and confident in the future than they were four years ago.""

TRUMP VOWS HE 'WILL NOT BLOCK' ABORTION PILLS OR MEDICATION IF ELECTED, SAYS HE BELIEVES IN 'EXCEPTIONS'

""I will fix all of that, and fast, and at long last this national nightmare will be over,"" he said. ""Women will be happy, healthy, confident and free!""

Polls have consistently shown Trump running strongly, against Vice President Kamala Harris in most demographic groups, but struggling with women. Much of that has been attributed to the fact that the three justices he picked for the Supreme Court helped overturn Roe v. Wade, which had enshrined abortion protections under federal law.

In his post, Trump wrote that women ""will no longer be thinking about abortion, because it is now where it always had to be, with the states, and a vote of the people -- and with powerful exceptions, like those that Ronald Reagan insisted on for rape, incest, and the life of the mother -- but not allowing for Democrat demanded late term abortion in the 7th, 8th, or 9th month, or even execution of a baby after birth.""

""I will protect women at a level never seen before,"" he said. ""They will finally be healthy, hopeful, safe and secure.""

Trump added: ""Their lives will be happy, beautiful, and great again!""

The former president's play for the female vote comes after Vice President Harris campaigned in Georgia, delivering a speech about the consequences of, what her campaign calls ""extreme Trump Abortion Bans.""

""After Vice President Harris spent the week speaking about the consequences of Trump Abortion Bans and the stakes of this election for women's lives, Donald Trump snapped -- taking to his phone late at night to rant and rave about women,"" Harris-Walz 2024 Spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in response to Trump's Truth Social post. ""After ripping away our reproductive freedom, now he's trying to tell us how to think.""

Chitika said ""Trump thinks he can control women -- he's wrong.""

The Harris campaign said he is ""terrified that women across the country will vote like our lives and freedoms depend on it, because they do.""

""Women aren't stupid. We see Trump's Project 2025 agenda for what it is: an extreme plan to ban abortion nationwide and threaten access to IVF and birth control,"" Chitika said. ""We'll vote like it this November.""

JD VANCE VOWS TRUMP WOULD NOT IMPOSE FEDERAL ABORTION BAN, VETO IT IF COMES ACROSS DESK

But Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital that Harris and President Joe Biden have put women's lives in danger, and noted the names of women who have been killed by illegal immigrants.

""President Trump is right. Kamala may want to be the first woman president, but she's made the lives of women worse -- more dangerous and more unaffordable,"" Leavitt said. ""If Kamala cared about protecting women, she would close the border and stop allowing rapists and murderers to flow into our country to prey on young women and girls. Kamala has never said the names of Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nunguaray, and Rachel Morin. President Trump has honored their lives and consoled their grieving families.""

Leavitt added: ""If women want safety, security and prosperity for our families, there's only one option on the ballot -- President Trump.""

As for Project 2025, a blueprint for a Republican administration crafted by the Heritage Foundation, Leavitt repeated Trump's assertion that he did not commission it and has no plans to implement it if elected.

""President Trump has repeatedly said he has nothing to do with Project 2025,"" Leavitt said, adding that ""Kamala's campaign is lying because they are losing.""

Harris continues to claim that Trump will install a national abortion ban that would allow for no exceptions, despite Trump repeatedly saying that he would never support a national abortion ban, and believes in exceptions for abortion, including rape, incest, and life of the mother.

Harris has refused to say whether she supports any abortion restrictions up to birth.

Trump has vowed that he ""will not block"" abortion pills or abortion medication for women, should he be elected president."
Russia pushes sex-at-work scheme as population crisis escalates,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/russia-pushes-sex-at-work-scheme-population-crisis-escalates,2024-09-21T13:24:10Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The Kremlin's top doctor this week encouraged all Russians to engage in a ""sex-at-work"" scheme in a move to back President Vladimir Putin's attempts to counter a growing population crisis.

Despite cash incentives, tax breaks, a nationwide push to discourage abortions and Putin's years-long attempt to encourage procreation across the country, Russia saw its lowest birth rate in the last quarter-century for the first six months of 2024, reports said following UN findings on worldwide population rates.

Speaking during a Eurasian Women's Forum on Wednesday, Putin encouraged women's role in the workplace, but he also reiterated his push for higher birthrates.

""Proper conditions are being created for women to succeed professionally while remaining guardians of the hearth and lynchpins of large families with many children,"" he said, according to report by Newsweek.

The Kremlin chief reportedly said that women can cope with the load of being both a career-woman and a mother because they ""possess a secret that men are unable to fathom.""

When pressed by a female reporter about when women are supposed to find the time to manage a family, Russia's Health minister Dr. Yevgeny Shestopalov said, ""Being very busy at work is not a valid reason, but a lame excuse.""

RUSSIA PLANS DIGITAL DRAFT AFTER THOUSANDS DODGE MILITARY SERVICE, FLEE COUNTRY

""There are people who work 12 to 14 hours - when do they make babies?"" Shestopalov was asked, according to a report by Metro.

""You can engage in procreation during breaks,"" he replied before adding, ""Life flies by too quickly.""

Female Russian lawmakers, including politicians Anna Kuznetsova and Zhanna Ryabtseva joined in on the push by encouraging women to maximize their childbearing years by starting families once they turn 18.

One Russian Member of Parliament, Tatyana Butskaya, even encouraged employers to monitor the birth rates of their female staff members, reported Sky News Australia.

Women in Moscow between the ages of 18 and 40 are also being encouraged to receive fertility testing.

""This new push for more Russian babies is consistent with the Russian government's previous initiatives to improve demographics and increase the size of the future workforce,"" former DIA intelligence officer and author of ""Putin's Playbook,"" Rebekah Koffler, told Fox News Digital. ""While the Kremlin portrays Russia's declining birth rates in Russia as 'disastrous,' in reality Russia's demographics is not much different from those of most industrial countries.""

The UN estimates that Russia's population, which currently sits around 140.8 million, will fall by 10 million by 2054.

The United States Census Bureau reports that the number of children per woman in Russia is currently 1.5, though a birth rate of 2.1 is needed to sustain its current population rate, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, as reported by Newsweek."
"The contest in one New Mexico swing district mirrors a larger, anxious electorate",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/20/g-s1-23961/new-mexico-gabe-vasquez-yvette-herrell,2024-09-21T10:08:24Z,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- On a warm Albuquerque evening with the majestic Sandia Mountains in the distance, New Mexico Democratic Congressman Gabe Vasquez is rallying supporters with a chant.

They're using a common Spanish refrain this time of year: ""Si, se puede,"" which translates to ""yes we can.""

The supporters were celebrating the launch of Vasquez's new Albuquerque campaign office. Harley motorcycle riders, military veterans, state politicians and retirees all gathered from different corners of this large district in southern New Mexico, where two of the biggest issues in this election -- immigration and abortion rights -- are at the heart of a tightly-contested U.S. House race.

Democrats and Republicans both think they can win the state's Second Congressional District -- one of the swingiest districts in the country. However, the outcome is anyone's guess for this largely rural corner of the state that has flipped red to blue and back again for more than 50 years.

Vasquez's supporters believe the freshman congressman will be re-elected easily, even as he's facing a tough rematch. Vasquez beat former Republican Congresswoman Yvette Herrell by only by 1,350 votes in 2022.

""The momentum is behind him. He's done an incredible job,"" said state Sen. Antonio ""Moe"" Maestas.

""I think he's probably got a better job this time,"" said Karin Kalodimos, a new resident to the district from Nashville.

""As you can tell by the turnout, people are energized,"" said state Rep. Art De la Cruz.

The Second Congressional District stretches from Albuquerque to the state's borders with Mexico and Texas. Vasquez likes to remind supporters the 2nd is larger than the state of Pennsylvania.

In an interview with NPR following a recent tour of Albuquerque's Real Time Crime Center, Vasquez said he is also bullish about his chances.

""We have worked our butts off to make sure that the people of this district are represented,"" he said. ""I know that there's a lot of national turmoil. But in New Mexico, politics truly are local and in the second district I have shown up for people. I think that's going to come out in the election results.""

Three hours south of Albuquerque at a sports bar in Las Cruces, N.M., Herrell is meeting with Republican supporters

She argues she's poised to avenge her loss against Vasquez since the issues are on her side.

""They want a secure border. They want a better economy. You know, they want safe neighborhoods. They want a good education for their children,"" Herrell told NPR about voters in the community. ""It always seems to be coalescing around those issues in the Second Congressional District.""

Herrell is hitting Vasquez on crime and border issues -- after all, Albuquerque and Las Cruces boast some of the highest crime rates in the country.

And supporters like Rebecca Dow, who is running for the New Mexico state House, says border issues hit different here.

""I know people say every community and every city is a border community now, but we've been living this, we've been living it,"" she said.

That's why Republicans angling to keep control of the U.S. House say this seat is among the top dozen races to flip this cycle.

Still, Herrell's supporters concede there's some headwinds, including Democratic redistricting in 2021 that shifted the district more blue.

Republicans are also hitting Vasquez on past controversies -- including an arrest two decades ago for outstanding traffic tickets before his time in public office.

""Yvette Herrell can run on my traffic tickets and I will run on my record,"" he said.

It marks one of many bitter turns in this fight

And while Republicans think they have the upper hand on the issues, Democrats are outraising and outspending Herrell dramatically.

They've also leaned into crime and border issues, while simultaneously blunting Republican attacks with their own on access to abortion.

""When you are very poor state and you've got people living 200-plus miles from a hospital or a health care provider, it's hard,"" Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said following a recent event with Vasquez.

They joined other state and local officials for the groundbreaking of a new reproductive health clinic

Supporters argue the new facility could be a major lifeline for women in this state and beyond.

It's all part of what makes this a critical race in what Lujan Grisham concedes are challenging political times.

""People are anxious and frustrated and angry at elected officials for a number of valid reasons,"" she said. ""You know, it's hard out there."""
Harris-Trump showdown: The edge is clear on this key issue,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-trump-showdown-edge-clear-key-issue,2024-09-21T08:10:08Z,"'Special Report' panelists Juan Williams, Mollie Hemingway and Marc Thiessen discuss the latest Fox News poll numbers and Teamsters not endorsing a 2024 presidential nominee.

With just over six weeks to go until Election Day on Nov. 5 and early voting and absentee balloting underway in a growing number of states, a slew of public opinion polls agree on a couple of key points.

One - the race in the key battlegrounds that will decide the 2024 White House election between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump is within the margin-of-error.

Two - Harris has a healthy advantage among voters when it comes to the issue of abortion, while Trump has an equally large margin in dealing with the border and immigration.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS IN THE HARRIS-TRUMP 2024 SHOWDOWN

Three - the economy remains the top issue on the minds of American voters as they prepare to cast their ballot in the presidential election.

""The economy tops voters' minds,"" reads the headline from a new AP/NORC national poll, which was conducted entirely after last week's first and potentially only debate between the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees.

Nearly eight in ten questioned in the survey said the economy was one of their top issues, far ahead of everything else.

HEAD HERE FOR ALL THE MOST RECENT FOX NEWS POLLING IN THE 2024 ELECTION

A Fox News national poll also in the field entirely post-debate spotlighted that 39% of voters surveyed said the economy was their most pressing issue, far ahead of immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues tested were in single digits.

The economy reigns supreme in pretty much every other survey.

While the nation's economic recovery from the pandemic-inflicted recession continues, inflation remains a leading concern among Americans.

""An increasing number say grocery prices and housing costs are tough for their family,"" the Fox News poll notes.

When it comes to which presidential candidate can better handle the economy, Trump continues to have the edge - but his margins over Harris differ dramatically depending on the poll.

The former president's up 13 points over the vice president in a post-debate survey from the New York Times and Siena College, and favored by 7 points in an ABC News Ipsos survey also conducted after the showdown.

But Trump's advantage over Harris on the economy stands at only 5 points in the Fox News poll, and just 2 points in the AP/NORC survey.

""The issue profile of this election continues to favor Trump,"" said Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Democrat Chris Anderson.

But Shaw added that Trump's ""edge on economic issues has decreased, probably due to Harris' messaging on housing costs and taxes, both of which target the middle class and appear to be paying off.""

Boosting Trump when it comes to the economy are apparent fond memories of his tenure in the White House.

Voters questioned in the Fox News poll by a 17 point margin said Trump's policies on the economy were more helpful than harmful. But by 24 points, they said that President Biden's economic policies have been more hurtful than helpful.

""The perception that Trump's policies helped more than Biden's creates some heavy baggage for Harris in this campaign and shows why 'turning the page' is a central theme she's tried to stress,"" Anderson said.

Social media erupted after First Lady Jill Biden presented at what may be one of President Biden's final Cabinet meetings in the White House.

Biden convened his Cabinet on Friday for the first time since Oct. 2, 2023 - this time with the first lady joining him to speak about the White House Initiative on Women's Health Research.

The president explained Jill Biden's presence there, saying, ""Here and across previous administrations, first ladies have attended these meetings for specific reasons. This is the first time Jill has joined us, and it goes to show how important the issue is, which she is about to speak to.""

He concluded by handing off to his wife, saying, ""It's all yours, kid.""

FLASHBACK: BIDEN'S CABINET DOUBLES DOWN ON SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT FOLLOWING DEBATE

The New York Post reported that Jill Biden, seated at the head of the Cabinet Room's board table, ""read from a binder about maternal health initiatives for four-and-a-half minutes after her husband spoke for just two minutes off the top of the meeting.""

The president traditionally sits at the center of the table with Cabinet members seated in order of the founding of their departments. The last sitting first lady to attend her husband's Cabinet meeting appears to be Hillary Clinton.

The amount of influence the first lady has over Joe Biden, and therefore his administration, has been a frequent source of controversy, and numerous commentators took to social media to criticize her presence at the meeting.

The New York Post said that Jill Biden is ""considered by insiders to be the most influential first lady since Edith Wilson, who tightly controlled access to her husband, President Woodrow Wilson, after he suffered a debilitating stroke in October 1919.""

Digital strategist Greg Price referenced this comparison, saying, ""She's literally Edith Wilson except right out in the open in a 24/7 news cycle and nobody in the media cares.""

""Wow. A visibly exhausted Joe Biden just held a full Cabinet meeting for the first time in 11 months and immediately turned the mic over to his wife, Jill,"" previous adviser to former President Donald Trump Steve Cortes said. He went on to ask, ""Who is running the country?""

Political commentator Kate Hyde observed, ""Jill Biden is kicking off the first cabinet meeting the White House has had in almost a year and we're expected to act like this is normal.""

""Jill Biden is the head of the table at the cabinet meeting. No one voted for her to be there... this must be part of her deal to have Joe drop out of the race,"" podcaster Tim Young speculated. ""She has no reason to be there.""

'ACCESS GRANTED': BIDEN'S FREE VACATION AT FRIEND'S CALIFORNIA MANSION DRAWS IRE OF CRITICS

The co-founder of The Federalist, Sean Davis, sarcastically quipped, ""I wasn't aware that our constitutional system of government bestowed any power whatsoever to the unelected wife of the figurehead president.""

""It's insane that the world's #1 nuclear superpower just sort of stumbled its way into a power vacuum,"" The Hill columnist T. Becket Adams mused. ""It's even more insane that the vacuum has been filled by the former ruler's wife, who holds no legal governing authority.""

""Is this real?"" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., asked. ""Is this who's running the country""?

""Before President Biden updated his cabinet and the country on the continued achievements of the most successful administration in modern history, he asked the First Lady to join for the top of the meeting to showcase groundbreaking work they are leading to fundamentally change how we fund and approach women's health research,"" White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates told Fox News Digital.

""If the only response these critics have are conspiracy theories that devalue historic progress researching women's health - including terrible diseases - then that says a lot about why more and more American women feel that the right couldn't care less about them, including as it pushes radical abortion bans,"" he added, while also making a dig about Hawley running out of the Capitol on Jan. 6."
Harris says strict abortion laws lead to 'predictable' suffering for women,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/20/g-s1-23971/harris-abortion-preventable-deaths-georgia,2024-09-20T22:14:28Z,"Vice President Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, speaks during a campaign event Friday in Atlanta. Brynn Anderson/AP hide caption

ATLANTA -- Vice President Harris called former President Donald Trump the ""architect"" of a health care crisis caused by a rollback of access to abortion in various states following the U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.

Speaking in Atlanta Friday, Harris called tougher abortion laws ""immoral"" and slammed Republicans for what she called ""longstanding neglect"" around maternal mortality.

""These hypocrites want to start talking about, 'This is in the best interest of women and children,'"" she said. ""Well, where've you been? ... How dare they? How dare they? Come on.""

As Harris tries to capitalize on the abortion issue on the campaign trail, on Friday she referenced reporting from ProPublica about two Georgia women whose deaths, after the state's new abortion law, were deemed ""preventable"" by a state committee of maternal health experts.

The investigations published this week tell the stories of two women, Amber Thurman and Candi Miller, who died from complications related to seeking abortions in the aftermath of Georgia's strict law that effectively bans most abortions with exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.

""There is a word -- preventable -- and there is another word: predictable,"" Harris said. ""And the reality is for every story here of the suffering under Trump abortion bans, there are so many of the stories we're not hearing where suffering is happening every day in our country.""

Trump has touted his nomination of Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the constitutional right to abortion.

Thurman and Miller died from complications that arose after their bodies failed to fully expel all of the fetal tissue after medication abortions, according to records reviewed by ProPublica. Thurman died after doctors waited more than 20 hours to treat an infection; Miller died at home without seeking medical treatment ""due to the current legislation on pregnancies and abortions,"" her family told ProPublica. NPR has not independently confirmed the reporting.

Some anti-abortion groups have pushed back on the characterization of those deaths as tied to abortion laws, blaming the Biden administration's looser regulations around medication abortion instead.

""Amber Thurman and Candi Miller did not die because a law denied treatment,"" Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, said in a statement. The group blamed the administration for lifting safety requirements when it eased access to medication abortion for the deaths, as well as a lack of sufficient medical treatment.

Republicans have also pushed back on Harris' narrative around the women's deaths, with a GOP spokesperson claiming the vice president is spreading ""misinformation.""

""Georgia not only established clear exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother, but also included providing necessary care in the event of a medical emergency,"" Republican National Committee spokesperson Morgan Ackley said in a statement. ""There was no reason that doctors cannot act swiftly to protect the lives of mothers.""

Friday's event comes as the presidential campaign enters its final six-week stretch, with Georgia as one of the swing states likely to decide the winner and as abortion rights continues to be a motivating issue for Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters.

Harris was introduced by Dr. Keisha Reddick, a Savannah OB-GYN who said that tighter abortion restrictions in Georgia and other states are ""putting women's health and lives in peril.""

""I see fear in my patients' eyes,"" she said. ""I see women who have left the state to get the care that they need, and those who are unable to do so. I watch medical students and other physicians avoid coming to our state, who are packing up their lives to move across the country ... [where] they won't face jail time for upholding their oath.""

Reddick said that has left Georgia with fewer health care providers in a state that has one of the worst maternal mortality rates in the country.

Harris also discussed abortion during a campaign event Thursday with Oprah Winfrey in Michigan. She will hold a campaign rally in Madison, Wis., later Friday."

Then President Joe Biden dropped out of the election, and Vice President Kamala Harris jumped in, saying in one of her first speeches:

""I am very clear: The path to the White House runs right through this state.You all helped us win in 2020, and we're going to do it again in 2024.""

Now Georgia is once again in play for democrats. But the state has never elected a female Governor or a female U.S. senator. Will that fact determine who might win their 16 electoral votes?

Consider This host Mary Louise Kelly sat down with three longtime Georgia residents to hear their thoughts on where their home state could go in this election.

She sat in a cafe in Atlanta this past week with Latrice Cushenberry, Eustacia McCloud Carter and Donna Smith Aranson.

The three women come from different backgrounds, different religions and different races. They range in age from their 50s to their 70s.

What they have in common is they are all backing Kamala Harris for president.

So why are they all in for Harris? To Cushenberry, it's about values, and seeing herself and her family in the candidate.

""She is someone that I have seen repeatedly throughout my lifetime in my grandmother, my mother, my aunts - [a] capable, competent, African American person that basically can get the job done with empathy and compassion,"" she told NPR.

For Aranson, it was a hope for change, as a native Atlantan who has lived through many political cycles in the city, and a rotation of both Republican and Democratic governors.

""When Kamala stepped up, it was like a lightning bolt,"" she said. ""I listened to President Biden as he stepped back and turned the reins over to Kamala. And I said, 'This is it. This has got to be it.'""

For Carter, the choice wasn't so obvious from the very beginning. She first had to move past the fact that she was ready for another term for Biden.

""I wasn't kumbaya and jumping up and screaming when Joe Biden stepped down because I was all in for Joe Biden. I didn't care if we had to put him in a wheelchair, motorized, five oxygen tanks on his back. I was all in [for] Joe Biden,"" she explained.

""It wasn't that I wasn't going to ever vote for Kamala. I knew I was going to vote for Kamala. I'm a staunch Democrat. I fall in line with the party. So she was going to get my vote. She's qualified and not just because she's a woman. She's a qualified individual. Her resume speaks for itself. And, yes, she can be president.""

Harris' campaign hasn't spent much time or energy focusing on the historic nature of her possible presidency.

Aranson says that she thinks it's the right choice.""When she wins - and it's a when, not an if - she will be the president of all the people. And I think she has to appeal to all people, all genders, all religions,"" she said.

""I think the stance on abortion and all of the things that matter to women specifically are strong issues that she backs. And that's not to say that men don't either, but it's feels more personal when it comes from a woman - and a strong woman.""

As for the question of if Georgia can elect a woman to power? Cushenberry says yes - and looks to the younger generations as to why.

""There's a brand-new demographic in this election: the young people who grew up during the age of school shootings. Those children are exhausted. They went through COVID. When they went back to school, there were so many threats. They're ready for change, and I am ready for the change that they are ushering in,"" she said."
"Opinion | In Mark Robinson's fall, Republicans are getting what they asked for",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/mark-robinson-republicans-north-carolina-porn-forum-rcna171979,2024-09-20T21:09:46Z,"The latest scandal for the fundamentalist Christian running for governor in North Carolina could have a dramatic impact on the GOP's chances in the battleground state.

Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, Republican candidate for governor of North Carolina, can no longer win a political race in the state -- or anywhere in America, for that matter.

Not after CNN uncovered sexually explicit and inflammatory posts he reportedly wrote in the comments of a pornographic website. According to the report, Robinson -- who's campaigned as a fundamentalist, Christian conservative -- commented frequently between 2008 and 2012 on a site called ""Nude Africa.""

Robinson has denied he is the author of the posts, saying ""these are not the words of Mark Robinson"" and dismissing the report as ""salacious tabloid trash."" But CNN's reporters documented several connections between the candidate, the email he used to register with the sites and biographical details posted to the various profiles.

The porn chatroom posts identified as Robinson's are graphic, sexually menacing and demeaning to women. If you track them down, you can't unsee them.

He commented on his love for transgender pornography, called himself a ""Black Nazi,"" made profane comments about a woman's alleged rape, referred to Martin Luther King Jr. by a racial slur (note that this article later quotes some of that language, which readers may find offensive), and even reminisced graphically about a teenage experience peeping on a women's locker room at a local college.

These are just the tip of a nasty iceberg. CNN acknowledged many of the things Robinson is accused of writing were so lurid, they couldn't be published.

If these statements offend you, congratulations: You are a thinking, feeling person. You're holding your elected leaders to a higher standard than the North Carolina Republican Party, which doubled down on its support for Robinson on Thursday night after the report was published. Most folks wouldn't let the guy in this story watch their dog, much less lead their state.

North Carolina Republicans had few realistic options for replacing Robinson, with the state deadline for candidates to withdraw just hours away when the story dropped. But there's no reason to think they would have pushed him out anyway. They've stuck with him through every disturbing scandal so far, and there have been a lot.

His candidacy was damaged and unhinged from the start, fetishizing violence, demonizing gay people and talking about women like they're trash. The party has had literally dozens of opportunities to disavow Robinson: when he said some folks out there ""need killing,"" when he fantasized about murdering people in the government with his AR-15, when he called LGBTQ people ""maggots,"" when he said women getting abortions just need to keep their ""skirt down.""

The party routinely looked past Robinson's breathtaking hypocrisy. A 2022 story revealed that Robinson, who has referred to abortion as ""murder"" and abortion doctors as ""butchers,"" once paid for a girlfriend's abortion. He's implied gender-neutral restrooms are a breeding ground for perverts. He's said women need protection from those perverts, but boasted online about spying on college girls in a locker room, according to CNN. He described LGBTQ+ people as ""maggots"" but according to that same CNN report, he once wrote about his enjoyment of pornography that features trans people, enthusiastically describing himself as a ""perv.""

Many of Robinson's Republican peers have held him up as a champion, though, an example of America at its finest. At one stump speech in North Carolina, Donald Trump said Robinson was ""like a fine wine.""

""You have to cherish him,"" Trump said. ""He's an outstanding person. I've gotten to know him so well.""

Like Trump, Robinson cast himself as an uncensored outsider who traded put-downs for policy; a conservative, chest-thumping warrior who seemed to be the beneficiary of limitless forgiveness for his transgressions.

North Carolina Republicans have shown that the MAGA movement doesn't believe in such limits. But voters will, which is why Republicans and Robinson will stay this way, locked in a doomed embrace, through Election Day. This is what rigor mortis looks like in a campaign.

The only question is whether Republicans up and down the ticket, including Trump, will get dragged down with him. Trump is virtually tied with Kamala Harris in this battleground state and some conservatives are worried Robinson's troubles will keep Trump voters at home. On Thursday night, GOP candidates running for office in North Carolina were trying to scrub their social media profiles of references to Robinson, like rats fleeing a sinking ship.

A candidate who talks about the historic nature of his candidacy -- if he wins, he would be the first Black governor in the state's history -- once allegedly wrote, ""Slavery is not bad. Some people need to be slaves. I wish they would bring it (slavery) back. I would certainly buy a few."" The man whom Trump praised as ""MLK on steroids"" once referred to Martin Luther King Jr. as ""Martin Lucifer Koon.""

Coincidentally, I interviewed Martin Luther King III on Thursday about a trip he's making to North Carolina this weekend to speak to rural communities of color about the election. The CNN story hadn't broken yet but the word was out that it contained hateful descriptions of his late father.

When I asked him about it, he was tactful, which isn't easy when someone says something awful about your dad.

""Clearly, it feels like this rejection is emerging for this candidacy,"" King said. ""And at some point, it will be looked at as a disaster."""
Dems roundly condemn death threats against Supreme Court they've repeatedly disparaged,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-roundly-condemn-death-threats-against-supreme-court-theyve-repeatedly-disparaged,2024-09-20T20:16:50Z,"Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson told late-night host Stephen Colbert on Tuesday that it was ""problematic"" for the Supreme Court to be perceived as political.

Democrats roundly condemned political violence after news that a suspect had been arrested for threatening to hurt and kill six of the Supreme Court's nine Justices and some of their family members.

""Threats and acts of violence are unacceptable. Period,"" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told the Washington Post. ""As President Biden and Vice President Harris have always said, violence has absolutely no place in our country. Violent rhetoric and threats are unacceptable,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates said. ""There's absolutely no place for political violence in this country - full stop,"" said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.

It remains unknown exactly which justices 76-year-old Alaska resident Panos Anastasiou intended to attack.

However, a complaint filed against him Wednesday indicated that his threats included anti-Black slurs, and there is only one Black Supreme Court Justice - Clarence Thomas, who typically votes with the Court's conservative majority. Additionally, the complaint laid out that Anastasiou's threats included extreme remarks about a former president described by Anastasiou as a ""convicted criminal."" Former President Donald Trump became the first former president to be convicted of a felony, earlier this year.

ALASKA MAN ARRESTED FOR THREATS AGAINST SIX SUPREME COURT JUSTICES

Democrats have repeatedly slammed the Supreme Court as illegitimate. In a foretelling speech from Duke Law School on Monday, Kannon Shanmugam, who is widely considered one of the nation's top appellate litigators and has argued 35 cases in front of the Supreme Court, said that ""attacks on the legitimacy of the courts are contributing to the threat of violence against judges in general.""

""Enough is enough. When will the media press Democrats like Sen. Schumer, Sen. Durbin, Sen. Whitehouse, VP Harris and others to stop their baseless attacks on the Supreme Court that have created actual threats to the safety of our Justices?"" questioned GOP Florida Sen. Rick Scott following news of Anastasiou's arrest. ""Hey, look, someone who took Chuck Schumer seriously,"" said Trent England, the founder and executive director of conservative nonprofit Save Our States. Other critics pointed to how Anastasiou was a frequent donor to Democrats.

ROE V. WADE ABORTION DECISION: DEMOCRATS CALL SUPREME COURT 'ILLEGITIMATE'

Trump's ability to shakeup the Supreme Court with new Justices has not sat well with Democrats.

In a fiery speech in front of the Supreme Court after a preliminary draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade was leaked in spring 2020, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., put conservative Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, both nominated by Trump, in his crosshairs: ""I want to tell you, Gorsuch. I want to tell you, Kavanaugh. You have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price,"" Schumer exclaimed outside the steps of the Supreme Court in 2020. ""You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.""

""The Supreme Court is not well. And the people know it,"" a cohort of Democratic senators said in an August 2019 brief after the High Court took up a case about the constitutionality of a New York City law restricting legal gun owners from transporting their firearms.

In 2020, during the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett, Trump's final Supreme Court nomination that would eventually make it to the bench, then-Sen. Kamala Harris called the confirmation ""illegitimate"" and ""reckless."" Following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, Harris warned that there is ""a national movement afoot to attack hard-won and hard-fought freedoms.""

""I don't want to, at this point, use my voice in a way that is alarmist,"" she added earlier this year in an interview with the New York Times. ""But this court has made it very clear that they are willing to undo recognized rights.""

HARRIS WAS 'OPEN' TO PACKING SUPREME COURT DURING 2019 PRESIDENTIAL BID

Meanwhile, in July, Sen. Ed Markey said: ""Donald Trump and his MAGA partners"" were to blame for the fact that ""Our most fundamental freedoms are under attack from an illegitimate, extremist U.S. Supreme Court majority.""

""They started by breaking the rules for confirming justices and ended up breaking the Supreme Court itself,"" Markey said.

The DOJ indicated Wednesday that Anastasiou was charged with nine counts of making threats against a federal judge and 13 counts of making threats in interstate commerce. He faces up to 10 years in jail.

""Our justice system depends on the ability of judges to make their decisions based on the law, and not on fear,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said Thursday. ""Our democracy depends on the ability of public officials to do their jobs without fearing for their lives or the safety of their families."""
ABC's shameless debate didn't even survive its own fact-check,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/abcs-shameless-debate-didnt-even-survive-its-own-fact-check,2024-09-20T17:53:55Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

As CBS anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan prepare for the vice-presidential debate on October 1, they have two models to choose from: CNN's attempt to avoid ""fact-checking"" the candidates or ABC's aggressively one-sided ""fact-based"" assault on the Republicans.

ABC's immoderate moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis uncorked the most flagrantly unfair and unbalanced debate in the history of modern presidential debates, going back to the Nixon-Kennedy debates of 1960. They don't care that anyone objects to their strategic decision to join in debating former President Donald Trump, giving everyone the distinct impression that this was a three-on-one conversation.

Muir appeared on the Disney-syndicated chat show ""Live with Kelly and Mark"" and dismissed all criticism of ABC's shoddy performance as ""noise."" He sounded like Jimmy Kimmel when he told Republicans he didn't want them watching his late-night show. ABC isn't here to please Republicans, only Democrats.

REPUBLICAN SENATOR DEMANDS ABC NEWS TURN OVER DEBATE COMMUNICATIONS WITH HARRIS CAMPAIGN: 'BIASED AGENDA'

""All of the noise that you hear afterward about you know, 'Which candidate won the debate, did the moderators win or lose?'"" Muir said. ""That's just noise. You all know that. The most important thing to remember is you all have the power.""

Voters don't have the power to tilt the election discussion in one direction. Conspiracy theories bubbled up from an alleged anonymous whistleblower about Vice President Kamala Harris getting questions in advance. ABC hired former Democratic Party chair Donna Brazile as a contributor, and in 2016, when she was a contributor at CNN, she sent Hillary Clinton's campaign some topics for a town hall discussion in advance, and CNN let her go.

It could be enlightening to drag ABC before a congressional probe and ask how this incredibly biased debate was organized. But Harris didn't need to have these questions in advance. Team Kamala could know there would be an inflation question, an immigration question, an abortion question, an Israel question, and maybe another mention of her flip-flop on fracking. There were no surprises, and the questions were vague enough that she repeatedly dodged a direct answer and uncorked her prepared speeches, and the moderators naturally allowed it.

Davis gave a revealing interview to the Los Angeles Times, explaining they didn't want to be like CNN. ""People were concerned that statements were allowed to just hang and not [be] disputed by the candidate Biden, at the time, or the moderators,"" she said. Those ""people"" are Democrats.

Davis told Times media reporter Stephen Battaglio that she had to turn off her social media accounts to shut out people who accuse her of pulling for Harris. ""There is a stereotype that I am acutely aware of that I can't be unbiased covering this moment,"" she said. Then she went on the debate stage and proved it. Davis, like Muir, had no time for people charging her with blatant favoritism.

Davis also cited her mentor, ABC News veteran Carole Simpson, a woman of color best known for moderating a 1992 presidential debate where she sneered at President George H.W. Bush for calling himself the ""education president."" Simpson openly called Hillary Clinton's election to the Senate in 2000 an ""exhilarating moment"" and in 2007, proclaimed it was time for Hillary to be elected the first woman president. That says a lot.

So how did Team ABC decide to tilt toward only ""fact-checking"" Trump? Davis said she and Muir had studied hours of campaign rallies and interviews to prepare for the debate, so they were ""ready to counter the candidates' most egregious statements."" For example, she fully anticipated fighting back on Trump's supposedly ""erroneous"" claim that the Democrats favor abortion at any time for any reason.

""That was an obvious thing to get on the record,"" Davis said. ABC's partisans should have studied what Trump typically cites, that then-Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said in a radio interview about keeping a baby that was born alive ""comfortable"" as they decided whether to kill it (or perhaps let it die unassisted). A state legislator had proposed a bill that she admitted would allow abortion up until birth.

They could have reviewed the 2020 Democratic Party platform, which proclaimed, ""We believe unequivocally, like the majority of Americans, that every woman should be able to access high-quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion ... Democrats oppose and will fight to overturn federal and state laws that create barriers to reproductive health and rights.""

Davis gave a revealing interview to the Los Angeles Times, explaining they didn't want to be like CNN. ""People were concerned that statements were allowed to just hang and not [be] disputed by the candidate Biden, at the time, or the moderators,"" she said. Those ""people"" are Democrats.

They will fight to overturn barriers, with no exceptions. Liberal ""fact-checkers"" have attacked Trump and many other Republicans (like Montana Senate candidate Tim Sheehy) for ""lying"" about Democrats supporting abortion on demand, when the facts are there, in black and white. They claim Republicans are debunked because late-term abortions are ""rare."" That's not a factual rebuttal.

On the Sunday after the debate, ABC ""This Week"" host Martha Raddatz, who has specialized in foreign policy, pushed a belated fact-check on Harris's claim that there were no American service members in war zones. ""Our fact-checkers found that to be false,"" Raddatz told Gov. Maura Healey, D-Mass. ""There are currently 900 U.S. military personnel in Syria, 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq. All have been under regular threat from drones and missiles for months. We also have action in the Red Sea. Also, every single day, the Navy SEALs, Delta Forces special operators can be part of any sort of deadly raid."" Muir and Davis didn't prepare for that one.

Battaglio apparently had no questions about whether they studied Harris's record for ""fact-checks."" They obviously needed no preparation on that front, since they never touched her. Let's guess that shameless zero occurred because, on the left, any attempt to fact-check a Democrat opposing Trump is objectionable, because it suggests that a Democrat's falsehoods might be made equivalent to Trump's. Every anti-Trump journalist acts on the belief that any measure of neutrality is an atrocity."
Harris-Trump Showdown: Presidential nominees hit key battleground states as election approaches,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-trump-showdown-presidential-nominees-key-battleground-states-election-approaches,2024-09-20T16:50:16Z,"Virginia Gov. Glen Youngkin joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the 2024 election as early voting starts in the key swing state.

With just over six weeks to go until Election Day on November 5, and early and absentee voting now underway in an increasing number of states, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump are not letting up as they campaign in the key battleground states.

After a stop Thursday evening in Michigan, Harris heads to Georgia on Friday afternoon for a reproductive rights event before heading to a rally later in the day in Wisconsin.

Trump, who campaigned in Michigan earlier in the week, returns to the campaign trail on Saturday with a rally in North Carolina.

TRUMP MAKES A BOLD PREDICTION ABOUT THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

Those four states, along with Pennsylvania, Arizona and Nevada, had razor-thin margins that decided President Biden's 2020 election victory over Trump. And those seven swing states will likely determine whether Harris or Trump wins the 2024 election and succeeds Biden in the White House.

Harris will keep the spotlight on the combustible issue of abortion during her Atlanta area stop. The issue has been a winning one for the Democrats at the ballot box since the conservative majority on the Supreme Court in a blockbuster decision two years ago overturned the landmark nearly half-century-old Roe v. Wade ruling, which had legalized abortion nationwide.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS SHOW IN THE HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN

""Trump Abortion Bans have criminalized reproductive care,"" Harris said on social media Thursday night after spotlighting the issue during a live-streamed forum in Michigan with one of her best known surrogates, Oprah Winfrey.

Biden narrowly edged Trump in Georgia four years ago to become the first Democrat to carry the state in a presidential election in over a quarter-century.

Harris returns to Georgia after making a campaign swing in the southeastern part of the state earlier this month.

Trump, amid strained relations with Gov. Brian Kemp, the state's popular two-term conservative governor, hasn't returned to Georgia since holding a large rally in Atlanta on August 5.

DOES TRUMP OR HARRIS HAVE THE EDGE IN THESE KEY BATTLEGROUNDS?

The latest public opinion polls in Georgia conducted entirely after the first and potentially only debate between Harris and Trump indicate the former president holding a slight lower-single digit edge over the vice president.

Harris later on Friday headlines a rally in Madison, Wisconsin, for her fourth visit to the Midwestern battleground since replacing Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket over two months ago.

The most recent surveys in Wisconsin also show a margin-of-error race, with Harris holding a razor-thin lower single digit edge over Trump.

Wisconsin, along with Michigan and Pennsylvania, is part of the Democrats' so-called Blue Wall of Rust Belt states that the party reliably won in presidential elections for a quarter-century until Trump narrowly captured all three states en route to a White House victory in 2016. But four years ago, Biden edged Trump in all three states to win the presidency.

The state is a must-win for the GOP presidential nominee, and his campaign is now spending big bucks to run ads in North Carolina. The latest polls suggest a coin-toss race, with the former president holding the slightest edge.

Trump's visit comes two days after a bombshell report rocked the state's governor's race, with allegations that GOP nominee and controversial Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson posted disturbing and inflammatory statements on a forum of a pornographic website. Robinson has denied the allegations.

A source familiar with Trump's rally Saturday in Wilmington, North Carolina, told Fox News that Robinson would not be attending the event."
We're Living In A Student Loan Land Of Confusion,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryancraig/2024/09/20/were-living-in-a-student-loan-land-of-confusion/,2024-09-20T13:01:12Z,"As the world's shortest and baldest rock star, Phil Collins has long been the butt of jokes. In the 2016 film Sing Street, a charming coming-of-age story of an Irish musician, the protagonist's older brother imparts this timeless advice: ""Trust me. No woman can truly love a man who listens to Phil Collins."" South Park portrays Collins as a cross-eyed villain who plays horrible music and flaunts his Tarzan Oscar at every opportunity; at the 2000 Academy Awards, Tarzan beat South Park for Best Original Song, prompting the show's caustic creators to remark that although they were prepared to lose, they weren't prepared to lose to Phil Collins. And when the diminutive drummer announced he had changed his mind about retiring, a Change.org petition garnered thousands of supporters for this proposition: ""Phil Collins must be stopped. There is far too much suffering in the world as it is.""

But the best Phil Collins joke was one played on him by his idol. Collins was a huge Beatles fan. As a 13-year-old, he was in the audience for the filming of the concert sequence at the end of A Hard Day's Night. So in early 1970, the 18-year-old drummer couldn't have been more excited to receive an invitation to play congas on a track for George Harrison's first solo album, All Things Must Pass. Collins showed up, met George, and played hard enough to raise blisters on both hands. But when the album appeared, Collins heard no congas, saw no credit, and received no explanation.

Collins and Harrison met a few times over the years but never discussed the session. Then in 2000, as Harrison was re-mixing All Things Must Pass, Collins bought the house of Harrison's friend, Formula One driver Jackie Stewart. Collins and Stewart got to talking about the upcoming re-release and Collins shared he was at the recording session but didn't show up on the album. A few days later, Collins received a package from Harrison with a master tape and note that read ""Could this be you?"" Collins pressed play and recognized the track. Then, Collins recollected, ""suddenly the congas come in - too loud and just awful."" Collins was mortified; the conga player was rubbish. Then at the end of the take, Harrison says audibly, ""Can we try another without the conga player?""

George Harrison had a wonderful sense of humor. When Monty Python lost funding for the controversial Life of Brian, George stepped up because he wanted to see the film (as Eric Idle described, ""the world's most expensive theater ticket""). He released a single where he's laughing through several verses, recorded the song Dark Horse while hoarse, and was an avid participant in the first great mockumentary, The Rutles, and subsequently annoyed Paul McCartney by repeating Rutles jokes throughout The Beatles Anthology. So as Stewart and Harrison subsequently disclosed, it's not surprising that the tape sent to Collins was a joke. After hearing Collins' story from Stewart, Harrison re-recorded the song and instructed the percussion player: ""Play bad, I'm going to record it and send it to Phil."" When it came to jokes, the Quiet Beatle was loudest of all.

In addition to being a good sport, Phil Collins deserves credit for a hit that accurately describes how tens of millions of Americans are thinking about their student loans. No, I'm not talking about Against All Odds or Sussudio. The song is Genesis' Land of Confusion.

With $1.59 trillion outstanding - nearly $40,000 per borrower - student loan debt has become a danger to economic mobility. But in the last 3 and ½ years, through dozens of executive decisions involving various Federal Student Aid programs, the federal government has canceled over 10% of that balance: $168.5 billion. Nearly 5 million borrowers - also about 10% - have benefited from loan beneficence. President Biden's Department of Education (ED) has made fools of those of us who never thought federal bureaucracy could be so forgiving.

But that's not the only thing that's gone on in student loan land over the past 3 and ½ years. Starting on March 13, 2020, ED paused all repayments and reset rates to zero. The Covid student loan moratorium was extended twice by the Trump administration, then seven successive times by the Biden administration. Mid-moratorium, President Biden's chief of staff bragged that ""Joe Biden right now is the only president in history where no one's paid on their student loans for the entirety of his presidency.""

Loan forgiveness and the repayment moratorium weren't wholly independent; the connection was made by ED itself. The explanation provided for the final extension to October 2023 - long past the Covid emergency's sell-by date - was ""it would be deeply unfair to ask borrowers to pay a debt that they wouldn't have to pay [when loan forgiveness is effected]."" So that's 3 and ½ years of no repayments entwined with 3 and ½ years of forgiveness.

Enter the increasingly Javert-like federal courts. Last year, in a widely expected decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the Biden administration's single biggest swing at loan forgiveness - $10,000 for borrowers making less than $125K, another $10,000 for borrowers who received Pell Grants, adding up to a number ($430 billion) with serious fiscal implications - required clearer congressional authorization by dint of being a major question. While the 9/11 HEROES Act did give ED the ability to ""modify"" student loan program rules, Chief Justice Roberts noted the proposed plan ""modified"" student loans ""in the same way that the French Revolution 'modified' the status of the French nobility"" i.e., abolishing it.

Hard upon last year's Supreme Court decision, ED indicated it would try blanket loan forgiveness again - this time based on the Higher Education Act. Meanwhile it had already established a second front: a new income-driven repayment program, the heroically named SAVE (saving on a valuable education). SAVE's terms are much more generous than any prior program at a cost the Congressional Budget Office pegged at $230 billion, or as the American Enterprise Institute's Michael Brickman called it, ""loan forgiveness disguised as loan repayment.""

But like a bad sequel, these borrower-friendly changes were blocked after a lawsuit filed by Missouri and six other red states resulted in same-day rulings from federal judges in Kansas and Missouri followed by an even broader injunction by the 8 Circuit barring changes to income-driven repayment and suggesting a lack of authority for any loan forgiveness under income-driven repayment. Now, in something of a fit of spite, ED is not allowing new enrollment in SAVE and has launched a brand-new moratorium for income-driven repayment participants.

Perhaps Chief Justice Roberts wouldn't have made a French Revolution joke about student loans if he realized millions of borrowers are as angry as their forerunners who stormed the Bastille. (As Phil Collins sang in Land of Confusion: ""I can hear the marching feet. They're moving into the street.) But they're not only angry; they're also really confused. Borrowers are telling media and advocacy organizations how confusing this all is and newspapers are running headlines like ""All so confusing"" and ""Loan forgiveness fighting is giving debtors whiplash."" But don't take my word for it. Just look at how the New York Times answers whether borrowers who can no longer enroll in SAVE or other income-driven repayment programs can stop interest from accruing. Better yet, don't - I assure you it's baffling (and also moot given the new moratorium).

Since no one knows how much they'll owe once this all shakes out, it shouldn't be surprising that nearly half of all borrowers are not making payments; Preston Cooper calculates the rate of non-repayment at nearly 60%. In the great tradition of setting a fire then pulling the alarm, Persis Yu, of the Student Borrower Protection Center, a progressive group that advocated for both loan forgiveness and the lengthy repayment moratorium, was quoted in the Times saying ""the nonpayment rate really is emblematic of a system that's not doing its job.""

This month's new lawsuit from Missouri + conservative confrères to prospectively block Big Swing II (pre-election blanket loan forgiveness premised on the Higher Education Act) aimed to keep the din to a dull roar. In their complaint, the states provided evidence that before publishing the final rule, ED instructed loan servicers to forgive loans and draft emails notifying borrowers. The point, apparently, was to spread the word quickly; even ED knows that forgiveness isn't forgiveness if it's done in secret. Missouri et al. argued that confusion would be compounded if millions of borrowers hear from servicers that their loans are forgiven only to learn that another federal court has countermanded that decision. A Georgia judge agreed and issued yet another injunction.

Speaking of injunctions, one of the few semi-coherent statements made by former President Trump in last week's presidential debate involved student loans. Although the context (abortion) was inappropriate and the analogy inapposite (inability to get congressional votes vs. winning in court), he wasn't wrong about this: ""they said they're going to get student loans terminated and it ended up being a total catastrophe... all these students got taunted... they taunted young people."" He should know; if anyone's an expert on taunting, it's former President Trump.

Our current approach to costly college tempered by loan forgiveness is a confusing combination of control and lenience: control in that - unless you're inordinately wealthy - you must take on debt to earn a degree and launch your career; lenience in that maybe you won't have to pay the debt. As such, financing higher education has caught up with the college experience itself. As UNC's Rita Koganzon noted in the New York Times, universities attempt to micro-manage campus life but don't hold students accountable for violating policies or laws. What's the result of this heighted control and lenience? ""A kind of simulacrum of adult independence that in reality infantilizes students and protects them from responsibility.""

With both the student experience and now its financing, higher education has followed in the footsteps of helicopter and snowplow parents who indulge their children through to adulthood then complain they're not independent. The answer must be greater independence. But the current cost of college is simply way too high.

There's only one way out: dramatically expand the supply of less expensive pathways to career launch. Pathways like industry certifications, bootcamps, and earn-and-learn options like work-integrated learning, internships, degree-apprenticeships, and apprenticeships. Then give students the freedom to choose. In this future state with a multitude of cheaper alternatives, if they take on debt to attend an expensive college, that's a choice they'll have to live with as independent adults. But as the current limited options - College or Chipotle - don't present a serious choice, we're only giving them a simulacrum of independence.

There's a second benefit as well. Loan forgiveness has been criticized by many as backward-looking policy. So much time and energy directed into trying to right past college wrongs - ""going back,"" as Vice President Harris might say, instead of turning the page and moving forward. If even a small percentage of these resources had been directed towards establishing and strengthening new pathways to career launch, the Democratic Party would have plausible deniability to the charge that it's the party of college elites. Particularly since, according to Brookings, ""the beneficiaries of student loan forgiveness would be higher income, better educated, and whiter than beneficiaries of [any] other transfer program.""

Are we about to start trying? Here's one positive sign. Last Friday Vice President Harris said this at a Pennsylvania rally: ""For far too long, our nation has encouraged only one path to success: a four-year college degree. Our nation needs to recognize the value of other paths, additional paths, such as apprenticeships and technical programs."" If the next administration spends as much effort on new pathways to economic opportunity as this one has on new pathways to student loan forgiveness, we won't need to try another without the conga player.

The most confusing part of our Land of Confusion is why we're not moving faster. Perhaps it's all a big joke. If so, it's a confusing one - and not nearly as good as the joke the Quiet Beatle played on the conga player."

NFL Hall of Fame coach Tony Dungy questions Kamala Harris' faith-based tweet about abortion rights,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/nfl-hall-fame-coach-tony-dungy-questions-kamala-harris-faith-based-tweet-about-abortion-rights,2024-09-19T22:59:55Z,"Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Legendary NFL coach Tony Dungy challenged a tweet from Vice President Kamala Harris about abortion rights.

Harris has been unapologetic about her stance on abortion rights for women, and she continued with a post on X Thursday.

""One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree: The government, and certainly Donald Trump, should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,"" she said.

Dungy, the first Black head coach to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in the modern era and second all-time, is a man of faith and questioned Harris.

""Dear VP Harris: I hear you make this statement all the time,"" Dungy wrote in a quote tweet. ""Exactly what 'faith' are you talking about when you say you don't have to abandon it to support abortion? Are you talking about the Christian faith that says all babies are made in the image of God (Gen 1:26), that God places them in the womb (Jer 1:5) and that we should not take any life unjustly (Luke 18:20)?

""Are you talking about that faith or some nebulous, general 'faith' that says we're good enough, and smart enough to make our own decisions? What 'faith' are you talking about?""

HARRIS CLAIMS TRUMP ABORTION PLATFORM MAKES 'NO EXCEPTION,' MOMENTS AFTER TRUMP SAYS THE OPPOSITE

Harris has pledged that if Congress were to pass a bill to reinstate the protections that Roe v. Wade guaranteed, she would ""proudly sign it into law"" if elected president in November.

Meanwhile, Trump commended the United States Supreme Court for overturning Roe v. Wade, which has allowed states to handle the issue.

Dungy also reposted former NFL tight end Benjamin Watson's quote tweet over a Sept. 17 Harris tweet, which said, ""A young mother from Georgia should be alive today, raising her son and pursuing her dream of attending nursing school. This is exactly what we feared when Roe vs. Wade was struck down. In more than 20 states, Trump Abortion Bans prevent doctors from providing basic medical care.""

""Amber Thurman's tragic death was caused by complications from legal abortion drugs and gross medical malpractice,"" Watson responded. ""She should have been treated immediately by physicians who instead waited too long to act. Georgia's pro-life law is not the issue. It does not criminalize doing a D&C, especially when there is no detectable fetal heart rate.

""Amber should be alive, and [Harris] should focus her attention on these facts so we can prevent the next tragedy rather than promoting politically motivated falsehoods.""

On Dungy's tweet, one commenter wrote, ""I love what you stand for coach. But how do you support someone like Trump? I have never seen post from you criticizing him.""

""I guess you didn't see my post last week when I said Donald Trump could not have read Florida Amendment 4 very carefully when he said he was going to vote 'Yes' on it,"" Dungy replied.

Trump later clarified his stance on the abortion amendment, which would protect access to abortion in the state, saying, ""I'll be voting no."" Abortion is not permitted in Florida after six weeks of pregnancy with exceptions in rare circumstances.

""President Trump has not yet said how he will vote on the ballot initiative in Florida. He simply reiterated that he believes six weeks is too short,"" Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign's press secretary, said after his NBC News interview.

Earlier this month, Harris also claimed Trump's abortion platform would make no exception ""even for rape and incest.""

""A survivor of a crime of violation to their body does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body. That is immoral, and one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,"" Harris said.

""Understand, if Donald Trump were to be re-elected, he will sign the national abortion ban.""

Trump said moments before Harris' statement he does believe ""strongly"" in exceptions for abortion.

""I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother,"" Trump said during a debate. ""I believe strongly in it. Ronald Reagan did also. Eighty-five percent of Republicans knew exceptions are very important.""

Fox News Poll: Voters cite high prices as biggest motivator to vote,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-voters-cite-high-prices-biggest-motivator-vote,2024-09-19T22:12:05Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

As the economy remains the top overall issue for voters, a new Fox News national poll finds high prices will be the main factor driving them to cast ballots this fall, as an increasing number say grocery prices and housing costs are tough for their family.

At least 6 in 10 voters say grocery prices (66%) and housing costs (60%) are a major problem for their family. In May, those numbers were at 62% for groceries and 47% for housing costs.

The 13-point jump in housing costs being a major problem is seen across the board but mainly among men (+16 points major problem), White voters (+15), those without a college degree (+15), Republicans (+15), voters ages 65 and over (+14), Democrats (+13), and those under 45 (+13).

Nearly half of voters (48%) say gas prices are a major problem, about where it was in May.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS TOPS TRUMP BY TWO POINTS

All this leads to high prices being the single most important factor that voters say will motivate them to go out and vote this election. Four in 10 say high prices (39%) will be the main issue driving them, followed by immigration (32%), stopping the other side from winning (29%), abortion (27%), violent crime (26%), the candidate's race (9%), and the candidate's gender (7%).

For Democrats, the single most important factor will be abortion (39%) and stopping the other side from winning (37%). For both Republicans and Independents, it's immigration (50% and 27%, respectively) and high prices (49% and 40%).

The economy has been the top issue for much of the campaign and that's no different now. Thirty-nine percent say it's the economy, with immigration (16%) and abortion (15%) registering a distant second and third. All other issues tested were in single digits.

Democrats' most important issue is split between abortion (27%) and the economy (25%), while Republicans and Independents are again united with the economy first (50% and 45%, respectively) then immigration (30% and 13%).

When it comes to who can better handle these priorities, former President Donald Trump is favored on two of the top three. By 5 points, he is seen as better able to handle the economy and by 10 points immigration, while more voters trust Vice President Kamala Harris to handle abortion by 16 points.

The candidates are rated evenly when it comes to handling taxes, while voters give Harris the lead on helping the middle class by 9 points.

""The issue profile of this election continues to favor Trump,"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll along with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""But his edge on economic issues has decreased, probably due to Harris' messaging on housing costs and taxes, both of which target the middle class and appear to be paying off.""

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS CLOSES GAP WITH TRUMP IN SUN BELT STATES

Overall, Harris has a 2-point edge (within the error margin) in the head-to-head matchup against Trump (50%-48%).

""One reason the horserace is so tight is that a handful of voters who trust Trump on the economy and immigration still back Harris and a handful of those trusting Harris on abortion and climate favor Trump,"" says Dana Blanton, who runs the Fox News polling unit.

Trump's advantage on the economy is bolstered by a rosier picture of his time in office. By 17 points, more voters see his administration's policies as helpful than harmful, whereas by 24 points they see the Biden administration's policies as more hurtful.

Half of Democrats (50%) say Biden's policies are helping them, while most Republicans (87%) and over half of Independents (52%) say they are hurting. More than half of Democrats feel Trump's policies were hurtful (55%) vs. most Republicans saying helpful (86%). Independents are more mixed on their memory of Trump policies: 39% helped, 32% hurt, 29% no difference.

""The perception that Trump's policies helped more than Biden's creates some heavy baggage for Harris in this campaign and shows why 'turning the page' is a central theme she's tried to stress,"" says Anderson.

Roughly 4 in 10 voters overall (39%) think imposing tariffs on products hurts the economy while 36% says it helps. Two in 10 believe it doesn't make a difference.

While it's nowhere near the high of 84% during Biden's presidency, 7 in 10 have a negative view of the economy (70%) compared to 3 in 10 who hold a positive view (29%). That negative view includes most Republicans (90%) and Independents (77%) and nearly half of Democrats (48%).

The president's job rating stands at 42% approve, 58% disapprove, mostly unchanged since July.

Despite negative attitudes on the economy and high prices, 41% of voters think life for the next generation will be better, up from 25% when the question was last asked two years ago. The new result sits near the high of 42% recorded in August 2012.

Compared to 2022, the increase in optimism for future Americans comes mainly from those without a college degree (+21), voters with annual income under $50,000 (+20), nonwhite voters (+19), Democrats (+18), men (+18), and voters under age 30 (+16)"
New allegations add to Mark Robinson's troubles in North Carolina,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/mark-robinson-drops-out-north-carolina-governor-election-rcna171856,2024-09-19T20:59:57Z,"As North Carolina's Mark Robinson confronts brutal new allegations, the future of his Republican gubernatorial campaign is in doubt.

Mark Robinson's Republican gubernatorial campaign in North Carolina was already struggling. In fact, while the Tar Heel State appears to be highly competitive at the presidential level this year, every recent poll has shown Robinson trailing Democratic state Attorney General Josh Stein -- in some surveys, by double-digit margins.

But the right-wing candidate's difficulties are far from over. The latest reporting from CNN has made matters even worse for Robinson.

Robinson denied the accuracy of the reporting, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, though CNN added that the network was able to verify the username belonged to Robinson ""by matching a litany of biographical details and a shared email address between the two.""

Complicating matters, Politico also published a new report, which has also not been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, alleging that an email address belonging to Robinson ""was registered on Ashley Madison, a website designed for married people seeking affairs.""

The report added that an adviser to the gubernatorial candidate confirmed to Politico that ""the email address in question belongs to Robinson.""

To be sure, the extremist candidate was a scandalous figure before these revelations reached the public. What's more, the GOP candidate has been forced to confront a variety of controversies in recent weeks, related to everything from pornography to abortion, bankruptcies to contraception.

But by any fair measure, the newest allegations, if accurate, are the most brutal. Republicans tend to do well in North Carolina, but when a struggling candidate is credibly accused of describing himself as a ""black NAZI!"" who doesn't think slavery was necessarily a ""bad"" thing, it's a tough sell to the state's electorate.

Shortly before CNN published its report, the right-wing candidate filmed a brief online statement in which he insisted he was ""staying in this race.""

The video was released just hours before North Carolina's deadline for Robinson to withdraw from the race, which would allow party officials to choose a new candidate. It also coincided with multiple published reports that the gubernatorial hopeful was facing pressure to end his campaign -- and by some accounts, that pressure included calls from some working on behalf of Donald Trump's campaign.

As things stand, Robinson is still a candidate who hopes to become the chief executive of a large state. That said, he and his party have some questions to answer.

Will Robinson ignore the pressure to quit? Will Trump, who has repeatedly and publicly praised Robinson, cut him loose? Will the gubernatorial candidate's scandals hurt other GOP candidates in North Carolina? Will his party redirect resources to other contests?

Will other Republican officials and candidates, many of whom have cozied up to Robinson for years, start pretending not to know him? Will conservative media outlets and personalities start walking back their years' worth of praise for the radical candidate?"
"Ari Melber: From GOP heavyweights to celebrities, Harris is expanding her coalition by the day",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/kamala-harris-gop-endorsements-celebrities-economy-rcna171861,2024-09-19T19:08:54Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris' coalition seems to be growing by the day and with less than 50 days to go until the election, she's working to expand that coalition even further -- highlighting the contrast between her and her opponent, Donald Trump. On Wednesday, she issued a new warning about Project 2025 and the dangers of a Trump second-term immigration crackdown, urging people to imagine and reckon with his plans for immigration policy.

And while Americans may want to forget what immigration policy was like under Trump's first term, it's important to see the facts. In 2016, Trump ran on a religious ban and then, once in office, he implemented a related Muslim-majority country ban while using policies to split up families on the southern border.

There was significant backlash to these policies at the time. Trump's travel ban sparked confusion, chaos and protests at U.S. airports. It was then paused by courts and later narrowed. The Trump child separation policy, meant to be used as a crackdown to punish and dissuade migration, only elevated cruelty against children.

While addressing the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Wednesday, Harris urged people to remember the past and consider how it would shape the future in a Trump second term, warning about the former president's mass deportation plan:

It's not just immigration, Harris is broadening out her message, sharing her policies on abortion rights, health care and taxes. Contrast that with Trump's ""concepts of a plan.""

In the home stretch of this race, the Harris campaign is seeking out ways to highlight those key contrasts between her and Trump. Harris did just that in a new interview with the National Association of Black Journalists. In July, Trump had a meltdown during his sit-down with the NABJ.

During her interview, Harris remarked about the ""profound responsibility"" that comes along with a public platform. Responsibility is different than ideology and on that score, Harris continues to draw support -- even from the other side. More top Republicans are backing Harris and calling Trump unfit to serve -- precisely because they view him as irresponsible with the nation's national security.

In recent days, there have been over 100 new endorsements from former members of Congress, defense secretaries and CIA directors.

They now join one of the GOP's top hawks, Dick Cheney, who recently endorsed Harris. It's an embrace that comes despite, not because, of policy.

The Harris coalition now spans from the right edge of the GOP to the center and left of the Democratic Party to cultural figures who fill stadiums, such as Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish. Seriously, who else or what else could bring these people together ... on anything?

They don't agree on foreign policy, abortion policy, music policy. You won't see them backstage together at the earning presentation for the oil company Haliburton, which Cheney ran. Or backstage at the Coachella music festival, which Eilish headlined. The one thing that brings them together is the conviction that Harris should be the next president, not Trump.

And they are taking these positions at the risk of upsetting their base. Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney spent their whole lives in GOP circles and plenty of Republicans buy music and go to concerts. So it's more than unusual, in fact, it's striking to see this organic, broad groundswell for Harris. And as Trump allies attack singers or lie and pretend they don't want these endorsements, let's be clear, they do.

That may be what's happening in the zeitgeist but when it comes to the issues, Harris got some of the best economic news possible this week. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced it was lowering its key interest rate by half a percentage point. If this rate cut can impact the economic vibe just as early voting kicks off, that could be the difference in this election."
Economic Concerns Are Top Priority For College Voters,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/meglittlereilly/2024/09/19/economic-concerns-are-top-priority-for-college-voters/,2024-09-19T14:55:54Z,"While much of the discourse about college voters has focused on campus war protests and reproductive rights, America's youngest voting block does not rank these as priority issues. If young voters turn out in high numbers on Election Day 2024, they will likely be driven by economic concerns like the cost of rent, food and college tuition. That's according to the latest analysis from The Brookings Institution, which synthesizes their ongoing research on this critical subgroup of the electorate.

""In short, young voters are experiencing a complexity of economic stress,"" according to the Brookings analysis. ""This includes a dramatic rise in the cost of rent and mortgages that has led many to move back in with their parents; a drastic increase in the cost of higher education that has saddled them with college debt; and limited job opportunities, even for those with college degrees.""

Gabriel R. Sanchez, a primary author of the Brookings paper, says that this is the extension of an underappreciated trend that's been simmering among youth voters for several years.

""Inflation was actually the number one issue for voters 18-29 in 2022, so this is not a new trend among this age group,"" says Sanchez. ""While more ideological issues like abortion are often talked about much more in the national media, young voters have been feeling the economic downturn and are voting based on the economy.""

He points to the results of the 2022 African American Research Collaborative Mid-Term Voter Election Poll which was an early sign of these emerging economic priorities. The findings are consistent with those of the 2024 Harvard Youth Poll and the 2024 Tufts Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement youth poll, both of which found inflation and cost of living as the top concerns among young voters this year.

Young voters are not a monolith, and not all attend college, but these trends appear to hold true among the subgroup of young voters who are currently in college. A 2024 poll from Young America's foundation found that economic issues outrank all social issues for college students, across party lines.

Mike Burns, national director of the Campus Vote Project, points out that, as the most diverse voting block in the electorate, youth voters express interest in a broad range of concerns.

""This generation of college voters is incredibly diverse so they are motivated by a range of issues. However, economic issues such as inflation, cost of rent/housing, and income inequality rank highly for them in surveys just like for older voters,"" says Burns. ""Students are also very concerned about mass shootings. We hear students wanting to see elected officials take strong action to address these issues.""

How these concerns will translate to voter turnout remains unknown. Most of the political data available today predates the July shakeup in the Democratic party, when President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.

Early signs suggest that Harris's entry into the race provided an infusion of enthusiasm among many young voters, including a September poll from Tufts that shows a dramatic increase in youth voter registration since July. In eight states, there are already more young voters registered than there were on Election Day 2020.

Youth voters are always outnumbered by their older counterparts, but the bar for making history is higher than it has ever been.

""2020 was also the highest turnout election in the history of the country and youth and students had especially high voter turnout, even compared to the increase for other groups of voters that election,"" says Mike Burns. ""So we are optimistic that will we again see young people, and students in particular, making their voices heard in their communities up and down the ballot at very high rates."""
"Trump, Harris locked in tight race in critical battleground Pennsylvania, polls find",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-harris-locked-tight-race-critical-battleground-pennsylvania-polls-find,2024-09-19T12:28:16Z,"Fox News contributor Kellyanne Conway reacts to latest Fox News polling showing a tight race between Trump and Harris as the former president hosts a rally in New York.

Former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are in a deadlock in the state of Pennsylvania, a virtual must-win state for both candidates, according to a new poll.

A Thursday poll from the Washington Post had Harris at 48% support among likely and registered voters, while Trump sits at 47%.

A New York Times poll gave Harris a slight edge, however, with Harris sitting at 50% compared to Trump's 46%. Nationally, however, the Times' poll had Harris and Trump tied at 47%.

Both polls were conducted after last week's presidential debate, in which most debate watchers said Harris came out on top.

Nevertheless, the Times says the debate does not appear to have had a major impact on voters, regardless of who they supported beforehand.

""Despite a strong debate performance, Vice President Harris did not gain much ground compared with our last polls of the nation and Pennsylvania. The poll is full of evidence that our respondents thought she did well in the debate -- and that Mr. Trump did poorly -- but it hasn't made a big difference,"" the paper wrote.

The Washington Post poll found that Trump maintains his lead when it comes to the top two issues of the election, the economy and immigration. Harris has also maintained her lead on the issues of defending democracy and abortion.

The close polls come as Trump seems to be losing his edge in two critical states, according to the most recent Fox News Power Rankings. Both North Carolina and Georgia, which were once considered Republican strongholds, are now rated toss-ups in the presidential race.

10 undecided voters explain why they haven't picked a side in this election,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/19/nx-s1-5118393/undecided-voters-kamala-harris-donald-trump,2024-09-19T09:07:33Z,"People watch the presidential debate between Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump during a debate watch party at Penn Social on Sept. 10 in Washington, D.C. Alex Wong/Getty Images hide caption

Most people have decided who they are going to vote for. Former President Donald Trump is well known and polarizing -- people either love him or hate him. Vice President Harris is famous, but voters say they don't know her as well.

Polls show an incredibly tight race between them, and a handful of swing voters could decide the election, depending on who they vote for or if they decide to stay home.

Only a tiny slice of the electorate is considered persuadable -- anywhere from 6% or less to the low teens.

There were nearly four dozen undecided voters in the NPR/PBS News/Marist poll in the last four months who gave permission to call them back to follow up. To understand their current thinking and motivations, NPR tried them all and got in touch with 10 by phone in the days following the Harris-Trump debate. What we found was notable.

First, the debate was important for Harris. Most who watched said she performed better than Trump. They were not all moved to vote for her as a result, but four who seemed to need a degree of reassurance about Harris are now voting for her or leaning Harris' direction after the debate.

And while undecided voters often have unique reasons for what influences their votes, there was a clear gender divide. All four who say they are now voting for or leaning toward Harris are women. That also reflects the wide gender gap seen in polls between the candidates.

The other six -- one woman and five men -- were a mix. Five said they likely won't be voting for Harris, most citing the economy or immigration as reasons. One other said he is still truly undecided, but said prices are a major concern. Two are leaning toward Trump; another said she aligns more with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.; a self-described progressive said he doesn't like Harris' stance on the war in Gaza; and one other, a conservative, said he might not vote at all.

Many did not want to use their full names; some didn't want us to use any name at all. They cited security concerns. They said in this political environment, they were apprehensive about giving out too much personally identifiable information.

Here's what they had to say:

On the debate, Brady said, ""Kamala [Harris] did a better job articulating her points, obviously.""

He added: ""I don't want to go through another four years of a Trump presidency.""

But his vote is largely contingent on his personal financial situation, and he noted, ""Things have gotten more expensive.""

""I have probably a middle-class income for my family,"" he said, ""and it doesn't feel like it's getting any easier -- even as my wife and I have advanced in our careers.""

Brady said he aligned more with former President Barack Obama, and said he doesn't ""like her policies"" on the economy.

Asked what specifically he doesn't like, he said, ""I can't say I'm super knowledgeable about the specifics, but from a how-our-family-is-feeling standpoint, just not sure.""

Lee did not like how ABC handled the debate, specifically the fact-checking. He felt the moderators ""teamed up on Trump.""

He felt Harris did almost too well, saying it was ""almost like rehearsed."" But he said he ""never got any message from Harris"" and said she ""skirted issues,"" including the Biden administration's ""inability to stop the flow of migrants"" and the economy.

""Trump stuck his foot in his mouth multiple times,"" Lee said, though.

He said he wanted to see Trump, whom he trusts more on the economy, debate again and was unaware that Trump had said he would not do another debate with Harris. When told that, Lee said he was ""disappointed.""

He said he's ""not a big Republican, not a big Democrat."" He voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders, the progressive independent from Vermont, in the 2016 primary and is now leaning toward Trump, independent Cornel West or the Green Party's Jill Stein (not from an environmental standpoint, however, because he thinks the Green New Deal ""went too far"").

""But I don't want to piss away my vote,"" he said, pointing out that he is leaning most toward Trump because of that.

Of the debate, the respondent said, ""I was like, OK, who are these people? They were like bad actors. Kamala, suddenly she was so articulate when it's usually word salad. There was something weird going on there.""

Trump, on the other hand, she said, it was like ""something was in his water,"" and he wasn't his usual self.

She said this of her ideal ticket: ""If RFK [Jr.] was on the ticket with [former Rep.] Tulsi Gabbard [of Hawaii], it would have been a slam dunk for me.""

Of Trump and Harris, she said: ""I am reluctant to vote for Trump, but I have absolutely no confidence about Kamala Harris' ability to do anything about the border at all. We're suffering for it.""

She said she didn't vote in the 2020 election, and that she doesn't trust Trump fully, because he signed the CARES act, a COVID relief bill.

""He is aesthetically lacking,"" she said, laughing, but ""the major Trump haters are missing the whole point. They're not looking at issues; they're looking at personality.""

Proffitt did not see the debate or follow news about it afterward. She said she voted for Trump in 2016 and did not vote for president in 2020. But she is resolved to do so this time.

""I'm going to go out and will vote this year,"" said Proffitt, a mother of five. ""It's a right I should exercise. I want to show my kids that's a right.""

Of the candidates, she said she doesn't know much at this point about Harris' policy positions, but she is leaning her direction because of Trump.

""I feel Trump's disrespect for women is not befitting of a president,"" she said. ""He is not someone I want my girls to look up to as a role model.""

About Harris, she added: ""She's a woman, and maybe having a female president would do the country some good. ... I gave the other guy a try, why not give her a try?""

A Republican and former interior decorator and rancher, Bohlman said she made the switch to vote Democratic when Trump came on the scene.

""No, I have not voted for Trump, nor will I ever,"" Bohlman said. ""I have never been able to stand the guy since he came into the picture years ago. I even took a book away from my 16-year-old son that [Trump] had written about making money. He didn't make his money; he inherited it and lost it. He's not a good businessman. He's not anything but a narcissistic misogynist.""

She was undecided in May, but is now locked in for Harris. She said she saw the debate and thought Harris performed well.

""I will vote Democrat,"" Bohlman said. ""I will vote for Kamala. I liked the way she came across in the debate. She is a very astute, intelligent woman, who knows exactly where she's going. She doesn't hinge her judgment on whether she likes someone or not.""

She went on to cite the overturning of Roe v. Wade abortion protections, which she blames squarely on Trump, as another motivating factor for her to vote for Harris.

""I am so angry about that,"" she said of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision. ""It's so unfair that a bunch of men are making decisions for women. I think it's horrific.""

Bohlman also brought up the siege at the Capitol on Jan. 6, which she said was ""appalling,"" called out GOP leaders' hypocrisy in criticizing Trump initially and then trying to get back in his good graces, and she noted that she has lots of family members who are ""adamantly pro-Trump.""

""They do not look at the whole picture,"" she said of Trump supporters. ""I'm sure after this second [assassination] attempt, they'll be saying, 'God is protecting him.' It's just a bunch of crock.""

Annette is a registered independent who generally votes Democratic. In June, she was undecided if she would vote at all because she was concerned about President Biden's age and ability to do the job.

""I didn't realize how bad he was,"" Annette said after watching Biden in the June 27 debate. ""He lost his oomph. He made Trump look good.""

But now, she is enthusiastically backing Harris.

""I would never vote for him,"" Annette said of Trump. She called herself ""happily surprised, maybe not surprised, but happy with [Harris'] presentation"" at the debate. Annette said Harris proved she's ""perfectly capable.""

Remensnyder is a registered independent, but described herself as a ""Republican at heart.""

""I really liked Nikki Haley,"" Remensnyder said. ""I was hoping she would run [as the Republican nominee].""

The retired audiologist voted for Trump in 2016 and then Biden in 2020. Remensnyder said she owned three doctors' practices. As a business owner, she said, ""I thought I could trust Trump. He was a businessman, but he was an absolute disaster"" from the start, Remensnyder said.

And ""as a medical professional,"" she said she thought ""what he did with COVID was embarrassing.""

But this time around, Remensnyder said she was ""despondent"" at the choice between Biden and Trump. She felt Biden's mental fitness had declined too much to do the job any longer.

""I couldn't trust him to run the government. ... It really scared me,"" she said.

When Harris entered, Remensnyder gave her a shot.

""I watched her,"" she said. ""I listened to her. I am a woman, and women's needs are first, even before party.""

Remensnyder is pro-abortion rights and said she liked how Harris has advocated for women's reproductive freedom, and she liked Harris' experience as a litigator.

Remensnyder said she thought Harris did fairly well in the debate, but ""did not answer most of the questions. She did skirt the issues. I don't think she's the best. I really, really wanted Nikki Haley.""

But she added that she is ""confident"" in Harris' ability to do the job, though not confident she will win because of the clear gender divide she sees. Remensnyder said her husband and son are conservative and tell her they are leaving the presidential line on the ballot blank.

""They can't force themselves to vote Democratic,"" she said.

A college student born in Brazil, he described himself as a progressive whose top issue is the war in Gaza.

""Donald Trump won't get my vote,"" Thiago said, pointing out that Trump's position on the war is a nonstarter.

After Biden dropped out, he was waiting to see what Harris would do, but Thiago said her posture on Gaza ""hasn't been a great one.""

""I'm still undecided whether it's worth it to vote for Kamala, given her not-great stance on Palestine,"" Thiago said, ""and given she's reaching out more to conservatives than more-progressive members of her party.""

He watched the debate and said Trump was ""off the ball in the same way Biden seemed entirely way too old and needing to step aside. Trump seemed to inherit that and seemed rattled by Kamala.""

Even if you're on Trump's side, Thiago said, it was ""obvious"" that ""Trump didn't do great in that debate.""

Thiago said he's still going to vote down-ballot, but short of Harris saying she will cut off weapons shipments to Israel, he likely will leave the presidential line blank.

A registered Republican, Gideon voted for Trump in 2016, but didn't vote for him in 2020 ""because of some of the choices he made."" He didn't specify which ones.

Of Trump and Harris: ""They both have their challenges.""

But he won't be voting for Harris. ""I understand her economic plan,"" he said, ""but her liberalism is a little bit too liberal.""

Gideon added: ""This might be a situation where neither one of them gets my vote.""

John is a registered independent originally from Nassau County, N.Y., and has a blue-collar background as the son of a firefighter. He considers himself a ""liberal union Democrat."" He voted for Obama twice, even volunteered to ""work the phones,"" he said, and thought former President Bill Clinton ""did a great job as president.""

He did not vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 because of a personal experience; she didn't show to an event he was involved with planning. In 2020, he said his son, who was 5 then, essentially cast his ballot for Biden, because he wanted to vote for him.

John said he's not following the current presidential race that much, but did watch ""a little bit"" of the debate. His biggest concerns are housing affordability, groceries and gas prices.

""Trump was cuckoo for saying that the dogs and cats were being eaten,"" John said, ""but Kamala Harris wasn't really answering any of the questions,"" especially about the economy.

John said he wants to see something put forward to ""stop the inflation."" John also doesn't trust Harris (mispronouncing her name as ""Camilla"" at one point) because of her changed positions on things like fracking.

""I think Joe Biden did the best he could,"" John said. ""If he could have just grabbed the horns on inflation -- things are through the roof. ... It's gone freakin' nuts."""
Harris and Trump deadlocked in Pennsylvania as former president trails in other 'blue wall' states: poll,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-trump-deadlocked-pennsylvania-former-president-trails-other-blue-wall-states-poll,2024-09-19T02:13:04Z,"Former President Trump, at a large rally on Long Island, vows 'we are going to win New York.' No Republican has carried the state in a presidential election in 40 years.

With fewer than 47 days until the November election, Vice President Harris and former President Trump are tied with likely voters in Pennsylvania, which could be the state to decide the contest on Election Day.

Trump and Harris each garnered 49% of likely voters in the Keystone State, per a new Marist Poll.

Furthermore, 90% of likely voters who said they had a candidate preference also reported strongly supporting them.

GOP SENS CALL ON SCHUMER, DEMS TO TAKE UP BORDER BILLS AS THEY TOUT IMMIGRATION VIGILANCE

""Pennsylvania is attracting the most attention of the Rust Belt states from the presidential candidates and with good reason,"" said Dr. Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. ""It's the biggest prize in the region and the most competitive. Winning Pennsylvania doesn't guarantee the White House, but it goes a long way.""

In two other so-called ""blue wall"" states, Michigan and Wisconsin, Harris topped Trump in the survey.

The vice president is up five points in Michigan, 52% to Trump's 47%. However, the margin is razor-thin in Wisconsin, where she only beat him by one point, 50% to 49%.

According to Miringoff, ""of the three so-called blue wall states, Michigan is the one where there is a difference between Harris and Trump.""

SECRET SERVICE TOLD LOCALS THEY WOULD 'TAKE CARE OF' BUILDING USED BY THOMAS CROOKS TO SHOOT TRUMP

""The Michigan vote is being driven by Trump's high negatives with Vance certainly providing no help for the GOP ticket,"" Miringoff added, referencing the 53% of Michigan likely voters that view Trump unfavorably.

Inflation was the top issue for most Pennsylvanians by far, with one-third saying so. Despite it being a campaign priority for Democrats across the country, abortion was the fourth most likely to be a top issue for voters, at just 11%. It was beaten by immigration at 15%, and preserving democracy, which garnered 27%.

The top issue breakdown among Wisconsin voters was similar to that of Pennsylvania, but in Michigan, the issue of preserving Democracy proved to be the most important for the greatest number of voters.

At 30%, the most likely Michigan voters cited it as such. Inflation was close behind, at 29%. Immigration followed at 15%, while abortion received 10%.

In all three states, an at least 20-point gender gap exists between Harris and Trump, with men breaking more often for the former president and women tending to choose Harris.

While the gap exists for both of them, Trump's woes with women seem to loom larger than Harris' issue with men. Trump's gap is particularly wide with women in Michigan, where Harris leads him by the most. In the state, the distance between Harris and Trump among likely women voters is 15 points.

The close polls come as Trump seems to be losing his edge in two critical states, according to the most recent Fox News Power Rankings. Both North Carolina and Georgia, which were once considered Republican strongholds, are now rated toss-ups in the presidential race.

With these presidential race shifts by Fox News Power Rankings, Harris has taken the overall lead in the forecast for the first time."
Fox News Poll: Harris tops Trump by two points,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/official-polls/fox-news-poll-harris-tops-trump-two-points,2024-09-18T22:05:35Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Vice President Kamala Harris edges former President Donald Trump in a head-to-head matchup, as more voters see Harris as the candidate who will help the middle class, and Hispanics and Independents swing in her direction.

The new Fox News national survey finds a 3 percentage-point shift among registered voters in the 2024 presidential contest since mid-August. Trump had a 1-point advantage last month, while Harris is ahead by 2 points today: 50-48%. For reference, in July, Trump was ahead by 1 point over President Joe Biden. Each of those differences falls within the margin of error.

This marks the first time Harris has hit 50% support, and the trial ballot result is identical among both registered and likely voters. That's unsurprising given most Americans who are willing to spend time answering a political survey are also probably going to vote.

Of course, presidential elections are decided by electoral votes from the states, not national vote totals. Hillary Clinton had a 2-point popular vote margin over Trump in 2016 but lost the Electoral College 304-227, while Biden's 4-point popular vote win in 2020 translated to a 306-232 Electoral College victory.

Since the August survey, many events occurred that could affect voter opinion: the Democratic National Convention was held, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump, former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Congresswoman Liz Cheney endorsed Harris, and the candidates faced off in a debate. A second assassination attempt on Trump happened about three-quarters of the way into the new survey.

The biggest change since last month is that Independents and Hispanics have swung Harris' way. Hispanics favored Trump by 6 points in August, but they go for Harris by 12 points today. Independents went for Trump by 8 points last month, but now prefer Harris by 12. It is important to remember that estimates among small subgroups are more volatile and tend to swing more than others, and that applies here.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS CLOSES GAP WITH TRUMP IN SUN BELT STATES

Trump gets his best numbers from voters who regularly attend worship services, non-college White men, rural voters, and men.

Harris' strongest backing comes from Black voters, urban voters, those under age 30, voters 65 and over, college graduates, and women. She's narrowly ahead in union households, a group that Biden won by low double digits. Her numbers also still trail his 2020 pre-election numbers a bit among Blacks and young voters. Democrats are optimistic these groups will ultimately back Harris, but that is certainly an unknown.

Harris holds onto almost all of 2020 Biden voters (93%) and Trump keeps nearly all his 2020 backers as well (94%). Among 2020 non-voters, Harris is up by 3 points, 51-48%.

When looking at results only among counties where the 2020 presidential vote was close (Biden and Trump within 10 points), Trump is ahead 50-48% -- and he holds the same edge across the combined battleground states (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin).

""Our best estimates are that if Trump is within 2 points of Harris nationally then he will likely win in the Electoral College,"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts Fox News surveys with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""These data showing a Trump edge in the key counties and battleground states suggest that's probably right.""

Overall, 72% of Trump supporters say they like his policies and record and another 8% like his character, but 19% say they simply dislike Harris. Views are more mixed among those backing Harris, as 42% like her policies and record, 24% like her character, while 33% say they are backing her because they dislike Trump.

Roughly 7 in 10 Harris and Trump supporters say they are ""extremely"" motivated to vote this year.

And while most of each candidate's supporters feel certain of their vote choice, about 1 voter in 10 is moveable.

Most Republicans (75%) consider themselves a supporter of MAGA, but among non-MAGA Republicans one in five backs Harris over Trump (21%).

More voters think Harris (53%) has the temperament to serve effectively as president than Trump (47%). For Trump, that is a 10-point improvement since 2017 when 37% said he had the right temperament (2017 is the most recent time the question was asked about him, and this is the first time it was asked of Harris).

Harris is seen as the candidate who will help the middle class by a 9-point margin and protect personal rights and freedoms by 6. She also bests Trump by 5 points on ""fighting for people like you"" and ""uniting the country."" There's little difference on who will make the country safe (Trump +3 points), protect free speech (Harris +1), and bring needed change (Harris +3).

Over half of Hispanic voters trust Harris over Trump on each of those measures, hitting nearly 6 in 10 on helping the middle class and fighting for people like you. She also does better among Independents on each except making the country safe, where he has a 3-point edge.

""Harris' advantage over Trump on a variety of personal traits is clearly helping her,"" says Shaw. ""It's a big deal that she's been able to fight to a draw on protecting free speech despite aggressive Republican efforts to highlight the Biden administration's censorship of right-leaning views on social media.""

More than 8 in 10 voters want the next president to make significant changes in the country, including one-third who are looking for ""drastic"" change. Trump is preferred by a wide 31-point margin among those wanting drastic change, but that narrows to just 4 points among the larger group looking for either major or drastic change.

When asked who they trust to handle top issues, voters favor Trump on immigration (+10), the Israel-Hamas war (+7), and the economy (+5). Since first asking this question in March, his advantage on the economy is down 10 points compared to his 15-point lead over Biden and down 8 points on immigration (was +18).

Harris is favored to handle election integrity (+7), health care (+11), abortion (+16), transgender issues (+16), and climate change (+17). It's noteworthy neither candidate has a real advantage on guns or taxes, both traditionally GOP issues.

As has been the case all year, the economy is the most important issue for voters this election. Thirty-nine percent say it is the priority, while fewer than half that number say immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues receive 7% or less.

Twice as many Republicans (50%) as Democrats (25%) say the economy is the top issue and 10 times as many Republicans say immigration (30% vs. 3% Democrats). Democrats are 5 times as likely to say abortion is the most important issue (27% vs. 5% GOP).

Some 70% of voters rate economic conditions negatively. That's an improvement from a record 84% who felt that way in July 2022 (a record Biden) and puts things on par with ratings early in Biden's presidency.

Trump's advantage on the economy comes from voters remembering his presidency as a sunnier time. By a 17-point margin, more say the Trump administration's policies helped rather than hurt them. When thinking about Biden, voters are more likely to say his administration's policies are hurting them by a 24-point margin.

Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have better personal favorability ratings than Trump and his vice-presidential pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. Walz is the only one voters view more favorably than unfavorably (+3 points). While Harris' ratings are net negative by 2 points, her 49% favorable is her highest in over three years. Trump is underwater by 8 points and Vance by 12. About 1 in 6 are unfamiliar with Walz and Vance. Biden's rating is negative by 17 points, 41% favorable vs. 58% unfavorable.

While Democrats and Republicans have largely positive views of their candidates, each individual tested is underwater when it comes to the small subgroup of Independents.

A larger share sees Harris (55%) as being willing to say anything to get elected than feel the same about Trump (48%). Only 43% think Harris says what she believes vs. 51% for Trump.

Abortion is the single most important issue motivating Harris supporters to vote (38%), closely followed by ""stopping the other side from winning"" (36%). For Trump supporters, immigration (49%) and high prices (49%) tie as the single most important factor motivating them.

FOX NEWS POLL: 87% CONSIDER SITUATION AT SOUTHERN BORDER A PROBLEM

Overall, voters say the thing most likely to get them to turn out and vote is high prices (39%), followed by immigration (32%), stopping the other side from winning (29%), abortion (27%), violent crime (26%), the race of the candidates (9%), and the gender of the candidates (7%).

Whoever wins will be on TV a lot for the next four years. When asked what they do when Harris comes on TV, by a 50-48% margin, voters say they turn up the volume rather than change the channel. For Trump, 48% turn it up and 49% change the channel -- almost identical to views in 2016 (46% turn up, 47% change). At that time, 41% said they would turn up the volume for Hillary Clinton and 52% said change the channel.

Conducted September 13-16, 2024 under the joint direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News survey includes interviews with a sample of 1,102 registered voters randomly selected from a national voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (128) and cellphones (699) or completed the survey online after receiving a text (275). Results based on both the full registered voter sample and the subsample of 876 likely voters have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points. Sampling error associated with results among subgroup is higher. In addition to sampling error, question wording and order can influence results. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics of respondents are representative of the registered voter population. Sources for developing weight targets include the American Community Survey, Fox News Voter Analysis, and voter file data."
InnovationRx: FDA Commissioner Talks Healthcare AI,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/innovationrx/2024/09/18/innovationrx-fda-commissioner-talks-healthcare-ai/,2024-09-18T21:17:51Z,"InnovationRx is your weekly digest of healthcare news. To get it in your inbox, subscribe here.

Healthcare AI startups developing products geared towards hospital systems have raised $23.2 billion over the past decade, according to a recent analysis by Flare Capital Partners. The biggest chunk of funding at $11.5 billion has gone to 324 companies working on solutions that impact clinical care. The flow of venture capital money, speed of technology advancement and the resources of Big Tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon and Apple have raised questions about who's really going to drive the healthcare AI regulatory agenda: industry or the feds?

""There is a risk that the system's going to outrun the ability to regulate it, but it will eventually self-correct,"" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf told reporters at an event in Massachusetts last week. ""I can guarantee you Congress is not going to give us 8,000 more positions to regulate the whole thing, and we can't just stop it.""

The FDA has authorized 950 AI and machine-learning-enabled medical devices as of August 7 with the majority of them being radiology software, but the next generation of software medical devices is about to get more complicated. ""It gets very different when you're using AI for decision support for healthcare, and there's a lot more concern there about how it can go akilter,"" said Califf. ""If you basically leave an AI algorithm in place and don't constantly check on it, it can get a lot better, it can get a lot worse.""

This is even more concerning with new advances in generative AI, he said, which is why there needs to be ""an ecosystem where there's shared accountability."" Califf specifically called out the need for health systems to ""step up."" ""I don't know how all this is going to play out with regard to liability,"" said Califf. ""But I think there's a lot of good reason for health systems to be concerned that if they don't step up, they're going to end up holding the bag on the liability with these algorithms.""

Ulrich Otte, Novo Nordisk's senior vice president of finance & operations, said at the Cantor Global Healthcare Conference on Tuesday that it is ""very likely"" Ozempic will be part of cost negotiations organized by the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, adding Novo Nordisk ""is ready for that,"" Bloomberg reported.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services can directly negotiate with pharmaceutical companies over drug prices through President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, and will announce its next group of drugs designated for price negotiations by Feb. 1, 2025.

Sleep Disorders: The FDA cleared the sleep apnea detection function in Apple Watch, which uses the device's sensors to detect breathing obstructions when the user is asleep and alert them to that so they can obtain care.

Brain Implants: Synchron, which has developed a brain implant that allows interaction with computing devices, announced that one of its patients with ALS was able to use his implant to control Amazon Alexa.

RNA Therapies: Korro Bio announced that it's partnering with Novo Nordisk on two rare disease targets for its RNA editing technology. The deal is valued up to $530 million in milestone payments plus royalties on sales of any drugs developed.

Dermatology: The FDA has approved lebrikizumab-lbkz, marketed by Lilly as Ebglyss, for the treatment of moderate to severe dermatitis.

AI For Drug Development: Ginkgo Bioworks announced it's launched a protein large language model built in collaboration with Google Cloud Consulting for customers to use AI insights that utilize Ginkgo's own private datasets.

Antifungal Treatments: F2G, a pharma company developing new antifungal treatments, announced that it has raised a $100 million financing round.

Despite a near decade-long ban on the sale of ""metaphysical services,"" the $6 billion arts and crafts e-commerce platform hosts thousands of spells being sold by its creators. Its public data shows that some of its most popular spell sellers, who boast hundreds of offerings and thousands of largely 5-star reviews, have made hundreds of thousands of dollars on tens of thousands of sales.

Many of these spells promise health benefits -- to cure depression and disease, to immediately enhance fertility, to ""ensure successful surgeries."" But they're also typically marketed with a disclaimer noting they are offered for entertainment purposes only, which provide them legal protection in most states.

""These are scams,"" said Kenny Biddle, the chief investigator for the Center of Inquiry, an organization devoted to defending science. ""They're taking money from people and they're going to keep consumers from looking at science-based medicine, which is harming them.""

Kelly Bishop On Her New Memoir And Life At 80: 'I Love Myself A Little Bit More',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffconway/2024/09/18/kelly-bishop-on-her-new-memoir-and-life-at-80-i-love-myself-a-little-bit-more/,2024-09-18T17:35:55Z,"She remains one of the most celebrated stage, film and television actors of our time - and yet, Kelly Bishop seems far from slowing down. Arguably best known for playing Sheila within the original production of A Chorus Line on Broadway and Jennifer Grey's on-screen mother Marjorie Houseman in Dirty Dancing, the role that continues to receive the most admiration from fans, generation after generation, is undoubtedly her performance as Emily Gilmore, the mother of Lorelai (played by Lauren Graham) and grandmother of Rory (played by Alexis Bledel) on the beloved series, Gilmore Girls.

Running on television for seven seasons, from 2000 through 2007, followed by a reboot miniseries on Netflix in 2016 titled Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, Bishop (who changed her birth name of Carole to stage name Kelly in the midst of her career) is now telling her life story in the form of a newly released memoir from Simon & Schuster, The Third Gilmore Girl.

Just before her 92NY appearance and on-stage conversation in New York City on September 17, which was moderated by her longtime Gilmore Girls co-star Graham, I spoke with Bishop about her new book, her life today and more.

Jeff Conway: You are 80 years young. What is it about your life today that made this feel like the right time for you to tell your story and share it with the world?

Kelly Bishop: Well, I think I was sort of badgered into it enough. A lot of people kept pushing me through the years and I didn't take it very seriously. And then of course, [Gilmore Girls creator] Amy Sherman-Palladino has great influence on my life, she started on me about it. It was around [Covid-19] shutdown time and I thought, Okay, sure. Let's try it. Besides, I'm 80 - it's not that I'm planning to leave anytime soon but I've done a lot by now, so let's play with it. Let's find out.

Conway: Gilmore Girls has such a legacy with fans, but when it comes to being off-screen with both Lauren and Alexis, are you able to keep in touch well and stay in each other's lives?

Bishop: Lauren, yes - absolutely! She's really like a daughter to me. She's one of my favorite people in the world - so Lauren, constantly. I see Amy when we can and I'm extremely fond of her. Alexis, I haven't talked to or seen since we did the reboot of Gilmore Girls. I don't even know which coast she's on or anything about her right now.

Conway: Like you said, we've already had a reboot of Gilmore Girls. Would you be open to having another one?

Bishop: I would be open to it. First of all, it would have to be Amy - Amy Sherman-Palladino would have to start it. I would pretty much follow her anywhere. She's just so solid and she's loyal and she's generous and she's a friend now, but then it would take the rest of us because I don't think you could replace any of us. We'd all have to agree and want to do it and be available to do it. So, I just think it's kind of unlikely - never say never, but it seems unlikely.

Conway: Kelly, where do you hope Emily Gilmore is today? Where would she be? What would she be doing?

Bishop: Well, now that we've seen her sitting by herself in that place, where she seemed fairly content. I give it a little bit of thought - I think she might be traveling the world and meeting new people. I doubt that she has fallen in love, but she might have. You never know!

Conway: So, when people read The Third Gilmore Girl and understand your story, what do you hope both women and men take away from this and bring into their own lives?

Bishop: Well, especially in reading about my relationship with Lee Leonard, my wonderful husband - that's for the men, too - if they could understand the companionship. Yes, we're lovers - we're this, we're that - but when you can become a partner and a buddy and a pal - and laughing. That was one of the best things about him. We didn't do it all the time, but when you get the giggles with someone and you can't stop, it's a great feeling. If you can find a relationship like that, you have to love it. And love yourself and love your person and be happy that you have or had, at least, what you had.

Conway: What was the hardest or most challenging part when you wrote your memoir that you wanted to make sure you got right and was told without any regrets?

Bishop: I wasn't very careful with the book. I'm very forthcoming and I'm a little bit too honest, sometimes. What really happened with the book would be when I talked about the abortion, which I never was going to. It's private, it's personal - it was not something that was horrifying or terrifying - it was nothing that I was ashamed of or felt guilty about, but I just thought that was private until Roe v. Wade and the Supreme Court [overturned it]. I really got angry, concerned about what I call ""my little sisters"" and remembering what I had - just the freedom. I had no intention of having an abortion and I don't think any woman wants one, but the fact that I could explain my experience doing that. I wanted people, particularly people who are offended by it or believe it's wrong - and that's their right - to understand the experience I had. So, I thought that was kind of important for people to hear, especially people who don't have that right anymore. I'm hoping we get it back.

Conway: So, what's next for you, Kelly? Any upcoming acting roles?

Bishop: Well actually, there's a certain show that's in the works now. It's Amy Sherman-Palladino's new show called Étoile, which is about ballet companies, both in Paris and New York. I've done two guest spots on it, so that's the next one! That's the next step now.

Conway: Kelly, what are you enjoying more about life today perhaps in some ways that you didn't in the past? What is it about you at this stage in your life and your activities & choices that you are enjoying now?

Bishop: I think I've forgiven myself a lot - not that I'm ashamed of anything - but I think I'm a little easier on myself. I love myself a little bit more. Pat myself on the back - I'm my friend - my very best friend is me. It's just saying Be grateful, be happy - you've had a really good run here and it's not over. That's it. Who knows?

Conway: What would you say to Emily Gilmore, if you Kelly today could speak to her now? After embodying her over these years on Gilmore Girls, what do you feel she needs to hear?

Bishop: That'd be the first time I ever talked to her - she's not the kind of woman I'd be hanging with.

Conway: You guys would not be buddies?

Bishop: No, no! Oh my goodness, no! Now that she's a little more relaxed, we could talk about nature and the environment. We could talk about widow-hood and we could share that with each other, but this is not a woman I would have ever been friends with, ever.

Conway: So lastly, if you could go back to the Kelly Bishop, before A Chorus Line, before Dirty Dancing, before Gilmore Girls - and could give her advice, a warning or a comforting message after everything you have achieved and accomplished in your life, Kelly, what would you say to yourself then, way before everything?

Bishop: I think what I would've said to myself is keep on doing it. You're on the right track. Don't let anyone stop you and do it as long as you want to. You have this gift - just keep going."
"Arizona election database flags 100,000 voters as possible noncitizens: 'Coding oversight'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/arizona-election-database-flags-100000-voters-possible-noncitizens-coding-oversight,2024-09-18T16:38:30Z,"Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich weighs in on concerns of illegal immigrants voting, the ABC News Presidential Debate and China's influence on American politics.

A ""coding oversight"" in state software is calling into question the citizenship status of 100,000 registered Arizona voters, prompting the state's Democratic secretary of state to insist he will send out ballots to those affected anyway.

""I am unwilling to disenfranchise this many voters by limiting them, suddenly, and with little notice, to a federal-only ballot when none of them had actual notice of or blame for this issue,"" Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said during a Tuesday news conference. ""We inherited this problem, we're on it, and we're going to fix it. It's as simple as that.""

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE ARIZONA SUPREME COURT'S REINSTATEMENT OF AN 1864 NEAR-TOTAL ABORTION BAN

The mistake affects individuals who obtained their driver's licenses before October 1996 and subsequently received duplicates before registering to vote after 2004. Since 2005, Arizona has required proof of U.S. citizenship for voting in state and local elections. Without this proof, these voters would be considered ""federal only"" voters, permitting them to vote solely on presidential and congressional elections rather than the full ballot.

""We don't have any reason to believe that anyone in this gap is not an eligible voter,"" Fontes said. ""We don't have any reason to believe that they're not eligible citizens in spite of the fact that we did find one. All we know is they fit into this category and all of this requires more research.""

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKING IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE SHOW

The Maricopa County Recorder's Office filed an emergency petition requesting the Arizona Supreme Court determine whether voters affected by the data oversight should be required to prove U.S. citizenship before the November election.

Fontes said the error comes as longtime Arizona residents have been voting in elections for years under the impression that they had already provided proof of citizenship. And if the justices determine these individuals are only eligible to vote in federal races, Fontes said there will be an outreach effort to inform them.

NEW POLL INDICATES WHETHER HARRIS OR TRUMP HAS THE EDGE IN THE MOST IMPORTANT BATTLEGROUND

The error comes as Arizona Republicans and a conservative watchdog group have been pushing for stricter voting measures that require proof of U.S. citizenship to participate in state and national elections. Arizona is also a swing state that flipped blue in the 2020 presidential election.

Last month, watchdog group America First Legal sued 15 Arizona counties for allegedly refusing to remove thousands of illegal immigrants from its voter rolls. The lawsuit claims that, as of April 2024, over 35,000 registered voters in Arizona had not provided proof of citizenship, limiting them to voting only in federal races, according to the Arizona Secretary of State's Office.

For their part, U.S. House Republicans are also attempting to attach H.R. 8281, which mandates proof of citizenship for voter registration and was passed in July, to a temporary government funding bill.

Vice President Kamala Harris is continuing her campaign blitz, but a series of 'word salad' interviews have some pundits skeptical if she can sway enough undecided voters. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich warned on ""Hannity"" Tuesday that the new interviews have become a ""joke,"" stressing the ""insanity"" of Harris' position on the Israel-Hamas war.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN PLEDGES MORE MEDIA INTERVIEWS AS VOTERS STILL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HER POLICIES

NEWT GINGRICH: The American people aren't stupid. In the recent interviews, for example, with undecided voters, overwhelmingly they believe she's much more radical than Donald Trump. ... They identify her with Biden and the Biden administration so overwhelmingly, they think that she is the candidate of the past and Trump is a candidate of change, by about three-and-a-half to one. Americans want change in current policies, not continuity. Part of this may be psychological and she may not be capable of uttering a clear, coherent policy position. But whatever the reason, the more we get these word salads, the more obvious it is that she either doesn't know what she's saying or she can't articulate it, or she's trying to hide. These things all hurt her. This interview today did not help her at all. The interview in Philadelphia on the local TV station became a joke. I mean, people thought it was absurd.

If you just watch her, it's the same stuff over and over. The things she's memorized have nothing to do with the real world. And I particularly want to point out, at one point in this interview, she talks about we have to get to a truce in Gaza and release the hostages. Now, there are two problems. The first is she is the vice president. They've had 11 months to get to this truce. 11 months. They've gotten nowhere. There's no reason to believe she'd get anywhere if she was president. Why? Because the founding constitution of Hamas says not a single Jew will remain. And when people chant 'from the river to the sea,' they're chanting genocide fully as much as the Nazi Germans were about Jews in Europe. These college students need to understand that. That's a genocidal quote that Hamas means to either massacre or evict every single Jew in Israel. So her fantasy that somehow she's going to sit down with Hamas, talk reasonably with them, get them to agree to something plausible, this is insanity. This is totally out of touch with the real world.

Vice President Kamala Harris has had numerous 'word salad' interviews during her time in office. Although her campaign has been marked by few media appearances, she had her first solo interview with the national media Tuesday.

Harris spoke to the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) in Philadelphia, about a month after former President Trump spoke to the same group and made waves when he questioned Harris' race.

CBS REPORTER FINDS ONLY 3 HARRIS SUPPORTERS IN 3 NEVADA RESTAURANTS: 'PEOPLE ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT TRUMP'

Beyond race-focused topics, the interview included remarks from Harris about her economic plan, abortion, support for Israel and gun control.

Later, the moderators turned to the second assassination attempt made on Trump's life over the weekend. Harris indicated that she spoke to Trump after the close call to check on him.

Harris was asked a follow-up question about her confidence in the Secret Service to protect her, with Harris responding in the affirmative.

""Not everybody has Secret Service. And there are far too many people in our country right now who are not feeling safe,"" she said. ""I mean, I look at Project 2025, and I look at, you know, the Don't Say Gay laws coming out of Florida. Members of the LGBTQ community don't feel safe right now, immigrants or people with an immigrant background don't feel safe right now. Women don't feel safe right now. And so, yes, I feel safe. I have Secret Service protection, but that doesn't change my perspective on the importance of fighting for the safety of everybody in our country.""

Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are neck-and-neck in one of the most important battleground states of the 2024 presidential election, according to a new poll.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution released on Wednesday the results of its most recent voter survey, which framed the election as a dead heat race with significant margins for fluctuation.

The poll shows approximately 46.9% of voters currently say they would vote for Trump, compared to 44.4% of voters who say they would cast their vote for Harris.

NEW POLL INDICATES WHETHER HARRIS OR TRUMP HAS THE EDGE IN THE MOST IMPORTANT BATTLEGROUND

With a margin of error of 3.1%, this makes the state election a toss-up between the two candidates.

Approximately 7% of voters reported themselves undecided, while the Libertarian Party candidate Chase Oliver and the rest of the third-party nominees polled below 1%.

The AJC poll showed inflation is the single most important issue among Georgia voters this election cycle.

NEW POLL REVEALS THIS POLITICAL EVENT SWAYED ONLY A FRACTION OF HARRIS-TRUMP SUPPORTERS

Inflation is followed by economic concerns and the preservation of democracy, then immigration and abortion policy.

Polling was conducted by the University of Georgia School of Public & International Affairs Survey Research Center between Sept. 9 and Sept. 15. It surveyed 1,000 likely voters across Georgia.

Opinion | What the right and left both get wrong about comparing speech with violence,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-assassination-attempt-ben-shapiro-stochastic-terrorism-rcna171406,2024-09-18T10:55:38Z,"Former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Las Vegas on Friday.Justin Sullivan / Getty Images

On Sunday, there was another apparent attempt on the life of former President Donald Trump. Though the suspect was never close enough to Trump to have him in rifle range and his motive is unclear, Trump said on Fox News that the man ""believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it."" In a fundraising email, the Trump campaign repeated this line and illustrated it with a screenshot of a social media post from the ""Kamala HQ"" account that included a video of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., calling Trump ""extremely dangerous"" and ""a threat to democracy.""

Similarly, his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, posted, ""Kamala Harris has said that 'Democracy is on the line' in her race against President Trump"" and ""[t]he gunman agreed."" Numerous prominent right-wing media figures, such as Ben Shapiro, Tim Pool and Chaya Raichik (of Libs of TikTok fame) have taken up the same talking point. Shapiro, for example, blamed those who claim Trump ""is Hitler without the mustache"" for inspiring the suspect. And Trump himself doubled down on the point in a long X post, writing, ""Because of this Communist Left Rhetoric, the bullets are flying, and it will only get worse!""

What no one seems to notice is that, in effect, Trump, Vance and their media surrogates are echoing the claims previously made by many on the left about ""stochastic terrorism"" and the relationship between speech and violence.

The theory of ""stochastic terrorism"" holds that people who engage in overheated or irresponsible rhetoric are, in effect, inciting violence -- even if they never actually advocate violence. Even though it's ""stochastic"" (i.e., random, insofar as any particular act of violence can't be predicted), it's still supposed to count as a form of de facto ""terrorism"" because it increases the general likelihood of such acts' taking place.

David Corn, for example, called Trump a ""stochastic terrorist"" in Mother Jones magazine. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., alleged during an appearance on ""The Breakfast Club"" radio show that death threats against her increased when Tucker Carlson talked about her on his show, and she said that ""this is what stochastic terrorism is.""

Certainly, it's wildly hypocritical for the right to suddenly embrace this equation of overheated speech with violence the moment it becomes convenient for it, after years of dismissing such charges out of hand. None of the figures I just listed have ever considered themselves responsible for hate crimes against trans people or immigrants, for example, despite their many years of harsh rhetoric about these groups.

A host and columnist for the conservative media empire The Blaze challenged his readers to ""[t]ry to imagine a world in which Barack Obama survived two assassination attempts and the media didn't publicly destroy the reputation of everyone who issued even the most mild criticism of the man."" In reality, while no assassin ever came close enough to fire a shot at Obama, there were numerous foiled attempts on Obama's life comparable to the incident on Sunday. And if we're going to play this game, it's worth pointing out that plenty of right-wingers essentially called Obama ""Hitler without the mustache"" while he was president. Obama-as-Hitler signs were a common sight at early tea party rallies and protests outside town halls to discuss health care reform.

That having been said, it's also inconsistent for many of my fellow leftists and progressives to suddenly dismiss the same ideas about speech and violence that far too many of them have themselves been eager to promote in the past.

Part of my problem with the theory of ""stochastic terrorism"" has always been that no one anywhere seems to apply it consistently. Those who blame the other team's ""overheated"" rhetoric for political violence tend to turn around and defend equally white-hot rhetoric with which they are sympathetic and become appropriately skeptical about the cause-and-effect connections between that rhetoric and violence.

Much of the debate about whether a given piece of rhetoric is ""overheated"" boils down to whether the underlying facts merit the heat. For example, if Trump really is a threat to democracy, it seems absurd to say that Bernie Sanders shouldn't say so because some people who agree with him might act on that belief in ways he himself would never condone.

Or, for example, I wrote numerous articles during the life of late Secretary of State Henry Kissinger calling him a war criminal and a ""monster"" responsible for the deaths of vast numbers of innocent people from Vietnam and Cambodia (where he and Richard Nixon orchestrated brutal bombing campaigns) to Chile (where they backed the overthrow of democratically elected socialist president Salvador Allende). At the time I was writing these articles, Kissinger was still given fawning treatment by many mainstream media outlets. Well, if someone who'd read my articles had shot up a television studio where Kissinger was being interviewed, would I therefore have been responsible?

How you answer that question will probably boil down to whether you think my condemnation of Kissinger was correct on the merits of the case. I've never heard anyone say, ""What you're saying right now is completely true, but it would be stochastic terrorism to say it out loud.""

In general, the problem with focusing too much on the hypocrisy of your ideological enemies is that it can be an excuse to never have to clarify your own principles. It's much easier to point out other people's inconsistencies than to spell out what you yourself believe.

So here's what I believe: I'm a democratic socialist. That means the core of my politics is about seeking to overcome the domination of society by wealthy interests. I want to empower the working class. Well, you can't believe that ordinary working-class people are capable of governing themselves while also believing that it's too dangerous to expose them to the ""wrong"" kinds of speech lest they draw conclusions with which even the speaker would disagree. As such, I care very deeply about free speech.

I'm also ""conservative"" enough to believe in individual moral responsibility.

If Bernie says Trump is a threat to democracy but he also frequently condemns political violence of all kinds, he isn't therefore responsible for people who agree with him on the first part but disagree on the second. In fact, he could well argue any threat to democracy posed by Trump's movement would be increased if he were killed, which his followers would certainly blame on a vast shadowy ""them.""

And, for that matter, if right-wingers say abortion is murder but disapprove of individual citizens' engaging in ""vigilantism"" against abortion doctors, I passionately disagree with the first part, but I don't blame them for the actions of anyone who disagrees with them about the second.

In both cases, arguing about whether the position is inflammatory is mostly just a distraction from arguing about whether it's true. If we make it easier to censor people engaging in ""stochastic terrorism,"" then the determination about what counts will simply be made by whichever faction happens to hold power at any given time. If you aren't confident that your faction will eternally hold power, that should give you pause.

We're far better off making a robust distinction between speech and violence. The more we blur that line, the harder it will be to defend robust norms about free speech. Let's not go down that road."
Opinion | Georgia's 'pro-life' abortion ban literally killed a woman  --  and she won't be the last,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/amber-thurman-death-georgia-abortion-ban-rcna171301,2024-09-18T10:55:34Z,"If the Christian right had not had its way at the Supreme Court, Amber Nicole Thurman would be alive today. She would have been able to get the medical care she needed in 2022. She would have lived to pursue her career ambitions and see her little boy grow up. Instead, the 28-year-old died a completely avoidable death in a Georgia hospital because the doctors treating her were terrified of committing a felony under the state's abortion ban.

The true crime is that Thurman's life was cut short because of ideologues who for 50 years trumpeted ""biblical"" values as they sought to make women pay for unwanted pregnancies, even with their lives.

A new report in ProPublica reveals the details of Thurman's excruciating final days and death, which a state medical committee recently deemed ""preventable."" Thurman learned she was pregnant with twins in the summer of 2022. Mother to a young son, she was hoping to attend nursing school and ""quickly decided she needed to preserve her newfound stability,"" her best friend, Ricaria Baker, told ProPublica.

But three years earlier, Georgia's Republican-controlled state Legislature passed a law prohibiting abortion at six weeks. After the Supreme Court's overturned Roe v. Wade's constitutional right to abortion in June 2022, the ban went into effect. Georgia became one of the first places to close the door on virtually all abortions, and many other GOP-run states soon followed. The law -- with the dystopian title of Living Infants and Fairness Equality Act, or ""LIFE Act"" -- does has a vague exception to protect the life of the mother. But most exceptions in these laws, reports the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization supporting reproductive rights, ""are designed to be unworkable, containing vague and contradictory language and imposing cumbersome requirements.""

When Georgia's ban went into effect, Thurman's pregnancy had just passed six weeks. According to ProPublica, Thurman scheduled a dilation and curettage in North Carolina, which still permitted abortion. But when traffic delayed her travel, the clinic -- ""inundated with women from other states where bans had taken effect"" -- could not keep her appointment slot. A clinic employee gave her legally obtained abortion pills to use instead. (""Her pregnancy was well within the standard of care for that treatment,"" ProPublica reports.)

Unfortunately, upon her return home, Thurman suffered a highly unusual complication, with increasing pain and heavy bleeding. The North Carolina clinic would have performed a D&C as a free follow-up, but it was too far away. Instead, Thurman went to a nearby hospital. Citing medical records, ProPublica says that ""doctors noted a foul odor during a pelvic exam, and an ultrasound showed possible tissue in her uterus.""

Usually, these signs of sepsis would be addressed with a D&C to remove the fetal tissue. But the LIFE Act prohibits ""administering any instrument ... with the purpose of terminating a pregnancy."" That made performing this normally commonplace and safe procedure a possible felony for the doctors. Hospital staff delayed the procedure for nearly a day, as Thurman's condition worsened. Finally, hours after her organs began failing, she was taken in for surgery -- during which she died. Her mother recalled her last words: ""Promise me you'll take care of my son.""

It was not Thurman's legal use of abortion pills that caused her to die. Deaths stemming from the use of abortion pills are exceedingly rare. ""Out of nearly 6 million women who've taken mifepristone in the U.S. since 2000, 32 deaths were reported to the FDA through 2022, regardless of whether the drug played a role,"" ProPublica reports. ""Of those, 11 patients developed sepsis."" The cause of Amber Thurman's death was the Republican-led criminalization of healthcare when she developed a condition that demanded immediate lifesaving attention. The LIFE Act killed Amber Thurman.

The LIFE Act is what happens when single-minded religious zealots seize political power. Anti-abortion activists, claiming to have a more pure and literal interpretation of Christianity than everyone else, and claiming to have a divine directive to make American law conform to it, insisted on this. They insisted on ending Roe v. Wade, chipping away at it for five decades until former President Donald Trump made their dream come true. He delivered on his promise of a right-wing Supreme Court majority. That majority, in turn, unleashed the sadistic laws that endanger the lives of women in dozens of states, restricting their rights to make their own decisions and get lifesaving care.

When Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed the bill into law, he said, ""Georgia is a state that values life."" He added, ""We stand up for those who are unable to speak for themselves."" But when Amber Thurman lay in a hospital bed, none of these ""pro-life"" heroes were there to treat her as a person with even a shred of dignity, much less any rights.

Trump knows that these kinds of stories -- and Thurman's is far from the only one -- are bad news for his campaign. So now he's gaslighting the public once again about the fallout from the Dobbs decision, his critical role in the criminalization of abortion, and his Project 2025 allies' plans for another term. At last week's presidential debate, he brazenly lied that all sides ""wanted this issue to be brought back to the states, where the people could vote.""

But Americans didn't ask for the ""issue to be brought back to the states"" so that Christian nationalist legislators could dictate the most intimate decisions of their lives. Amber Thurman didn't ask for a lecture on life from her governor. She only wanted to live."
Harris tells NABJ she expects to 'earn' the Black vote this November,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-speaks-national-association-black-journalists-philly,2024-09-17T22:40:06Z,"Former White House senior counselor Kellyanne Conway and former Pennsylvania Congressman Patrick Murphy debate Kamala Harris' platform and treatment of the media on 'The Story.'

Vice President Harris spoke to the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) in Philadelphia on Tuesday, about a month after former President Trump spoke to the same group and made waves when he questioned Harris' race.

The event marks Harris' first solo interview with the national media. It was held at NPR's Philadelphia station, WHYY, and was moderated by three Black journalists, including Eugene Daniels of Politico Playbook, WHYY's Tonya Mosely and TheGrio's Gerren Keith Gaynor. The stop marked Harris' 13th visit to the Keystone State this year.

During his July interview with the NABJ in Chicago, Trump drummed up a firestorm of criticism when he said, ""I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So, I don't know. Is she Indian or Black?""

Harris was not asked to respond to those remarks from Trump on Tuesday, but she did slam the former president for what the moderators described as racially charged rhetoric about Haitian migrants in a small Ohio town eating people's pets.

OHIO AG EYES 'CREATIVE' PATH TO GET 'MISHANDLED' SPRINGFIELD MIGRANT CRISIS IN FRONT OF FEDERAL JUDGE

""It's harmful, and it's hateful and grounded in some age-old stuff that we should not have the tolerance for,"" Harris said of the rumors being circulated by Trump. ""We've got to say that you cannot be entrusted with standing behind the seal of the president of the United States of America, engaging in that hateful rhetoric that, as usual, is designed to divide us as a country.""

When asked by one of the moderators if this case of ""irredeemable racism"" deserved some sort of federal response to help the community heal, Harris sidestepped the question.

Meanwhile, Harris also sidestepped whether she would sign or veto a bill establishing a federal committee to study reparations for the Black community. Harris said she ""thinks"" a federal reparations commission will be taken up by Congress and, therefore, she won't need to use her power as president to study the matter at the federal level.

Harris also spoke about the Black vote on Tuesday and took a far different approach than President Biden did in 2020.

""If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't Black,"" Biden said while campaigning for the presidency in 2020. Harris, however, said Tuesday that she expects to have to ""earn"" the Black vote, particularly Black men. ""I think it's very important to not operate from the assumption that Black men are in anybody's pocket.""

Beyond race-focused topics, the interview included remarks from Harris about her economic plan, abortion, support for Israel - which she said has the right to defend itself - and gun control.

""The United Sates of America absolutely has a role"" in aiding Israel's right to self-determination, Harris said during Tuesday's interview.

On gun control, Harris was resolute that she and her running mate, Democrat Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are both gun owners - something that came as news to voters during last week's presidential debate. ""We're not trying to take anybody's guns away from them, but we do need an assault weapons ban,"" she said. Previously, as a presidential candidate in 2019, Harris said she thought a mandatory gun buyback program run by the federal government was ""a good idea."" However, Harris' campaign has said she no longer supports such a program.

Harris added that she does support universal background checks for those seeking to legally obtain a firearm. When one of the moderators pointed out that most handguns are purchased illegally, Harris pointed to the need to eradicate ""gun show loophole[s].""

""We need to address each entry point in the issue,"" Harris insisted.

KAMALA HARRIS WANTS TO HAVE IT BOTH WAYS ON CRIME. NO WONDER AMERICANS DON'T FEEL SAFE

Later, the moderators turned to the second assassination attempt made on Trump's life over the weekend. Harris indicated that she spoke to Trump after the close call to check on him.

""I am in this election, in this race, for many reasons, including to fight for our democracy. And in a democracy, there is no place for political violence,"" Harris said. ""We can and should have healthy debates and discussion and disagreements but not resort to violence to resolve those issues.""

Harris was asked a follow-up question about her confidence in the Secret Service to protect her, with Harris responding in the affirmative.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., expressed fear over former President Trump's rhetoric following him surviving two assassination attempts in the past two months.

Former White House press secretary Jen Psaki and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., expressed fear about former President Trump's rhetoric following the two assassination attempts he's survived in just over two months.

Warren appeared on MSNBC's ""Inside With Jen Psaki"" on Monday to discuss Trump telling his supporters to ""fight"" after nearly being assassinated twice, the second incident happening just a day prior to their conversation.

""And you hear this 'fight, fight, fight' chant, which you heard Trump do right after the shooting in Butler. We saw that once again on TRUTH Social,"" the host said to Warren, adding, ""That does scare me a little bit.""

NY TIMES REPORTER SAYS TRUMP 'INSPIRES' POLITICAL VIOLENCE AFTER SECOND ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

Psaki was referring to Trump's immediate reaction to the first attempt against his life at a rally in Pennsylvania in July, where he immediately jumped to his feet after being shot in the ear and told his supporters to ""fight, fight, fight.""

The day after the second attempt on his life, Trump posted a campaign ad to his TRUTH Social account captioned with his Pennsylvania rallying cry, ""FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT!!!!!""

Warren agreed with Psaki that Trump's rhetoric was scary. Before sharing her feelings about his behavior, she did acknowledge that she has used the term ""fight"" as political rhetoric, but insisted that hers was not an allusion to violence, whereas Trump's could be.

""So, I have to say - look, I'm a fighter. I have written books that talk about fighting,"" she began, referencing her two books, ""You Don't Get What You Don't Fight For,"" and ""This Fight is Our Fight.""

She continued, ""But I mean [fight] with words. That's all that this means. In a democracy, we need to be able to go back and forth with our words. We need to be able to disagree and to put those issues in front of the American people. That's how we inform people about our positions. That's how we get back in and make a decision that the majority of Americans want. And it's only by talking about those.""

HILLARY CLINTON SAYS TRUMP POSES 'DANGER TO OUR COUNTRY AND THE WORLD' AFTER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

She then argued that Trump doesn't get the same benefit of the doubt, stating, ""But that is very, very different from a man who incited an insurrection, a man who refers to his political rivals as vermin, a man who has said just in recent days that he wants to lock up the people who don't agree with him.""

""That is a very, very different kind of approach not just to politics, but to democracy, and one that ultimately does put our democracy at risk, puts us all at risk,"" the progressive lawmaker added.

Warren went on to say she wants both Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris to be ""fully protected,"" but insisted that people should not forget about Trump's policies amid the attempts on his life.

""We need to keep this open so people talk and people are able to make a decision. Do you want a candidate who's embracing a nationwide abortion ban? He wants to lie about it, wants to pretend, because he knows it's unpopular, but won't say that, no, he would -- he would veto an abortion ban? No, he's not going to say that,"" she said.

Warren added, ""He's still going to wink and nod at his extremist groups. Or do you want someone who just flatly puts it out there and says, give me a chance, as Kamala Harris does, and I will sign protection for access to abortion and IVF into law?"""
"Claire McCaskill: This time around, it's Trump who has the enthusiasm problem",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-kamala-harris-enthusiasm-gap-poll-abortion-rcna171495,2024-09-17T19:32:35Z,"Since Donald Trump entered the political scene, he's owned the enthusiasm gap. But, according to a new survey from renowned pollster Ann Selzer, that's no longer the case. The Des Moines Register poll found that in Iowa, a state Trump won comfortably in both 2016 and 2020, 80% of Vice President Kamala Harris' supporters say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about her as their choice for president. That's compared to 74% of Trump's supporters.

In 2016 and 2020, I don't think it was that there was a lack of enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden. But you had Trump burst onto the scene, giving the finger to the man, to the government, to the system, to the ""swamp"" -- to whatever you want to call it. That kind of negative messaging created such a burst of enthusiasm among a bunch of folks who felt like nobody got them, that nobody was taking care of them. They wanted to give the finger to everybody in power, too.

But this time around, the burst of enthusiasm is on the Democratic side. People see Harris as positive and uplifting. She's talking about the problems that matter to the American people.

One of the issues driving up enthusiasm for Harris is abortion. Many women feel that Trump has diminished their pain. But it's not just women who find this issue motivating, it's women and the men who love them, the men who care about their daughters and their nieces and their grandchildren.

Nobody is making up that women are bleeding out in bathrooms and hospital parking lots. Nobody is making up that women are not able to get the medical care they need when a pregnancy has gone terribly wrong through no fault of their own.

All of that creates a kind of visceral pain that makes women and men want to rise up together and say enough is enough. That's where a lot of this enthusiasm for Harris is coming from."

A number of the biggest names in Hollywood came out in support of Biden before he dropped out of the race, before turning their support to Harris. Olivia Rodrigo, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris by sharing a video of a speech the vice president gave promising to ""stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans."" Major Democratic fundraiser George Clooney, who used a New York Times essay to call for Biden to drop out of the race, lent his support to Harris and Barbra Streisand said she would support Harris because of her vow to fight for reproductive rights. Musician John Legend, who performed at the Democratic National Convention in 2024, posted he was ""so ready"" for a Harris presidency. Director Spike Lee, ""West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin, director Ken Burns and Star Wars actor Mark Hamill threw their support behind Harris, along with actresses Rosie O'Donnell and Jamie Lee Curtis. Robert De Niro, who narrated an advertisement for the Biden campaign, praised the president's ""selfless patriotism"" in a statement that did not mention Harris but said ""there is nothing more important for our country than defeating Donald Trump at the ballot box."" British pop artist Charli XCX brought Harris into the Gen Z fold by tweeting ""kamala IS brat,"" an endorsement that was met by Harris' team changing the background photo on her X account to the ""brat"" green color and using the same font used on Charli XCX's album of the same name. Rapper Cardi B, who in May said she wouldn't be endorsing Biden, tweeted ""AHAHAHAHA LETS GOOOOO I TOLD YALLL KAMALA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 2024 candidate...."" Pop musician Kesha said she plans to support Harris in November and, when asked how she felt about Vance, responded ""f -- - that man."" Beyoncé has not made a public endorsement but did give the Harris campaign permission to use her song ""Freedom"" in a video of her first official visit to her campaign's headquarters, a rare approval from the superstar musician. Beyoncé's mom and businesswoman Tina Knowles endorsed Harris with an Instagram post. Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle and former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have also thrown their support behind Harris. Former President Jimmy Carter, 99, reportedly told his son last week he was trying to make it to his 100th birthday so he could cast his vote for Kamala Harris. ""Sex in the City"" actress and former New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon threw her support behind Harris and her Vice Presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, in a post that read: ""I'm Walzing on air!"" Billionaire Mark Cuban, who previously said he was committed to voting for Biden, has also supported Harris and endorsed Walz as her running mate, calling him someone who ""can sit at the kitchen table and make you feel like you have know him forever."" Actor Tony Goldwyn, Republican political commentator Ana Navarro, comedian Mindy Kaling and actress Kerry Washington each supported the Harris-Walz campaign by hosting one evening of the Democratic National Convention. Nick Offerman, Jane Fonda, Ben Stiller, Kathy Griffin, John Stamos, Ed Helms, Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz were among those who appeared on a ""Comics for Harris"" virtual rally via Zoom, which reportedly raised close to half a million dollars for the Harris campaign. Over Labor Day weekend, a fundraiser for the Democratic ticket in Southampton, New York was hosted by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and fashion designer Tory Burch, among others. Actors Matt Damon and Lin-Manuel Miranda will attend fundraiser in New York City in September -- for which tickets are listed at $25,000 per person -- to support the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket, Bloomberg reported.

UFC President and personality Dana White called Trump the ""toughest, most resilient human being."" Rapper and reality TV star Amber Rose gave a speech at the RNC in support of Trump. Country music stars Chris Janson and Jason Aldean also appeared at the convention. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy in January said voting for Trump over Biden was a ""no-brainer."" Public-facing billionaires like Elon Musk and Steve Wynn have also supported the former president. Actress Rosanne Barr, a longtime conservative supporter of Trump, clapped back at Cuban's endorsement of the Harris-Walz ticket and called the VP pick ""another reason Harris is a disaster."" Rapper Azealia Banks last year said she would vote for Donald Trump in Novemebr and she appeared at a rally in Florida this summer. Actor Jon Voight has defended Trump on multiple occasions. 50 Cent's 2023 song ""Many Men (Wish Death)"" started trending online after the assassination attempt of Trump last month. The rapper responded by putting Trump's face on the cover of his ""Get Rich or Die Tryin.'"" While it's hard to call the response an official endorsement, he did appear to support the president in 2020 before apparently backtracking. Other celebrities who have supported Trump in the past, but not outright endorsed him yet this election season, include Lil Wayne and ""Happy Days"" star Scott Baio.

Notable names missing from the list of public supporters include billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who called the decision ""too important to rush."""
ABC's David Muir sees newscast ratings decline after controversial debate performance,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/abcs-david-muir-sees-newscast-ratings-decline-after-controversial-debate-performance,2024-09-17T15:23:27Z,"ABC's David Muir told ""Live with Kelly and Mark"" about his debate prep and why he dismissed the post-debate ""noise"" about the candidates and moderators.

ABC's ""World News Tonight"" anchor David Muir may have driven away some viewers after the Disney-owned network irked conservatives during last week's presidential debate.

Muir and co-moderator Linsey Davis fact-checked former President Trump five times without ever correcting Vice President Kamala Harris, prompting a plethora of conservatives to suggest the debate wasn't fair. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America even called for a correction after Davis made an abortion claim made during the debate during one of the fact-checks on Trump that the group said was ""100% inaccurate.""

Muir's ""World News Tonight"" averaged 6.7 million viewers on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, the three episodes following the debate, after averaging 7.6 million in 2024 leading up to the debate.

The 12% drop in viewers for ""World News Tonight"" is more significant than slight declines ""CBS Evening News"" and ""NBC Nightly News"" saw when comparing the three episodes following ABC's debate to the year-to-date totals, although Muir's newscast remained the No. 1 broadcast evening newscast.

ABC'S DAVID MUIR DISMISSES POST-DEBATE 'NOISE' ABOUT MODERATORS

While it's unclear if Trump supporters have tuned out ABC's newscast on the heels of the debate, the former president has blasted it as ""one-sided."" Trump told Fox News that he believed Harris should have been fact-checked on a variety of claims.

""Every one of them should have been questioned by David Muir, who I've lost a lot of respect for. Everyone's lost respect for him,"" Trump said last week.

""It was so ... one-sided,"" he continued. ""It was one against three.""

Davis admitted in a post-debate interview that her fact-checking of Trump was influenced by the CNN debate that went disastrously for President Biden in June.

""People were concerned that statements were allowed to just hang and not [be] disputed by the candidate Biden, at the time, or the moderators,"" Davis told the Los Angeles Times last week.

ABC HOST PRESSES KAMALA HARRIS ALLY ON VP'S FALSE CLAIM ABOUT ACTIVE US TROOPS: 'WHY WOULD SHE SAY THAT?'

On Sunday, ABC News' Martha Raddatz even noted on Sunday that Harris was wrong when she said there is ""not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world.""

""Our fact-checkers found that to be false,"" Raddatz said.

""There are currently 900 U.S. military personnel in Syria, 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq. All have been under regular threat from drones and missiles for months. We also have action in the Red Sea,"" Raddatz continued. ""Also, every single day, the Navy SEALs, Delta Forces special operators can be part of any sort of deadly raid.""

Muir and Davis failed to correct Harris in front of the debate's massive audience of nearly 70 million people.

""All of the noise that you hear afterward about you know, 'Which candidate won the debate, did the moderators win or lose?'"" Muir told the audience on ABC's ""Live With Kelly and Mark."" ""That's just noise. You all know that. The most important thing to remember is you all have the power.""

Muir said he felt it was the ""duty"" of him and Davis to discuss issues Americans cared about, citing their questions about the economy, the border crisis, reproductive rights, Afghanistan and the peaceful transfer of power.

""These are all really important issues, the issues of our time, really, and I always say as a moderator, what the candidates decide to do with that time - you can ask the questions, but they'll answer with whatever they choose to answer with, and you have to be ready for whatever might come your way, even the most unexpected of moments,"" he said, to chuckling from the audience.

ABC NEWS REBUKED BY PRO-LIFE GROUP, ASKED FOR CORRECTION OF ABORTION CLAIM BY DEBATE MODERATOR

Muir said he disappeared at the end of the summer because of the weight of the debate and the amount of time necessary to prepare for the event. He praised the ""extraordinary"" team that helped him get ready.

Muir and Davis were criticized by conservatives for fact-checking Trump during the debate five separate times while never fact-checking Vice President Kamala Harris once. Trump, whose uneven performance at the debate received criticism, fretted afterward that it was ""three on one.""

While conservatives fumed, liberal media pundits widely praised Muir and Davis, contrasting them with the more passive performance of CNN's Dana Bash and Jake Tapper when they moderated the debate in June between Trump and President Biden. Biden's frail, dismal showing at the CNN debate led directly to him exiting the 2024 race and being replaced by Harris.

Davis, whose ""fact-check"" of Trump on an abortion claim went viral, referenced CNN in a post-debate interview.

Ali Velshi: The danger behind Donald Trump and the GOP's abortion lies,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/donald-trump-fact-check-late-term-abortion-rcna171352,2024-09-17T13:08:14Z,"For decades, the anti-abortion movement has been inviting the violence of extremists among their ranks by equating abortion to murder.

This is an adapted excerpt from the Sept. 14 episode of ""Velshi.""

Before Donald Trump took office, he promised to deliver a Supreme Court that would overturn Roe v. Wade -- and that's exactly what he did. Now he's running for president against the dystopian backdrop of forced birth and denial of care he helped create.

The difficulty of running with that record is evident in the increasing desperation of the lies he tells about abortion and women's health care. By now, you have probably heard Trump and his acolytes talk about what they're calling ""post-birth abortion."" They claim that Vice President Kamala Harris and other Democrats want to allow, as Trump puts it, the execution of babies.

This lie, which sounds so insane and fringe that it's hard to imagine anyone could believe it, was repeated by Trump at last week's debate:

""Under Roe v. Wade, you could do abortions in the seventh month, the eighth month, the ninth month, and probably after birth. ... The governor of Virginia said, 'We put the baby aside, and then we determine what we want to do with the baby. ... In other words, we'll execute the baby.'""

What Trump described there is murder, not abortion. The post-birth abortion lie is a deliberate attempt to equate actual abortion -- which is health care -- to murder, as a means to stigmatize women who need abortions and doctors who provide them.

But because you might encounter someone in your own life who believes this dangerous lie, let's get into the details. Though he did not say his name, Trump was referencing Ralph Northam, the former Democratic governor of Virginia. In 2019, then-Gov. Northam did a radio interview in which he was asked a question about proposed legislation that would have loosened restrictions on late-term abortions. Northam gave a long and somewhat circuitous answer that touched on the tragic circumstances surrounding the very rare cases of late-term abortions:

""When we talk about third-trimester abortions, that decision is made with the mother and with the consent of the physician, more than one physician. And it's done in cases where there may be severe deformities, there may be a fetus that's nonviable.""

Then, in the same answer, Northam also talked about what would happen if a baby was born with a fatal diagnosis:

""In this particular example, if the mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen: The infant would be delivered, the infant would be kept comfortable, the infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired. And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.""

As Northam's office explained at the time, he was speaking of two different circumstances, one in which a catastrophic diagnosis or circumstance would cause a patient to need a late-term abortion -- which is extremely rare and done, as Northam notes, only with approval from more than one physician.

The other hypothetical case he addressed was if a patient goes into labor and delivers a baby with a fatal diagnosis. In that case, Northam explained the heartbreaking circumstances such families would face, including the very difficult decisions around keeping their baby comfortable in their final moments or taking extraordinary measures to prolong their life.

The anti-abortion movement took the interview, twisted it and ran -- using it to claim that Democrats were promoting abortion after birth, aka the murder of newborns, and now, five years later, the same lie is cropping up on the Republican campaign trail.

But let's look at the facts: A full-term pregnancy lasts between 39 and 40 weeks. By definition, a late-term or late-in-pregnancy abortion occurs at or after 21 weeks of pregnancy, and they are extremely rare. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2021, fewer than 1% of all abortions occurred at or after 21 weeks, 80.8% occurred at or before 9 weeks of pregnancy, and just 5.7% occurred between 14 and 20 weeks of pregnancy, which is during the second trimester. Zero abortions are happening after birth.

It sounds bizarre to even have to say that, but in fact we have been building to this moment for a long time. The anti-abortion movement has been painting women who have abortions and physicians who perform them as murderers for decades.

According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a ""common harassment tactic was to find and publicize personal information about doctors in the form of 'Wanted' posters. Other times, they would send letters to a doctor's neighbors, telling them, 'There is a killer in your neighborhood.'""

For the last four decades, anti-abortion activists have been performing what they call ""rescues."" This has involved everything from blocking entrances to abortion clinics and medical centers to harassing patients, doctors and workers, and even invading the clinics. It has often involved carrying signs and calling patients and staff who enter clinics murderers.

The 1980s saw a huge wave of clinic bombings. In 1984, attackers set fire or bombed 29 clinics across the country. According to the National Abortion Federation, since 1977, there have been 42 bombings and 200 cases of arson at clinics across the U.S. And, yes, over the years the anti-abortion movement did cross the threshold into straight-up murder. At least 11 people have been killed by the militant wing of the anti-abortion movement since 1977, according to the group.

Two of the most well-known cases are the murders of Dr. George Tiller and Dr. David Gunn. In the '90s and early 2000s, Tiller was a frequent target of violence because he was one of a few physicians at the time who were performing late-in-pregnancy abortions. His clinic was bombed in 1986. In 1993, he was shot but survived. In 2009, a man named Scott Roeder walked into Tiller's church, during service, where Tiller was serving as an usher and shot him in the head, killing him. Roeder said he did it to protect babies from being murdered.

The first known abortion provider to be assassinated was Dr. David Gunn in 1993. The gunman was a member of the anti-abortion group Rescue America. He shot Gunn in the back three times as he entered his clinic in Pensacola, Florida. In response, Rescue America released a statement saying while Gunn's murder was ""unfortunate, the fact is that a number of mothers would have been put at risk today and over a dozen babies would have died at his hands.""

For decades, the anti-abortion movement has been inviting the violence of extremists among their ranks by equating abortion to murder. The rhetoric that Trump and others on the right are now spewing fits seamlessly into this tired, yet dangerous, strategy.

The post-birth abortion lie was designed to justify the brutal regime of forced birth under which millions of American women are now suffering. It's being used as a lazy but dangerous strategy to turn our attention away from the tragedies that have sprung up in the wake of the end of Roe: the rush of stories of women being denied care, left to bleed and suffer, forced to flee their states and saddled with wholly preventable life-altering medical conditions. Tragedies all because of the anti-abortion crackdown ushered in by Trump."
"Abortion providers  --  and patients  --  are on the move, as state laws keep shifting",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/09/17/nx-s1-5114359/abortion-rates-guttmacher-planned-parenthood-ban-states,2024-09-17T13:02:37Z,"Anti-abortion protesters march past the Planned Parenthood in Bloomington, Ind., after the Rally for Life march in January 2023.

Soon after a series of state laws left a Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbia, Mo., unable to provide abortions in 2018, it shipped some of its equipment to states where abortion remained accessible.

Recovery chairs, surgical equipment and lighting from the Missouri clinic -- all expensive and perfectly good -- could still be useful to other health centers run by the same affiliate, Planned Parenthood Great Plains, in its three other states. Much of it went to Oklahoma, where the organization was expanding, CEO Emily Wales said.

When Oklahoma banned abortion a few years later, it was time for that equipment to move again. Some likely ended up in Kansas, Wales said, where her group has opened two new clinics within just over two years because abortion access there is protected in the state constitution -- and demand is soaring.

Her Kansas clinics regularly see patients from Texas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas and even Louisiana, as Kansas is now the nearest place to get a legal abortion for many people in the Southern United States.

Like the shuffling of equipment, America's abortion patients are traveling around the nation to navigate the patchwork of laws created by the Supreme Court's Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision, which left policies on abortion to the states.

Since that ruling, 14 states have enacted bans with few exceptions, while other states have limited access. But states that do not have an abortion ban in place have seen an 11% increase in clinician-provided abortions since 2020, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a national nonprofit that supports abortion rights. Over 170,000 people traveled out of their own state to receive abortion care in 2023, according to the institute.

Not all of the increase in abortions comes from interstate travel. Telehealth has made medication abortions easier to obtain without traveling. The number of self-managed abortions, including those done with the medication mifepristone, has risen.

And Guttmacher data scientist Isaac Maddow-Zimet said the majority of the overall abortion increase in recent years came from in-state residents in places without total bans, as resources expanded to improve access.

""That speaks, in a lot of ways, to the way in which abortion access really wasn't perfect pre-Dobbs,"" Maddow-Zimet said. ""There were a lot of obstacles to getting care, and one of the biggest ones was cost.""

Last year, the estimated number of abortions provided in the U.S. rose to over 1 million, the highest number in a decade, according to the institute.

Still, abortion opponents hailed an estimated drop in the procedure in the 14 states with near-total bans.

""It's encouraging that pro-life states continue to show massive declines in their in-state abortion totals, with a drop of over 200,000 abortions since Dobbs,"" Kelsey Pritchard, a spokesperson for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, wrote in a statement.

Organizations in states where abortion remains legal feel the ripples of every new ban almost instantly. One Planned Parenthood affiliate with a clinic in southern Illinois, for example, reported a roughly 10% increase in call volume in the two weeks following the enactment of Florida's six-week abortion ban in May. And an Illinois-based abortion fund, Midwest Access Coalition, experienced a similar pattern the day the Dobbs decision was announced in June 2022.

""Our hotline was insane,"" said Alison Dreith, the coalition's director of strategic partnerships.

People didn't know what the decision meant for their ability to access abortion, Dreith said, including whether already scheduled appointments would still happen. The coalition helps people travel for abortions throughout 12 Midwestern states, four of which now have total bans with few exceptions.

After serving 800 people in 2021, the Midwest Access Coalition went on to help 1,620 in 2022 and 1,795 in 2023. Some of that increase can be attributed to the natural growth of the organization, which is only about a decade old, Dreith said, but it's also a testament to its work. It pays for any mode of transportation that will get clients to a clinic, including partnering with another Illinois nonprofit with volunteer pilots who fly patients across state lines on private flights to get abortions.

""We also book and pay for hotel rooms,"" Dreith said. ""We give cash for food and for child care.""

The National Network of Abortion Funds, a coalition of groups that offer logistical and financial assistance to people seeking abortions, said that donations increased after the Dobbs decision and that its members reported a 39% increase in requests for help in the following year. They financially supported 102,855 people that year, including both in-state and out-of-state patients, but they have also seen a ""staggering drop off"" in donations since then.

Increased awareness about the options for abortion care, spurred on by an increase in news stories about abortion since the Dobbs decision, may have fueled the rise in abortions overall, Maddow-Zimet said.

Both sides now await the next round of policy decisions on abortion, which voters will make in November. Ballot initiatives in at least 10 states could enshrine abortion rights, expanding access to abortions, including in two states with comprehensive bans.

""Lives will be lost with the elimination of laws that protect more than 52,000 unborn children annually,"" wrote Pritchard, of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, citing an analysis on the group's website.

In the meantime, Wales said her clinics in Kansas don't have enough appointments to accommodate everyone who reaches out about scheduling an abortion. In the early days after the Dobbs decision, Wales estimated, only 20% of people who called the clinic were able to schedule an abortion appointment.

The organization has expanded and renovated its facilities across the state, including in Wichita, Overland Park and Kansas City, Kansas. Its newest clinic opened in August in Pittsburg, just 30 miles from Oklahoma. But even with all that extra capacity, Wales said her group still expects to be able to schedule only just over 50% of people who inquire.

""We've done what we can to increase appointments,"" Wales said. ""But it hasn't replaced what were many states providing care to their local communities."""
Opinion | Trump and Vance think anti-immigrant hate is good politics. They're mistaken.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-trump-haitian-immigrants-springfield-rcna171292,2024-09-16T23:51:16Z,"Over the weekend, Ohio senator and vice presidential nominee JD Vance made a stunning and unintentional admission: He's a liar.

For more than a week, Vance, former President Donald Trump and many of their allies have spread falsehoods about the town of Springfield, Ohio, and its Haitian immigrant community. Most infamously, Trump last week repeated the now oft-debunked claim that Haitian migrants in the town are stealing and eating pet dogs and cats.

But on CNN, Vance gave away the GOP's game. ""If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do."" He claimed that the ""American media"" ignored the ""problems in Springfield"" associated with the impact of Haitian migration on public services in the town until ""Donald Trump and I started talking about cat memes."" Vance tried to explain away his verbal slip, but he couldn't avoid the truth: ""creating stories"" is another way to say ""making stuff up.""

The consequences for such lies are both obvious and frightening. A steady stream of bomb threats has forced Springfield officials to temporarily shutter government offices, hospitals, elementary and middle schools, and two local colleges. On Monday, a local festival celebrating ""diversity, arts and culture,"" was also canceled -- a fitting monument to Trump and Vance's racist attacks.

Most insidious is the effect on the local Haitian community, which is increasingly under siege. As Vance's rhetoric has made clear, his concern is not the Haitians' immigration status: They are in America legally. Rather, the issue is their skin color and background of those moving to Springfield. As the vice presidential nominee argued on X this weekend, the real question about Springfield is, ""Should we drop 20,000 people from a radically different culture in a small Ohio town in a matter of a few years?""

Never mind that, like so many immigrant communities before them, the Haitian community in Springfield has more than acclimated itself to their new homes. Their ""positive influences"" on the town have been noted by everyone from Springfield's Republican mayor and local business leaders to Ohio's Republican governor, who has decried the Trump/Vance-led attacks as ""garbage.""

But would Vance make such proclamations if the 20,000 people were, say, from Norway? Would he make the same argument about urban gentrification and thousands of white yuppies moving into a predominately Black or Hispanic community?

When Vance claims that ""what is happening in Springfield is coming to every town and city in this country if Kamala Harris' open border policies are allowed to continue,"" his intent is not difficult to discern. His incessant focus on ""illegal immigration"" and problems ""at the border"" is nothing more than a racist dog whistle to MAGA voters. And it's one that minority communities have seen play out in America for centuries.

It's also quite purposeful. As Marc Caputo reported Sunday for the Bulwark, ""Privately, Trump aides think it's a net plus,"" writes Caputo. ""The longer the discussion is about migrants, the less it is about tougher topics for them. 'We talk about abortion; we lose. We talk about immigration, we win,' said one Trump adviser.""

""But what about the blowback from spreading an incendiary story for which there is no evidence?"" Caputo asks. ""'We'll take the hit to prove the bigger point,'"" the adviser responds. NBC News reports that Trump is planning to visit Springfield ""soon,"" which surely will fan the flames even more.

Immigration is indeed an effective policy issue for Trump. In the most recent ABC/Ipsos poll, he polled 10 points better on it than Harris. But he also polls seven points better than his Democratic rival on the economy and inflation. Not only are those issues the top concerns for undecided voters, but they have the added benefit of not utilizing unabashedly racist sentiments. To side with Trump and Vance because of concerns over the economy is asking a heckuva lot less of voters than siding with them over naked immigrant bashing. The former doesn't require a cleansing shower after wading in the political sewer.

The last nine years of American politics have shown us that Trump and his minions only sing from one anti-immigrant hymnal. Since 2016, immigrant-bashing has been the issue that most consistently unites GOP candidates -- and it's one that has taken on an even darker hue this cycle, with routine talk of immigrant ""invasions"" into the U.S.

There is, however, less evidence that it's an effective political strategy. In 2018, Trump-supported candidates regularly used xenophobic attack lines in their campaigns. This was the election of ""migrant caravans"" and ""bad hombres."" It didn't work. Trump trotted out the usual dog whistles in 2020. So did Republican candidates in 2022. Neither led to political success. Maybe 2024 will be different, but the evidence is against xenophobic broadsides against immigrants as a route to political success.

In fact, the constant attacks on immigrants and the rising tensions in Springfield and around the country could be a net negative for Trump. The unending negativity that now defines the Trump campaign, the constant feeling of chaos and fatigue around the former president has a profound effect. The demagoguing over Springfield may energize MAGA world but, for the anti-Trump wing of the electorate, it's a reminder of everything loathsome about the former president. Unfortunately, for Trump and now Vance, shame has always been an emotion in short supply, so there's little reason to expect the racist, immigration bashing to stop. There's also not much reason to think it'll work."
House Dem leader rails 'we must stop' MAGA amid news of 2nd Trump assassination attempt,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-dems-leader-rails-we-must-stop-maga-amid-news-2nd-trump-assassination-attempt,2024-09-16T17:46:38Z,"The Free Press reporter Tanya Lukyanova joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss her prior interaction with alleged gunman Ryan Wesley Routh after he was arrested for the attempted assassination of former President Trump.

As headlines spread like wildfire that former President Donald Trump was likely targeted in a second assassination attempt, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries posted a message to X demanding supporters ""stop"" the ""extreme MAGA Republicans.""

""Extreme MAGA Republicans are the party of a national abortion ban and Trump's Project 2025,"" Jeffries posted to X at 3:30 p.m. Sunday afternoon.

""We must stop them.""

The statement was posted well after news broke that Trump was safe following what authorities described as a likely assassination attempt on his life.

TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SUSPECT LAUGHS, SMILES DURING FIRST COURT APPEARANCE IN FLORIDA

Authorities in West Palm Beach, Florida, received calls of shots fired at Trump International Golf Club at about 1:30 p.m. Sunday, with the Trump campaign issuing a statement after 2 p.m. that the 45th president was ""safe following gunshots in his vicinity.""

About two hours after Jeffries posted about stopping ""extreme MAGA Republicans,"" he condemned the attack against Trump, posting at 5:33 p.m., ""Political violence has no place in a democratic society.""

Trump spoke to Fox Digital on Monday morning and blamed rhetoric from Democrats, namely President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, for the attack on his life.

""[The suspect] believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it,"" Trump said in the interview. ""Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country -- both from the inside and out.""

""It is called the enemy from within. They are the real threat,"" Trump added.

WITNESS SAW TRUMP ASSASSINATION SUSPECT FLEE BUSHES, TOOK PHOTO OF GETAWAY CAR

Trump went on to say that his ABC News debate last week was ""so biased and so out of control,"" citing Harris' comments claiming Trump supports Project 2025 and a national abortion ban. Jeffries also cited Project 2025 and the alleged plans for a national abortion ban in his X post Sunday.

""Harris was the one lying about Project 2025, she lied about abortion, she lied about everything,"" Trump said. ""She was correcting me.""

Project 2025 was authored by conservative think tank, the Heritage Foundation, with Trump repeatedly saying on the campaign trail that he had no role in crafting what was billed as a blueprint for a future Republican administration. Trump has also repeatedly said that he would not impose a national abortion ban if re-elected, doubling down that abortion issues should be left to individual states.

Authorities confirmed that the suspect arrested Sunday at the golf club is 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh, a Hawaiian resident who has posted prolifically on social media about Trump and politics, Fox Digital found.

Routh currently resides in Hawaii after spending the majority of his life in North Carolina, where he worked in construction, including owning a company called United Roofing, a background check conducted by Fox Digital shows.

The suspect's alleged social media accounts on Sunday afternoon showed he repeatedly posted about Trump, the war in Ukraine, the 2020 election and other world events.

TRUMP BLAMES BIDEN-HARRIS 'RHETORIC' FOR LATEST ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, SAYS HE WILL 'SAVE THE COUNTRY'

The account also weighed in on Trump's assassination attempt in July, calling on Vice President Kamala Harris to visit those injured at the Pennsylvania Trump rally, because ""Trump will never do anything for them.""

""You and Biden should visit the injured people in the hospital from the Trump rally and attend the funeral of the murdered fireman. Trump will never do anything for them....show the world what compassion and humanity is all about,"" he said in a reply message to Harris' account on July 17.

In another X post published on April 22, Routh appeared to quote a commonly used phrase by the Harris campaign, declaring, ""DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose.""

""Your campaign should be called something like KADAF. Keep America democratic and free. Trumps should be MASA ...make Americans slaves again master. DEMOCRACY is on the ballot and we cannot lose. We cannot afford to fail. The world is counting on us to show the way,"" the account posted ahead of Biden dropping out of the race in July and Harris ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket.

During Trump's interview with Fox Digital, he cited rhetoric from Democrats describing him as a ""threat to democracy"" as a likely motivation for the attacks against him in recent weeks. He argued that while Democrats such as Biden and Harris call him a ""threat to democracy,"" they described themselves as ""unity"" leaders.

RYAN ROUTH, ARMED MAN ARRESTED AT TRUMP GOLF COURSE, POSTED PROLIFICALLY ABOUT TRUMP, POLITICS

""They are the opposite,"" Trump said. ""These are people that want to destroy our country.""

The X account appearing to belong to Routh also repeatedly issued messages related to the war in Ukraine, posting to X that he was ready to fly to Ukraine to fight Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""I am flying to Ukraine to fight. We need to launch a media campaign to encourage every human around the globe to meet in Ukraine and join in the fight. We need hundreds of thousands of civilians to make the cost of war high for putin and a flood of fighters,"" he posted on Feb. 17, 2022.

Following repeated messages declaring his intention to fight on behalf of Ukraine, he posted in April that he was in Kyiv.

""I am here in kyiv and want to use Independence Park to create a tent city of all the foreigners here in support to get thousands more foreign civilians to come and support Ukraine,"" the account posted.

Routh also has a lengthy rap sheet stretching out decades, most notably in North Carolina, where he racked up dozens of arrests for car infractions, such as driving without insurance, driving without a license and driving with an expired registration.

In 2002, Routh made local headlines when he was arrested at his roofing company's office following a three-hour standoff with police, the Greensboro News & Record reported at the time. Routh had been pulled over by police during a traffic stop and put his hand on a gun during the stop, sparking him to drive to United Roofing and barricade himself in the building. He was ultimately arrested without incident.

Fast-forward to Sunday afternoon, Routh was arrested after allegedly pointing a rifle through a chain-link fence, aiming it toward where Trump was playing golf, authorities said.

Routh fled the scene in his car but was arrested on I-95.

He appeared in federal court Monday morning wearing shackles and jail scrubs. He was seen laughing and smiling ahead of his first court appearance.

He faces charges of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. Authorities said he could be hit with additional charges.

Shortly following the attempt, Trump reassured supporters he was ""safe and well,"" while vowing to ""never surrender.""

""There were gunshots in my vicinity but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!"" he posted in a campaign message. ""Nothing will slow me down. I will NEVER SURRENDER.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Jeffries' office regarding his X post and Trump's comments blaming Democratic rhetoric for the attempt Sunday but did not immediately receive a reply."
Donald Trump Posted 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT' -- What Did He Expect?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/09/16/donald-trump-posted-i-hate-taylor-swift-what-did-he-expect/,2024-09-16T17:17:50Z,"Probably more than a few men in their late 70s would proudly say they're ""Swifties"" -- as in fans of pop singer Taylor Swift. However, former President Donald Trump isn't one of them, not by a long shot.

In a post on Truth Social on Sunday, the former president wrote, ""I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,"" without going into any specific reason, although her endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris last week likely is what spurred Trump to make his view clear.

The question, however, is why he waited several days to make the statement, but also what -- if anything -- he expected he sought to get from airing his personal opinion about the recent Grammy Award winner. Last Wednesday, he told Fox & Friends that he ""was not a Taylor Swift fan,"" and expected that she would endorse Harris.

""She's a very liberal person. She seems to always endorse a Democrat and she'll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace,"" Trump said, suggesting that her public endorsement might drive away Conservative voters.

That fact may be true as there have been some on social media who have said they're through with the pop singer, but the story seems to have passed. Now Trump's post may have only served to energize the masses of Swifties -- but likely not in his favor!

""Trump clearly understands her influence -- and his 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT' post could be interpreted as a defensive or one-dimensional move aimed at influencing his followers. As their leader, he perceives himself as having complete control over his cohort,"" explained technology industry analyst Susan Schreiner of C4 Trends.

""With Taylor Swift, Trump has met his greatest match yet,"" Schreiner suggested. ""Beyond a fight, he's picking a battle with a Titan.""

It is still possible that as a former TV celebrity Trump may think his reach is as great as Ms. Swift's, and he may feel to see that her appeal reaches potential segments of the electorate that both campaigns are eager to attract -- namely women, young people, and most importantly, people who don't pay attention to politics very much.

""If anything, Trump has underscored why he's not the candidate for Swifties,"" Schreiner suggested. ""Trump has drawn attention to his policies and statements that could motivate people to vote -- against him. Many of Swift's fans are already outraged by the loss of access to abortion care and other rights following Dobbs. They also understand that implementing Project 2025 could mean women being demoted to second-class citizens.""

Although Taylor Swift hasn't responded to Trump's post, many of her fans have, and #ILoveTaylorSwift has been trending on Monday morning -- again highlighting her reach.

""Taylor Swift's influence on social media is undeniable. Especially with younger generations who are newer voters,"" said celebrity business strategist, stylist, and creator Nina Vargas. ""Her call for voter registration has worked and had an influence, and that's the true power of a celebrity with cultural reach.""

Trump may have the comments before the second assassination attempt on his life and may have been an attempt to change the conversation away from the claims he made about Haitian migrants eating pets last week -- in other words trading one controversy for another.

Yet, if that is the case, Vargas said it would be a strange play to make.

""Why would Donald Trump respond by saying 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT' on social media because it's not about liking or disliking her, it's about understanding that this kind of response, in front of her massive following, could have the opposite effect from what he is hoping for,"" Vargas continued.

Fans who may not have even been leaning politically one way or another could now take this as a reason to vote against him regardless of how they feel about Harris.

""Instead of turning people against Swift and thereby Harris, he has sparked a backlash. She's expanding the electorate in ways that could be negative to Trump,"" said Schreiner.

""End of the day, this is a prime example of how perception can turn into reality in today's world and why our actions or reactions really do matter,"" added Vargas. ""If anything, candidates should be focusing on how to respond thoughtfully to cultural shifts like this, not just emotionally."""
Disney honcho Dana Walden dismisses notion her close friendship with Kamala Harris affected debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/disney-honcho-dana-walden-dismisses-notion-her-close-friendship-kamala-harris-affected-debate,2024-09-16T16:59:58Z,"Former President Trump speaks about the first presidential debate against Vice President Kamala Harris from Rancho Palos, California.

Disney honcho Dana Walden on Sunday dismissed concerns that her close friendship with Vice President Kamala Harris resulted in a biased ABC Presidential Debate.

Walden, a senior Disney executive whose portfolio includes ABC News, is one of Harris' ""extraordinary friends,"" according to a report in the New York Times. Walden and Harris have known each other since 1994, while their husbands, Matt Walden and Doug Emhoff, have known each other since the 1980s.

There has been a harsh spotlight on ABC on the heels of last week's debate, when former President Trump was repeatedly fact-checked while Harris was not. When Walden attended the Emmy Awards, a reporter from Variety asked her about attacks from the ""far-right"" who have said her close friendship with Harris affected the debate.

""You know I really don't want to dignify it with much of a response,"" Walden said.

DAVID MUIR'S ABC NEWSCAST WAS 100% POSITIVE ABOUT HARRIS, 93% NEGATIVE ABOUT TRUMP AHEAD OF DEBATE: STUDY

""I have the highest regard for everyone at ABC News. It's the most professional organization, the most top-notch journalists,"" she continued. ""It doesn't really dignify much of a response.""

Moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis fact-checked Trump five times without ever correcting Harris. Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt wrote that the ""journalistic reputations of Muir and Davis are the most scarred by the fiasco,"" but ""the damage will extend to both the ABC and Disney brands"" because the moderators failed to ask more critical questions of Harris.

Media Research Center founder Brent Bozell said on ""The Brent Bozell Show"" podcast that Harris had a clear advantage that should have been apparent after his researchers found that ABC's evening newscast has been more ""positive towards Harris and the most hostile to Trump"" compared to evening newscasts on NBC and CBS.

""Whoever recommended that [Trump] do that debate on ABC should be fired. It was about the worst decision that could have been made,"" Bozell said on Wednesday when discussing what he feels are the Disney-owned network's biases.

CNN PANEL CLASHES AFTER DEMOCRATIC GUEST SUGGESTS DEBATE MODERATORS WERE 'HARSHER' ON TRUMP

Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America sent a letter to ABC News president Almin Karamehmedovic, along with Muir and Davis, urging the network to issue a correction about a ""100% inaccurate"" abortion claim made during the debate during one of the fact-checks on Trump.

Walden has donated to dozens of Democrats and has contributed to Harris' political campaigns since at least 2003.

Last month, Walden was described as a ""Hollywood winner"" in the rapid ascension of Harris to de facto Democratic nominee, according to a Puck report. Harris has extensive ties to the entertainment community, but few ""go as far back with Harris as Walden does, nor do they enjoy the perch and purview Walden does at Disney,"" the report said.

ABC previously told the New York Times that Walden, who is Disney's highest-ranking television executive, does not weigh in on editorial decisions.

BILL MAHER MAKES THIS BOLD 2024 PREDICTION AFTER TRUMP-HARRIS DEBATE

Walden is among the insider candidates who could take over as the next Disney CEO when Bob Iger's contract expires in 2026, according to reports, and her coziness with a possible future president likely doesn't hurt her stock.

"Trump blames Biden-Harris 'rhetoric' for latest assassination attempt, says he will 'save the country'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-blames-biden-harris-rhetoric-latest-assassination-attempt-says-he-save-country,2024-09-16T14:19:32Z,"EXCLUSIVE: Former President Trump said President Biden and Vice President Harris' ""rhetoric"" is what is causing him to be ""shot at,"" following the second assassination attempt against him since July, while telling Fox News Digital that the suspected gunman ""acted"" on ""highly inflammatory language"" of Democrats.

Trump spoke exclusively with Fox News Digital Monday morning, just a day after he was rushed off of the golf course at Trump International in West Palm Beach, Fla., after the Secret Service discovered a gunman in the bushes.

WHO IS RYAN WESLEY ROUTH: ALLEGED GUNMAN AT TRUMP GOLF CLUB

The suspected gunman, Ryan Wesley Routh, had an AK-47 style rifle pointing through the chain-link fence out toward the green; a go-pro camera; and two backpacks. He ran from the scene but was pulled over and arrested on I-95.

Authorities are treating the episode as an apparent assassination attempt against Trump.

Trump was safe following the second assassination attempt against him since July.

""He believed the rhetoric of Biden and Harris, and he acted on it,"" Trump said of the gunman in an interview with Fox News Digital. ""Their rhetoric is causing me to be shot at, when I am the one who is going to save the country, and they are the ones that are destroying the country -- both from the inside and out.""

Trump pointed to Biden and Harris' past comments casting Trump as a ""threat to democracy,"" while telling Americans they are ""unity"" leaders.

""They are the opposite,"" Trump said. ""These are people that want to destroy our country.""

He added: ""It is called the enemy from within. They are the real threat.""

A background check on the name given by officials, Ryan Wesley Routh, revealed that he currently lives in Hawaii and has faced dozens of run-ins with police, stretching back to at least the 1990s.

Routh previously echoed Biden and Harris' anti-Trump comments, that ""Democracy is on the ballot"" on his social media pages this year, and that Democrats ""cannot lose.""

TRUMP SAFE AFTER 'GUNSHOTS IN HIS VICINITY,' CAMPAIGN SAYS

Routh posted about politics often and donated to only Democrat candidates and causes.

""They do it with a combination of rhetoric and lawsuits they wrap me up in,"" Trump said. ""These are the things that dangerous fools, like the shooter, listen to -- that is the rhetoric they listen to, and the same with the first one.""

Democrats, meanwhile, have repeatedly blamed Trump for raising the temperature and have accused him of being a ""threat to democracy,"" particularly due to his handling of the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.

The White House, Harris' campaign, and the office of Minnesota Gov. Time Walz, Harris' running mate, did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment.

Trump also said Biden and Harris' policies are ""destroying"" the country ""by allowing millions of very dangerous migrants to pour into it and destroying our country and cities.""

""On the outside, we are weak and feeble and not respected by the world anymore,"" Trump said.

Meanwhile, reflecting back on the debate against Harris last week, Trump slammed the media.

""The media is made up of fools that will spew [Democrats'] garbage and spew their sick philosophies and will protect them at all costs, and they can't believe they get away with it,"" Trump said. ""Democrats are totally protected by the media.""

Trump said the debate on ABC News last week ""was so biased and so out of control.""

""Harris was the one lying about Project 2025, she lied about abortion, she lied about everything,"" Trump said. ""She was correcting me.""

""It was three against one,"" he said. ""I was surprised at David Muir. I thought he was a high-quality person, but he is just a sleeze like the rest of them.""

But with just 50 days until Election Day, Trump warned Democrats to watch their rhetoric.

""They use highly inflammatory language,"" he said. ""I can use it too -- far better than they can -- but I don't."""
Forbes Daily: Murdoch Family Feud Will Decide Future Of Fox News,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2024/09/16/forbes-daily-murdoch-family-feud-will-decide-future-of-fox-news/,2024-09-16T12:11:02Z,"The Murdoch family is headed to court this week over the future of billionaire Rupert Murdoch's media empire.

Murdoch's new succession plan would pass control of his businesses solely to Lachlan Murdoch, his eldest son and the chairman of News Corp -- the parent firm of the print empire that includes the Wall Street Journal and New York Post -- and executive chairman and CEO of the Fox Corporation. But three of Murdoch's other children, who were set to have equal voting shares under the original plan, are fighting back.

According to one document obtained by the New York Times, Murdoch may be motivated by a desire to maintain the conservative leanings of his outlets like Fox News -- which some of his children do not share.

Former President Donald Trump is safe after shots were fired Sunday in what the FBI described as an ""attempted assassination"" at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida. The suspected shooter is now in custody, and was about 300 to 500 yards away from Trump when he was spotted and fired upon by the Secret Service.

Consumer sentiment improved this month but remains historically weak, according to the University of Michigan's monthly survey. The lingering low sentiment coincides with elevated inflation during President Joe Biden's time in office, though economists say presidential actions have far less of an impact on the economy than public perception may suggest.

Adobe's stock fell 8% Friday after the company reported a lower forecast for its upcoming quarter than expected, bringing the software firm's shares down into the negative for the year. The firm actually beat estimates for earnings and revenue, but nearly $23 billion was erased from its market capitalization amid Friday's slide.

The S&P 500 closed out its best week of the year Friday, fresh off of its worst week of 2024, as the market walks a tightrope. Friday's rally was driven by hope that the Federal Reserve will take the market-friendly approach of an aggressive monetary policy shift when it meets this week.

Billionaire venture capitalist Walter Kortschak, who owns the land where Jurassic Park was filmed, made his estimated $1.6 billion fortune thanks to his tenure at growth equity firm Summit Partners and, later, personal early-stage investments that paid off big. In an interview with Forbes, he said the fear of missing out is the biggest risk investors face today, and cautioned against getting swept up in the mass hysteria around a sector.

A rally in shares of software giant Oracle briefly propelled its chairman Larry Ellison to the second spot on Forbes' ranking of the wealthiest people on the planet on Friday, with his net worth reaching as high as $208.4 billion. But Amazon founder and chairman Jeff Bezos retook the No. 2 spot as the day went on, and Oracle stock's gains pared.

Disney and DirecTV reached a crucial deal Saturday, bringing back college football broadcasts for 11.3 million DirecTV customers who lost access to Disney networks like ABC and ESPN after the cable provider and Disney battled over a distribution agreement at the start of the month. The new distribution deal will also make Disney streaming services and ESPN's upcoming standalone streaming service available in select DirecTV packages.

TOPLINE Etsy, the $6 billion arts and crafts e-commerce platform, hosts thousands of spells promising everything from untold wealth to cures for chronic depression, despite a near decade-long ban on the sale of ""metaphysical services.""

Sellers on the platform offer spells like ""Extreme Millionaire Lotto Spell"" ($13.13), ""Best Death Spell"" ($60.87), ""14th Dimensional Master Energy"" ($365.01), ""Wonderful Holiday With Family Spell"" ($19.01"") and ""Child Athlete Spell"" ($11.95). There are also ""Social Media Fame Spells"" ($2.88) and, predictably, too many penis enhancement spells to bother counting.

Etsy does not break out witchcraft and wizardry in its quarterly financials. But interviews with people who claim to practice it and some rough math suggest the platform has facilitated millions of dollars in spell sales. Etsy's own public data shows that some of its most popular spell sellers have made hundreds of thousands of dollars on tens of thousands of sales.

To say that Etsy, a company with a market capitalization of over $6 billion, has historically struggled to moderate its website is an understatement. It has been caught hosting deepfake pornography of female celebrities, counterfeit and mass-produced goods and AI-generated tripe. Earlier this year, following a widely publicized ban on sales of sex toys, Forbes found a proliferation of them two weeks later.

Most spells marketed on Etsy feature a disclaimer noting they are offered for entertainment purposes only, which provide them legal protection in most states, Charles McCrary, a professor of religious studies at Eckerd College in Florida, told Forbes. But it's hard not to view such spells as deceptions -- especially when Etsy exempts them from the platform's mediation system.

WHY IT MATTERS ""Etsy, a company with a market capitalization of over $6 billion, and a company that has always been known for selling artisanal handicrafts, has been found to have facilitated the sale of millions of dollars worth of purported 'spells,'"" says Forbes senior writer Cyrus Farivar. ""These include magical offerings to enhance body parts, but also to seek wealth and power. One expert told Forbes that these are 'modern day snake oil,' and can be financially harmful to those that purchase these items.""

""There is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world, the first time this century,"" Harris claimed during the debate.

""Our fact-checkers found that to be false,"" Raddatz said during the interview on Sunday. ""There are currently 900 U.S. military personnel in Syria, 2,500 U.S. troops in Iraq.

Raddatz jumped in again and repeated what Harris had said.

""You say she demonstrated her ability to be commander in chief, but did she not know about these people in Syria and Iraq? Why would she say that?"" Raddatz said.

Healey argued that Donald Trump ""stands with Vladimir Putin.""

Oregon DMV admits to wrongfully registering hundreds of non-citizens to vote,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/oregon-dmv-admits-wrongfully-registering-hundreds-non-citizens-vote,2024-09-15T18:23:41Z,"Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has more on efforts to ensure the integrity of the 2024 presidential election on 'Fox News Live.'

The Oregon DMV admitted on Friday to wrongfully registering at least 306 non-citizens to vote in U.S. elections.

The DMV says the wrongful registrations have occurred since 2021 and were the result of a program that automatically registered anyone who obtained a driver's license or state ID. State officials say they expect to find more wrongful registrations ahead of Election Day.

Oregon has allowed non-citizens to obtain diver's licenses since 2019. Of the 306 people identified, just two have cast ballots in an election since 2021.

Oregon Secretary of State LaVonne Griffin-Valade says the 306 people ""will be notified by mail that they will not receive a ballot unless they demonstrate that they are eligible to vote.""

HARRIS REPEATS DEBUNKED CLAIM TRUMP WANTS TO 'BAN' ABORTION

Griffin-Valade defended the state's automatic voter registration program despite the lapse. Gov. Tina Kotek also argued the discovery will ""not impact"" the 2024 election.

""While this error is regrettable, the secretary and the Elections Division stand by automatic voter registration and its many benefits,"" Griffin-Valade said.

""The error in data entry which may have affected the voter eligibility of some Oregonian's voter registration was discovered because the Oregon DMV and the secretary of state were doing their due diligence ahead of the 2024 election,"" Kotek said in another statement. ""My office will continue to closely monitor the situation. This situation will not impact the 2024 election in any way.""

Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, who has led a purge of illegal voter registration in Ohio throughout the year, told Fox News Digital that so-called automatic voter registration is a problem across the country.

""This is why we have resisted so-called automatic voter registration in Ohio. We have multiple really convenient ways to register in Ohio, but there are people who should not be registered, like non-citizens, and there are people who simply don't want to be registered,"" LaRose said.

He also highlighted the obstacles state offices face when trying to verify voter rolls. LaRose says Ohio first checks against DMV data, but it often can't determine a registrant's status.

The second check is the federal Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database, a list of non-citizen data maintained by the Department of Homeland Security. States have to pay $1.50 for each query of the database, however, and finding the information required to properly search the data is cumbersome, LaRose says.

LaRose added that he and other election officials are seeking access to more DHS data that would allow for a more accurate audit of voter rolls, but his requests have so far been refused.

When pressed by Welker again whether Trump would veto a federal abortion ban, Vance responded: ""I think that I've learned my lesson on speaking for the president before he and I have actually talked about an issue.""

Abortion is expected to be a key issue in November's election, with Democrats arguing Republicans would ban or heavily restrict access to the procedure if they gain power. Many Republicans -- including Trump and Vance -- have pushed back and insisted the issue should be largely decided by the states following the overturning of Roe v. Wade, which ensured a national right to abortion access. Trump has said recently he is not in favor of a national ban, but he refused to say if he would contest Congress if it approved such a ban twice during Tuesday's debate. The former president has been inconsistent on his views of abortion throughout his career: In 1999 he was ""very pro-choice"" despite hating the ""concept of abortion,"" in 2016 he suggested women who get abortions should be punished in some way and, while in office, Trump supported a 20-week federal abortion ban. Vance has described himself as pro-life and believes states should make their own policies, but as recently as 2022 he has indicated he would support making the procedure illegal federally.

18. That's how many states have a ban on all or most abortions, according to The Washington Post. Two states have had bans blocked by courts, and another three states have bans in places after 12 or 15 weeks."

Speaking to Fox News' Pete Hegseth on Sunday, she spelled out a handful of reasons behind her exit, including the alleged ""lawfare"" against former President Trump and Democrats' ""denial of school opportunities"" for low-income children.

In a recent New York Post op-ed, Romero also spelled out her issues with Vice President Kamala Harris, slamming her tenure as California attorney general as ""unimpressive"" and adding that her ""manipulated rise"" aligns with the Democratic Party's ""giant leap toward authoritarianism and censorship.""

""The Democratic Party has just lurched to the extreme left. It's been captured by [what] many call the Hamas caucus of the Democratic Party, in order to win a swing state.""

She continued, ""Under Donald Trump and the Republican Party, it really has become, I believe, an agenda for an America that we all want to see for ourselves and our children and our future. Keeping us safe, including having a secure border."""
Opinion | A Kamala Harris win could save conservatism,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-win-save-conservatism-rcna170533,2024-09-15T12:42:49Z,"The vice president and her policies are terrible. But I want her to win, so that a post-Trump conservative party can be reborn.

To MAGA-era conservatives, there is no crime more unforgivable than for a traditional, Reagan-era Republican to endorse voting for Vice President Kamala Harris. You won't find any such endorsement here: I care less about whom you're voting for than you should care about for whom I'm casting my ballot.

Of course Harris can't keep the price of food and clothing down by setting up a ridiculous ""price gouging"" law (and if she could, why hasn't the Biden/Harris administration done so yet?). Obviously giving $25,000 to first-time homebuyers would increase demand and drive up housing prices. And taxing unrealized gains would be economically catastrophic, bureaucratically unworkable and almost certainly unconstitutional.

But it's not like Republicans have spent the past nine years defending the bedrock principles of free-market conservatism. Slowly but surely, most of them have contorted themselves into endorsing whatever former President Donald Trump thinks ""economic populism"" is.

That's why, with less than two months until the election, there should be an honest discussion of whether a Trump loss would be best in the long term for ""conservatism"" as traditionally understood. In a sense, a Harris presidency could serve as a type of political chemotherapy: a poisonous injection meant to eradicate a tumor in order to keep a major political party alive.

What happens to traditional free-market, low-tax conservatism if Trump were to win in November? One could argue the classical liberalism horse has already jumped the fence, never to return. But if America gives up and returns Trump to the presidency, ""conservatism"" as many of us understood it for the past half-century would simply become a museum piece, gathering dust on library shelves.

A second Trump term would mean that for the next four years, conservatism would continue its descent into whatever Trump decides it is based on the last person to whom he spoke. He would continue to insist tariffs are paid by other countries, when in fact economists are nearly unanimous in their belief those costs are borne by American consumers. Trump would continue to fumble the abortion issue, dragging Republicans into becoming the maybe-pro-life-sometimes-when-it's-politically-convenient party. And he would destroy faith in American elections, but conveniently only in states in which he loses.

Further, if Trump were to win, the right would have permanently ceded any moral ground to the left.

Over the past four decades, the GOP's defense of morality, family values and patriotism was the sinew that held the party together. These were fundamental ties that held together religious conservatives, libertarian-leaning Americans worried about taxes and the economy and national defense hawks.

But Trump believes in none of these things. On the personal side, his amoral predilections are well-known and have been for 40 years (and have cost him dearly in courts around America).

Publicly, his idea of strength is to demean the presidency by cozying up with dictators and strongmen around the world. He mocks great American cities for their crime problems while he himself is carrying dozens of felonies on his ledger. Exactly what limited government principle was Trump ""conserving"" when he called for the ""termination"" of certain parts of the Constitution in order to return himself to the presidency?

Granted, it is rarely beneficial for a political party to occupy the minority in American politics, but the GOP's best chance at regaining its conservative heritage may be to mold itself in opposition to Harris' positions. This would allow those truly interested in liberty to oppose taxes, regulations, court-packing and ""green"" mandates instead of obsessing over whether Harris is Black or Indian, whether photos of her crowds have been doctored with artificial intelligence or whether America is overrun by single women who enjoy the companionship of felines.

America has had good presidents and bad presidents. It has survived Democrats and Republicans, conservatives and progressives. Each time it has come out on the other side, electing a new administration that corrects the course of the previous one.

But Donald Trump isn't a true member of a party, nor does he clutter his mind with any ideological knowledge or allegiances. He is simply a political movement unto himself who responds with ridicule and scorn to any attempts to undergird his mercurial instincts with a cogent philosophy. He doesn't recognize the rules that have kept America a functioning republic for nearly 250 years, which has left the nation in the inconceivable position of either electing a man to the presidency or potentially sending him to prison for most of the remainder of his life.

Conversely, Kamala Harris is a standard, run-of-the-mill Democrat with bad ideas. Her administration would prompt groans and eye-rolls among conscious conservatives while sending the deranged fringes of the Republican Party into full conspiracy mode.

A Harris administration would be a painful four years for Republicans in the way America muddled through terms by Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden. But pain is also the way the body teaches you a lesson. And the lesson in this case is that the sooner Republicans cut out the Trump tumor, the quicker they can once again become a healthy political party."
"Data shows Texas doctors perform abortions to save life of the mother, despite claims from politicians, media",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/data-shows-texas-doctors-perform-abortions-save-life-mother-despite-claims-from-politicians-media,2024-09-15T10:08:59Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Despite claims from politicians, the media and abortion activists that female health in Texas is at risk with pro-life laws on the books, new numbers released by the state show that doctors do intervene in cases when the life of the mother is at risk.

The latest data from the Texas Health and Human Services Commission on induced terminations of pregnancies (HHSC ITOP) shows that doctors in Texas performed 113 abortions to save pregnant women's lives in the 22 months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022.

Texas has a pro-life law that went into effect shortly after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which prevents elective abortions beginning at conception with an exception for medically necessary abortions when the pregnancy causes ""a life-threatening physical condition aggravated by, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless the abortion is performed or induced."" Additionally, every state in the country with a pro-life law includes an exception for the life of the mother.

Vice President Kamala Harris and her campaign have previously claimed that doctors are hindered from performing abortions in the case of a pro-life law when the pregnancy puts a woman's life at risk.

When the Texas Supreme Court ruled in May that physicians may use ""reasonable medical judgment"" to determine whether a pregnancy requires a medically necessary abortion, Harris tweeted: ""This Texas Supreme Court ruling means women will continue to be denied access to necessary medical care, putting their health and lives at risk. To the women of Texas: Know you are not alone. @POTUS and I will continue to fight for reproductive freedom.""

When reached for comment, the Harris campaign pointed to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey in which 68% of OBGYNs said the Dobbs ruling has worsened their ability to manage pregnancy-related emergencies and 64% said the decision has worsened pregnancy-related mortality.

""The latest report reaffirms that Kamala Harris' dire claims about Texas' protective abortion laws are completely baseless,"" Amy O'Donnell, Texas Alliance for Life's communications director, said of the data in a press release. ""Texas' laws continue to save unborn babies from abortion while also protecting women's lives in those rare and tragic cases where pregnancy endangers a pregnant woman's life or health.""

ELON MUSK RIPS INTO KAMALA HARRIS FOR 'LYING' ABOUT TRUMP'S ABORTION POSITION

""Since the Court overturned Roe, no doctor has been prosecuted by a district attorney, sanctioned by the Texas Medical Board, or sued by the Attorney General, and no pregnant woman has lost her life because of the provisions of Texas' abortion laws, even with more than 360,000 live births in Texas each year,"" O'Donnell added.

Dr. Ingrid Skop, vice president and director of medical affairs at Charlotte Lozier Institute, told Fox News Digital that ""intentional media misinformation"" about Texas pro-life laws initially left many physicians confused and fearful, but that the situation has improved after the Texas Medical Board and the Texas Supreme Court issued guidance to physicians, reassuring them that they may use their ""reasonable medical judgment"" to determine when to intervene, and the risk of maternal death does not need to be ""imminent.""

""The Texas Induced Terminations of Pregnancy (ITOP) Reports also demonstrate that physicians have been intervening in the rare circumstances when an abortion is necessary to save the life of a mother,"" she said. ""In 2023, 62 abortions were performed in hospitals. 77% were performed by labor induction and only 6% by dilation and evacuation (dismemberment) abortion. 90% were performed between 13- and 25-weeks post-fertilization.""

""Similarly, the data for the first four months of 2024 demonstrates that 32 abortions have been performed,"" she added. ""Unborn life is being protected in Texas, but the state also prioritizes the life of the mother and allows physicians to provide quality care when severe complications arise.""

""Med Ed"" efforts in Texas, as well as Florida, South Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Kentucky aim to stop the abortion lobby from spreading what Kelsey Pritchard, the director of state public affairs for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, called misinformation that confuses doctors and harms women.

KAMALA HARRIS TWEET ON ABORTION RIGHTS SLAMMED BY LIBERALS: 'LITERALLY THE EMBODIMENT OF THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS'

""In Texas, specifically, with this Texas MedEd rule, they made it clear that doctors can continue to rely on their reasonable medical judgment,"" Pritchard said. ""They also made it clear that you should not wait until a woman is actually at the point where her life is in danger. If there is a foreseeable threat, then that allows doctors to act. You don't have to wait until it's a dangerous situation. I think that's a very important point in Texas and in all the pro-life states.""

Pritchard said the talking point is a tactic by Democrats to distract from their push to provide all-trimester abortion, which only 10% of Americans support, according to SBA Pro-Life data. A Gallup survey in May estimated 35 percent of Americans support abortion in all circumstances, verus 50 percent supporting it under certain circumstances. Just 12 percent in that poll were in favor of it being totally illegal.

""I think the abortion lobby has been telling this lie for a while now that if there is a pro-life law that will put women in danger and women will die because they won't be able to get emergency care,"" she said. ""That's something they've said for a long time, but we really saw it ramp up with Dobbs, and it has really become their number one talking point, their number one lie in red states, particularly.""

""Whether it's a ballot measure fight, a legislative fight or it's a candidate, a Democrat, talking about abortion, this is the number line they go to because they know that the Democrat agenda for all trimester abortion is unpopular with Americans widely,"" she added. ""They use this as the justification for: 'Oh, we can't have any limits, we can't at any point, not in the seventh, eighth, ninth month of pregnancy even, you have to be able to have abortion at all points because, you're putting women in danger.'""

In Florida, Planned Parenthood employee Laura Goodhue said Florida's six-week abortion ban would create a ""public health crisis"" in the state, while Democratic State Sen. Lauren Book said ""women and girls will die"" as a result of the law.

KAMALA HARRIS TORN APART BY PRO-LIFERS FOR HISTORIC TRIP TO ABORTION CLINIC: 'NORMALIZATION OF EVIL'

In June, the Arizona Democratic AG issued guidance clarifying that the 15-week abortion law does not impede a pregnant woman's ability to receive treatment when experiencing a miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy or another health emergency. But, pro-choice groups posted ads that claimed women's lives were at risk. President Biden himself claimed ""women's lives are in danger"" in regard to the law.

Pritchard said Democrats and the abortion lobby are the ones putting women's lives in danger by telling such ""lies.""

""That lie is what is putting women in danger, it is what has led some women to delay seeking care,"" she said. ""We've heard some of these horror stories where there are a handful of doctors that are confused about their ability to provide care, like the story of a woman who was told to wait in her car till she was bleeding profusely. That is wrong and those situations are really often created by this misinformation.""

""I would hope that pro-choice, pro-life, we could all agree that this is wrong and that women need to understand the truth, doctors need to understand the truth that lifesaving care is as available now as it has always been,"" she added."
Nebraska Supreme Court green-lights competing pro- and anti-abortion ballot measures,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/nebraska-abortion-ballot-measures-rcna171144,2024-09-14T18:59:06Z,"Nebraska is the only state since the fall of Roe v. Wade to put opposing abortion measures on the ballot.

Nebraska's Supreme Court ruled Friday that competing abortion rights measures can be on the ballot in November, allowing voters to choose between expanding the right to abortion or codifying a 12-week ban into the state constitution.

The former would enshrine ""a fundamental right to abortion until fetal viability, or when needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient"" in Nebraska's constitution. The other would ban abortions after the first trimester with exceptions for a medical emergency, rape or incest -- essentially codifying the state's current abortion ban into its constitution.

Anti-abortion supporters sued over the abortion rights initiative, arguing that it violated a state rule that requires a ballot proposal to address only one subject. The state's high court ultimately ruled that measure does not violate the single-subject rule, thus allowing both measures to appear alongside each other on the ballot.

Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, voters have resoundingly sided with abortion rights in states when the issue has been on the ballot. This year, at least 10 states, including Nebraska, are slated to vote on abortion rights measures. In response, Republican officials in those states have resorted to a slew of tactics to undermine those initiatives ahead of the election.

Nebraska is the only state since the fall of Roe to put opposing abortion measures together on the ballot. It's unclear which way voters are leaning: Organizers for both initiatives said last month that they had each submitted a roughly similar number of signatures to get ballot access. In the event that voters approve both measures, the one that gets the most votes in favor will be the one that's enshrined in the state constitution, The Associated Press reported."
UK government accused of cracking down on free speech: 'think before you post',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/uk-government-accused-cracking-down-free-speech-think-before-you-post,2024-09-14T15:34:46Z,"LONDON - Britain is facing a free speech crisis as the new left-wing government, overzealous police and courts crackdown on freedom of expression.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the leader of the ruling Labour Party, and his government of barely two months have been accused of rolling back free speech protections on safety grounds and failing to root out selective enforcement of laws.

""Every Brit fundamentally has the right to free speech, but for several years now, we've seen a growing trend,"" Lois McLatchie Miller, Senior Legal Communications Officer for Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) U.K., told Fox News Digital. ""It's only now becoming widely recognized that certain groups, depending on their beliefs, seem to have their free speech curtailed much more easily than others with different viewpoints.""

NEW ONLINE 'MISINFORMATION' BILL SLAMMED AS 'BIGGEST ATTACK' ON FREEDOMS IN AUSTRALIA

Widespread riots in the streets of England last month and a heavy-handed approach in response to the social unrest reignited the debate about free speech.

The U.K. has been grappling with harsh policing of online speech for years. In 2019, ex-police officer Harry Miller was investigated over social media posts deemed transphobic for questioning whether transgender women were real women. Miller's posts were recorded by the police as a ""non-crime hate incident,"" prompting him to challenge the designation in court. In 2020, the U.K. court ruled in Miller's favor but stopped short of changing the guidelines that allow police to pursue people over comments made online.

During a speech to parliament, Reform Party leader Nigel Farage complained of the double standards in applying the law evenly. Farage wrote on X ""Establishment MPs can heckle me all they like, but the British people are angry that we are living through a two-tier policing and justice system.""

Last month, the government issued a direct reminder of such laws and warned its citizens to be mindful of posting content deemed offensive and threatening with imprisonment. The Crown Prosecution Service posted a warning to social media platform X, which was amplified by the government's official social media accounts, warning citizens, ""Think before you post!""

""Content that incites violence or hatred isn't just harmful - it can be illegal,"" the agency wrote. ""The CPS takes online violence seriously and will prosecute when the legal test is met. Remind those close to you to share responsibly or face the consequences."" The post added: ""The British government is cracking down on people who share social media posts about the U.K. riots that it judges are 'likely to start racial hatred.'""

The government simultaneously began working on measures to force social media companies to suppress perceived ""fake news"" and legal content deemed harmful, to avoid fueling social unrest. The new measures would expand the scope of Britain's Online Safety Act by targeting and making social media companies liable for ""legal but harmful"" content.

UK LOOKS TO TREAT MISOGYNY AS EXTREMIST VIOLENCE, RAISING FREE SPEECH CRACKDOWN CONCERNS

London Mayor Sadiq Khan encouraged the Stammer government to swiftly implement changes to the online safety law, saying that currently, ""it's not fit for purpose.""

""I think very swiftly the government has realized there needs to be amendments to the Online Safety Act,"" Khan said in an interview with the Guardian. ""I think what the government should do very quickly is check if it is fit for purpose. I think it's not fit for purpose.""

But concerns over free speech in the U.K. extend beyond online, with double standards applied to different viewpoints and political protests.

""This isn't 1984, but 2024.""

Last weekend, two pro-Israel counter-protesters, Mark Birbeck and Niyak Ghorbani, carrying a ""Hamas is terrorist"" sign, were arrested during the pro-Hamas march in London on suspicion of breach of peace. The counter-protesters' presence allegedly led to the march being paused, and they were arrested following a struggle with police officers.

Ghorbani is a well-known anti-Hamas Iranian dissident whom London's Metropolitan Police tried to ban from attending future anti-Israel protests as part of his bail conditions after he was arrested for opposing the protests. A court rebuked the force and ruled in April that such bail conditions were neither proportionate nor necessary. The moniker 'Two-tier Kier' is how some on social media have responded to the new prime minister's policies.

UK POLICE COMMISSIONER THREATENS TO EXTRADITE, JAIL US CITIZENS OVER ONLINE POSTS: 'WE'LL COME AFTER YOU'

""On one hand, we see groups like environmental protesters, such as Stop Oil activists, or pro-Palestinian, and even in some cases, pro-Hamas protesters being given a wide berth to express their beliefs, sometimes using very violent language,"" Lois said. ""Yet, when we consider different types of protests, for example, Christians going out to pray near places of worship, they often face much stricter restrictions.""

For example, Dia Moodley, a Christian pastor who occasionally engages in street evangelism, was forced to sue the local police after the force forbade him from ""passing comments on any other religion or comparing them to Christianity"" and ""passing comments on beliefs held by Atheists or those who believe in evolution."" Moodley won in court earlier this year, and the police admitted that the restrictions on free speech imposed on Moodley were ""disproportionate.""

'Two-tier Kier' is how some on social media have responded to the new prime minister's policies.

Adam Smith-Connor, a Christian military veteran, meanwhile, is set to appear in court next week after being fined and criminally prosecuted over praying silently near an abortion facility. Local authorities alleged that Smith-Connor's silent prayer violated the so-called ""buffer zone,"" a designated area where individuals are allowed to express approval or disapproval of abortion.

""Silent prayer is not, and can never be, a crime. Yet, the prosecution of Adam Smith-Connor - who served in Afghanistan to uphold fundamental freedoms for everyone - shows an authoritarian move towards 'thought-policing' in the U.K. This isn't 1984, but 2024. And yet, the determination of the state to clamp down hard on even silent Christian beliefs - while protecting the free expression of others with different views - is clearly exposed,"" said McLatchie Miller.

Yet, there is a growing backlash against the government's anti-free speech stance, particularly the decision to pause the implementation and potentially scrap entirely the free speech law in higher education over safety concerns.

Over 600 academics and intellectuals, including seven Nobel laureates, signed a letter urging the government to reconsider the decision to shelve the law, the Times of London reported. The law was a flagship policy passed by the previous Conservative government to protect students' and academics' free speech rights on campus.

""The decision to halt [the act] appears to reflect the view, widespread among opponents, that there is no 'free speech problem' in U.K. universities. Nothing could be more false. Hundreds of academics and students have been hounded, censured, silenced or even sacked over the last 20 years for the expression of legal opinions,"" the letter read."
Arizona's repeal of 1864 ban on nearly all abortions goes into effect,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/arizonas-repeal-of-1864-ban-on-nearly-all-abortions-goes-into-effect,2024-09-14T12:52:34Z,"Fox News contributor Kellyanne Conway discusses the Arizona abortion ruling and weighs how the issue will factor into the 2024 presidential election.

Arizona's Civil War-era ban on nearly all abortions is officially being repealed on Saturday.

The long-dormant 1864 law, which predated Arizona's statehood, had no exceptions for rape and incest, only for the life of the mother.

The 160-year-old law went into effect after the repeal of Roe vs. Wade in 2022 but faced court challenges which prevented it from being enforced.

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE ARIZONA SUPREME COURT'S REINSTATEMENT OF AN 1864 NEAR-TOTAL ABORTION BAN

The ban was held up by the Arizona Supreme Court in April, throwing out an earlier lower-court decision that concluded doctors couldn't be charged for performing abortions in the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.

But the decision sparked backlash in the battleground Grand Canyon State, with Democratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs calling on the state legislature to repeal the ban.

Republicans hold a narrow majority in both chambers, but House Democrats were then able to garner the support of three Republicans to pass the repeal legislation in April following two previous attempts, sending the measure to the Senate for consideration. Two GOP senators joined with Democrats a week later to grant final approval and then Hobbs signed the bill in May, declaring it was just the beginning of a fight to protect reproductive health care in Arizona.

""I will continue doing everything in my power to protect reproductive freedoms, because I trust women to make the decisions that are best for them, and know politicians do not belong in the doctor's office,"" Hobbs said in a statement.

Arizona House Speaker Ben Toma, a Republican, said at the time that he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the bill's passing.

""We should not have rushed this bill through the legislative process,"" he said in a statement shared with Fox News Digital. ""The pre-Roe law has been on the books for decades and was readopted in 1977 by Democrats and Republicans in the State Legislature and signed by Democrat Gov. Raul Castro.

ARIZONA HOUSE LAWMAKERS PASS BILL TO REPEAL 1864 ABORTION BAN

""It would have been prudent and responsible to allow the courts to decide the constitutionality of the pre-Roe law. Instead, we are rushing to judgment for reasons I simply cannot understand.""

The state's internal tussle over the issue was thrust into the national spotlight in March when Arizona state Sen. Eva Burch announced on the state Senate floor that she planned to have an abortion after learning that her pregnancy was not viable.

Arizona law now allows abortions until 15 weeks. After that, there is an exception to save the life of the mother, but missing are exceptions for cases of rape or incest after the 15-week mark.

The state requires those seeking an abortion prior to the 15-week mark to have an ultrasound at least 24 hours before the procedure and to be given the opportunity to view it. Minors must have either parental consent or authorization from a state judge, except in cases of incest or when their life is at risk.

Voters will decide on whether to add the right to abortion to the state constitution when they have their say on Proposition 139 in the general election.

The measure secured a spot on the ballot after the pro-abortion group Arizona for Abortion Access, secured nearly 578,000 signatures, well over the 383,923 required from registered voters.

If voters approve the measure, abortions would be allowed until fetal viability -- the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb, typically around 24 weeks. It also would allow abortions after that time in cases where the mother's physical or mental health is in jeopardy."

(Courtesy: ABC News)

The Nebraska Supreme Court has set up a major abortion policy showdown for election day, approving two competing ballot measures to go before voters.

One ballot measure, put forward by abortion advocates, would enshrine a fundamental right to abortion ""until fetal viability."" The other measure, put forward by abortion opponents, would codify the state's current 12-week abortion ban into the state's constitution.

Current Nebraska law allows for exceptions in the case of rape, incest or the life of the mother.

Anti-abortion groups had filed a pair of lawsuits challenging the competing ballot measure, arguing it violated state policy requiring that such measures pertain to only one subject.

The lawsuits argued the ballot measure deals with abortion rights until viability, abortion rights after viability to protect a woman's health, and whether the state should be allowed to regulate abortion, amounting to three separate issues.

TRUMP AND HARRIS ON COLLISION COURSE AS 2024 CAMPAIGN ENTERS FINAL STRETCH

The state Supreme Court struck down those challenges in a Friday ruling, allowing the measure to appear on ballots.

Organizers for each ballot measure turned in more than 200,000 signatures supporting them, well over the 123,000 requirements.

The court battle comes as Democrats across the country seek to use abortion as a key issue to outplay Republicans. The effort was on full display during last week's presidential debate, with Vice President Kamala Harris blasting the end of Roe v. Wade under former President Trump.

Harris argued Trump would sign a national abortion ban into law if he is elected in November. Trump rejected that claim and instead pointed to ballot measures like the ones now playing out in Nebraska.

VOTERS GIVE HARRIS THE DEBATE WIN, BUT PRAISE TRUMP ON POLICY: SHE GOT UNDER HIS SKIN

""As far as the abortion ban, no, I'm not in favor of an abortion ban, but it doesn't matter, because this issue has now been taken over by the states,"" Trump said.

""I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother,"" he said. ""I believe strongly in it. Ronald Reagan did also. Eighty-five percent of Republicans knew exceptions are very important,"" he said.

It started with her aggressive pursuit of a handshake and continued with the trap she set by talking about his obsession with crowd sizes. He never regained control.

All that being said, debate performances alone don't win elections. Just ask John Kerry or Hillary Clinton, who both won all of their debates and did not win their elections. But debates can help differentiate candidates and motivate voters.

On Tuesday night, the key exchange, at least in my opinion, centered around abortion rights.

After Trump boldly claimed he ""did a great service"" in overturning Roe v. Wade, Harris had this to say:

She was direct, passionate and made the impact of abortion bans specific and personal.

Trump, meanwhile, failed to commit to vetoing an abortion ban.

There were a lot of spicy moments in this debate. But that exchange showed where Harris and Trump stand on an issue that could be a key motivator of turnout, if not voter behavior.

If I were Team Harris, I would make sure Trump doesn't forget it.

This summer, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz warned Trump and JD Vance: ""See what cat people do when you go after 'em."" And Tuesday night, they found out.

Taylor Swift's endorsement was one of the most highly anticipated this election. Why? Swift's social media call to action drove over 400,000 visits to the federal voter registration website Vote.gov within 24 hours of her post. And for context, this website typically only receives about 40,000 visits per day. So far, the pop star's original Instagram post has been shared by over 1.5 million users on Instagram.

Trump claimed that Swift will ""probably pay a price for it in the marketplace."" But Swift's influence, to say nothing about her business, did just fine after she endorsed Joe Biden for president in October 2020. If anything, she's only grown more powerful.

Vance, whose ""childless cat lady"" insults got a callout in Swift's post, attempted to shrug off the development, saying he doesn't think many Americans ""are going to be influenced by a billionaire celebrity who I think is disconnected from the interests and the problems of most Americans.""

To quote Rep. Adam Schiff: ""Has JD Vance met his own running mate?""

Meet Karen Dunn, the powerhouse attorney leading Harris' debate prep team. The New York Times reports she is described by people close to her as a ""skilled handler of high-ego politicians."" And Dunn also knows how to give candidates ""tough love"" when they need it, according to Hillary Clinton.

Dunn got her start in politics on Clinton's 2000 Senate campaign. She rose to become Clinton's communications director and joined Clinton's presidential campaign after attending Yale Law School. After clerking for then-Judge Merrick Garland and Justice Stephen Breyer, Dunn returned to politics to work on debate prep teams for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, Clinton in 2016, and Harris (for her vice presidential debate with Mike Pence) in 2020.

In 2021, Dunn also won a landmark case holding the organizers of the Charlottesville rally accountable for injuries suffered by counterprotesters, securing over $25 million in damages.

After Obama won re-election in 2012, Dunn took a job in the White House counsel's office. We don't know where she'll land next, but she's absolutely a player to watch in a potential Harris administration."
Opinion | My former friend JD Vance has aligned with something far worse than MAGA,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/sofia-nelson-jd-vance-trump-maga-post-liberal-right-rcna171095,2024-09-14T12:50:42Z,"Unlike the MAGA movement, which is led by a candidate who is defiantly amoral, post-liberalism is steeped in a revolutionary religiosity.

Most Americans haven't heard of the post-liberal right, the small but influential group of conservative, mostly Catholic men who have declared that liberal democracy, the animating principle of America's founding, has failed and want to bring about a new social order where there is no separation of church and state and men and a hyperconservative Catholicism reign supreme. They are disdainful of secularism and individual liberty. Just like Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump illustrated during Tuesday night's debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, these men idolize the authoritarian Viktor Orbán, the prime minister of Hungary.

They're also nostalgic for Spain as it was run by the dictator Franco and see Orbán's government and Franco's as potential models for the kind of regime they wish to install in the United States. The group's political priorities -- which include restricting access to contraception and divorce and banning marriage equality and pornography -- are wildly unpopular. And yet the Republican nominee for vice president, my former friend JD Vance, is a prominent voice of this fringe movement, as so many of his regrettable podcast interviews have demonstrated.

To repeat, I once considered Vance a friend. We were in the same class at Yale Law School, he knew me as an openly trans person, and we remained in communication until 2021. That's the year that he announced he would be running in the U.S. Senate race in Ohio the next year. Before running in post-liberal and neoreactionary circles, Vance was far less angry and extreme. He was also, as everybody will remember, riding the attention from his memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy"" and was a vocal and unambiguous critic of Trump, using words like ""idiot"" to describe Trump and ""reprehensible"" to describe his views on ""Immigrants, Muslims, etc.""

Despite the time we spent as friends, I have no real insights (other than political expediency) into what drew him to post-liberal men like the academic Patrick Deneen, columnist Sohrab Ahmari, legal scholar Adrian Vermeule and expat journalist and author Rod Dreher, who was present for Vance's baptism into the Catholic Church in 2019. What I do know is that Vance used to condemn Trump's racism and be empathetic to how such rhetoric made Americans feel unwelcome in their own country. But these men have had an obvious and heartbreaking effect on Vance's worldview.

The leaders in the post-liberal movement are elites steeped in classical and Catholic philosophy who fancy themselves warriors for the average man. Vermeule, for example, is explicitly against the separation of church and state, and believes the Catholic Church should have ultimate control over all moral questions. (Well, maybe not the church as it's run by Pope Francis.)

Vance and his intellectual mentors like Deneen are benefiting from the conflation of MAGA and post-liberalism, because if Americans truly understood post-liberalism, they'd realize it seeks to strip them of individual freedom.

There is some policy overlap between MAGA and post-liberalism in their shared opposition, for example, to immigration and transgender rights. But the ideological overlap between the groups is a shared affinity for authoritarianism. The post-liberal right, which has goals that even MAGA Republicans would find extreme, is attempting to hijack the MAGA movement to push its own agenda.

Consider: Trump, who has been married three times and divorced two times, proudly appeared on the cover of Playboy magazine. He was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records in a case that prosecutors successfully argued was about him trying to cover up an adulterous affair he had with an adult film star. He is not exactly an exemplar of Christian morality.

More importantly, Trump's positions change with the tides of public opinion. They aren't rooted in any religious or ideological convictions. ABC News' Linsey Davis, a moderator at Tuesday night's presidential debate, pointed out that, according to Vance, Trump ""explicitly"" said he'd veto a national abortion ban. That's after Trump suggested in March that he'd support such a ban. But not only did Trump not state a clear position at the debate, he said, ""I didn't discuss it with JD."" This comes on the heels of him first indicating he would vote in favor of an abortion rights ballot initiative in Florida, only to say he would vote against it the next day.

Unlike the MAGA movement, which is led by a candidate who is defiantly amoral, post-liberalism is steeped in a revolutionary religiosity. Its goals include replacing our social and political power structures with a new social order rooted in a misogynist understanding of gender, sexuality, marriage and reproduction closely tethered to Catholic social teachings. This is reflected in Vance's obsession with birth rates and the way he belittles women without children.

Some of the post-liberal right's priorities are reflected in Project 2025, but not even the Heritage Foundation, which is behind that project, has set its sights on trapping people in violent marriages by repealing no-fault divorce, as Vance and the post-liberal right seek to do.

Post-liberalism, unlike MAGA, has no grassroots following. Most Americans aren't Catholic, and most Catholics support the separation of church and state. But post-liberalism, despite its ideological and moral disdain for Trump, needs MAGA. To accomplish any of its goals, it must leech off of a populist movement. The movement needs to exploit Trump's popularity for its own unpopular aims. This may explain why Vance, who had more integrity when I knew him, abruptly flipped from calling Trump ""cultural heroin"" to the greatest president of his lifetime.

Prior to MAGA gaining control of the Republican Party, the leaders of this movement, most notably Vance, were staunchly anti-Trump. And while the post-liberal right is excited one of its own has quickly risen through MAGA's ranks -- most leaders of post-liberalism still aren't Trump fans.

But they understand that it's more feasible for them to co-opt the MAGA base than to organically organize a political base of their own. MAGA is far from a majority of the country, 42% of self-identified Republicans or roughly 14% of the county, but it's a larger political force than post-liberalism could ever hope to build on its own given the unpopularity of its policy priorities.

Post-liberalism further seeks to confuse the American people through its rhetorical support for labor unions, a definite break from mainstream Republican orthodoxy. However, Vance was booed by a group of union firefighters when he stated he sought to be part of the ""most pro-worker Republican ticket in history."" Nobody who's pro-worker, as Vance claims to be, would team up with Trump, the candidate who laughed with Elon Musk about union busting. Nor would he oppose the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would expand the right to organize. Hardworking union firefighters recognize Vance's support for organized labor for what it is: hollow political rhetoric.

A post-liberal devotee like Vance knows how to talk a populist game, but, like Trump, he has no interest in delivering for working people. His real devotion is to the culture wars.

Instead of persuading Americans to support their ideas, leaders of the post-liberal right are covertly positioning themselves within MAGA to be the heirs of Trump's political base when he's off the scene. They seek to transform the GOP into a pro-theocracy party willing to ignore the Constitution and democratic norms.

Those of us who don't want to live in a theocracy must look beyond just defeating Trump and must also seek to vanquish a post-liberal right. That also means defeating the ambitions of a classmate whom I once considered a friend."
Clueless elites wrong about Trump-Harris debate and now we know why,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/clueless-elites-wrong-about-trump-harris-debate-now-we-know-why,2024-09-14T11:26:35Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

As the dust is settling from the first debate between President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the political elites are failing to understand how badly Harris failed to achieve her objectives.

Nothing better illustrates the gap between reality and our political elite (including a number of famous Republicans) than their complete misreading of what happened in the clash between the ABC News-Harris Team and the lone opponent, President Trump.

Every Trump supporter and independent witnessed the astounding dishonesty of ABC's moderators (who were actually active debaters helping Harris take on President Trump). Their reaction has been outrage and, in some cases, a condemnation of ABC and Vice President Harris.

FOUR WAYS TRUMP CAN GET TO A 96% CHANCE OF WINNING

One observer said to me ""they didn't have to give her the questions, she was clearly giving them the questions."" The fact that one of her closest friends is also in charge of ABC News just further confirmed for many Americans that the fix was in and the whole thing was rigged.

Trump's base is 48 percent of Americans who feel there is a corrupt establishment trying to control their lives and rip them off. The spectacle of ABC News so blatantly rigging the fight just confirmed everything they already believed and firmly placed Harris in the corrupt establishment wing. Walking through three airports on Thursday, I was greeted by dozens of people who were infuriated by the debate and bitterly angry at how stupid Harris thinks they are.

The fact is, authenticity beats wearing a mask. Being yourself beats trying to be the person your consultants have trained you to be. This has always been true in American politics.

Harris further hurt herself by spending a large part of her listening time making faces and looking cute. It was the behavior of a spoiled teenager, not a commander-in-chief.

The elites value style over substance. They would like everyone to behave as though they were at a Washington cocktail party.

MORNING GLORY: THE WORST DEBATE IN THE HISTORY OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES

Most Americans are not so highfalutin. Most Americans do not appreciate well-dressed, clever people treating them as if they are ignorant and incapable of realizing when they are being manipulated and lied to.

The simple fact is: Vice President Harris can't tell the truth, because an honest admission of her beliefs - and the failures of the last three-and-a-half years - would doom her campaign. The ABC team did all it could to stop President Trump from telling the truth about her. The most glaring example was the blunt intervention that there were no states in which babies could be left to die after they were born. That was an outright lie. The truth is that in Tim Walz's Minnesota at least eight babies have been left to die after botched abortions. It is a matter of public record. If you want a pro-infanticide vice president, then ""Tampon Tim"" is your guy.

President Trump's great attraction to the supporters who have been with him through thick and thin is precisely that he is not an effete, fawning, dishonest, and manipulative cretin from the governing class. Remember, they've stuck with him through the Russia hoax, a multiyear investigation, two impeachments, multiple lawsuits, and slanderous attacks by the leftwing propaganda media.

You can like him or dislike him, admire him or disdain him, but what you get is the authentic Trump.

UNDECIDED VOTERS NOT SWAYED BY LAST DEBATE, 'STILL ON THE FENCE' ABOUT THE ELECTION: REPORT

So, we had a debate between the privileged, protected elitist Princess of the Left and a down-to-earth guy who people understand. It isn't that President Trump can't function in high society and country clubs. He owns country clubs (Callista and I see him occasionally at Trump National in Washington). He can afford as many tuxedos as any politician in the country. But he is a regular guy who never hides who he really is.

The fact is, authenticity beats wearing a mask. Being yourself beats trying to be the person your consultants have trained you to be. This has always been true in American politics.

The elites completely misread the outcome of the debate because they valued style over substance. Furthermore, they expected and accepted that ABC would be dishonest, one-sided and arrogantly abrasive. As elitists, they figured that an outsider like President Trump deserved that kind of treatment.

The great genius of the Founding Fathers was understanding that freedom ultimately depends upon all the people - not just the elite. Further, Abraham Lincoln's admonition that with popular sentiment, anything is possible. Without popular sentiment nothing is possible,"" is still true.

As the polls come in and show that Trump's authenticity and substance beat the ABC-Harris team's dishonesty and overtrained style, go back and read the columns and quotes of those who totally misread what happened. Take note of who simply does not understand the wisdom of the American people.

The great Democratic political consultant Joe Napolitan warned, ""never underestimate the intelligence of the American people nor overestimate the amount of information they have.""

On Tuesday night, Vice President Harris underestimated the intelligence of the people she wants to lead. She then compounded her mistake by giving them the information about what a bad president she would be."
Trump's own version of reality continues to confound political actors and observers,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/13/nx-s1-5111649/trump-fact-check-reality,2024-09-14T09:05:09Z,"Eight years ago this month, Donald Trump announced that he had personally laid to rest the controversy about President Obama's country of origin. He gave himself credit for clearing up any questions that may have arisen because of something, he claimed, Hillary Clinton had said years earlier.

Those familiar with the facts were stunned. They knew the so-called birther conspiracy had been hatched by various Obama opponents to suggest he was ineligible to be president because he had been born not in the U.S. but in Kenya or some other country. It had been kept alive and promoted for years by a variety of Obama critics, including, most prominently, Donald Trump.

It could even be said that Trump had facilitated his transition from TV reality show star (The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice) to bona fide political candidate by exploiting the birther myth.

What Trump was actually announcing in September 2016 was a decision to stop talking about a non-issue he himself had helped sustain for years. But in finally renouncing one falsehood, he insisted on substituting another -- casting himself as a hero of the tale.

Nearly a decade after Trump began running for president we should all be accustomed to his reliance on falsehoods.

But back in 2016, the birther flip-flop seemed to deserve special recognition. It was not just blatant, it was preposterous.

Or so we thought. Surely it would diminish the man even in the eyes of his admirers. And it may have done so, in some cases. But it did not alter his trajectory. He stunned the world a few weeks later by winning the Electoral College vote for president.

It was said in the early Trump years that the media took him literally but not seriously. It's hard to deny that many of us took him too literally and not seriously enough. At the same time, many of Trump's ""base"" voters were said to take Trump seriously but not literally. That worked for him, and those attitudes surely persist in 2024 much as they did in his first two campaigns.

Ten years ago, the media were accustomed to politicians who could be shamed or at least embarrassed over errors of fact and even minor exposures of ignorance. Trump seemed then, and still seems now, quite impervious to either.

Still, the most egregious trait of Trump's campaign was his willingness to state highly consequential claims that were entirely at odds with reality, standing by them when challenged and sailing on -- dismissive or seemingly oblivious to all criticism.

Far from being disqualifying, this feature of the Trump persona presents itself as part and parcel of his appeal.

This week, after a debate with Vice President Harris that he apparently did not take entirely seriously, Trump said he would not debate her again. He said there was no need for a ""third debate"" because he had clearly won the first two. He was including the June 27 debate he had with President Biden, who had been the presumptive Democratic nominee at the time.

Perhaps that was not surprising, as Trump kept Biden in his sights throughout his debate with Harris this week -- name checking Biden repeatedly without naming Harris once.

But what was surprising was Trump's claim to having won both debates. Few would question he won the June 27 meeting with Biden, who seemed so diminished as to be hard to recognize.

But quite the opposite impression prevailed after Trump's match with Harris, who had swept to the Democratic nomination without opposition after Biden's July 18 decision to withdraw.

The first CNN polls after Tuesday's debate showed nearly two-thirds of those who watched thought Harris did better than Trump (even if they were not planning to vote for her). A sizable fraction of Republicans were not willing to say Trump had won the faceoff.

Yet here was Trump, on the afternoon after the debate, telling reporters he was not interested in a rematch with Harris because he had ""won the debate according to every poll -- every single poll, I think.""

In fact, the only polls where Trump won were online polls of self-selected website samples rather than the randomized scientific samples actual pollsters use. One poll Trump cited had him winning 98% to 2%, according to Trump.

Meanwhile, actual polling organizations such as Reuters and YouGov had done their soundings and found Harris the winner in the eyes of a clear majority -- though not as large a majority as CNN's poll. Trump came out on top for just 31% of the respondents in YouGov and 24% in Reuters.

This willingness or compulsion to present claims that are utterly counterfactual has set Trump apart from conventional candidates. It continues to pose a problem for the media and the political community alike -- including conservative media such as Fox News and a sizable portion of the Republican Party itself.

Trump's claims are often expressed in hyperbolic superlatives. Trump insists he had ""the best economy"" and Biden had ""the worst inflation"" ever -- two statements that are easily disproven. The nation's economic growth was stronger for longer under Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, just to name two relatively recent presidents. Inflation was far higher and more sustained in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

But Trump has never been troubled by making such outlandish statements. Moreover, he is rarely satisfied with telling his crowds that yellow is green. It has to be the greenest green there has ever been. It is not sufficient to say up is down, it must be down farther than down has ever been.

The escalating statement of the stupendous is also a specialty. Take, for example, his casual references to the number of immigrants present in the United States illegally. On Tuesday night he started referring to millions, mentioned 21 million, then said it was surely far more than the official government estimate of 11 million. Then he again said it was more like 21 million before adding he thought the figure was ""a lot higher than"" that.

And all this without a shred of actual evidence or even a hint at the source of these wildly disparate numbers.

In the June 27 debate against Biden, the incumbent's stumbles overshadowed Trump's own missteps. But Trump still had his share of howlers. At one point he said illegal immigrants had taken ""110%"" of all the jobs created during the Biden presidency.

That would mean they had taken more jobs than were created, strongly suggesting Trump was not paying much attention to what he was saying. Indeed, as a general rule when he starts spouting statistics, he seems far more interested in what shock they may cause than whether they add up.

There may have been a time this kind of behavior could be dismissed as ordinary political rhetoric, which most Americans expect will contain exaggerations and oversimplifications. It is clear from the polls that whatever Americans think of Trump's relationship to fact, something approaching half of them still plan to vote for him.

Fact-checking has been around for more than a generation, giving newspapers and magazines a chance to offer something different and escape the ""he said, she said"" pattern. In the later decades of the 20th century, most newspapers and big broadcasters were steeped in the values of ""middle of the road"" reporting as media owners sought ever-larger and more diverse audiences.

Stories were considered balanced when different sides were presented with equal weight and respect. Deciding which side was right or more accurate or more worthy was left to the news consumer or voter.

That was never entirely satisfactory, either to the consumer-voter or to the journalists themselves. More and more news outlets turned to ""fact-checks"" or ""fact-checking,"" an effort to find and follow the facts on crime, unemployment, trade, health care, immigration and any other issues that drove the debate.

For some journalists this became a full-time assignment. The Washington Post has used veteran reporter Glenn Kessler as its official guru of fact for many years. The Poynter Institute in Florida, related to the St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times) pioneered Politifact several election cycles ago.

NPR and PBS have been fact-checking debates and other key moments in national campaigns for decades, online and on air. This week, the fact-checking operation in both shops had its hands full.

So when ABC moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis made a few factual corrections during the debate about a particular claim or statement, they were carrying on a custom that has been increasingly common in broadcast journalism.

As they did not see a need to correct as much in what Harris said, their efforts struck many Trump supporters as unnecessary, unfair and evidence of Democratic bias. Trump himself said the debate had been ""3 against 1.""

The anchors' defense was that Harris said nothing to compare with Trump's assertions about states allowing abortion after birth or Haitian immigrants eating people's pets in Ohio.

That's a judgment call, of course, and just the kind that mainstream journalists were once trained to avoid. That they now feel compelled to make those calls has a lot to do with how Trump himself has changed the rules. But it should not be surprising that changes the media have made prompt protest from those who feel abused -- particularly Trump himself.

This entails also the sea change over the use of the three-letter word we were trained as journalists to avoid: lie. We might say a politician was misstating facts or making inaccurate claims. But we could never make the leap of imputing motive. Maybe the pol was just mistaken and sincerely believed his opponent was guilty of this or that accusation. We could say he was wrong, but calling someone a liar was a big deal.

Trump has led to a change in that policy in much of the industry. Even in 2016, some TV anchors were using the word, at least on late-night TV. It has since become quite common for mainstream news organizations to refer to lies and lying.

With his latest portrayal of what happened in the Harris debate in front of 67 million TV viewers this week, Trump once again has thrown down the gauntlet to challenge the fact-checkers and the commentators alike.

Now, even the practice of fact-checking has become controversial, with Trump acolytes questioning what constitutes a fact. We have reached a point where the idea of fact-checking is regarded as polarizing.

And the more we talk about how polarized things have become, the more polarized they get."
"Harris interrupted multiple times by pro-Palestinian protesters as she rallies in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-interrupted-multiple-times-pro-palestinian-protesters-she-rallies-wilkes-barre-pennsylvania,2024-09-14T00:52:54Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris spoke for around a half hour to a packed crowd at the McHale Athletic Center of Wilkes University in Pennsylvania on Friday, where she was interrupted at least twice by pro-Palestinian protesters.

""You're supporting a war criminal,"" one protester shouted about two-thirds of the way into her speech.

A second appeared shortly after the first was ushered out, and shouted for several minutes until he also was removed, crying out ""Free Palestine"" as he was led past the press cordon.

In response, Harris said, ""I respect your voice, but right now, I am speaking,"" before moving on with the rest of her address over the interjector's din.

PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS TAUNT HARRIS RALLYGOERS AS VEEP SUPPORTER HITS BACK: 'WHAT ABOUT HAMAS?'

Harris had been introduced by Mary Grace, a local nurse who said she was a longtime Republican who could not support former President Trump.

After thanking Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr., D-Pa., Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Wilkes-Barre Democratic mayor George Brown, all of whom preceded her remarks, she began the crux of her remarks by referencing the ABC News debate from earlier in the week.

""I take it many people here watched it,"" she said, as the reference drew applause.

""You'll remember that night I talked about issues that matter to families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in America's small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom. And keeping our nation safe and secure. But that is not what we heard from Donald Trump. Instead, it was the same old show, the same tired playbook we've heard for years with no plan, no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people. Well, folks, it's time to turn the page.""

Harris claimed Trump will give billionaires and large corporations ""massive"" tax cuts while also taking a scalpel to entitlements.

She also said the Republican wants to impose a ""Trump sales tax,"" which some observers claim to be a reference to the former president's foreign tariff plans.

Harris also spoke about national division, saying ""we are not going back"" to past years, and instead called for a ""new way forward.""

""We need a President of the United States who works for all the American people and that just stops with all the trying to divide us,"" she said.

""People are exhausted with that stuff.""

She also called herself the ""underdog"" in the race, predicting it will be tight in the crucial Commonwealth in which she spoke.

""So Pennsylvania, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom?"" Harris asked

Making the trek north on I-81 from Harrisburg, Shapiro - who many believed was the proverbial runner-up to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in Harris' running mate consideration - offered a booming endorsement shortly before the candidate came onstage.

""We have proved ... that we can 'get sh -- done'!"" Shapiro shouted, referencing his gubernatorial administration's edgy slogan of sorts.

""[We've invested] a historic amount in our public schools... when those kids go to and from schools, they deserve to live in safe communities,"" he added.

""We want everyone to know that you are valued here, whether you choose to be a lawyer or a laborer, we want you to know you belong here [in Pennsylvania].""

""Where you come from, who you love, and who you pray to - you belong and I got your back,"" Shapiro went on, adding Harris' campaign offers a similar vision.

""She and I have both been prosecutors,"" said Shapiro, who served as the separately-elected attorney general during the governorship of predecessor Tom Wolf.

""Kamala Harris has always been for the people... She stood up for our union sisters and brothers.

This time borrowing a line instead from Harris, Shapiro added of Trump's tenure in the White House, ""we are not going back to that.""

""When you go back and look at his record, it was ... less jobs and a whole lot less freedom when Donald Trump was in charge,"" he said, invoking the abortion issue and claiming women lost ""basic freedom to make decisions about their own bodies.""

Shapiro went on to point to Philadelphia, just 100 miles on the other end of the Northeast Extension from where he spoke, saying that Americans ""declared our independence from a king [there, once] and we are not going back.""

In response to Harris visiting the Commonwealth, PA Trump Team spokesman Kush Desai told Fox News Digital that Pennsylvanians are fed up with the rising costs of groceries, gas, and utilities thanks to the Harris-Biden administration's disastrous inflationary, anti-energy agenda.""

""The choice between another four years of retirees scraping by off ramen under Kamala or a return to the peace, prosperity, and stability of the Trump administration couldn't be easier for Pennsylvanians.""

At the debate in Philadelphia, Harris made reference to the approximate 800,000 Polish-Americans who reside in Pennsylvania. Outside Port Richmond and the Philadelphia area, the counties in and around where Harris rallied Friday have a sizeable such population.

In Wilkes-Barre's Luzerne County, about one-sixth of the population is Polish American, and cities like Nanticoke, Hazleton and Shamokin - in nearby Northumberland County - also host sizable communities.

In that regard, when asked, Desai said Trump is an ""especially easy choice"" for Pennsylvania's Polish-Americans, noting his ""blossoming friendship"" with Polish President Andrzej Duda and his work with Warsaw to build a stronger alliance, including within their shared NATO status.

At the debate, Harris appeared to draw a connection between the Polish-American electorate and her criticisms of how Trump would end the war in Ukraine - which borders Poland:

""Why don't you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch,"" Harris said, referring to Russian leader Vladimir Putin."

Pope Francis on Friday urged Catholic voters to ""choose the lesser evil"" between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

The pope criticized Harris' support of abortion rights as being an ""assassination,"" while he also chastised Trump, saying ""not welcoming migrants is a sin.""

""You must choose the lesser evil,"" Francis told reporters in a press conference held from his papal airplane following a 12-day tour of Southeast Asia and Oceania. ""Who is the lesser evil? That lady, or that gentleman? I don't know. Everyone, in conscience, [has to] think and do this.""

But he also said, ""Not voting is ugly. It is not good. You must vote.""

WHITE HOUSE RESPONDS AFTER POPE CONDEMNS 'GENDER THEORY,' AFFIRMS BIDEN'S SUPPORT FOR TRANS COMMUNITY

Harris has said that she wants to codify Roe v. Wade into law if elected, and Trump has promised the ""largest mass deportation in American history of our country.""

The pope didn't specify which candidate, if either, he personally prefers.

On abortion, he said, ""It is an assassination. On these things we must speak clearly. No 'but' or 'however.'""

On Trump's deportation plans, the pope said: ""Not giving welcome to migrants is a sin. It is grave.""

""Whether it is the one who is chasing away migrants, or the one who that kills children, both are against life,"" he claimed.

POPE FRANCIS RESPONDS TO CONSERVATIVE CRITICS IN NEW INTERVIEW

Trump previously sparred with the pope in 2016, after the pontiff claimed that his plan to build a wall along the Mexican border was ""not Christian.""

""I'm a very good Christian,"" Trump responded at the time in a news conference, ""He's questioning my faith. I was very surprised to see it.""

Trump called questioning a person's faith ""disgraceful,"" claiming that the pope was being used as a ""pawn"" by the Mexican government.

The pope has also previously criticized President Biden's stance on abortion. Biden is a Catholic, but supports a woman's right to choose, which Francis called an ""incoherence"" in a 2022 interview, saying that he would leave it to Biden's ""conscience.""

CNN anchor wonders how Harris can increase support with Trump 'killing' her on the economy,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-anchor-wonders-how-harris-can-increase-support-trump-killing-her-economy,2024-09-13T21:04:50Z,"CNN anchor Kate Bolduan asked a network panel on Friday morning how Vice President Kamala Harris can boost her performance in the polls when former President Trump is ""killing"" her on economic issues.

CNN anchor Kate Bolduan asked a network panel on Friday morning how Vice President Kamala Harris can boost her performance in the polls when former President Trump is ""killing"" her on economic issues.

Bolduan spoke to CNN political commentators Van Jones and Alyssa Farah Griffin about how, though Harris did well in the debate and is giving some good messaging in areas, Trump is still beating her on one of the most important issues this election cycle.

""You've got, potentially, a good sign that Kamala Harris can talk about, kind of quote-unquote late-stage change, but you still have Donald Trump killing her when it comes to the economy,"" she said.

The anchor stated that the Harris campaign is in a ""funky place"" ahead of the November election, and mentioned polling that demonstrated Trump maintaining a key advantage in the immediate aftermath of Tuesday night's debate.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH ABORTION FACT-CHECK AGAINST TRUMP: 'COMPLETELY INTERJECTS HERSELF'

""In that snap poll after the debate, he was up 20 points on the economy even though the vast majority said she won the debate,"" Bolduan told her guests.

However, both pundits downplayed the numbers.

Jones replied by saying that 2012 GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney was seen as better than former President Obama on the economy, and Obama won. ""People thought Romney was better on the economy than Obama but people believed that Obama was going to fight for them harder.""

""People might think, 'Yeah, he might be better on the economy, but he said he'll help the billionaires, he's not gonna help me,'"" he added.

Griffin's counterpoint was that Trump is too easily distracted to capitalize on this 20-point advantage, pointing to one of his viral moments at the debate as evidence for her argument.

FOX NEWS MEDIA PROPOSES SECOND HARRIS-TRUMP DEBATE MODERATED BY MARTHA MACCALLUM, BRET BAIER

""The economy is objectively Donald Trump's strongest issue, but it comes down to can he actually focus on that? Aides have put him up to give speeches focused on it and he ends up diverting to all different directions - Hannibal Lecter, now we're onto eating animals,"" she said.

Jones jumped back in, stating that ""Every candidate has their strong points and their weak points.""

""Economy - weaker for her. Abortion­ - weaker for him,"" he said. ""So, everybody's got strengths and weaknesses. What you want to do is mitigate your weaknesses as much as you can - which is why he's flip-flopping all over the place on abortion - and you lean into your strengths.""

Still, Bolduan wasn't convinced the Harris campaign is doing all they can on the economy, stating that campaign officials she has talked to have not had good answers about the vice president's performance on that issue.

""I just think the response I've gotten to 'Why isn't she doing better on the economy' or 'Why wasn't Biden doing better on the economy' that I've gotten from administration officials and from Democratic electeds - it has been unsatisfying to this point, which is 'They just haven't gotten our message,'"" the anchor said.

She added, ""And at some point, I'm asking, 'Where's the expiration date on that reasoning?' As at some point there has to be."""

75%. That is the share of U.S. Catholics who view Pope Francis favorably, according to a Pew Research Center report released earlier this year, marking an 8% decrease since 2021. About nine out of 10 Democratic Catholics or those who lean toward the Democratic Party have a positive view of the pope, according to the report, which noted 63% of Catholics who are Republicans or lean Republican have a positive view of him.

Francis previously made comments about the presidential election in 2016, criticizing Trump's plan to build a wall on the border between the U.S. and Mexico and saying anyone who builds walls to shut out migrants ""is not Christian."" The pope also warned against using fear as a political tool just days before the 2016 election, saying in addition to ""being a good deal for the merchants of arms and death,"" it ""also numbs us to the suffering of others."" Francis has also repeatedly condemned abortion, calling it ""murder"" and saying ""those who carry out abortions kill,"" regardless of how close an abortion is carried out to conception, Reuters reported in 2021. Francis, who approved blessings for same-sex couples last year, has developed a rocky relationship with conservatives in the Catholic Church, telling CBS's Norah O'Donnell in May that conservative church leaders in the U.S. were ""closed up inside a dogmatic box.""

Top senators briefed on 'major errors' leading up to Trump assassination attempt,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-senators-briefed-major-errors-leading-up-trump-assassination-attempt,2024-09-13T18:40:45Z,"Lawmakers said an interim report is expected to be released on what they've learned so far about the shooting.

A handful of leading senators on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) were briefed Thursday by Acting U.S. Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe on the investigation into the July assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump.

""I think the American people are going to be shocked, astonished and appalled by what we will report to them about the failures by the Secret Service in this assassination attempt on the former president,"" HSGAC Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) Chairman Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told Fox News Digital following the briefing.

The senator refused to go into details about what he heard in the meeting, however.

Rowe briefed Blumenthal, PSI Ranking Member Ron Johnson, R-Wis., HSGAC Chairman Gary Peters, D-Mich., and HSGAC Ranking Member Rand Paul, R-Ky., before venturing to the House of Representatives to similarly brief the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump.

""I do think that the director is attempting to try to make sure this doesn't happen again. And so I do appreciate that he's trying,"" Paul said after exiting the briefing.

He added that ""major errors"" occurred on July 13 when Trump was shot in the ear at an outdoor campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and one attendee was killed, while two others were critically injured.

He detailed that the committee's bipartisan interim report on the assassination attempt would be coming out in a few days.

""I think it's going to identify very specific errors that were made in this,"" Paul said.

Peters emphasized that the forthcoming report will ""only be an interim report because there's a lot more information that we need to find.""

""We hope once this report comes out, and we can get the additional information necessary to have a complete report of what happened, as well as steps of what we need to do in the future to make sure that this never happens,"" he told Fox News.

The Secret Service provided senators with an initial briefing just days after the assassination attempt, which left many senators unsatisfied. At the time, Johnson said ""virtually no information"" was shared, and the discussion was primarily to ""check the box.""

A Peters aide told Fox News Digital one day after the shooting that the committee would be launching an investigation into the assassination attempt, also revealing that the chairman was scheduled to speak with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Mayorkas that weekend."

A number of the biggest names in Hollywood came out in support of Biden before he dropped out of the race, before turning their support to Harris. Olivia Rodrigo, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris by sharing a video of a speech the vice president gave promising to ""stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans."" Major Democratic fundraiser George Clooney, who used a New York Times essay to call for Biden to drop out of the race, lent his support to Harris and Barbra Streisand said she would support Harris because of her vow to fight for reproductive rights. Musician John Legend, who performed at the Democratic National Convention in 2024, posted he was ""so ready"" for a Harris presidency. Director Spike Lee, ""West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin, director Ken Burns and Star Wars actor Mark Hamill threw their support behind Harris, along with actresses Rosie O'Donnell and Jamie Lee Curtis. Robert De Niro, who narrated an advertisement for the Biden campaign, praised the president's ""selfless patriotism"" in a statement that did not mention Harris but said ""there is nothing more important for our country than defeating Donald Trump at the ballot box."" British pop artist Charli XCX brought Harris into the Gen Z fold by tweeting ""kamala IS brat,"" an endorsement that was met by Harris' team changing the background photo on her X account to the ""brat"" green color and using the same font used on Charli XCX's album of the same name. Rapper Cardi B, who in May said she wouldn't be endorsing Biden, tweeted ""AHAHAHAHA LETS GOOOOO I TOLD YALLL KAMALA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 2024 candidate...."" Pop musician Kesha said she plans to support Harris in November and, when asked how she felt about Vance, responded ""f -- - that man."" Beyoncé has not made a public endorsement but did give the Harris campaign permission to use her song ""Freedom"" in a video of her first official visit to her campaign's headquarters, a rare approval from the superstar musician. Beyoncé's mom and businesswoman Tina Knowles endorsed Harris with an Instagram post. Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle and former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have also thrown their support behind Harris. Former President Jimmy Carter, 99, reportedly told his son last week he was trying to make it to his 100th birthday so he could cast his vote for Kamala Harris. ""Sex in the City"" actress and former New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon threw her support behind Harris and her Vice Presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, in a post that read: ""I'm Walzing on air!"" Billionaire Mark Cuban, who previously said he was committed to voting for Biden, has also supported Harris and endorsed Walz as her running mate, calling him someone who ""can sit at the kitchen table and make you feel like you have know him forever."" Actor Tony Goldwyn, Republican political commentator Ana Navarro, comedian Mindy Kaling and actress Kerry Washington each supported the Harris-Walz campaign by hosting one evening of the Democratic National Convention. Nick Offerman, Jane Fonda, Ben Stiller, Kathy Griffin, John Stamos, Ed Helms, Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz were among those who appeared on a ""Comics for Harris"" virtual rally via Zoom, which reportedly raised close to half a million dollars for the Harris campaign. Over Labor Day weekend, a fundraiser for the Democratic ticket in Southampton, New York was hosted by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and fashion designer Tory Burch, among others. Actors Matt Damon and Lin-Manuel Miranda will attend fundraiser in New York City in September -- for which tickets are listed at $25,000 per person -- to support the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket, Bloomberg reported.

Former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan ripped off his shirt while on stage at the Republican National Convention last month to reveal a Trump-Vance campaign shirt underneath, and called Trump his ""hero"" and the ""greatest president of the United States."" Musician Kid Rock has been vocal about his support of Trump in the past and at the RNC revamped his song ""American Bad Ass"" to include references to Trump. UFC President and personality Dana White called Trump the ""toughest, most resilient human being."" Rapper and reality TV star Amber Rose gave a speech at the RNC in support of Trump. Country music stars Chris Janson and Jason Aldean also appeared at the convention. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy in January said voting for Trump over Biden was a ""no-brainer."" Public-facing billionaires like Elon Musk and Steve Wynn have also supported the former president. Actress Rosanne Barr, a longtime conservative supporter of Trump, clapped back at Cuban's endorsement of the Harris-Walz ticket and called the VP pick ""another reason Harris is a disaster."" Rapper Azealia Banks last year said she would vote for Donald Trump in Novemebr and she appeared at a rally in Florida this summer. Actor Jon Voight has defended Trump on multiple occasions. 50 Cent's 2023 song ""Many Men (Wish Death)"" started trending online after the assassination attempt of Trump last month. The rapper responded by putting Trump's face on the cover of his ""Get Rich or Die Tryin.'"" While it's hard to call the response an official endorsement, he did appear to support the president in 2020 before apparently backtracking. Other celebrities who have supported Trump in the past, but not outright endorsed him yet this election season, include Lil Wayne and ""Happy Days"" star Scott Baio.

Notable names missing from the list of public supporters include billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who called the decision ""too important to rush,"" and Taylor Swift, who pledged support for Biden last election cycle, has not come out for a candidate."
Gen Z women will be critical in this year's election. Here's what they care most about.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/out-of-office/gen-z-women-will-critical-years-election-s-care-rcna170820,2024-09-13T17:00:43Z,"Attendees at the YWCA GenZ voters town hall.Courtesy YWCA USA

Young women voters played a critical role in the 2020 elections. And they're expected to be a deciding factor once again in November.

Over 40 million Gen Zers -- between the ages of 18 and 27 -- will be eligible to vote this year. That includes 20 million women and four million newly eligible new women voters who aged into the electorate since the 2022 midterm elections. And according to new data, there has been a surge of new voter registration for young people in key battleground states.

So, what issues matter most to them?

According to a new national survey by YWCA, Gen Z women voters consider issues like cost of living, healthcare and gun violence as the top issues of importance, which is true for those in other generations. But compared to other issues, they've rated them lower and instead spread their priorities out over multiple issues.

Researchers said the fact that Gen Z voters are ranking the importance of so many issues speaks to their high anxiety about the future.

""There's so many issues, it feels very overwhelming,"" said UCLA student Genevive Chin at a recent Gen Z voter townhall put together by the YWCA on September 7 in Philadelphia. ""Especially with everyone being very connected online, you can see all these issues on your phone, on your daily news. They're right in your face, even if they're not directly in your community.""

I had a chance to moderate a discussion with a group of seven Gen Z leaders from across the country, who shared their priorities on some most of the most pressing topics ahead of the 2024 election. The provided solutions they'd like to see from elected officials and their vision for the future.

A key message to elected officials? ""This is a job interview,"" said graduate student Lalitha Pamidigantam. ""You better come prepared to answer my questions and tell me exactly how you're going to earn my vote. There is no free ride. Not in a red state, not in a swing state, not in a blue state. You have to earn my vote.""

Nearly half of Gen Z voters in the U.S. are young people of color, and race was an important issue among Gen Zers on the panel.

Alicia Wicks, a student at Clark Atlanta University, said racial justice is extremely important to her generation, especially as diversity, equity and inclusion efforts are being rolled back across the country.

""African-American children are being stripped of their identities,"" said Wicks. ""We're seeing in different states legislation being passed... banning books, and curriculum. These children are growing up going to predominantly white institutions and losing a piece of themselves that is very fundamental to them as an individual...We need to elect officials who are going to protect our rights, protect who we are as a people.""

Jasmine Lopez, an Indian-American student from Tucson, Arizona spoke about the role of racial justice for tribal communities.

""We have lost our language. We have lost culture, we have lost an important way of life. And we cannot let that happen again,"" said Lopez. ""...We have to protect our population. And we see it in our education, we see it on our border, in our land.""

On abortion access

Caroline Vanchiere, who is from Houston, Texas and studies at the London School of Economics, emphasized that reproductive rights is healthcare. She explained that in the aftermath of Roe v. Wade being overturned ""There's this concern that if you're not politically aligned with your OB/GYN, they may share information that you told them in confidence. The situation in Texas makes people fearful to get or even ask about the care that they need which is really heartbreaking, especially in a country that already has the worst performance in maternal mortality of any developed country.""

Pamidigantam said abortion access is among her top three most pressing matters heading into the election. ""I am from Ohio, where our incredible organizers did an amazing job of putting abortion on the ballot and won last year... It is a sacred right to our own bodies, to our autonomy. And it's not just for women. It's for all people who need access to reproductive health care. All people need it. All people deserve it. And we will not lose it.""

On mental health

According to the survey, 47 percent of Gen Z said mental health was central to their identity, and 75 percent said it's a very important issue policymakers need to address. The vast majority -- 94 percent -- said it was crucial to expand access to affordable mental health care.

Ollie Henry, a recent graduate from Georgetown University who is disabled, noted that while the Covid-19 lockdown was a particularly tough time for many young people with intersecting identities.

""That isolation for so many of my friends, that meant being in home environments that were not safe, where they could not be queer, where they could not be trans, where they did not have access to therapy services that were culturally competent, where they did not have access to the basic things that they really needed in terms of social engagement,"" they said. ""That takes a huge toll on someone's mental health ... And now we know that mental health is actually integral for us to do anything else in life. Mental health is just as important as physical health as spiritual health or any other form of health.""

On social media and online harassment

The YWCA survey showed that women experience twice as much online harassment than older generations.

""As a woman, you may receive messages or certain things online that you're like, you know, I did not ask for this... And you don't really know what to do with it,"" shared Vanchiere. ""You maybe will joke about it to a friend and like, what are your options? You report them on Instagram and that just doesn't really feel like much of a solution. And so, I think there's still a lot that needs to be developed in terms of how do we better moderate and educate individuals on how to handle the situation?""

Leilani Nti, a student at Emory University in Georgia, says that education on social media, and education on online harassment should be taught in school. ""If we really want students to learn and children to learn how to be in community with one another, we need to meet them where they are at and where we're at is online. [We need to be] teaching students what sexual assault is ... what sexual assault can mean in various contexts...It's the responsibility of our education system and ultimately the responsibility of our politicians.""

Henry said he wants politicians to create safer online communities.

""Speaking for myself specifically, online spaces are sometimes the only space I can access,"" said Henry. ""If I can't get out of bed, I still want to be social. I still want to talk to friends. I still want to be invested and involved in community and online spaces are the way to do that. But when people are using that as a space to spew hate and to genuinely like genuine only cause harm to others, that keeps me from being able to participate. That keeps me from being able to be in community. So really, those online spaces we do, we need better legislation around what internet safety looks like, while also still preserving the free thought and beautiful connections that are able to develop on social media.""

Their message to politicians

The Gen Z panel also wanted to set the record straight on stereotypes around their generation (they are anything but ""uneducated"") as well as their conviction to hold leaders accountable. ""I want politicians to be afraid to lose their position. I want you guys to know that Gen Z is not afraid to come for your positions. Gen Z is not afraid to kick you out,"" said Lopez.

""My message to politicians is we are watching, looking at your track record,"" added Wicks. ""I'm looking at what you want to do to benefit not only African-American women, but women of color, women, nationally, globally, locally, in our communities. What are you doing to impact those day to day? And that's very crucial. And that's something that I'm going to stay on top of."""
ABC's Linsey Davis admits fact-checking of Trump was because CNN let his statements 'hang' at first debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/abcs-linsey-davis-admits-fact-checking-trump-because-cnn-statements-hang-first-debate,2024-09-13T16:46:33Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

ABC News anchor Linsey Davis admitted in a post-debate interview that her fact-checking of former President Trump was influenced by the earlier CNN debate that went disastrously for President Biden.

In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, David said she wanted to address concerns that Trump's statements could be allowed to ""hang"" there unchallenged by his opponent or the moderators, as they were when Trump and Biden debated on CNN in June.

""Davis, wearing pink glasses while speaking to The Times over breakfast at the Ritz Carlton in Philadelphia, said the decision to attempt to correct the candidates was in response to the June 27 CNN debate between Trump and President Biden, whose poor performance led to his exit from the race,"" the Times reported.

""People were concerned that statements were allowed to just hang and not [be] disputed by the candidate Biden, at the time, or the moderators,"" Davis told the outlet on Wednesday morning.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH ABORTION FACT-CHECK AGAINST TRUMP: 'COMPLETELY INTERJECTS HERSELF'

The LA Times gushed over Davis in the profile, calling her a ""rising star"" who ""held Trump's feet to the fire.""

In one viral moment, Davis sternly told Trump that ""there is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born,"" after Trump invoked former Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam's remarks in 2019 suggesting a live baby could be killed after being born, following a ""discussion"" between the physician and the mother.

While liberals celebrated the moment, one pro-life group demanded a correction from ABC News, saying Davis' comments were ""100% inaccurate.""

Since the debate, both Muir and Davis have been slammed by critics for appearing biased towards Vice President Kamala Harris. The debate moderators fact-checked Trump five times and failed to correct Harris a single time on Tuesday evening.

Trump alleged bias by the ABC moderators as well, telling Fox & Friends on Wednesday, ""It was three to one. It was a rigged deal as I assumed it would be.""

Despite zero fact-checks for Harris, Davis insisted that her team intended to fact-check both candidates throughout the course of the night.

The LA Times stated, ""With co-moderator David Muir, Davis had studied hours of campaign rallies and interviews to prepare for the much-anticipated event at Philadelphia's National Constitution Center, and were ready to counter the candidates' most egregious statements.""

FOX NEWS MEDIA PROPOSES SECOND HARRIS-TRUMP DEBATE MODERATED BY MARTHA MACCALLUM, BRET BAIER

Davis countered accusations of bias by stating that she and Muir could not catch every misstatement, the Times reported, without noting that none of Harris' incorrect statements received rebukes.

Elsewhere in the article, the outlet noted how Davis simply ignored the criticism that she was helping Harris, reporting that she shut off her social media accounts.

""There is a stereotype that I am acutely aware of that I can't be unbiased covering this moment. And the anonymous Instagram people serve as reminders every day,"" Davis said.

Fox News Digital reached out to ABC News for comment."
Here's Where Abortion Is On The Ballot In November -- As Nebraska Measures Upheld In Court,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/09/13/heres-where-abortion-is-on-the-ballot-in-november-as-nebraska-measures-upheld-in-court/,2024-09-13T16:42:48Z,"The Nebraska Supreme Court ruled Friday that the state's planned questions on abortion rights can stay on the ballot, as 10 states are set to have abortion on their November ballot -- including some where the procedure is now banned.

Abortion is totally banned in Missouri and South Dakota, meaning the ballot measures in those states would overturn the bans if they're passed by voters and restore abortion access. They would also have an impact in Florida, which bans abortion after six weeks, and Arizona, where abortion is banned after 15 weeks. Nebraska has a 12-week ban in place now, so voting in favor of the pro-abortion rights amendment would undo that ban, while the anti-abortion rights measure would make the 12-week ban permanent. Abortion is still legal in Colorado, Maryland, Nevada and New York, but enshrining the protections in state law would ensure legislators can't impose bans in the future. Montana has also preserved the right to an abortion, as the state constitution already specifies a right to privacy that has led to abortion bans getting struck down, but the proposed ballot measure language would be even more explicit that the procedure is allowed. Approximately 20 states now have some form of abortion ban in place.

The Nebraska Supreme Court upheld both of the state's abortion measures remaining on the ballot Friday, ruling the pro-abortion rights referendum did not violate a law on ballot measures only dealing with a single subject, as opponents claimed. While the challenge focused on alleged issues with the pro-abortion rights measure, pro-abortion rights advocates challenged the anti-abortion measure remaining in place if the pro-abortion one was struck down, saying either both measures should appear on the ballot or neither of them. The ruling came days after the Missouri Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that state's abortion measure can stay on the ballot after a lower state judge said it was invalid, siding with opponents of the measure who alleged it was ""insufficient"" because it didn't properly say how it would affect existing state laws. Missouri Attorney General Jay Ashcroft decertified the ballot measure after the lower court's ruling -- prompting an effort by Democrats to hold him in contempt -- but the state's highest court then ruled the measure was valid after all and Ashcroft must put it back on the ballot. The tussles were part of a broader effort by Republicans to challenge abortion ballot measures even just weeks before the election, with court battles also ongoing in South Dakota, while Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration is investigating signatures in favor of that state's measure.

While many states have accepted ballot measures on abortion this election cycle, Arkansas' potential ballot measure was rejected in court. The state initially rejected the ballot measure application for paperwork issues and organizers then sued the state, but the Arkansas Supreme Court ruled in August in the state'. Organizers submitted enough signatures for the measure to make the ballot but the state claimed they didn't correctly submit a sworn statement regarding instructing canvassers who collected the signatures, which the state Supreme Court upheld.

Abortion ballot measures have been met with significant resistance by GOP politicians and anti-abortion rights advocates in the states where they've been considered and approved. Beyond the court battles playing out in Nebraska and South Dakota, anti-abortion groups in a number of states have gone to court to challenge technical issues with applications, signatures received in support of the measures, the wording of various proposals and other alleged issues. Opponents told Politico in July their aim was to block the measures from making the ballot, though many legal challenges have continued even after that point. ""We are working to make sure it doesn't get on the ballot in the first place,"" Jill Norgaard, a board member of Arizona Right to Life and former member of the Arizona House of Representatives, told the outlet about the state's ballot measure before it was approved.

85%. That's the share of U.S. adults who think abortion should be legal in at least some circumstances, according to Gallup polling released in May. A Public Religion Research Institute poll released in May found residents in all but five states believe abortion should be at least mostly legal -- though those five states include South Dakota, where only 47% reported supporting abortion rights ahead of the ballot measure this fall.

Among the people who will vote on Florida's abortion ballot measure is former President Donald Trump, who has said he believes abortion should be left up to the states. The ex-president has said he will vote against the Florida measure even as he's criticized the state's six-week ban. When asked at the presidential debate on Tuesday about his vote, Trump claimed he was opposing the measure because it would allow abortion in the ""ninth month,"" though in actuality the measure would only allow abortions until the fetus is viable unless medically necessary. Abortions in the final months of a pregnancy are exceedingly rare.

Abortion ballot measures have emerged as a successful way to protect abortion rights in the past two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, setting off a wave of state-level bans. While Republican legislators have been eager to ban the procedure, abortion rights supporters have used ballot measures to harness public support in favor of abortion, hamstringing lawmakers from imposing restrictions in even some Republican-leaning states. Kansas was the first state to put abortion on the ballot in August 2022, with 59% of voters opposing a measure that would have paved the way for abortions to be restricted. Five states then had abortion-related measures on the ballot in the 2022 midterms -- California, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana and Vermont -- with Ohio following suit last year. All votes have broken in favor of abortion rights."

Justin Timberlake appeared in court Friday in connection to his June DWI arrest.

The former *NSYNC star pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was given community service, 25-40 hours.

Timberlake reached a plea agreement with prosecutors before the hearing. Details of the agreement weren't disclosed, but a person with knowledge of the deal said Timberlake has agreed to admit guilt to a lesser offense of ""driving while ability impaired,"" a traffic violation that carries a $300 to $500 fine and a 90-day license suspension.

JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE EXPECTED TO CUT PLEA DEAL IN DWI CASE

Timberlake arrived to court wearing black sunglasses and accessorized with a double strand pearl necklace. The musician was joined by an entourage of people - including his lawyer, Ed Burke Jr., bodyguards and his music manager, Johnny Wright.

When pulled over by authorities the morning of June 18, Timberlake ""performed poorly on all standardized field sobriety tests,"" the arresting officer claimed in documents obtained by Fox News Digital.

Timberlake had ""bloodshot and glossy"" eyes, a ""strong odor of an alcoholic beverage was emanating from his breath"" and he was ""unable to divide attention,"" according to the complaint. The ""Cry Me A River"" singer also exhibited ""slowed speech"" and was ""unsteady afoot.""

Ed Burke Jr., Timberlake's lawyer, previously claimed police made ""significant errors"" during the musician's June arrest.

""The most important fact to know about this case is that Justin was not intoxicated and should not have been arrested for DWI,"" Burke said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""The police made a number of very significant errors in this case. In court today, you heard the district attorney try to fix one of those errors. But that's just one, and there are many others. Sometimes the police make mistakes, and this is just one of those instances.""

Timberlake was originally charged with one count of driving while intoxicated along with citations for failure to keep right and failure to stop at a stop sign, the district attorney's office confirmed to Fox News Digital.

The pop star told the arresting officer he had one martini and was following some friends home, according to the documents. After being arrested and taken to a police station in nearby East Hampton, he refused a breath test, according to the court papers, which listed his occupation as ""professional"" and said he's ""self-employed.""

Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) called out Timberlake's plea deal.

""MADD does not support plea deals in cases involving impaired driving, as we believe justice should be fully served for such a serious crime,"" a spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""Driving while impaired is a dangerous and reckless choice that puts lives at risk, and the consequences should reflect the gravity of that decision. Plea deals diminish the severity of impaired driving, which is a violent crime that kills and injures thousands of people every year.""

""MADD has asked for Mr. Timberlake to do the right thing by using his significant platform to raise awareness about the dangers of impaired driving and help prevent this crime,"" the statement continued. ""Though it has been reported that Mr. Timberlake will produce a PSA with MADD, we have not been formally contacted by his representatives. MADD will continue to advocate for justice and accountability in every impaired driving case, and we hope Timberlake's future decisions reflect the seriousness of this issue and contribute meaningfully to our cause.""

Timberlake addressed his drunk driving arrest days after it happened at his Chicago stop of ""The Forget The World Tomorrow Tour.""

""It's been a tough week,"" the 10-time Grammy winner told fans at the United Center during his first performance following the arrest. ""I know I'm hard to love sometimes, but you keep loving me right back.""

The ""Bye Bye Bye"" singer took some heat earlier this year when Britney Spears wrote about their relationship in her memoir. The pop star alleged the former couple had an abortion, and she addressed Timberlake's infamous ""Cry Me A River"" music video which featured a Spears look-a-like.

Spears claimed she was painted as a ""harlot who'd broken the heart of America's golden boy"" by the media.

Timberlake took the stage shortly after and seemingly responded to Spears, saying, ""I'd like to take this opportunity to apologize to absolutely f------ nobody.""

"JD Vance flubs economic basics, adding to his list of troubles",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vance-economy-immigration-republican-basics-election-2024-rcna171001,2024-09-13T13:50:20Z,"JD Vance was already suffering through a humiliating week. Then he started flubbing the basics of economic and immigration policy on national television.

Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance was struggling long before last week, but an eight-day stretch helped capture why the Ohio senator wasn't a great choice for the GOP's national ticket.

On Wednesday, Sept. 4, delivered a ridiculous and widely mocked answer what can be done to address the cost of child care. A day later, he lamented that deadly mass shootings in schools are a ""fact of life"" -- a comment that sparked fierce and immediate pushback.

On Monday, Vance threw his support behind a ridiculous and racist conspiracy theory about immigrants abducting and eating pets, and on Tuesday, he endorsed a brazenly illegal response to Donald Trump's 2020 election defeat. That evening, the former president distanced himself from Vance's rhetoric about abortion policy during a nationally televised debate.

Two days later, the senator sat down with CNBC hosts to discuss the economy, and he managed to top off a brutal eight-day stretch with an interview in which he didn't appear to have any idea what he was talking about.

After badly flubbing the basics on the inflationary effects of tariffs, Vance tried to argue that immigration is bad for the economy:

So, a few things.

First, the ""25 million illegal aliens"" figure is ridiculously wrong. Given Vance's apparent interest in immigration policy, it's weird to see him struggle with such a basic detail.

Second, the vice president is not chiefly responsible for federal immigration laws -- though she did endorse a bipartisan solution that Vance's running mate killed, despite the legislation's merits, because he was afraid helping the country might hurt his 2024 candidacy.

Third, while it's true that housing costs in Springfield, Ohio, have gone up, it's because the local economy is improving -- despite Trump's insane claims that the community has been destroyed by pet-eating immigrants.

Fourth, the idea that Springfield has suffered economically as a result of immigration is the exact opposite of what has actually happened in reality. As Vance really ought to know -- he ostensibly represents Ohio -- we're talking about a community on the rise, not decline.

But perhaps most notable of all was the hapless senator's insistence that if immigration benefited the economy, the United States ""would be the most prosperous country in the world.""

Whether Vance understands this or not, the United States is already the most prosperous country in the world. In fact, we're the most prosperous country by a wide margin.

To be sure, such confusion is expected from Trump, who's relationship with reality has long been fractured, but Vance is supposed to be the more knowledgeable one. It leads to an unavoidable question:

Is the Republican senator really this confused about issues he claims to care about, or is the vice presidential hopeful assuming that voters are foolish enough to believe demonstrable nonsense?"
Four ways Trump can get to a 96% chance of winning,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/four-ways-trump-can-get-96-chance-winning,2024-09-13T13:04:22Z,"The 2016 election hinged on 40,000 votes in key Midwest states. This time the margin of victory, or defeat, may be even more dramatic: 10,000 to 20,000 Pennsylvanians - or the student section at a Penn State football game.

According to election guru Nate Silver, if former President Donald Trump wins the Keystone State, his chances of winning the White House are 96%. We know Trump's strengths with men - and his weaknesses with women. Thus, the entire race could hinge on his ability to persuade several thousand women in Pennsylvania to turn his way.

Easier said than done, as this election poses new challenges. For the first time, abortion has surpassed the economy as the No. 1 issue for female voters under 45 years of age. For women overall, abortion is now neck-and-neck with the economy as the preeminent issue.

HARRIS, TRUMP ENTER POST-DEBATE 'HOMESTRETCH' WITH DUELING RALLIES IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES

With this backdrop, some perspective and prudence are needed:

First, Trump should be given leeway by the right in his approach to abortion. For the past 50 years, Republicans have had the benefit of a single unifying message: overturn Roe vs Wade.

Now, the debate has changed, and even the most pro-life states and governors vary on their state-specific policies. And the political reality is that most Americans are somewhere in the middle on this difficult issue, like in Pennsylvania, where abortion is legal up to 24 weeks.

Trump delivered on his promise to appoint judges who would overturn Roe and send the issue back to the states. It's not the perfect solution, but it's a solution for the hardest question in American political life. The right should give Trump the latitude to explain these positions and assure Pennsylvanians that the issue is now in their hands.

Second, remind parents of what is at stake. Suburban moms may have little regard for Trump's style, personality and rough-and-ready approach to policy and people, but, when he was president, he fought to keep kids in the classroom during COVID-19 and nonsense out. Democrats, and their teachers union allies, have done the opposite.

Despite what many view as his personality defects, Trump ran a good country and was on the side of parents and students. The question is not who we would rather have as a classroom teacher -- Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris -- but who's more likely to wield government to interfere with our children, to try to shape them and their views in the things we do not believe or are none of their business. The answer, to us, seems obvious.

Third, expose Harris's hypocrisy on fracking -- a key industry for Pennsylvanians. Admittedly, it's hard to know what Harris is running for - but it's clear what she's running from: her record.

She previously said she would ban fracking. She said she would abolish the filibuster to pass the Green New Deal. She passed the deciding vote for the Inflation Reduction Act -- arguably the largest ""green"" pork bill ever passed. On their first day in office, the Biden-Harris administration canceled the Keystone XL Pipeline, and they've blocked oil and gas leases on large swaths of federal lands.

Trump delivered on his promise to appoint judges who would overturn Roe and send the issue back to the states. It's not the perfect solution, but it's a solution for the hardest question in American political life. The right should give Trump the latitude to explain these positions and assure Pennsylvanians that the issue is now in their hands.

This is an administration beholden to radical environmentalists; she pays lip service to fracking because she knows the political stakes. Or as Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said recently, she's ""doing what she thinks is right in order to win the election.""

Finally, let us not forget Butler, Pennsylvania, ever. In that field north of Pittsburgh, Trump made his strongest case to date. As he rose defiantly in the face of death, he demonstrated his best quality: he's a fighter for his country. Whether it's the Russia collusion hoax, the bogus lawfare, or a near assassination, he doesn't back down. That's a quality that Pennsylvanians respect, and it could make the difference.

Conservatives say a recent study showing Vice President Kamala Harris receiving significantly more favorable coverage on ABC's ""World News Tonight with David Muir"" than former President Trump should have been a clear indicator that Tuesday night's debate was going to be hostile territory.

ABC News has come under fire after Muir and co-moderator Linsey Davis repeatedly fact-checked Trump while failing to correct Harris even a single time. The ABC moderators have also been urged to issue a correction on their abortion coverage and were scolded for giving Harris a pass on her explanation for recent policy flip-flops.

Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt wrote that the ""journalistic reputations of Muir and Davis are the most scarred by the fiasco,"" but ""the damage will extend to both the ABC and Disney brands"" because the moderators failed to ask more critical questions of Harris.

CNN PANEL CLASHES AFTER DEMOCRATIC GUEST SUGGESTS DEBATE MODERATORS WERE 'HARSHER' ON TRUMP

Media Research Center founder Brent Bozell said on the NewsBusters Podcast t that Harris had a clear advantage that should have been apparent.

""Whoever recommended that [Trump] do that debate on ABC should be fired. It was about the worst decision that could have been made,"" Bozell said on Wednesday when discussing what he feels are the Disney-owned network's biases.

The debate was hardly the first time ABC News has been accused of favoring Democrats over Trump or painting the GOP nominee in a negative light. The network's daytime gabfest ""The View,"" which falls under the umbrella of ABC's news division, has been overtly anti-Trump for years and summoned Chelsea Clinton to guest-host on Thursday. The show's hosts were gleeful over the debate, with Whoopi Goldberg calling it a ""booty whooping.""

ABC's flagship late-night show, ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!,"" is also regularly critical of Trump and booked prominent anti-Trump figures Jane Fonda and George Conway as guests following the network's coverage of the debate. Kimmel even helped with a fundraiser for Biden when he was the nominee earlier this year.

When it comes to the debate moderators, Davis seemingly linked Trump to the Ku Klux Klan by noting during ABC coverage of the Democratic National Convention that the former president was scheduled to appear in the same Michigan town where the KKK held a protest earlier this year.

VOTERS GIVE HARRIS THE DEBATE WIN, BUT PRAISE TRUMP ON POLICY: SHE GOT UNDER HIS SKIN

As for Muir, the conservative Media Research Center found prior to the debate that his program, ""World News Tonight,"" has been more ""positive towards Harris and the most hostile to Trump"" compared to evening newscasts on NBC and CBS.

Bozell's MRC reviewed 100 campaign stories on ABC's ""World News Tonight"" that aired from July 21 when Harris entered the race through September 6.

""Our analysts found 25 clearly positive statements about Harris from reporters, anchors, voters or other non-partisan sources, with zero negative statements -- none. That computes to a gravity-defying 100% positive spin score for the Vice President,"" MRC NewsBusters contributing editor Rich Noyes wrote.

""As for Trump, our analysts found just five clearly positive comments, vs. 66 negative statements, for a dismal 7 percent positive -- 93% negative -- spin score,"" Noyes continued. ""During these same weeks, both the 'CBS Evening News' and 'NBC Nightly News' also delivered highly positive coverage for Harris, and mostly negative coverage for Trump, yet not as extreme as we found with ABC's 'World News Tonight.'""

Notes explained that MRC's measure of good versus bad press omitted partisan comments, ""as well as 'horse race' assessments about the candidates' poll standings and prospects."" The MRC added ""ABC's reporters and anchors either jumped in to criticize Trump themselves, or broadcast negative comments from non-partisan sources to impart a heavily negative spin to the former President's coverage.""

MRC researchers also pointed to ""other ways that ABC's flagship newscast aided the Democratic nominee"" ahead of the presidential debate.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH ABORTION FACT-CHECK AGAINST TRUMP: 'COMPLETELY INTERJECTS HERSELF'

The MRC wrote that ""World News Tonight"" hasn't used the word ""liberal"" to describe Harris, hasn't spoken to voters who oppose Harris and regularly promotes Trump controversies while ""hiding"" negative news about Harris.

Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America also sent a letter to ABC News president Almin Karamehmedovic, along with Muir and Davis, urging the network to issue a correction about a ""100% inaccurate"" abortion claim made during the debate.

Trump referred to infamous comments made by former Virginia Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam in 2019 but was promptly ""fact-checked"" by Davis. At the time, Northam suggested that in some rare instances of third-trimester abortions, a baby could be born alive and a ""discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother"" about what to do.

""There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born,"" Davis sternly responded to Trump at the debate.

TRUMP'S DEFAMATION LAWSUIT AGAINST ABC, GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS CAN MOVE FORWARD, JUDGE RULES

Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America says the ABC moderator was ""inaccurate"" and should correct the record.

""This is 100% inaccurate. Her statement tragically ignores the reality of babies who survive failed, late-term abortions but are denied basic medical care and left to die,"" Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America president Marjorie Dannenfelser wrote in a letter to ABC bigwigs.

ABC News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Meanwhile, Dana Walden, a senior Disney executive whose portfolio includes ABC News, is one of Harris' ""extraordinary friends,"" according to a report in the New York Times. Walden and Harris have known each other since 1994, while their husbands, Matt Walden and Doug Emhoff, have known each other since the 1980s.

ABC told the New York Times that Walden, who is Disney's highest-ranking television executive, does not weigh in on editorial decisions. She has donated to dozens of Democrats and has contributed to Harris' political campaigns since at least 2003.

Defamation lawsuit against CNN could expose company's financial secrets as court seeks to expose net worth,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/defamation-lawsuit-against-cnn-could-expose-companys-financial-secrets,2024-09-13T09:10:33Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

CNN faces a defamation lawsuit over a 2021 story centered around the chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal and a recent ruling could expose financial secrets as the court seeks to determine the cable network's net worth.

The plaintiff, Zachary Young, alleges that CNN smeared his security consulting company, Nemex Enterprises Inc., by implying it illegally profited when helping people flee Afghanistan during the Biden administration's military withdrawal from the country in 2021. A civil trial is scheduled to begin on January 6, 2025 in front of Judge William Henry in the Circuit Court for Bay County, Florida.

Last week, Henry paved the way for Young to issue a subpoena for CNN to hand over a plethora of sensitive financial information that the cable network presented to its parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.

""Essentially, this will act as a way to double check to see if CNN was being honest with the financial documents they were turning over as part of discovery; comparing what they turned over to Young's legal team vs what they told corporate,"" NewsBusters associate editor Nicholas Fondacaro wrote when covering the hearing.

CNN FACES DEFAMATION SUIT OVER AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL STORY: 'EVIDENCE OF ACTUAL MALICE'

Puck reporter Eriq Gardner wrote that the judge's decision ""sent a jolt through CNN's executives offices.""

""Young has won a green light to seek punitive damages,"" Gardner wrote.

""Accordingly, Young's attorneys will soon be receiving documents to assess CNN's net worth, so they can argue before a jury just how big a penalty Young should receive,"" he continued. ""The judge has also ordered a deposition for Jake Tapper, who will likely have to disclose his salary and contract negotiations.

Tapper's salary will be particularly interesting to now-former CNN employees who were let go during a recent round of cost-cutting headcount reductions. The network announced in July that roughly 100 staffers would be let go.

Gardner also reported that CNN's lawyer Charles Tobin ""visibly bristled at the ruling"" and told the judge that the October 11 deadline to comply ""upends"" his plans.

Young, a U.S. Navy veteran, believes CNN ""destroyed his reputation and business by branding him an illegal profiteer who exploited desperate Afghans"" during a Nov. 11, 2021, segment on CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper,"" which was shared on social media and also repackaged for CNN's website.

Tapper began the segment by informing viewers that CNN correspondent Alex Marquardt discovered ""Afghans trying to get out of the country face a black market full of promises, demands of exorbitant fees, and no guarantee of safety or success.""

Tapper tossed to Marquardt, who said ""desperate Afghans are being exploited"" and need to pay ""exorbitant, often impossible amounts"" to flee the country. Marquardt then singled out Young, putting a picture of his face on the screen and saying his company was asking for $75,000 to transport a vehicle of passengers to Pakistan for $14,500 per person to end up in the United Arab Emirates.

""Prices well beyond the reach of most Afghans,"" Marquardt told viewers.

ABC NEWS REBUKED BY PRO-LIFE GROUP, ASKED FOR CORRECTION OF ABORTION CLAIM BY DEBATE MODERATOR

""We got Young's number and called, but he didn't pick up. In a text message, he told CNN that 'Afghans trying to leave are expected to have sponsors pay for them. If someone reached out, we need to understand if they have a sponsor behind them to be able to pay evacuation costs which are highly volatile and based on environmental realities,'"" Marquardt continued. ""Young repeatedly declined to break down the cost or say if he's making money.""

No other people or companies were named other than Young.

""In another message, that person offering those evacuations, Zachary Young, he wrote, 'Availability is extremely limited and demand is high' ... he goes on to say, 'That's how economics works, unfortunately,'"" Marquardt told viewers.

Tapper responded, ""Unfortunately, hmm,"" before thanking Marquardt for the report.

Young alleged that CNN using the terms ""black market,"" ""exploit"" and ""exorbitant,"" painted him as a bad actor preying upon desperate people.

AFGHANISTAN GOLD STAR FATHER: BIDEN-HARRIS NEED TO 'OWN UP' TO THEIR MISTAKE, SAY SORRY

CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

It will be interesting to see if CNN chief media analyst Brian Stelter covers the story, as he recently returned to the network after being fired by previous management. His media newsletter didn't return until Monday and he did not post about the defamation suit on X while he was away from the network.

Earlier this year, judges with the First District Court of Appeal for the State of Florida ruled on June 12 that the Young offered enough evidence that he was able to move forward with a defamation suit against CNN for punitive damages.

""Young sufficiently proffered evidence of actual malice, express malice, and a level of conduct outrageous enough to open the door for him to seek punitive damages,"" the court document states. ""Whether Young can ultimately prevail is not the issue before us.""

The judges wrote, ""Young proffered CNN messages and emails that showed internal concern about the completeness and veracity of the reporting -- the story is 'a mess,' 'incomplete,' not 'fleshed out for digital,' 'the story is 80% emotion, 20% obscured fact,' and 'full of holes like Swiss cheese,'"" but the network aired it anyway.

""Young also proffered a message exchange he had with Marquardt just hours before publication where he advised there were factual inaccuracies in the reporting. CNN published anyway,"" the judges wrote, adding that other internal communications show CNN staffers ""had little regard"" for Young and used profanities and disparaging language when privately discussing him.

""Marquardt referred to him as 'f---ing Young' and quipped, ""it's your funeral bucko,'"" according to the court document.

""On appeal, CNN argues it did not intend to harm; its language was either opinion or ambiguous; and the internal communications were journalistic bravado that reflected a sincere belief in the reporting,"" the judges wrote."
Dems run on border bill Republicans say 'was never designed to solve the problem',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dems-run-border-bill-republicans-say-was-never-designed-solve-problem,2024-09-12T23:44:35Z,"Yuma, Arizona Mayor Doug Nicholls discusses how the border crisis is a top issue for Arizona voters as border crossings in the state increased under the Biden-Harris administration.

The immigration bill being used by vulnerable Democrats as evidence of their commitment to border security has been trashed by Republican senators, who claim the measure would have actually exacerbated the crisis at the southern border.

""That bill was awful. It killed itself,"" Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told Fox News Digital on Thursday of the bill that was negotiated by Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., and James Lankford, R-Okla.

""I'm not aware of anybody that Trump called,"" he added, with another GOP senator seconding this.

After former President Donald Trump himself came out against the measure, Democrats accused him of being responsible for its ultimate demise, and he further welcomed their blame. But several Republican senators said the bill was essentially dead on arrival, with or without Trump's input.

TOP HANDICAPPER GIVES GOP'S TIM SHEEHY EDGE AGAINST DEMOCRAT JON TESTER IN MONTANA RACE SHIFT

Republican senators prompted by Fox News Digital in the spring about Trump's involvement in lobbying against the border bill also denied that the former president was making calls.

On Thursday, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told Fox News Digital the bill was terrible. ""Chuck Schumer drafted it. He drafted it with the objective of keeping the current open borders open in perpetuity,"" he claimed.

Cruz listed concerns with the measure, including that it ""codified catch and release. The bill provided immediate work permits to illegal aliens when they came here. The bill provided taxpayer-funded attorneys to illegal aliens. The bill gave billions of dollars to sanctuary cities and NGOs that are aiding with human-traffickers and the bill normalized 5,000 illegal immigrants a day.""

""It was never designed to solve the problem,"" he said.

As the Texas senator referenced, the bill would have expanded what are known as alternatives to detention (ATD) for those who enter the country illegally, make work permits immediately available for those who pass initial asylum screenings, provide funding for attorneys to represent some unaccompanied minors, and would have established a threshold of an average of 5,000 border crossings a day for one week before ushering in a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) emergency authority that would bar illegal immigrants from entering the country between ports of entry.

He also pointed to the fact that chief Democrat negotiator, Murphy, wrote of the bill on X that, ""The border never closes, but claims must be processed at the ports.""

TEXAS DEM'S SENATE AD FEATURES BORDER WALL HE ONCE BLASTED AS 'RACIST'

Murphy didn't respond to Republican suggestions that his bill would have made the border worse and said it was false that it would have codified catch and release or that it would not actually ever shut down the border. ""Those are not true,"" he told Fox News Digital on Thursday.

The bill faced its first procedural vote in February as part of a supplemental spending deal that also included funding for aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. The vote was 49-50, failing to garner the necessary 60 votes to move forward. A supplemental foreign aid package ultimately passed without the border measure.

""There were a lot of good things in that bill, but in the end, we did not address the one thing that I think is a legitimate argument: That's trust in this administration to implement it,"" Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told reporters on Thursday.

ROGERS ADDRESSES ABORTION AMID SLOTKIN ATTACKS: 'MICHIGAN VOTERS HAVE ALREADY DECIDED'

Lankford, along with Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, were the only Republicans to vote in favor of the negotiated bill in February.

Senate Democrats revived the bill for a second procedural vote in May, which failed again by a worse margin. Two of the three negotiators, Sinema and Lankford, voted against it in the ultimate 43-50 vote. Both Romney and Collins also voted against advancing it in the second vote.

Collins told Fox News Digital on Thursday, ""I don't think it was the be all and end all, but I think it would have helped.""

Democrats running for Senate have panned their Republican counterparts for coming out against the negotiated bill, and have used their support for it during their respective campaigns to demonstrate that they will work to address the border.

For example, Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., who is embroiled in what is considered one of the most competitive races in the country, referenced his support of the measure in an April ad that said, ""Jon Tester worked with Republicans, fighting to shut down the border, target fentanyl traffickers, and add hundreds of new border patrol agents.""

Democrats in Senate races are not the only ones using this bill to their advantage. Vice President Kamala Harris is campaigning on signing the bill into law if she is elected president in November.

As for whether Democrats' advocacy for the bill will resonate with voters, Collins told Fox News Digital it won't. ""The president did absolutely nothing by way of executive orders or of really pushing that bill for years. He created the crisis,"" she said of President Biden.

TOP 5 MOMENTS DURING TRUMP-HARRIS PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'I'M TALKING NOW'

Tillis noted that Biden and Harris ""conveniently leave out how they haven't enforced existing laws.""

He characterized Republican discussions regarding the negotiated bill, explaining, ""There were people that were saying, 'I don't mind the policy. I just don't think you'll execute.'""

Romney reiterated his disagreement with some of his conference members on the measure, suggesting they are doing their ""best to provide an excuse for a very unfortunate vote.""

According to him, Trump was ""of course"" responsible for its failure.

Opinion | Trump's sexism backfired spectacularly at the debate,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/harris-trump-debate-sexism-women-rcna170890,2024-09-12T21:48:11Z,"By Molly Jong-Fast, special correspondent for Vanity Fair and host of the podcast ""Fast Politics with Molly Jong-Fast.""

It was the slightest bit disarming when it happened -- ""I'm talking now, if you don't mind, please,"" former President Donald Trump said during Tuesday's presidential debate. He was trying to use the ""I'm speaking"" line on Vice President Kamala Harris, the same way Harris used it on Mike Pence during their 2020 vice presidential debate. ""Does that sound familiar?"" Trump quipped with a little smirk, as if to make it completely obvious he was being cute, performing a hostile homage.

I'd say this was one of the very few times being a powerful, white man did not benefit Trump. Women are used to being interrupted. That's why when Harris said it to Pence in 2020 it was such a powerful encapsulation of the experience of female life. Trump tried to make the line his, but he flailed and failed, and that quickly became a theme of the debate. And somehow, Harris used the power imbalance to be powerful. She was able to bait Trump by mentioning the crowd size at his rallies. She was able to use the optics of a woman standing up for herself to her advantage.

That moment when Trump told Harris he was ""talking now"" reminded a lot of us of what it's still like to be a woman in the world. That line, coming from Trump, somehow served as a brutal reminder of what his administration took from our gender -- the right to bodily autonomy.

One of the sometimes subtle, sometimes not-so-subtle threads running through this entire truncated Harris-Trump campaign cycle has been misogyny. The thrice-married adulterer Trump, who paid off not one but two women during the 2016 campaign cycle, is someone who behaves in a deeply misogynistic way. Not that that's enough to disqualify him in the minds of many American voters.

Most of the time, that misogyny and sexism is focused on Harris, like when Trump posted a crude sexist meme about her on his social media platform. And Trump is not the only one to delight in this sexist commentary. You could say his running mate, JD Vance, sometimes almost makes Trump look like a feminist: Whereas Trump has flip-flopped on the matter, Vance vocally supports a national abortion ban, as he told a podcast in 2022: ""I certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally."" Vance has somehow managed to double down on some of Trump's worst instincts, from his comments about childless cat ladies to his belief that post-menopausal women exist to care for their grandchildren.

""Quiet, please,"" Trump said at another point during the debate, as Harris tried to interject with an answer. Once again, it didn't work, landing with a patronizing thud. During the debate, it became clear to me that Harris has more available to her than female politicians historically have. So she was able to take the high road, to ignore his pettiness. And by not overly focusing on her own identity, she's been able to allow Trump to bait himself into obsessing about it.

A number of Republicans showed us who they were that debate night. The sexism was largely focused on details that somehow mattered a lot when it came to Harris, but not at all when it came to her male opponent. GOP pollster Frank Luntz posted, ""If she wants to win, Harris needs to train her face not to respond. It feeds into a female stereotype and, more importantly, risks offending undecided voters."" The sexism here rests in the notion that women's faces must always be pleasing to the viewer, part of an old, tired notion that many of us are very weary of.

But for a lot of people, the impact of Harris' debate performance has landed very differently. One Georgia swing-state voter told Sarah Longwell for a piece she wrote in The Atlantic, ""I was actually pleasantly surprised at Harris. She addressed most of the issues pretty well, and she gave Donald Trump what other candidates couldn't. She was a little bit sarcastic, talking back with him, which I appreciated."" It turns out there's more available to women politicians than there used to be in the 1980s, when Luntz was in his prime.

The world has changed since Geraldine Ferraro was the first woman to run for vice president. It's even changed since Hilary Clinton's 2016 campaign, when a confident, pantsuited former secretary of state failed to break the glass celling by only a few thousand voters in a few swing states.

Roe is no longer the law of the land. Women know what it's like to lose. Harris showed us there's more available to women politicians than ever before. Can she translate that to an electoral victory? No one knows. But she's making space for herself and showing others that they can, too."
Trump campaign declares 'clear victory' in Harris debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-campaign-declares-clear-victory-harris-debate,2024-09-12T20:59:08Z,"EXCLUSIVE: The Trump campaign is doubling down on former President Trump's debate performance this week, calling it a clear victory against Vice President Kamala Harris, despite recent reports that Harris is gaining momentum in battlegrounds Georgia and North Carolina.

""Their little reaction to the debate and performance is nothing but a sugar high, and it's artificial, and it's based entirely on the fact that she came out and she managed to deliver her memorized lines, and she put on a fine performance, which we anticipated she was going to do, because she's able to go out and memorize things and go out and put on a performance,"" senior Trump campaign adviser Tim Murtaugh told Fox News Digital in an interview Thursday.

""They placed so much emphasis on that debate, and so many millions of people tuned in to hear why she was running for president, because they had heard that she'd been in hiding most of the time, and they were expecting her to explain the rationale for what her record is and what her goals would be as president and what her plans would be. And they walked away not having heard or learned anything,"" he said.

The campaign's assessment comes as Trump himself said Thursday he will not be doing any more debates.

TRUMP ALLIES CLAIM VICTORY IN DEBATE, CRITICIZE MODERATORS AS 'PRO-KAMALA ACTIVISTS'

While debate watchers initially gave the victory to Harris after Tuesday's showdown, there are still six toss-up states on the map worth a combined 78 electoral votes. The election is still considered up for grabs for either candidate.

As of Thursday, Trump has lost his edge in Georgia and North Carolina in the latest Fox News Power Rankings, giving Harris a lead in the overall forecast for the first time.

Over the last 12 months of the Fox News Poll, between 48%-50% of registered voters have said they supported Trump. While Biden polled as low as 45% earlier this year, Harris is now only one point behind Trump at 49% in the latest Fox national survey.

Criminal indictments, a conviction, the primaries, a last-minute change in opponents and an assassination attempt did nothing to move the former president out of that three-point range.

JD VANCE VOWS TRUMP WOULD NOT IMPOSE FEDERAL ABORTION BAN, VETO IT IF COMES ACROSS DESK

But Murtaugh believes Trump had ""a strong performance"" and that he refused to let Harris ""escape her liberal record and her responsibility in the Biden-Harris administration.""

Murtaugh pointed to Harris' flip-flop record in which she's tried to distance herself from her former progressive record.

""And everyone knows what they are. It's fracking, it's the wall, it's making illegal immigration or making illegally crossing the border not illegal. She reversed herself on outlawing health insurance that people get from their employer,"" Murtaugh said. ""She reversed herself on gun confiscation. She's reversed herself on a variety of tax cuts. You know, she's actually even reversed herself on plastic straws.""

""And she also needed to try to separate herself from the Biden-Harris administration,"" Murtaugh said. ""And she absolutely did not do that. And so while the pundits might think, 'Oh, wow, what a great performance she put on,' because she went out and did her lines, in fact, the truth is, the grocery store will not let you buy food with style points.""

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS ISSUES TRACKER: TRUMP LEADS ON TWO TOP ISSUES, BUT HARRIS IS GAINING GROUND

On top issues like the economy, Trump clearly has the upper hand, according to polls. In a CNN poll conducted after the debate, 55% of voters preferred Trump's economic platform compared to Harris', trailing behind at 35%.

And while pundits and debate watchers called the victory for Harris, middle-of-the-road voters may not have been convinced, according to Reuters and the New York Times' interviews with undecided voters.

Former President Trump said he will not participate in a third debate this election cycle, claiming victory after Tuesday's showdown against Vice President Kamala Harris.

The Harris campaign on Tuesday after the debate said they would be interested in having another. But Trump was lukewarm to the idea, and on Thursday afternoon, he rejected the proposal completely.

""When a prizefighter loses a fight, the first words out of his mouth are, 'I WANT A REMATCH,'"" Trump posted on his Truth Social account. ""Polls clearly show that I won the Debate against Comrade Kamala Harris, the Democrats' Radical Left Candidate, on Tuesday night, and she immediately called for a Second Debate.""

TRUMP SPARS WITH HARRIS, MODERATORS DURING HEATED PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'SHE DOESN'T HAVE A PLAN'

Trump said Harris and President ""Crooked Joe"" Biden have ""destroyed our country, with millions of criminals and mentally deranged people pouring into the USA, totally unchecked and unvetted, and with Inflation bankrupting our Middle Class.""

""Everyone knows this, and all of the other problems caused by Kamala and Joe -- it was discussed in great detail during the First Debate with Joe, and the Second Debate with Comrade Harris,"" Trump said.

Trump participated in a town hall on Sept. 4 on Fox News, after Fox News invited the former president and Harris to debate.

MORNING GLORY: THE WORST DEBATE IN THE HISTORY OF PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES

""She was a no-show at the Fox Debate, and refused to do NBC & CBS,"" Trump continued. ""Kamala should focus on what she should have done during the last almost four year period.""

He added: ""THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!""

Biden's disastrous debate performance against Trump in June instantly fueled questions about his physical and mental abilities to serve another four years in the White House - and spurred a rising chorus of calls from within his own party for the 81-year-old president to end his bid for a second term.

Facing increased pressure from fellow Democrats, Biden, in a blockbuster announcement on July 21, ended his re-election campaign and endorsed Harris. She faced no opposition and quickly sewed up the nomination.

Trump and Harris faced off in a heated debate Tuesday night, sparring about abortion, immigration, Israel, the economy and a range of other issues -- but Trump also battled the ABC News moderators, who were quick to challenge and ""fact check"" the 45th president, while leaving Harris' distortions untouched.

Shortly after it concluded, Trump told Fox News Digital that he thought it was his ""best debate ever, especially because it was three on one."" A CNN flash poll afterward found a majority of watchers thought Harris won the debate. The majority of a Fox News Digital focus group also gave Harris the victory, although the Democrat took criticism for continuing to sound evasive on major issues.

On the heels of Tuesday's ABC debate, FOX News Media executives sent a letter to the Harris and Trump campaigns offering to host another debate, with Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum as moderators.

Garland claims DOJ reaffirming its 'norms' despite series of controversies,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/garland-claims-doj-returning-norms-despite-series-controversies,2024-09-12T20:13:24Z,"Fox News Legal Editor Kerri Urbahn analyzes DOJ controversies.

U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland championed a returned to ""norms"" at the Department of Justice Thursday, despite controversies that have left Republicans alleging a two-tier justice system.

Speaking to department staff in Washington D.C., Garland referred to former President Donald Trump's term in the White House as a ""particularly difficult period for the department.""

""When I came back to DOJ in 2021, after a particularly difficult period for the Department, I said that my mission as Attorney General would be to reaffirm and strengthen those norms as the principles upon which the Justice Department operates,"" he said.

Garland, however, failed to mention the department failing to enforce a federal statute against the protesters who were harassing conservative justices at their homes in 2022, slow-walking the trial of the man accused of seeking to kill Justice Brett Kavanaugh while fast-tracking cases involving Trump, and writing a letter directing the National Security Division to monitor angry parents at school board meetings, said Fox News legal editor Kerri Urbahn.

Urbahn, appearing Thursday on ""America Reports,"" criticized the DOJ for providing regular updates on the aggressive Jan. 6 riot prosecutions while staying mum on anti-Israel agitators who have defaced and destroyed private and federal property. The department also slow-walked the Hunter Biden investigation until whistleblowers spoke out, Urbahn said, and then nearly allowed a ""sweetheart"" plea deal to go through.

FORMER CIA OFFICER ACCEPTED GIFTS FROM CHINA FOR TOP SECRET INFO, SENTENCED TO PRISON

""So, we took steps to better protect the Department's criminal and civil law enforcement decisions and its legal judgments from partisan or other inappropriate influences,"" Garland continued.

Garland lamented accusations that the department had been weaponized against political enemies and decried ""conspiracy theories, dangerous falsehoods [and] efforts to bully and intimidate career public servants.""

""Our norms are a promise that we will not allow this department to be used as a political weapon, and our norms are a promise that we will not allow this nation to become a country where law enforcement is treated as an apparatus of politics,"" Garland told DOJ staff.

SECRET SURVEILLANCE OF CONGRESSIONAL STAFF BY DOJ IN FOCUS AFTER WHISTLEBLOWER ADVOCATES NOTCH COURT WIN

Garland's statements appear to be a response to accusations coming from across the Republican Party that the DOJ has been weaponized against Trump in recent years.

In June, The Washington Post published an opinion piece written by Garland, which shot down assertions that the department was attempting to influence the 2024 election.

WATCH: GARLAND SAYS DOJ RETURNING TO 'NORMS' UNDER HIS WATCH

Without naming them, Garland alluded to Trump and his allies, who have repeatedly claimed the DOJ was behind the New York criminal case against the presumptive GOP nominee, who was found guilty on all 34 counts of falsifying business records by a Manhattan jury.

""We have seen an escalation of attacks that go far beyond public scrutiny, criticism, and legitimate and necessary oversight of our work. They are baseless, personal and dangerous,"" Garland wrote.

Such attacks, Garland insisted at the time, included ""threats"" to defund Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith's efforts to prosecute the former president.

Garland added at the time, ""The Justice Department makes decisions about criminal investigations based only on the facts and the law. We do not investigate people because of their last name, their political affiliation, the size of their bank account, where they come from or what they look like. We investigate and prosecute violations of federal law -- nothing more, nothing less.""

""With all due respect, attorney general, prosecuting the former president of the United States and the possible future president of the United States and your boss' political enemy is anything but normal,"" Urbahn said.

Urbahn said Smith has brought ""untested legal theories"" against Trump.

""They are basically twisting the law in ways that have never been done before in order to fit the facts to get the guy,"" Urbahn continued.

Others have pointed out what appears to be hypocrisy on the DOJ's part with recent treatment of groups lumped together as politically conservative when compared to those categorized as generally liberal.

In 2023, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Matthew Graves announced the conviction of Paula ""Paulette"" Harlow, 75, of Kingston, Massachusetts, for a ""federal conspiracy against rights"" and Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act violations for participating in a protest at an abortion clinic in 2020.

Critics immediately cried foul, noting that Graves had yet to condemn or preview possible prosecution efforts for roughly 200 anti-Israel activists -- some armed with pepper spray -- who violently rioted at the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters and injured at least six Capitol Police officers in November."
Harris Expands Lead Over Trump In First Post-Debate Polls,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/09/12/harris-expands-lead-over-trump-in-first-post-debate-polls/,2024-09-12T19:44:05Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris leads former President Donald Trump by five points in the first two major national polls taken following Tuesday's debate -- in which pundits widely considered Harris the winner.

2.7. That's how many points Harris was leading Trump by in polls on the day of the debate, according to FiveThirtyEight's polling average. Her polling surge appeared to be tapering off, with Trump notching one of his first leads by a major pollster since early August with a New York Times/Siena survey taken Sept. 3-6 that found him up by one point, 48% to 47%.

Tuesday's debate -- the first and only scheduled showdown between Trump and Harris and the first time the two met in person -- was widely considered the most consequential night of the 2024 election. It was particularly high stakes for Harris, as voters are less familiar with her from a personal and policy perspective considering her late entrance into the race. While she didn't float any new policy proposals during the debate, she and Trump traded their usual barbs over the economy, the troubled U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, the border and abortion. The debate came a little over two months after President Joe Biden's disastrous debate with Trump that effectively ended his presidential campaign, paving Harris' path to securing the Democratic nomination.

ABC moderators Linsey Davis and David Muir faced criticism from Trump allies for fact-checking Trump in multiple instances, but never Harris. News outlets that fact-checked the candidates' answers found that Trump made far more baseless or factually wrong statements -- such as inflation being the worst it's ever been -- than Harris, though Harris did stretch the truth in a few cases, including by saying she made her position on fracking clear in 2020, and wasn't corrected by moderators.

Trump said Thursday he won't debate Harris again, writing on Truth Social, that Harris ""SHOULD FOCUS ON WHAT SHE SHOULD HAVE DONE DURING THE LAST ALMOST FOUR YEAR PERIOD. THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!"" Trump accused Harris of challenging him to a second debate only because she lost the first one, comparing her to a fallen UFC fighter who wants a rematch.

Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America sent a letter to ABC News president Almin Karamehmedovic and debate moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis on Wednesday that urges them to issue a correction and meet with abortion survivors over a viral moment where Davis fact-checked Trump.

""[The] ABC News Presidential Debate featured network moderator Linsey Davis attempting to debunk former President Trump's assertion that some states allow for the killing of an infant after birth,"" Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America president Marjorie Dannenfelser wrote in the letter obtained by Fox News Digital.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH ABORTION FACT-CHECK AGAINST TRUMP: 'COMPLETELY INTERJECTS HERSELF'

During the debate, Trump referred to infamous comments made by former Virginia Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam in 2019 but was promptly ""fact-checked"" by Davis. At the time, Northam suggested that in those rare instances of third-trimester abortions, a baby could be born alive and a ""discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.""

""The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother,"" Northam said in 2019.

Trump's apparent reference to Northam at the debate drew a quick rebuke from Davis.

""There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born,"" Davis said.

Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America claims the ABC moderator was ""inaccurate"" and should correct the record.

""This is 100% inaccurate. Her statement tragically ignores the reality of babies who survive failed, late-term abortions but are denied basic medical care and left to die,"" Dannenfelser wrote.

""We are writing to request a swift correction from Ms. Davis and ABC News. It is undeniable that babies are born in this country after failed abortions, as the facts below demonstrate,"" she continued. ""A correction from the network and the debate moderators is an important first step in acknowledging this fact. We also encourage ABC to meet with abortion survivors who are a living testament to the need for born-alive protections.""

VOTERS GIVE HARRIS THE DEBATE WIN, BUT PRAISE TRUMP ON POLICY: SHE GOT UNDER HIS SKIN

The pro-life advocate then added several claims to back up the request for a correction, including ""numerous examples of babies born alive after failed abortions"" and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that ""between 2003 and 2014, around 143 babies died after being born alive following failed abortions.""

It also cited a report from the center-right outlet The Dispatch about Minnesota recording eight deaths among infants who survived abortion attempts during Tim Walz's tenure as governor.

""It's also a fact that, as a U.S. senator, Kamala Harris voted against protections for babies born alive after failed abortions. And as a member of Congress, her running mate Tim Walz even issued a public apology for 'accidentally' voting for said legislation after he previously voted against it,"" Dannenfelser wrote.

The Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life president requested an in-person meeting with ABC honchos to speak directly with abortion survivors.

Numerous fact-checks published after the debate slammed Trump for his remarks on abortion.

""Infanticide is illegal in every state, and Harris and Walz have never supported it,"" CBS News reported. NPR also cited a Kaiser Family Foundation report earlier this year that stated abortions ""after birth"" are illegal in all 50 states.

At the debate, Harris dodged a question from Davis over whether she supported any restrictions on a woman's right to an abortion.

""I absolutely support reinstating the protections of Roe v. Wade,"" Harris said. ""And as you rightly mentioned, nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion. That is not happening.""

During the 2022 primaries, Kunce, a progressive Democrat, supported transgender treatment for children. On Thursday, Kunce posted a video of Hawley on X talking about Missouri's Amendment 3 - the state's right to abortion initiative - where Hawley said that Kunce supports transgender treatments for minors.

""Josh Hawley is so afraid of sharing the ballot with an amendment to end his total abortion ban that it's broken his brain,"" Kunce posted to X in response.

Kunce won the Democratic primary in Missouri, a Republican state, last month and has his sights set on unseating Hawley, who was elected in 2019.

The move comes just days after a different political handicapper similarly decided that Republicans were favored to win the Senate seat.

The Democrat was seen in a July campaign ad walking with law enforcement along a portion of the border wall as he hit Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for opposing a border measure backed by Democrats in the upper chamber.

However, Allred has had a long history of opposing the border wall and other elements of Trump and Republicans' efforts to secure the border.

In fact, at an event in 2018, Allred told attendees, ""If they build that racist wall, my generation is the one that will tear it down. You're not going to have a wall in this country.""

As a representative, he has voted against countless bills that would institute strict changes to address the crisis at the southern border. Most notably, he opposed the H.R. 2 Secure the Border Act, which had been advocated by House and Senate Republicans. The legislation is understood to propose the toughest crackdown on the southern border and illegal immigration in consideration.

He also voted for a resolution to end the national emergency declaration that then-President Trump had made for the southern border and in favor of legislation that would limit the president's ability to suspend or restrict the ability of illegal immigrants to enter the country, among other controversial measures.

""Congressman Allred is laser focused on solutions supported by both parties to fix our broken immigration system and secure our border. Ted Cruz has been in the Senate 12 years and has nothing to show for it. He tanked bipartisan legislation that would secure our border. Lyin' Ted only cares about himself, and Texans know he will never be part of a real solution,"" Allred spokesperson Josh Stewart told Fox News Digital in a statement.

TOP 5 MOMENTS DURING TRUMP-HARRIS PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'I'M TALKING NOW'

While the border bill in question was negotiated by bipartisan Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz, and James Lankford, R-Okla, Republicans have largely rejected the resulting bill and were vocal critics of the negotiations as they were taking place.

After the long-awaited release of the negotiated bill this year, Republicans promptly rejected it.

Some members of the Republican conference in the Senate have even said the measure would have made the current border crisis worse.

While some have pointed to Trump's opposition to the bill as the reason it did not succeed, one Senate Republican told Fox News Digital it would have failed either way. But they said they imagine Trump is happy to take credit.

In the most recent procedural vote on the border bill, two of the three negotiators, Sinema and Lankford, voted it down.

Another Republican criticism of the bill has been that the president currently enjoys the authority to address many of the concerns at the border right now and doesn't need additional congressional permission to fix the crisis.

Allred is not the only Democrat who has apparently changed their tune on the border wall as concerns about illegal immigration surge. Vice President Harris, who is running as the Democrat nominee for president, has also used the Trump-era border wall in campaign advertisements portraying her as strong on the southern border.

Trump's campaign slammed Harris over this, with a spokesperson previously saying that statements that Harris now supports Trump's border wall are ""preposterous and false claim(s).""

A top political handicapper, the Cook Political Report, rated the Texas Senate race ""likely Republican,"" with Cruz boasting a significant advantage. However, given the Democrats' relatively unfavorable Senate election map, the Texas and Florida Senate races are their best pickup opportunities.

Allred has spent far more on the race than Cruz so far, with millions more spent on past ad spending and on future reservations ahead of the election."

ABC News is a left-wing, woke leftist talk network, but they're not honest. In what was the most overt, sickening display of left-wing bias during a presidential debate, the so-called moderators barely asked the vice president about any massive flip-flops, changes in position - only since she became the presumptive Democratic nominee, never once followed up on when she failed to provide a straight answer.

NBC's Chuck Todd applauded Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday for how she handled the presidential debate against former President Trump, arguing she outperformed her predecessor, President Biden.

""It is fascinating to me that how the Harris campaign has -- has decided to take Trump on, belittle him, make him small. He's not this menacing figure that -- that is threatening to destroy America the way Joe Biden was painting him or, to a lesser extent, even Hillary Clinton,"" Todd said on MSNBC's ""Andrea Mitchell Reports."" ""Like this is -- and this is borrowing a page from how Barack Obama dealt with Donald Trump. Now granted, Obama never actually faced him in a campaign, but it was -- it was a belittling. It was the whole Gary Busey shot.""

""This stuff does get under his skin,"" Todd said. ""He can't handle it. And we're seeing -- I mean, this is why I -- if I were in the LaCivita/Wiles shoes I would not put him up against her again, because the abortion contrast alone. And that's the most important thing about this debate.""

""He disagreed with J.D. Vance,"" host Andrea Mitchell said.

""It is the most important part of this debate. He gave that unforced error in that answer,"" Todd replied. ""Joe Biden could have never done what Kamala Harris did. And that's why Joe Biden couldn't win this election"" due to alleged discomfort with the abortion issue. ""What she said, talking about humanizing it, Joe Biden couldn't even bring himself to utter the words 'abortion ban' and she called them Trump abortion bans.""

Todd also underlined how Harris outperformed Biden on the debate stage.

""I think of all of the back and forth, this was the most substantive, and this was a reminder, I think, of why so many Democrats were convinced Biden didn't have what it took to win this campaign, because you needed to make reproductive rights among the front and center issues,"" the political analyst said. ""He was uncomfortable speaking about it, you could tell. I mean, I'm just thinking about just the anecdote she shared. Joe Biden never would have been able to bring himself to share that anecdote.""

ABC has been widely criticized for how it moderated the debate, in particular Linsey Davis' controversial ""fact-check"" against Trump about abortion.

Trump had spoken about abortions performed in the ninth month of pregnancy. He referred to former Virginia Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam's infamous comments on third-trimester abortions.

""The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother,"" Northam said at the time."
An undecided swing state voter watched the debate. It moved the needle,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/11/nx-s1-5107673/undecided-voter-debate-harris-trump,2024-09-11T23:20:20Z,"DUNWOODY, Ga. - A small, but potentially crucial slice of voters remain undecided about the presidential election this fall, including in tossup Georgia. Just outside Atlanta, Cameron Lewellen, a father of three little kids, is one of them.

In 2020, Lewellen voted for Joe Biden. But four years prior, he cast his ballot for Trump. And in the last election, he split his ticket between the Republican candidate for governor and the Democrat running for U.S. Senate. With early voting in 2024 a few weeks away, Lewellen has felt stuck.

""This is tough,"" he says.

Suburban voters like Lewellen have helped shape recent elections in this closely divided state, as some independents and disaffected Republicans drifted from their party in the Trump era. Metro Atlanta's suburbs are also growing and becoming more diverse.

After Biden notched a win by just under 12,000 votes in Georgia, voters in 2022 sent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock back to Washington and reelected Republican Gov. Brian Kemp.

On Tuesday night, Lewellen tuned into the debate in an effort to help crystallize his choice this fall. Lewellen settled into a plush, cream couch across from a big screen TV and a spread of pizzas. On a scratch piece of paper, he wrote in permanent marker the names of the two candidates and drew a line down the middle for his notes.

Lewellen says he soured on Trump as his presidency grew so chaotic, he began to fear for the stability of government, especially after the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol. At this point, Lewellen says he knows who Trump is, but sees Harris as more of a question mark. He has some serious reservations.

""She didn't earn my vote,"" Lewellen says. ""She just was basically anointed because she was the vice president, second in charge.""

And while Lewellen felt Harris got off to a slow start in the debate, declining to directly answer a question on whether Americans were better off financially four years ago, he says he came away encouraged by her proposals to speed the construction of new homes and offer tax incentives for starting a small business. He also says he felt turned off when Trump did not offer any regrets about his conduct on Jan. 6.

""As I think about it, it makes me angry because I think that's crap,"" Lewellen says. ""Take responsibility.""

And when Trump doubled down on his remarks about Harris' race and identity, Lewellen says it stung.

""It's offensive to a lot of us,"" Lewellen says. ""Because you don't wake up deciding to be Black. I'm an African American and I've had people in the past, for me speaking the King's English, ask, 'Why are you talking white?' or whatever.""

Lewellen says while he went into the debate leaning toward Trump, now he says he is more likely to vote for Harris. But he worries about the markets and interest rates and has been searching for a job for the last several months. He notes that the pace of hiring has slowed. Finding something that fits his experience in healthcare and technology has been slow-going. He says if the economy takes a turn for the worse this fall, he will reevaluate his vote again.

""I want a president that's going to be really favorable to small business because that's how I could ultimately leave a legacy for my family. ""But if you're telling me we're going to wake up sometime in October and have a 10 percent slide on the market, I don't think Harris can run from that.""

Lewellen says it is frustrating when people press why he has not made up his mind yet. He says he has always valued carefully studying the issues and learning about a candidate's policies. He thinks both candidates have upsides and drawbacks.

At first thought, Lewellen says the choice has not been gnawing at him. ""You know, day to day, I think about my kids and what we're going to eat and soccer games and baseball."" But reflecting on the debate and the many topics he is thinking about, like the wars in Israel and Ukraine, abortion, affordability and democracy, he reconsidered."

Tuesday night's ABC debate was the first time Trump and Harris met in person, and it was widely considered the most important night of the 2024 campaign yet. They touched on major topics including the economy, abortion, wars in Ukraine and Israel and each of their past records. Harris was largely seen as the winner of the debate by pundits who said she successfully goaded Trump to get off topic and defend himself angrily rather than address the questions and topics at hand. Early polls also showed people largely considered Harris to have won the debate, with ABC News reporting Wednesday afternoon that an average of 57% of respondents thought Harris performed better.

Trump's post contradicted what one of his advisers, Jason Miller, said on CNN on Wednesday, when he implied Trump would participate in a second debate and said ""the onus here is on Kamala Harris to . . . show up."""

(Courtesy: ABC News)

During Tuesday's debate, former President Trump sought to delineate his and other Republicans' pro-life viewpoints with that of Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party, while sparring with moderator Linsey Davis.

Davis asked, 'Why should [Americans] trust"" him on the abortion issue when he has changed his view on some aspects of it at times.

In response, Trump said Democrats have been ""radical"" on the issue, while Republicans have sought to bring the issue ""back to the states"" in supporting the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

Trump claimed comments from former Virginia Gov. Ralph S. Northam seem to prove it is Democrats, not Republicans, who hold extreme views on the issue.

CLIMATE PROTESTERS INTERRUPT YOUNGKIN'S REMARKS REMEMBERING 9/11

While appearing to accidentally refer to Northam as the previous governor of West Virginia, who would be Democrat Earl Ray Tomblin, Trump said the opposition party wants to allow abortions into the ninth month of gestation and even after birth.

""Look at [Northam], not the current governor who is doing an excellent job, but the governor before him, who said, 'The baby will be born, and we will decide what to do with the baby.' In other words, we'll execute the baby,"" Trump said.

In 2019, Northam was interviewed by Washington, D.C., radio station WTOP and was asked about a bill from Delegate Kathy Tran, D-Springfield, that loosened Virginia abortion restrictions.

Northam was asked to explain a comment Tran made in a committee hearing regarding a woman being permitted to undergo an abortion while in labor.

""This is why decisions such as this should be made by providers, physicians and the mothers and fathers that are involved. When we talk about third-trimester abortions, these are done with the consent of obviously the mother, with the consent of the physician -- more than one physician, by the way -- and it's done in cases where there may be severe deformities,"" he said.

TRUMP: I HAVE BEEN A LEADER ON IVF

Northam, who was also a pediatrician in Onancock, Va., added that if a mother is in labor, the infant would ""be delivered [and] kept comfortable.""

""The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.""

In the debate, Trump said Northam's comments show Democrats are the true ""radicals"" on the abortion issue, while Republicans have fought to return the issue to states, where people can vote on the leniency or strictness of abortion policy in their area.

Trump said most Republicans support exceptions to abortion bans for life of the mother or rape or incest.

He noted Republicans' success in having abortion policy returned to state houses has actually led to several red states passing otherwise lenient abortion policies, pointing to referendums in Ohio and Kansas.

""The vote [in Ohio] was somewhat liberal,"" Trump said.

However, Davis cut in after Trump finished his response and said, ""There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born.""

Heritage Foundation religion fellow Delano Squires shared clips of both Tran and Northam speaking about the late-term abortion policy, sarcastically captioning it, ""no one supports abortion in the ninth month.""

""This is how extreme they are,"" tweeted Rob Smith, a conservative commentator.

Dozens of others on X posted the same video of Northam speaking to WTOP in attempts to debunk Davis' retort or make Trump's case."
Top five clashes of the Harris-Trump presidential debate: 'I'm talking now',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-five-clashes-harris-trump-presidential-debate-im-talking-now,2024-09-11T20:42:35Z,"The top five clashes between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Harris.

The presidential debate on Tuesday between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump saw a number of testy moments between the two candidates.

The debate, which was in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was the first and possibly only debate between Harris and Trump. The Harris campaign quickly said ""Harris is ready for a second debate,"" but Trump said on Wednesday morning during a ""Fox and Friends"" interview that he ""won the debate"" and is ""less inclined to"" do another debate with Harris.

Here are some of the top clashes of the night:

HUGE MAJORITY OF DEBATE WATCHERS SAY HARRIS TOOK HOME THE VICTORY, CNN POLL FINDS

One of the early clashes between the two was over abortion. Harris accused Trump of opening the door to ""Trump abortion bans"" due to his nomination of justices who eventually overturned Roe v Wade.

""If Donald Trump were to be re-elected, he will sign a national abortion ban,"" she said.

Trump responded by calling that a ""lie."" The two would eventually challenge each other on the topic, with Trump asking if Harris would support late-term abortions, and Harris challenging Trump to say if he would veto a federal abortion ban.

""Will she allow abortion in the eighth month? Ninth month? Seventh month?"" Trump asked.

""Why don't you ask her that question?"" Trump appealed to the moderators.

""Why don't you answer the question, would you veto?"" Harris asked Trump.

TRUMP SAYS PROJECT 2025 'GOES WAY TOO FAR' WITH ABORTION RESTRICTIONS

Harris upset former Trump when she accused him of holding boring rallies and accused him of talking about ""windmills causing cancer.""

""What you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early out of exhaustion and boredom. And I will tell you, the one thing you will not hear him talk about is you.""

Trump soon shot back: ""People don't go to her rallies. There's no reason to go. And the people that do go, she's busing them in and paying them to be there. And then showing them in a different light. So she can't talk about that. People don't leave my rallies. We have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics.""

Trump used a quip on Tuesday evening similar to one made famous in 2020 by Harris during the vice presidential debate, in which she repeatedly told then-Vice President Mike Pence, ""I'm speaking.""

""Wait a minute, I'm talking now if you don't mind. Please,"" Trump said. ""Does that sound familiar?""

Harris smiled as she clearly got the reference.

""Remember this, she is Biden. You know, she's trying to get away from Biden. 'I don't know the gentleman,' she says. She is Biden. The worst inflation we've ever had. A horrible economy because inflation has made it so bad and she can't get away with it,"" he said.

Harris shot back: ""Clearly, I am not Joe Biden and I am certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country.""

Harris and Trump attacked one another over Russian President Vladimir Putin.

""It is well known that he admires dictators, wants to be a dictator on day one, according to himself. It is well known that he said of Putin that he can do whatever the hell he wants and go into Ukraine. It is well known that he said when Russia went into the Ukraine, it was brilliant,"" she said.

Trump pushed back, accusing Harris of being ""weak on national security"" and said she had the endorsement of Putin.

""Putin endorsed her last week, said, 'I hope she wins,' and I think he meant it because what he's gotten away with is absolutely incredible. It wouldn't have happened with me,"" he said."

Mike Rogers, addressed what promises to be a top concern of many voters in November in a new campaign ad, making his position clear.

""I know that a decision about a pregnancy is one of the most difficult and personal decisions a woman will make,"" Rogers said in a new ad, appearing seated alongside his wife, Kristi Rogers, who held his hand.

""Michigan voters have already decided the issue, and I respect that decision,"" he explained, referencing the 2022 election, in which Michigan voters chose to enact Proposal 3, an abortion rights amendment that enshrined the ""fundamental right to reproductive freedom"" into law.

The amendment also protected rights to contraception and treatments for infertility.

""In the Senate, I won't do anything to change it,"" he promised in the 15-second digital campaign ad.

TOP 5 MOMENTS DURING TRUMP-HARRIS PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'I'M TALKING NOW'

A source familiar told Fox News Digital the ad is meant to combat purported misinformation from the campaign of Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., on Rogers' stance.

They will continue to address this as necessary with campaign expenditures, the source added.

The video comes the same day as Slotkin rolled out two abortion-related ads against Rogers as part of a multi-million dollar buy running on broadcast, cable and digital platforms.

NRA BETS BIG ON MONTANA IN GUN RIGHTS PUSH AS TESTER TEETERS IN SENATE RACE

One ad slams Rogers for his espoused support for restrictions on abortion in 1994. At the time, he told the Lansing State Journal, ""I support all restrictions on abortions, since I consider it intentional taking of life. I would further support legislation restricting abortions done for choosing the sex of a baby.""

She also took aim at the Republican for reportedly expressing support in a questionnaire supposedly two decades ago for policy such as a ""human life amendment,"" establishing that babies are considered a life once they are conceived.

Slotkin's second ad features a woman named Sarah, describing having several miscarriages and an issue with her fifth pregnancy that she said required an abortion. ""I'm scared that Mike Rogers will continue to take away my rights,"" she said.

DEMS FACE TIGHT TIMELINE TO CONFIRM BIDEN-HARRIS JUDGES, SURPASS TRUMP LEGACY

However, Rogers has pushed back at suggestions that these instances would define his actions in the Senate, doing so once again in the Wednesday video. In fact, Rogers has committed consistently since launching his Senate campaign last year to abiding by the Michigan abortion law and not supporting federal legislation that would contradict it. He has further gotten behind former President Trump's stance that abortion should be left to the states.

In Michigan, abortion was the third most cited as a top issue for voters in a July Fox News Poll. The top issue for the most voters by far was the economy, with 35% saying so. This was followed by immigration at 17% and abortion at 16%.

According to a CNN poll released this month, Slotkin leads Rogers 47% to 41%. A previous AARP-commissioned poll of the race last month showed Rogers tied with her among the key demographic of voters over 50 years old, with each posting 46%. Among all voters, Slotkin slightly led her opponent, 47% to 44%.

A top political handicapper, the Cook Political Report, rated the Michigan Senate race a ""toss up,"" despite the seat's lengthy history of going Democrat."

He's now saying, after claiming he's willing to do another debate, now saying maybe not so much.

CNN's Bakari Sellers said Trump was so ""humiliated"" by Harris in the debate that he resorted to blaming the moderators.

Justin Baragona, a media columnist at former MSNBC host Medhi Hasan's news site, Zeteo, said Democrats were similarly blaming the CNN moderators after the Biden-Trump debate in July.

""If you're whining about the refs, you are losing,"" he wrote on social media.

Other conservative commentators, including CNN's Scott Jennings, agreed that blaming the moderators was not a good sign for the former president.

""You can't complain about the refs when you aren't making your own jump shots. And for Trump, it is no excuse for his getting sidetracked (at least until his closing statement) and failing to make the central case that must be made: If you want change, you can't leave the same people in charge,"" he wrote in an op-ed for the LA Times.

MSNBC's Brian Lowry wrote in a column on Wednesday that Davis and Muir did a better job than CNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash did during the first debate between Biden and Trump.

""The tightrope walk of modern journalism means never pleasing everyone, and the constant peril of being accused of putting a thumb on the scales. So we have to give credit to ABC News' David Muir and Linsey Davis, who for the most part were able to deftly navigate that fine line during Tuesday's debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.

Taylor Swift Shakes Up President Race With Harris Endorsement,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/09/11/taylor-swift-shakes-up-president-race-with-harris-endorsement/,2024-09-11T19:20:34Z,"There has been a significant ""shake-up"" in the 2024 race for the White House -- and not just because of the less-than-stellar performance by former President Donald Trump during Tuesday evening's debate. Though political pundits spent the late hours of Tuesday and much of Wednesday morning discussing statements made by Trump and rival Vice President Kamala Harris during their first -- and likely only -- presidential debate in this year's election cycle, pop singer Taylor Swift also made headlines.

The singer, who is taking a brief break from her global tour, endorsed Harris via a post on Instagram, writing, ""I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election.""

The pop superstar said she was ""sure to watch and read everything I can about their proposed policies and plans for this country,"" while adding that she was recently made aware of AI being used to ""falsely"" endorse the former president.

""I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos,"" Swift added in her Instagram post, and she called upon her followers to vote -- but didn't actually call upon them to vote for Harris.

""Your research is all yours to do, and the choice is yours to make,"" she suggested. ""I also want to say, especially to first time voters: Remember that in order to vote, you have to be registered!""

In a call-in to ""Fox & Friends"" on Wednesday morning, Trump responded that he wasn't surprised by Swift's decision to endorse Harris, labeled her ""a very liberal person,"" and suggested, ""She'll probably pay a price for it [...] in the marketplace.""

Swift's endorsement of Harris shouldn't be seen as surprising, as she had back Joe Biden and Harris in 2020, but her superstar has only increased in the past four years. Thus the impact it could have on the election shouldn't be dismissed, especially as it could entice younger voters to head to the polls.

""This is a real case study in terms of a celebrity impacting an election,"" explained Scott Talan, senior professorial lecturer in public communications at American University. ""She laid out in several paragraphs what led to her endorsement. The fact that it was on Instagram is noteworthy as it is the medium that young people use. It was an A+ job in impact and potential success.""

Swift's post also allowed her to respond directly to the false claims from last month that she had endorsed Trump. Her post set the record straight to her fans while highlighting the danger not to believe everything you read on the platforms.

""Social Media are marketing platforms now and not necessarily based on personal thought or opinion. The amount of misinformation spreads like wildfire because of the sheer size of those communities. They do not encourage impact, but actually the contrary and Gen Z are savvy to authenticity. It was powerful for Taylor to officially post her intentions, as she said, to be very transparent and fight misinformation with the truth,"" said Claire Wright, CEO and co-founder of social media utility app BUDDY.

""Taylor has her comments turned off, most likely to prevent everyone, including herself, from experiencing toxic comments -- sadly what the culture of social media use has become,"" suggested Wright.

In many ways, Swift's endorsement via Instagram could be critical for Harris simply because of her massive following. Even if not all ""Swifties"" are liberals, her message was still about the importance of voting -- and serves as a reminder of MTV's Rock the Vote campaign from the 1990s.

""The key to the 2024 Presidential election is getting new voters out to the polls,"" said Linda Bloss-Baum, professorial lecturer in the Department of Management at American University.

""The biggest crop of 'new' votes may come from the younger electorate that has not actively participated in past elections,"" added Bloss-Baum, who also said many students have been asking how to register to vote and get involved in a campaign. ""These voters are proud 'Swifties.'""

The power of celebrity can't be dismissed, as Bloss-Baum further noted that Swift sold 4.35 million tickets last year for the first U.S. leg of her Eras tour.

""The way she relates to her fans through her music, social media, and personal anecdotes creates a sense of intimacy and understanding,"" said Bloss-Baum. ""Taylor Swift's deep connection with an entire generation surpasses that of any artist in my lifetime. The millions of Instagram likes that Taylor's post received within mere minutes after the Presidential debate shows how quickly her fans stand ready to support her, and by extension, Kamala Harris. If a mere fraction of those 'likes' turn into 'votes' for Kamala Harris, it could seriously impact the outcome of the election in November.""

Yet, it should be remembered too that Trump is also more celebrity than a politician.

""If he wasn't a reality TV star he wouldn't be president,"" added Talan.

The difference is that Trump's celebrity status may have helped win him the White House in 2016, but it fell short in 2020, and might not put him over the top in 2024. By comparison, Swift is at the top of her game.

""She has one of the biggest fan bases around, and you tie this into more and more young voters being politically motivated, while her fans are mainly fans are female with abortion being a central campaign issue,"" said Talan. ""There isn't another celebrity on the other side of the political spectrum that has the reach of Swift."""
Here's Where Abortion Is On The Ballot In November -- As Missouri Measure Upheld In Court,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/09/11/heres-where-abortion-is-on-the-ballot-in-november-as-missouri-measure-upheld-in-court/,2024-09-11T18:54:23Z,"The Missouri Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the state's planned question on abortion rights can stay on the ballot, after the state's Republican attorney general tried to decertify it, as 10 states are set to have abortion on their November ballot -- including some where the procedure is now banned.

Abortion is totally banned in Missouri and South Dakota, meaning the ballot measures in those states would overturn the bans if they're passed by voters and restore abortion access. They would also have an impact in Florida, which bans abortion after six weeks, and Arizona, where abortion is banned after 15 weeks. Nebraska has a 12-week ban in place now, so voting in favor of the pro-abortion rights amendment would undo that ban, while the anti-abortion rights measure would make the 12-week ban permanent. Abortion is still legal in Colorado, Maryland, Nevada and New York, but enshrining the protections in state law would ensure legislators can't impose bans in the future. Montana has also preserved the right to an abortion, as the state constitution already specifies a right to privacy that has led to abortion bans getting struck down, but the proposed ballot measure language would be even more explicit that the procedure is allowed. Approximately 20 states now have some form of abortion ban in place.

The Missouri Supreme Court ruled the state's abortion measure can stay on the ballot after a lower state judge said Friday it was invalid, siding with opponents of the measure who alleged it was ""insufficient"" because it didn't properly say how it would affect existing state laws. Missouri Attorney General Jay Ashcroft decertified the ballot measure after the lower court's ruling -- prompting an effort by Democrats to hold him in contempt -- but the state's highest court then ruled the measure was valid after all and Ashcroft must put it back on the ballot. The tussle was one of a few efforts by Republicans to challenge abortion ballot measures even just weeks before the election, with court battles also ongoing in Nebraska and South Dakota, while Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration is investigating signatures in favor of that state's measure.

While many states have accepted ballot measures on abortion this election cycle, Arkansas' potential ballot measure was rejected in court. The state initially rejected the ballot measure application for paperwork issues and organizers then sued the state, but the Arkansas Supreme Court ruled in August in the state'. Organizers submitted enough signatures for the measure to make the ballot but the state claimed they didn't correctly submit a sworn statement regarding instructing canvassers who collected the signatures, which the state Supreme Court upheld.

Abortion ballot measures have been met with significant resistance by GOP politicians and anti-abortion rights advocates in the states where they've been considered and approved. Beyond the court battles playing out in Nebraska and South Dakota, anti-abortion groups in a number of states have gone to court to challenge technical issues with applications, signatures received in support of the measures, the wording of various proposals and other alleged issues. Opponents told Politico in July their aim was to block the measures from making the ballot, though many legal challenges have continued even after that point. ""We are working to make sure it doesn't get on the ballot in the first place,"" Jill Norgaard, a board member of Arizona Right to Life and former member of the Arizona House of Representatives, told the outlet about the state's ballot measure before it was approved.

85%. That's the share of U.S. adults who think abortion should be legal in at least some circumstances, according to Gallup polling released in May. A Public Religion Research Institute poll released in May found residents in all but five states believe abortion should be at least mostly legal -- though those five states include South Dakota, where only 47% reported supporting abortion rights ahead of the ballot measure this fall.

Among the people who will vote on Florida's abortion ballot measure is former President Donald Trump, who has said he believes abortion should be left up to the states. The ex-president has said he will vote against the Florida measure even as he's criticized the state's six-week ban. When asked at the presidential debate on Tuesday about his vote, Trump claimed he was opposing the measure because it would allow abortion in the ""ninth month,"" though in actuality the measure would only allow abortions until the fetus is viable unless medically necessary. Abortions in the final months of a pregnancy are exceedingly rare.

Abortion ballot measures have emerged as a successful way to protect abortion rights in the past two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, setting off a wave of state-level bans. While Republican legislators have been eager to ban the procedure, abortion rights supporters have used ballot measures to harness public support in favor of abortion, hamstringing lawmakers from imposing restrictions in even some Republican-leaning states. Kansas was the first state to put abortion on the ballot in August 2022, with 59% of voters opposing a measure that would have paved the way for abortions to be restricted. Five states then had abortion-related measures on the ballot in the 2022 midterms -- California, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana and Vermont -- with Ohio following suit last year. All votes have broken in favor of abortion rights."
Independent voters surprise pollster with reactions to Trump's debate performance: 'Didn't expect it',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/independent-voters-have-surprising-reaction-trumps-debate-performance-didnt-expect-it,2024-09-11T18:17:27Z,"A panel of voters join 'The Faulkner Focus' to provide their perspectives on the first debate between former President Trump and Vice President Harris. Pollster Lee Carter provides real-time debate reactions.

Dials monitoring the reaction of a Fox News focus group during Tuesday's presidential debate showed independent voters overlapping with Republicans in support of former President Trump's immigration policies.

Trump took aim at Vice President Kamala Harris during the ABC News Presidential Debate, blaming the Biden-Harris administration for ""destroying the fabric of our country"" with the influx of illegal immigration.

The former president blamed the administration for the rise in ""migrant crime,"" a sentiment that seemingly resonated with not just Republicans, but a large number of independent respondents.

The focus group comprised seven Democrats, five independents, and five Republicans, and was represented by blue, yellow, and red lines, respectively. When Trump spoke of the rising crime at the hands of illegal immigrants, the yellow line monitoring the independent reaction rose drastically in Trump's favor, overlapping with the red Republican line.

FOX NEWS VOTER PANEL SAYS HARRIS WON THE DEBATE

Lee Carter, pollster and president of Maslansky + Partners said she was shocked to see independent voters tracking with Republicans so closely on the issue.

""I was really, really surprised because the intensity of the independent support was there for Donald Trump and I didn't expect it,"" Carter said Wednesday on ""The Faulkner Focus.""

""Independents are tracking very much with Republicans. They're looking for a couple of things. They're looking for answers on immigration, they're looking for answers on the economy. They want to hear that things will get better for them and they also want change from what is happening right now,"" Carter continued. ""One of the most important things they were looking for last night from Kamala Harris is how are you going to make it different?""

VOTERS REACT TO TRUMP SAYING HE 'TOOK A BULLET TO THE HEAD' OVER LEFT RHETORIC

An independent voter from New York who joined a voter panel Wednesday told host Harris Faulkner, ""You don't have to look any further than the five boroughs to see the impact of the migrant crisis.""

""When asked directly by the moderators, Kamala didn't even make an effort to defend the administration's policies at all. She can't,"" he added. ""It's indefensible, so she pivoted...but they totally rewrote all of Trump's immigration policies year one. I would've liked to have seen an explanation for the country as to why they did that.""

Carter proceeded to highlight additional examples - including on fracking, abortion and the economy - where independents tracked with Republicans' reactions.

Faulkner said the dial results indicate the GOP ""better pay attention"" to non-affiliated voters.

""I think the independents are tracking this way with Trump's responses because it is obvious what's happening across the country in these cities,"" a GOP voter from New Jersey said.

""Every single day we're seeing destruction...crime...every single day our safety is being compromised and I think you can't hide from that and I think it's becoming more and more obvious and something needs to change.""

Independents showed dissatisfaction with Trump while he talked about the coronavirus pandemic, but both Democrats and Republicans were consistently more supportive of the former president as he discussed the pandemic and the economy.

All three voting blocs, however, shot up in support for Trump when he said he was going to ""cut taxes very substantially and create a great economy like I did before.""

"At the debate, JD Vance's many troubles went from bad to worse",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/debate-jd-vances-many-troubles-went-bad-worse-rcna170613,2024-09-11T18:00:35Z,"In 2016, Trump became the first presidential candidate to distance himself from his own running mate during a debate. In 2024, he did it again.

Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance was already struggling as a candidate for national office, but the past week or so has been especially brutal.

It was six days ago, for example, when the Ohio senator sat down with a prominent conservative pundit, who asked what can be done to address the cost of child care. Vance's answer was, by any fair measure, ridiculous. A day later, the GOP candidate lamented that deadly mass shootings in schools are a ""fact of life"" -- a comment that sparked fierce and immediate pushback.

On Monday, Vance threw his support behind a ridiculous and racist conspiracy theory about immigrants abducting and eating pets, and on Tuesday, he endorsed a brazenly illegal response to Trump's 2020 election defeat

Hours later, the Ohioan's week managed to get even worse during the presidential debate, as his running mate distanced himself from Vance's recent rhetoric.

The trouble began when ABC News' Linsey Davis asked Donald Trump whether he would veto a national abortion ban if it got to his desk during a possible second term. The former president largely dodged the question, saying he wouldn't have to veto such a measure.

So, Davis tried again, reminding the GOP nominee that his running mate, just last month, told NBC News that Trump would, in fact, veto a federal abortion ban. At that point, the former president replied:

He quickly added, ""We don't have to discuss it,"" dodging the underlying question again.

The exchange suggested that, as far as Trump is concerned, Vance isn't an entirely reliable source for information about the former president's position and plans.

If this sounded at all familiar, it wasn't your imagination. As longtime readers might recall, something similar happened eight years ago.

During the second presidential debate in 2016, ABC News' Martha Raddatz reminded Trump that his own running mate had said, in the context of a discussion about U.S. policy in Syria, that ""provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength."" In an unusual display, Trump denounced the position.

In fact, the then-Republican candidate said of Pence, ""He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree. I disagree.""

In other words, in 2016, Trump became the first presidential candidate to ever distance himself from his own running mate during a general-election debate. Eight years later, he did it again."
"In Debate, Harris Reiterates Healthcare Positions While Trump Balks",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2024/09/11/in-debate-harris-reiterates-healthcare-positions-while-trump-balks/,2024-09-11T16:55:51Z,"The fiery presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris was perhaps a spectacle. But as is historically often been the case when candidates for president square off, there weren't many substantive policy discussions. Nevertheless, on healthcare Harris reiterated her positions on the Affordable Care Act, the Inflation Reduction Act and abortion, while Trump showed an unwillingness to commit to specific policies.

A May 2024 poll of voters by the Pew Research Center found that healthcare ranked as the third-highest issue priority for voters, behind inflation and the perceived need for more bipartisanship. Survey respondents cited rising healthcare costs, with 57% saying that the increasing expenses are a ""very big problem"" in the country today.

Yet it took more than 90 minutes into the debate for moderators to finally pose a question about healthcare.

Harris defended the Affordable Care Act and Inflation Reduction Act, noting how under the Biden Administration the ACA was ""strengthened"" and that the newly enacted IRA ""lowers drug prices for seniors ... and caps out-of-pocket costs for insulin as well as other [outpatient] drugs.""

Just this week, the ACA reached a milestone of nearly 50 million individuals having received coverage under the law.

The $35 per month cap on insulin out-of-pocket costs she was referring to is in effect and applies to all Medicare recipients. The Trump Administration did issue an executive order in 2020 in which monthly insulin out-of-pocket costs were capped at $35 for a relatively small number of Medicare beneficiaries under a voluntary model. By contrast, the IRA mandates such an out-of-pocket maximum for all Medicare recipients.

The $2,000 annual cap on out-of-pocket costs for outpatient drugs Harris referenced will be implemented starting in 2025. This means that in a given year Medicare beneficiaries will not pay more than $2,000 out-of-pocket on outpatient drugs.

In defending the Biden Administration's policies on prescription drugs and the ACA Harris reiterated a Democratic plank that ""healthcare is a right, not a privilege.""

Trump revealed he doesn't have a specific proposal to replace the ACA. But he said he had ""concepts of a plan."" This may have reminded viewers of something similar he stated about replacing the ACA while he was president. While in office, Trump often proclaimed he would come up with an alternative to the ACA. However, during his time in office he never did.

During the debate, Trump declared ""we can do much better than Obamacare,"" but that he ""would only change it if we come up with something that's better and less expensive."" He also reiterated points he has made in the past about ""saving"" the ACA while he was president. Indeed, following unsuccessful efforts to scuttle the ACA, the Trump Administration did issue multiple executive orders to ""improve ACA market dynamics."" But overall enrollment in the program declined from 2017 through 2020. And a Brookings article details the ways in which the Trump Administration may have done more to undermine than save the ACA.

Surprisingly, Trump said nothing to parry Harris's points on reducing Medicare drug prices. He could have noted that his Administration drafted proposals to lower drug prices in Medicare. As president, Trump issued executive orders that would have instituted a ""most favored nations"" drug pricing policy for the Medicare program. Specifically, MFN would have required pharmaceutical firms to sell certain drugs to Medicare for the lowest price that they offer to peer nations overseas. But notably, the use of international price referencing was staunchly opposed by many fellow Republicans. And the MFN executive order was never implemented.

On abortion rights, the two candidates voiced strongly differing views on a topic that remains critical for about one in eight voters. According to KFF, 12% of the electorate says that abortion is the most important issue for their vote in the 2024 elections.

While Trump said he would not sign a nationwide abortion ban, he hedged by also refusing to commit to vetoing such a ban. Moreover, he maintained that the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade was broadly popular, though that isn't the case according to state ballot initiatives or public opinion polling. More than 60% of Americans disapprove of the Supreme Court decision.

Harris repeated her strong support for women's reproductive rights, criticizing Trump for his role in facilitating decreased access to abortion in a growing number of states. However, she declined to say whether she supported restrictions on abortion in the third trimester."
Trump's abortion lies on Roe v. Wade at the debate flunked the legal test on multiple counts,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/deadline-legal-blog/trump-debate-abortion-lies-roe-v-wade-supreme-court-rcna170596,2024-09-11T16:20:10Z,"Among other false statements, the Republican nominee said that everyone wanted the abortion rights precedent overturned and that six justices made it happen.

You think Chief Justice John Roberts watched the presidential debate Tuesday night? If so, he could've taken issue in real time with Donald Trump giving ""tremendous credit to those six justices"" who overturned Roe v. Wade.

The factual problem with Trump's statement is that it's not true.

Five justices voted to ditch Roe. Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett joined Justice Samuel Alito's 2022 opinion in the Dobbs case that overturned federal abortion rights.

To be sure, Roberts didn't dissent like the three Democratic appointees did. He wrote a separate concurring opinion saying, essentially, that overturning Roe went too far. Roberts wanted to further erode abortion rights but not eliminate them.

Indeed, the former president twice botched the number of justices in the Dobbs majority on Tuesday.

""And through the genius and heart and strength of six Supreme Court justices we were able to do that,"" he said at the debate against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, referring to Dobbs. Trump later said: ""And I give tremendous credit to those six justices.""

So, Trump gave Roberts ""credit"" where it wasn't due.

And unlike some of Trump's other lies, the political benefit to him mischaracterizing the vote count in Dobbs is not readily apparent. In fact, he might even benefit from an accurate rendering. After all, his three high court appointees -- Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett -- accounted for a majority of those five justices. So if overturning Roe was a good thing, as Trump claims, then a vote for Trump in November is a vote for a president who will appoint more justices who will do more of the same on abortion.

Of course, the Dobbs vote count wasn't Trump's only lie during the debate. It wasn't even the only abortion-related lie. One of the ABC moderators had to explain to the former president that ""there is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born.""

And in somehow trying to cast Dobbs as both uncontroversial and heroic, Trump falsely claimed that ""every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, liberal, conservative, they all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote.""

Polling shows that the majority of reproductive age women in the U.S. oppose leaving the legality of abortion up to the states. And to note the obvious, a case reaches the Supreme Court because there's disagreement over an issue. Dobbs was no exception. The 5-4 -- not 6-3 -- vote count on overturning Roe further underscores that reality."
Who Is 'Abdul'? Trump's Bizarre Debate Story About Taliban Negotiations Explained,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/09/11/who-is-abdul-trumps-bizarre-debate-story-about-taliban-negotiations-explained/,2024-09-11T16:12:18Z,"Former President Donald Trump incorrectly said during Tuesday's debate that someone named ""Abdul"" leads the Taliban while discussing his role in negotiating the end of the U.S. war in Afghanistan -- reprising a story he frequently tells that seems to conflate the name of one of the terrorist organization's negotiators with its leader.

Harris defended Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan during the debate and accused Trump of having ""negotiated one of the weakest deals you can imagine,"" blasting him for agreeing to the release of 5,000 Taliban prisoners from Afghan prisons.

Trump forged an alliance with some of the families of the 13 service members killed in the Abbey Gate bombing who are critical of the Biden administration. His visit to Arlington National Cemetery last month to commemorate the third anniversary of the attacks sparked controversy when his team took photos and videos in a restricted area, Section 60, where service members killed in recent wars are buried. Federal law prohibits photos and videos in Section 60 for political purposes. The Army, which operates the cemetery, accused a Trump aide of pushing a female staffer out of the way who tried to prevent his team from taking photos, a claim the Trump campaign denied, while accusing the staffer of having a mental breakdown and promising to release footage of the alleged incident (though his campaign has never done so). Harris, along with some veterans and Gold Star families, publicly criticized Trump, alleging he disrespected the gravesites. Other Gold Star family members, including some whose loved ones were killed in Abbey Gate, publicly defended Trump and criticized the Biden-Harris administration in the wake of the controversy.

Trump and Harris debated -- and met -- for the first time Tuesday in a 90-minute debate hosted by ABC News. Pundits widely lauded Harris' performance, praising her for putting Trump on the defensive with her frequent jabs over abortion, the crowd sizes at Trump's rallies, his pandering to dictators and his legal woes. The candidates sparred over abortion, the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars, and the economy, as Trump promoted his plan for tariffs and Harris detailed proposals she said are designed to boost the middle class. Harris' campaign challenged Trump to a second debate almost immediately after the first one ended Tuesday, but Trump said Wednesday he's not sure if he will participate.

It's not clear whether abortion ballot measures will significantly sway the presidential race. Analyses of past abortion measures have pointed out the questions typically outperform Democratic candidates, as some Republicans will vote in favor of protecting abortion rights but still vote for GOP candidates. It remains to be seen whether Trump's refusal to say he would veto a national abortion ban could be enough to sway pro-abortion rights Republicans and independents in Arizona, Florida and Nevada away from Trump. A FiveThirtyEight analysis also argued ballot measures don't necessarily boost turnout as much as Democrats have claimed, with data suggesting increased access to voting has a bigger impact than what's on the ballot.

Ballot measures could have a bigger impact on state-level turnout when they're designed to overturn existing abortion restrictions (like in Arizona or Florida) rather than when they reinforce the status quo (like in Nevada). Turnout increased in Michigan in 2022 when the state put a measure on the ballot that determined the legality of the procedure, for instance, with 4.5 million voting in 2018 versus 4.3 million in 2018 and 3.1 million in 2014. FiveThirtyEight attributes at least some of that bump to the state enacting same-day and automatic voter registration, though it notes the ballot measure's fairly high stakes might've made it more impactful.

Beyond the presidential race, Democrats are also hoping an abortion-focused ballot measure in Montana will boost incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester, as he faces a tough reelection fight in the right-leaning state. Maryland is also one to watch as Republican former Gov. Larry Hogan runs for the Senate in the typically left-leaning state, though Hogan has said he supports abortion rights. In its April memo, the DCCC identified 18 close House races in states with abortion measures in which Democrats could get a boost from the questions. More states have added ballot measures since that list was compiled, so there are likely even more races that Democrats are targeting now.

Abortion was a major topic at Tuesday's debate, with moderator Linsey Davis asking Trump about whether he'd veto a national abortion ban after his running mate Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, suggested Trump would. The ex-president again pushed back on the idea of imposing a national ban and claimed ""there's no reason to sign a ban because we've gotten what everybody wanted"" -- even as most voters oppose overturning Roe v. Wade -- but refused to answer directly whether he would veto any ban that did pass. Trump said he ""didn't discuss"" the issue with Vance, only claiming he ""won't have to"" veto a bill and ""we don't have to discuss it because she'd never be able to get it,"" apparently referring to Harris wanting federal protections for abortion. Harris responded by slamming Trump's defense of overturning Roe v. Wade and tied him to the impacts of the state bans, like people having to spend money to travel out of state for abortions or being denied IVF procedures, arguing, ""What you are putting [people]

Trump has said he will vote against Florida's abortion ballot measure in November even as he's criticized the state's six-week ban. When asked about his opposition to the measure at Tuesday's debate, Trump falsely claimed the measure supports abortions ""in the ninth month"" and went off on a tangent about abortions in the ninth month and ""after birth."" No state legalizes any procedure to kill babies after they're born and abortions in later pregnancy are exceedingly rare, and Florida's measure, if enacted, would only allow abortions up until the point of fetal viability -- about 24 weeks -- unless medically necessary.

It's unclear how Trump's position on abortion will continue to evolve before Election Day, as the ex-president faces backlash from his anti-abortion base for saying he supports abortion being left to the states and refusing to outright support a national ban. While Trump has disavowed a national ban -- but remained vague on if he'd veto one -- abortion rights supporters still believe it's likely Trump would restrict abortion if elected, pointing to other steps Trump could take without a national ban, like enforcing the 19th century-era Comstock Act to ban mailing abortion pills and equipment or stripping abortion drug mifepristone of its federal approval. Trump has said in interviews he's not interested in either of those options, but he has backed the proposals outlined in the Republican National Committee's formal platform -- which supports giving constitutional rights to fetuses, a legal theory that, if adopted, would ban abortion nationwide.

The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to an abortion in June 2022, kicking off a wave of state bans nationwide. Polling has shown a majority of Americans support the procedure remaining broadly legal, however, which has led abortion to become a key election issue, as voters are inclined to support abortion rights. That's led to Republicans often downplaying their opposition to abortion -- even changing their campaign websites -- in order not to alienate voters, and has made ballot measures a key tactic for abortion rights supporters, as they can harness voters' support for abortion rights even in states where lawmakers want to ban it. Seven states have had ballot measures on abortion since the Supreme Court's ruling -- California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, Ohio and Vermont -- with all breaking in favor of abortion rights. Trump said in April he supported abortion being left up to the states after months of uncertainty of where the ex-president stood on abortion, and after he previously suggested he could be open to a national 15-week ban. Polling has suggested his position is broadly unpopular, with an August Kaiser Family Foundation poll finding 74% of women of reproductive age oppose leaving abortion up to the states, and anti-abortion advocates have decried Trump for not going further to oppose abortion rights."
11 Takeaways From Kamala Harris And Donald Trump's Presidential Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sughnenyongo/2024/09/11/11-takeaways-from-the-kamala-harris---donald-trump-presidential-debate/,2024-09-11T15:35:35Z,"In a face-off, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump took to the stage in Pennsylvania in a fiery debate for the Oval Office, laying out their sharply contrasting visions for America's future.

Moderated by ABC News' David Muir and Linsey Davis, the debate kicked off with immediate tension, as former President Trump focused on his familiar themes: border security and economic recovery, repeatedly pointing to his claim of record-breaking tariffs and tough immigration policies.

Vice President Harris called out what she framed as Trump's failures, including public health mismanagement, saying Trump's administration had triggered a public health epidemic. Harris also ripped into Trump's recession-prone economic plan and his response to the January 6th attack on the Capitol. Sensitive issues like race, abortion, and voting rights also took center stage, with Harris accusing Trump of worsening the country's divides. Trump was also challenged for his misleading comments about winning the 2020 election.

The debate, which was different from the 2020 presidential debate, with no audience, saw the two presidential hopefuls rip into each other's policies, with words like ""weak"" and ""stupid"" thrown about. Here are 11 key takeaways from the U.S. presidential debate.

In the first few minutes of her speech, Harris focused on the middle class, young families, and small businesses, pushing her bold ""opportunity economy"" plan by offering tax breaks for small businesses and a $6,000 tax cut for growing families. Her pledge: to lead as president for all Americans and act as a unifying buffer for both sides.

Meanwhile, Trump doubled down on immigration and dismissed Harris' vision as a socialist threat. Trump fired at Joe Biden's policies and criticized Harris for aligning with what he called Marxism, claiming that the Biden administration's policies had deteriorated the U.S. economy and led it into economic disaster. Trump also painted Harris as an advocate for Marxism, warning viewers that her economic plans would stifle economic growth.

Harris, in response, dismissed these attacks, emphasizing that her ""opportunity economy"" was aimed at uplifting middle-class families, not just the wealthy elite, drawing a sharp contrast between her inclusive economic vision and Trump's policies, which she argued favored only the rich. Trump, in turn, fired back, stating that Harris' leadership was eroding the economy and depriving the American people of being able to afford basic groceries.

During the debate, Trump repeatedly zeroed in on immigration, noting it as a core issue of American national security and patriotism.

Trump argued that his border policies had kept America safe and emphasized that a softening of these policies under Harris would open the country to job losses, crime, and economic regression. He pointed to his administration's success in implementing tariffs and border security measures as a defense against what he labeled as ""radical socialist"" policies from Harris. His rhetoric on immigration was designed to appeal to his base, framing the border as a frontline issue that threatened the livelihood and safety of everyday Americans.

Harris, on the other hand, aimed to reach voters from a collaborative standpoint, welcoming voters to approach the election with unity and humanity. By leaning into her history as a public servant, Harris aimed to appeal to the people and chart a new path.

In a particularly impassioned moment, Trump began to passionately speak about the harm that undocumented immigrants were causing, citing baseless stories that immigrants were eating pets in Springfield, Ohio -- a claim that moderator David Muir quickly challenged.

The abortion debate was one of the most heated exchanges of the night, with Harris passionately defending Roe v. Wade and women's rights.

Trump accused Harris of advocating for executing babies post-birth; Harris argued that her policies were centered around humanizing the conversation by focusing on the personal toll these decisions would have on families, either because of incest or rape.

Trump, in contrast, reiterated his pro-life stance but admitted that he would consider exceptions for abortion in cases of incest and rape. He positioned himself as the candidate who would protect religious freedom.

At the same time, Harris emphasized the need to separate government from personal medical decisions, particularly for women, and held Trump accountable for putting women through something ""unconscionable."" Harris argued for the reinstatement of Roe v. Wade to set protections in place for women to make collaborative decisions about their healthcare with their providers.

The candidates clashed over their approaches to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. Harris said that it was important to uphold international humanitarian law while supporting Israel's right to defend itself. She criticized Trump's foreign policy approach, suggesting that his presidency had weakened America's global standing and that her administration would pursue a ceasefire and a two-state solution.

Trump, meanwhile, argued that such conflicts would have never happened under his leadership, accusing Harris of abandoning Israel. He also claimed that Iran's growing influence was a direct result of Biden's weak policies, which he said had allowed terror groups like Hamas to thrive.

Trump claimed he could have ended the war between Russia and Ukraine before it began, positioning himself as a proficient leader who commands respect from adversaries like Vladimir Putin. He blamed Biden's ""weak"" foreign policy for allowing the conflict to escalate with no foresight.

Harris, in contrast, defended the Biden administration's support of Ukraine and echoed the need for Americans to stand up for democratic values. She argued that Trump's admiration for dictators like Putin only emboldened autocrats, and that his foreign policy record was filled with mistakes that destabilized global security.

Like with other issues, Trump and Harris offered different views on the state of the American economy. Trump framed his presidency as one of unprecedented economic growth, boasting job creation and record stock market highs.

At the same time, Harris blamed the former Trump administration for the ""worst economy since the Great Depression.""

Trump pointed to inflation and rising gas and grocery prices as evidence of Democratic failure, but Harris fired back by pointing to her economic plans, which she argues would focus on tax relief for middle-class families, investment in clean energy jobs, and $25,000 in assistance for first-time home buyers. Harris also positioned herself as a unifying bridge between both parties, arguing that addressing economic inequality and creating a fair economy would benefit all Americans.

The candidates' debate over national security was a flashpoint, with Trump painting Harris as weak and unprepared to handle global threats. He claimed that during his presidency, countries like China, Russia, and North Korea were ""afraid"" of him, and that his strength had kept the world more stable.

Harris pushed back, challenging Trump's problematic relationships with authoritarian leaders and his tendency to admire dictators. She emphasized the importance of diplomacy, alliances, and upholding America's role as a leader in promoting global security and democracy. Harris also advocated for strength in national security, which means respecting and supporting the U.S. military and its veterans, which she accused Trump of neglecting.

Racial division was another major topic, with Harris accusing Trump of using race to divide the country. She recalled Trump's history of racial discrimination and raised his refusal to rent to Black tenants in the 1970s to his comments on the Central Park Five. The issue of race was brought up when Muir asked Trump about his comments on Harris' race.

Harris, on the other hand, positioned herself as a unifying political figure who would be committed to addressing systemic racism and healing the divisions that have widened under Trump's leadership.

During the debate, the moderator Muir grilled Trump about the January 6th riots at the Capitol and whether he regretted the incident, but the former president did not provide a direct response. Rather, he addressed other topics, challenging the Biden administration for their lackluster response to riots in Minneapolis.

This lack of direct acknowledgment has since drawn attention from critics who have raised concerns about Trump's evasion and his response to the rioters. In contrast, Harris took the opportunity to condemn the violence of January 6, 2021, emphasizing the importance of protecting democratic institutions and holding individuals accountable.

Harris strongly positioned herself as an advocate for climate action and promised to continue expanding renewable energy and reducing America's dependence on fossil fuels. She also criticized Trump's lackadaisical approach to climate change, which Trump dismissed and, in contrast, doubled down on his support for deregulating the fossil fuel industry. He argued that his policies had led to American energy independence, while Harris' plans would cripple the economy with excessive regulations and economy-crippling green initiatives.

Apart from seemingly sidestepping questions about the January 6th riots, Trump also denied any association with Project 2025, a policy agenda outlined by the Heritage Foundation. The initiative, which includes plans to drastically reduce the size of the federal workforce and increase executive power, has been met with both support and criticism from different political factions.

Trump distanced himself from the project during the debate, insisting that it was not part of his campaign strategy, despite speculation about his alignment with its goals. His denial came as part of a broader effort to reframe his policy vision, focusing instead on familiar themes like immigration and the economy, while avoiding detailed discussions on controversial policy proposals tied to his potential second term.

Harris did not hold back when addressing Trump's criminal history during the debate. She pointed to the former president's legal battles, including ongoing investigations and indictments.

Since the debate, political analysts have continued to dissect the two contenders' strategy, responses and optics on the debate stage, with some arguing that both candidates did not answer certain questions around economy, immigration and policy as closely as they should have. With less than eight weeks left to election day, this debate will be critical in moving the needle in terms of who wins America's ultimate vote."
Trump-Harris debate: Body language expert weighs in on high-stakes face-off: 'Fell into the trap',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-harris-debate-body-language-expert-weighs-high-stakes-face-off-fell-trap,2024-09-11T15:18:48Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris successfully baited former President Trump on several occasions at Tuesday's ABC Presidential debate, making him see red and knocking him off course, according to body language expert Susan Constantine.

Tuesday's debate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was the first time Trump and Harris shared the debate stage, with commentators opining that it was a good night for Harris while Trump has had better performances.

That was, in part, due to how Harris sparked reactions from Trump, who became more frustrated and angry as the night wore on.

IN THE TRUMP-HARRIS FACEOFF THERE WAS A CLEAR WINNER BUT DON'T BELIEVE THIS ELECTION IS OVER

Constantine tells Fox News Digital that Harris knew Trump's weak points, such as questioning crowd sizes at his rallies, and when she brought them up, he defiantly responded -- to his detriment.

""He fell for every one of her games; they were all tactics,"" Constantine says. ""So when she would poke the bear, he would growl back and she would keep poking the bear and especially when it came to, of course, the crowds.""

Harris said that people at Trump's rallies often leave early out of exhaustion and boredom. Trump responded by saying that his rallies have record-breaking crowds, whereas Harris buses people to her rallies and pays them to be there.

""She knew every single one of his weak points, and he would defend it instead of answering the question and just staying on task. He was spending most of his time hitting her back with the ball and also defending himself, which was not a good approach,"" Constantine says.

""You could see that Trump was getting really, really upset about it. At one point, he dropped his shoulders, dropped his head, and he sunk. And then you see the upper lip [move upward] very quickly. It was a micro-expression of leakage, of hatred and disgust and scorn ... he was really angry at her for saying that.""

HARRIS TELLS TRUMP HE'S 'NOT RUNNING AGAINST JOE BIDEN' DURING DEBATE

Constantine says Trump was angry for a reason, noting that Harris made a lot of derogatory remarks, and thus he was unable to regain control of the debate after being goaded by Harris, whose smiles were reflective of her knowing she had cornered the former president.

""You would see his anger, his voice inflection, his breast eyebrows pursed or his tightened lips. He was angry. In fact, you could hear a lot in his voice,"" she explains. ""His lips were pressed most of the time. He was suppressing a lot of his own feelings towards her, which was anger. All that did was fuel for Harris because she knew she got him. That's why you kept seeing the smiles. And every time she got him ... she rewarded herself with a great big perma-smile.""

Constantine says that Harris' smiles were often not genuine and were abnormally long. Harris also did this to prod Trump and smiled as a fallback plan when she didn't agree with things Trump said, according to Constantine.

BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT'S BRUTAL TAKE ON BIDEN'S DEBATE AGAINST TRUMP: 'LIKE A DEAD MAN WALKING'

""Real smiles don't last beyond the very longest four seconds. When a person holds that smile and does it throughout, that's condescending, and what she's doing is she is also dismissing what Trump is saying and [that] is covered with the perma-smile. That is inauthentic,"" Constantine explains. ""If she wants to diminish what Trump is saying, she smiles all the way through or even laughs at that in itself.""

Constantine says that there was a clear distinction between the two candidates: Trump with a more serious tone, Harris appearing happier.

In the beginning, Harris would kick her head back often and almost leave her head tilting up, which Constantine describes as a ""superiority stance."" She raised her nose up and crossed her arms evaluating.

""It was condescending and also smug. Not a good move,"" Constantine says.

Constantine says Harris was very illustrative with her hand movements and looked straight into the camera, knowing exactly how to frame her gestures.

""She spoke to the American people. She played the card musically perfect in a lot of ways. So I think that she had gotten a lot of coaching.""

Constantine says Harris went out of sync when she was tripped up about a question about whether she supports any restrictions on a woman's right to an abortion.

""She evaded that question because she couldn't really answer,"" she explains. ""So that's when her eyes go down she starts to do the 'bobblehead.' And that was a cluster of deception.""

Additionally, Constantine praised Harris for her pre-debate handshake, noting that the vice president moved into Trump's space to engage with him.

""She paused for a minute. She was almost slightly hesitant, but then she went for it... So I'm going to give her a point for that one,"" Constantine says. ""Overall ... it was certainly a boxing match. They were completely on opposite sides, of course. There was no love there on [the] Trump side, and then I think that Harris used that to her advantage and Donald Trump fell into the trap."""
Trump says ABC debate moderators favored Kamala Harris: 'It was three to one',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-says-abc-debate-moderators-favored-kamala-harris-three-one,2024-09-11T13:47:25Z,"Former President Donald Trump discusses his performance at the ABC News Presidential Debate and reflects on the Sept. 11 terrorist attack after 23 years.

Former President Donald Trump shredded ABC News for what he considered a ""rigged deal"" on the debate stage after he went head-to-head against Vice President Kamala Harris on various issues.

Trump tore into the network during ""FOX & Friends,"" calling out co-moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis for only fact-checking him and refusing to call out the vice president for her false claims.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH ABORTION FACT-CHECK AGAINST TRUMP: 'COMPLETELY INTERJECTS HERSELF'

""I think we did great. It was three to one. It was a rigged deal as I assumed it would be,"" Trump said Wednesday. ""Because when you look at the fact that they were correcting everything and not correcting with her, and we knew it, the winner was 100% good coverage for her over the last month or last year. I looked at it and only bad coverage of me no matter what. The press is so dishonest in this country. It's amazing.""

""I didn't mind because frankly, I knew that I was pretty sure that's what they would do,"" he continued. ""CNN was much more honorable. The way we had with Biden was a much more honorably-run debate, but this was incredible.""

The pair fact-checked Trump five times during the heated 90-minute event and failed to correct Harris a single time.

Aside from the lopsided number of fact-checks, many pundits said Trump received far more challenging questions and that ABC moderators gave largely Harris a pass on a variety of issues.

""So many things I said were debunked, totally debunked, like Charlottesville... I have a list of seven different things,"" Trump said. ""And she could say anything she wanted. Everything, every time I spoke, and my stuff was right, and they'd correct you. I thought it was terrible from the standpoint of ABC.""

""They're the most dishonest, in my opinion, the most dishonest news organization, and that's saying a lot because they're all essentially really dishonest,"" he continued.

Many have pointed out that Muir and Davis failed to correct Harris for saying that Trump once said there were ""very fine people"" on both sides of the Charlottesville ""Unite the Right"" rally in 2017.

FOX NEWS MEDIA PROPOSES SECOND HARRIS-TRUMP DEBATE MODERATED BY MARTHA MACCALLUM, BRET BAIER

Critics of Trump have claimed for years that he called neo-Nazis ""very fine people"" when he was actually talking about people protesting over a Robert E. Lee statue, with President Biden and his allies in the mainstream media regularly pushing the notion.

But earlier this year, left-leaning fact-checking website Snopes acknowledged that Trump never called neo-Nazis ""very fine people"" during his press conference following the ""Unite the Right"" rally.

""In a news conference after the rally protesting the planned removal of a Confederate statue, Trump did say there were 'very fine people on both sides,' referring to the protesters and the counterprotesters. He said in the same statement he wasn't talking about neo-Nazis and white nationalists, who he said should be 'condemned totally,'"" Snopes wrote.

Trump helped out ABC moderators by informing viewers that the claim by Harris has been ""debunked.""

Muir and Davis were also quick to interject with Trump on key issues dealing with crime, abortion, illegal immigration, the 2020 election and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

""I think they lost a lot of credibility,"" Trump said. ""I think it was one of my better debates, maybe my best debate I think."""

An overwhelming majority of debate watchers said they thought Vice President Kamala Harris outperformed former President Trump in Tuesday night's debate, according to a CNN poll.

The survey respondents went into Tuesday night's debate split, with 50% saying they expected Trump to win and 50% saying they expected a Harris victory. By the end of the night, however, 63% said Harris came out on top, compared to 37% for Trump.

Broken down by candidate, 96% of Harris' supporters said they thought she won, while 69% of Trump supporters said the former president won.

Trump allies have defended the former president's performance at the Pennsylvania debate. Many have also criticized the ABC News debate moderators, David Muir and Linsey Davis.

""President Trump delivered a powerful America First message directly to the American people focusing on reining in inflation and strengthening our economy, securing our border, and peace-through-strength foreign policy,"" House GOP Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., said in a statement at the tail end of the debate.

""The ABC moderators were not journalists, they were pro-Kamala activists who baselessly attacked President Trump leading to a 3 on 1 debate, while allowing Kamala to lie repeatedly. President Trump won overwhelmingly and will win again on Election Day,"" she added.

Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, similarly told Fox News host Sean Hannity, ""The moderators didn't do their job, but President Trump did do his job.""

Trump himself said the debate was ""three against one"" as the moderators sided with Harris on a number of issues.

""She wants it because she lost,"" Trump responded. ""I don't know. I have to think about it. But if you won the debate, I sort of think maybe I shouldn't do it. Why should I do another debate?

Opinion | Harris understood the assignment. Trump did not. Does it matter?,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-kamala-harris-debate-might-not-have-mattered-rcna170553,2024-09-11T13:00:51Z,"The choice has now been laid out, and it is stark. Tuesday's presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump likely won't be among history's most remembered, but it delivered what we needed in 2024, showcasing the very real differences between the two candidates.

And yet, I'm left to wonder whether it was enough to dramatically change the race. After nearly a decade of this same Trump in our politics, it's difficult to have real confidence that an objectively poor performance will cost him the White House. As disorienting as his comments can be, it feels exactly like what we've seen from him for years.

The question remains: How many voters are willing to overlook his obvious flaws and bizarre rhetoric out of gauzy nostalgia for pre-pandemic days or a frustration with the current administration's handling of the economy?

In style and substance, Harris looked the part of a president, the awkwardness of her early stumbles on the national stage gone. She spoke to her plans but more so to the values, principles and priorities that motivate her. She was firm and forward-looking. Harris was speaking directly to the American people.

Trump, by contrast, reprised his familiar role as America's dark and self-obsessed loudmouth. He did little to appeal to swing voters, diving immediately into conservative culture issues and conspiracy theories. The Trump campaign had hoped to present Harris as a lightweight and a radical. But once again it was undermined by its candidate. The former president leveled many attacks, to be sure, but he got so lost in his own rambles that Harris was rarely put on the defensive.

At times she was able to toy with him, tossing out bait on topics like crowd sizes, Trump's criminal conviction and his role on Jan. 6. He eagerly took it each time, wasting precious time on self-indulgent rants that serve only to highlight his narcissism. Perhaps the worst moment for the former president was an extended argument that he, in fact, did not lose the 2020 election. None of this does him any good with the undecided voters who will determine this election.

Harris, meanwhile, understood the assignment. She pressed her advantage on issues like abortion while presenting herself as a mainstream Democrat, saying she would be tough on illegal border crossers, promoting the need for a mighty military force and even announcing herself as a gun owner. She had no knockout blows, but in contrast to the brooding, unfocused performance of her opponent she was the clear better candidate onstage.

Tuesday's debate was much bigger than the differences in their policy proposals. It was a contrast in the character, ideals and seriousness that we should expect from a president.

It's confounding that the race is so close, making this debate supposedly so crucial, because the choice should not be hard. There is a serious candidate working to earn your vote, running in the traditions of American democracy and offering a vision for moving America forward. And there is another who remains deeply unstable and wants to scare people into going backward."

Employee productivity is one of the biggest concerns for executives. But research shows that those at the top may be the most guilty of ""fauxductivity,"" or fake productivity.

A report from software company Workhuman found that nearly half of managers say that faking productivity is a problem on their team, but managers were actually more likely to admit to exaggerating their productivity compared to non-managers. C-suite execs were the most likely to admit to ""performative productivity"" among those surveyed.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump squared off in Tuesday night's presidential debate, speaking on a range of issues including inflation, abortion and immigration. Both candidates were flagged by fact-checkers for various statements, including Trump repeating a false viral claim that immigrants in Ohio ""are eating the pets of the people that live there."" Harris, meanwhile, falsely claimed that Trump ""left us with the worst unemployment since the Great Depression,"" despite the fact that unemployment had fallen to 6.4% by the time Joe Biden took office.

TOPLINE UFC 306 on Saturday is the first sporting event to come to the state-of-the-art Las Vegas Sphere, and the fight promotion is pulling out all the stops. Forbes got an exclusive look at the knockout production, which CEO Dana White says is ""a completely different animal than anything we've ever done.""

Initially, no one at the company, including White, had any idea how expensive it would be to stage a promotion at the 18,600-seat venue. When the CFO at TKO Group Holdings, UFC's New York City-based parent company, asked what the budget might be for the event, UFC executive vice president and chief content officer Craig Borsari estimated $8 million. In the end, it cost White and Borsari more than $20 million to realize their vision for UFC 306.

Saturday's spectacle will include six short film segments before each fight, tracking Mexican history from the dawn of man through to hundreds of years in the future, each with its own animated graphics, practical effects and elaborately costumed octagon girls.

The hope is to prove that live sports in the Sphere is viable, and perhaps even spectacular, both for attendees and viewers around the globe.

For TKO, a company founded last September when Ari Emanuel's Endeavor merged UFC and WWE into one $20 billion publicly traded entity, the real money is made from media rights. Some two-thirds of TKO's $851 million in revenue last quarter comes from the category, including UFC's current pact with ESPN, which expires at the end of 2025. Negotiations are expected to begin early next year. In other words, now is the perfect time for a noisy, attention-grabbing event.

WHY IT MATTERS ""Dana White claims that UFC's event at the Sphere will change the way sports broadcasts are thought of forever,"" says Forbes reporter Matt Craig. ""He's no stranger to hyperbole, of course, but if you think about it, the way sports are presented on TV hasn't changed much over the past few decades. UFC 306 is not only a pivotal moment for that company, with billions of dollars in the next media rights negotiation hanging in the balance, but it could present some fresh ideas for others to adopt. A lot of people will be watching closely to see if it succeeds or fails.""

The economy was a key topic at Tuesday night's debate, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump sparring back and forth on issues like inflation. But both Trump and the Biden Administrations oversaw strong economic output and labor markets during their time in office:

3.5%: The annualized expansion of real GDP during President Joe Biden's first three years, compared to 2.7% during Trump's

16.3%: The annualized return of the S&P 500 index under Trump, compared to 11.8% since Biden took office in 2021

19%: The increase in inflation over the first 42 months of Biden's term compared to 6% during Trump's first 42 months

Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump faced off last night over topics including the economy, abortion, foreign policy and immigration. Throughout the debate, Trump's tried to tie Harris to President Biden's record and distance himself from abortion restrictions. Harris tried to define herself to voters as a new and younger leader who cares about them and tie Trump to the overturning of Roe v. Wade and its aftermath. Here are some takeaways from the debate.

A government shutdown looms as Congress must pass a stop-gap spending bill before the end of the month. The House is set to vote today on an opening offer from House Republicans that will begin the negotiations. Republicans want to attach what they call the SAVE Act to the bill, which would require voters to prove citizenship to prevent noncitizens from voting. The partisan bill is drawing opposition from Democrats and some Republicans.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, today on a joint visit with British Foreign Secretary David Lammy. The trip comes hours after the presidential debate, where the candidates had starkly different views on what to do about Ukraine. The country wants the U.S. to lift restrictions on the use of long-range weapons provided by the U.S. to hit military targets in Russia.

Food production and transportation make up as much as one-third of a typical U.S. household's annual contribution to climate change-inducing emissions. An estimated 30% of food produced in the country is wasted. Once it's in landfills, rotting food creates methane -- a potent gas that heats the Earth. Minimizing waste and reducing transportation might have a significant impact on the pollution that causes climate change. One possible better solution: home delivery. That's because with a delivery vehicle, when a driver drops off your groceries they're often also delivering to neighbors during the same run.

For some people the question is almost an insult. How could they forget? For the families of the 2,977 people who died and the tens of thousands of people estimated to have been affected by the smoke, dust, falling debris and trauma, the day marks the end of one life and the beginning of another.

But for other people, especially people born after the 9/11 attacks, who were too young to remember, who lived far away or who have lots of other things to worry about -- the question might feel like a scolding in disguise. How many sad days are people supposed to hold close? How many tragedies?

We are not great with memory in America. We often think other people's memories are too long. We wonder why their ancient hatreds loom so large today. But sometimes it seems as if our memories are too short; we don't understand why pain lingers or why some people can't ""just get over it"" -- whatever ""it"" is.

Maybe there's a middle ground. On a day like 9/11, maybe we could just take a moment to notice the people around us and ask, ""Is this a special day for you? Do you want to talk about it? Did you lose someone? Tell me about that person."""

There's a long-standing theory in politics that whoever controls the first 15 minutes of a debate will go on to control the entire evening. That was certainly the case back on June 28, when former President Donald Trump dominated the first presidential debate so completely that President Joe Biden faced immediate calls to drop out of the race.

What a difference a few months can make. In his first outing against new Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, Trump spent almost the entire evening on the defensive against both Harris and moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis. Faced with a real-time fact-checking of some of his outlandish statements, Trump inadvertently conceded what millions of Americans have known for years: His policy positions are mostly based on whatever he's seen on far-right television networks.

After less than an hour it was clear that Trump had discarded any attempt to challenge Harris on policy, reverting instead to a nonstop stream of name-calling, self-pity and directionless fury. Even by Trumpian standards, the former president's performance stood out as shockingly incoherent. It was certainly not the night an already nervous Trump campaign was hoping for.

What Americans saw on Tuesday was a Trump who appeared convinced that his second presidential debate would go much like his first -- with Trump controlling the floor while his Democratic opponent struggled to mount any defense. Instead, Trump went toe-to-toe with a career prosecutor who clearly understood how to derail her opponent while repeatedly urging Americans to ""turn the page"" on his political circus.

Trump's breakdown started early in the evening, when he repeated the debunked claim that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, had been stealing and eating local pets. That conspiracy theory caught fire online this week after right-wing social media accounts ran with the unsourced story -- even though there is no actual evidence that it happened.

Muir was quick to correct Trump by noting that Springfield officials, including the city manager, have reported no such incidents of cat-eating in their town. A further ABC News investigation also failed to turn up any examples of missing or injured pets. That inconvenient correction led Trump's strangest meltdown yet.

""Well, I've seen people on television!"" Trump shouted in a failed effort to interrupt Muir's fact-check. ""The people on television saying, 'My dog has been taken and used for food!' But maybe [the city manager] said that, and maybe that's a good thing for a city manager to say.""

What?

Despite multiple efforts to name-call Harris into a direct conflict, Trump never managed to regain his momentum after his cat-eating meltdown. At one point Trump seemed to even confuse himself, first accusing Harris of stealing his economic plan and then calling her a ""Marxist"" for advocating those economic policies. His economic confusion seemed even stranger given the former president's refusal to outline his second-term economic policy despite multiple direct questions from the moderators.

At one point, Davis asked Trump if, after years of empty promises, he had finally produced an actual policy to reform health care. ""I have the concepts of a plan,"" Trump admitted. When asked for even bare-bones details about his alleged plan, Trump argued that he shouldn't have to come up with any ideas because he's ""not the president right now.""

In a change of pace that will most likely have Democrats breathing a sigh of relief, Tuesday's debate proved to be Harris' to control. In a series of back-and-forths, Harris succeeded in cornering Trump on Republicans' proposed national abortion ban, with the former president twice refusing to say whether he would veto the bill. When asked why vice presidential nominee JD Vance recently reassured voters that Trump would veto any effort to federally ban abortion, Trump claimed to have no idea what Vance was talking about. It was hardly a picture of party unity.

Harris' needling about Trump's inaction on Jan. 6 also yielded an explosive and contradictory response, with Trump claiming he had ""nothing to do with"" the attack on the Capitol and, for good measure, once again defending his controversial 2017 remark that white supremacist marchers in Charlottesville, Virginia, included some ""very fine people.""

Despite repeated claims by Trump's handlers that the former president would exercise discipline in his matchup with Harris, what viewers saw was an angry and scattered former president repeatedly scolded for pushing falsehoods. Worse for Trump's fragile ego, his flurry of attacks against Harris seemed to fall flat. Not only did Harris appear unrattled; Trump's attacks seemed to tee up her most effective comebacks.

If Trump wanted to telegraph to Americans that his campaign is thriving, Tuesday's debate wasn't the way to do it. The former president looked frazzled, frustrated and ready to be done with a grueling 90 minutes. Don't expect a rematch after that sorry display."

"Trump allies claim victory in debate, criticize moderators as 'pro-Kamala activists'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-allies-claim-victory-debate-criticize-moderators-pro-kamala-activists,2024-09-11T09:50:52Z,"Former President Trump argues that the Charlottesville story was 'debunked' several times during the ABC News Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: ABC News)

Former President Donald Trump's top allies are rushing to declare victory after his debate against Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday night.

GOP lawmakers are touting a Trump win even as they criticize ABC News moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis for their handling of the debate, accusing them of acting with bias against the ex-president.

""President Trump delivered a powerful America First message directly to the American people focusing on reining in inflation and strengthening our economy, securing our border, and peace through strength foreign policy,"" House GOP Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., said in a statement at the tail end of the debate.

JD VANCE VOWS TRUMP WOULD NOT IMPOSE FEDERAL ABORTION BAN, VETO IT IF COMES ACROSS DESK

""The ABC moderators were not journalists, they were pro-Kamala activists who baselessly attacked President Trump leading to a 3 on 1 debate, while allowing Kamala to lie repeatedly. President Trump won overwhelmingly and will win again on Election Day.""

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Trump ""exposed"" Harris as a ""radical"" despite her seeking to reflect more moderate positions on firearm ownership and the border at times.

""While Harris lied about her radical positions and spoke about things she would supposedly do as president, and despite the biased moderators shamelessly covering for Harris, there are two problems that Americans were reminded of in prime-time: she has a lifelong record as a Marxist, and she's the sitting Vice President who could secure the border and bring down costs today,"" Johnson said.

TRUMP SAYS PROJECT 2025 'GOES WAY TOO FAR' WITH ABORTION RESTRICTIONS

Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, similarly told Fox News host Sean Hannity, ""The moderators didn't do their job, but President Trump did do his job.""

Senate GOP Conference Chair John Barrasso, R-Wyo., wrote on X, ""President Trump tonight shared his strong vision to reverse the high prices and open borders of the Biden-Harris administration. He articulated a plan to unleash American energy and to get our country back on track.""

Rep. Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, Trump's former White House physician, said the ex-president ""just DESTROYED Kamala Harris on national television and EXPOSED her administration for the harm it caused!!""

Meanwhile, Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., said on X at the end of the debate, ""Joe Biden set the bar low enough to bunny hop over it and she still somehow managed to limbo underneath.""

However, not all Republicans agreed it was a clear victory for Trump. One GOP lawmaker, granted anonymity to speak freely, told Fox News Digital that Harris appeared to be getting under Trump's skin.

""She talks to us like toddlers but is doing a good job of provoking him,"" the GOP lawmaker said during the debate. ""He's right on policy but can't keep to a message."""
The debate between Harris and Trump wasn't close  --  and 4 other takeaways,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/11/g-s1-22023/debate-harris-trump-takeaways,2024-09-11T09:06:38Z,"Well, that was different from the June 27 debate between President Biden and Donald Trump.

If that June debate was a five-alarm fire for Democrats that eventually forced Biden from the race, after Tuesday's debate between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's proponents should probably check the temperature in their own house.

What happened - and what could it mean going forward?

Here are 5 takeaways:

The majority of the focus coming into Tuesday was about how Harris would handle her first-ever presidential debate with someone who had been on this stage many times. Could she answer questions about her position shifts, parry attacks from Trump, someone who tries to be the alpha on these stages, could she answer the attack that she's light on policy and could she appear ""presidential""?

She may have seemed nervous at first, but she quickly found her voice and more than acquitted herself well. All of those questions were quickly dispatched:

Trump's team ahead of the debate equated the Republican standard-bearer to boxing great, Muhammad Ali. If he was a boxer, Trump was cut and bleeding in the middle of the fight, and by the end, was TKO'd. Or as a Democratic strategist texted afterward, it was more like Ali vs. Berbick, Ali's last fight, decided unanimously - for Berbick.

Trump made the unusual move for a presidential candidate to go into the spin room after the debate and talk to reporters. That's not something that's normally done when someone has a good debate. That's usually reserved for low-polling primary candidates, who felt they didn't get enough time or attention during the debate.

Coming into the debate, we noted that if Harris is ""able to acquit herself passably, the spotlight and scrutiny should be heavily on Trump.""

That's because Trump did not have a very good debate against Biden in June, but his serious problems - his lack of substance and repeated lies - were overshadowed by Biden's disastrous performance, maybe the worst of any presidential candidate in history.

With a more-than-competent performance from Harris Tuesday, Trump's lies, meandering, conspiracies and often general incoherence was made even more glaring.

He wandered through conspiracies about, not just the election, but also about who is currently president (Joe Biden), the usual about immigrants who (aren't actually) coming from ""mental institutions and insane asylums"" and the newly unusual (and debunked) about immigrants who (are not) ""eating the dogs"" or ""cats.""

Trump got the conspiracy wrong, though, because it was about ducks, not dogs.

Trump even got wrong what the actual facts of Harris' misleading charge that Trump predicted ""a bloodbath"" if the outcome of this election is ""not to his liking.""

""It was a different term,"" Trump said, ""and it was a term that related to energy because they have destroyed our energy business.""

It was the correct term. He did say ""bloodbath"" back in March, but he was talking in the context of Chinese tariffs, the auto industry and a transition to electric vehicles - not ""our energy business.""

It's the very kind of thing that would have had Democrats nervous about their octogenarian former candidate and Republicans ""outraged"" on cable news about Biden's mental state.

Harris had Trump on the defensive from the get-go on the economy (about his tax cuts and tariffs), his jobs record, his handling of the pandemic and Jan. 6. There were times, even on immigration, when Trump decided to address a Harris attack instead of talking about the issue he ostensibly wants to talk most about.

For someone who likes to bill himself a straight shooter, Trump didn't answer questions directly and dumped a greatest hits of lies from this campaign. He declined to say if he wanted Ukraine to win against Russia, wouldn't answer if he had any regrets about his response to the violence on Jan. 6 and he twice refused to say if he would veto a national abortion ban, like his vice-presidential running mate said he would.

In fact, he went out of his way to say essentially that Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance doesn't speak for him in a clumsy and meandering way that led him to student loans:

""Well, I didn't discuss it with JD in all fairness. JD- And I, I don't mind if he has a certain view, but I think he was speaking for me, but I really didn't. Look, we don't have to discuss it, because she'd never be able to get it, just like she couldn't get student loans. They couldn't get student loans. They didn't even come close to getting student loans. They taunted young people and a lot of other people that had loans. They can never get this approved. So it doesn't matter what she says about going to Congress. So wonderful, let's go to Congress, do it.""

Never mind that Republicans in Congress would not act to help relieve student loans or that Republican-led states sued to end Biden's executive action on student-loan forgiveness. But Trump was digging the hole even deeper for himself on abortion rights.

""I did a great service in doing it,"" Trump said about the overturning of Roe. ""It took courage to do it. And the Supreme Court had great courage in doing it. And I give tremendous credit to those six justices.""

Nearly two-thirds have said they opposed the overturning of Roe.

Trump was also outside the mainstream of public opinion in talking about the Affordable Care Act. He called it ""lousy"" and ""not very good today"" when record numbers of people have a favorable opinion of it.

Trump's best attack was probably this:

""She's gonna do all these wonderful things,"" he said. ""Why hasn't she done it? She's been there for three and a half years. They've had three and a half years to fix the border. They've had three-and-a-half years to create jobs and all the things we talked about. Why hasn't she done it?""

But a coherent attack line was rare from Trump Tuesday night. And even this one was nearly a concession.

CNN said it was going to leave the fact checking to the candidates during the June debate between Trump and Biden.

ABC took a different approach. Moderators David Muir and Lindsay Davis interjected with fact checks four times - all were of Trump.

That was not a reflection of bias; it was because of just how many things Trump said there were blatantly false, like on crime statistics, the dogs and cats conspiracy and the 2020 election.

They did it with a mild, but clear tone and maintained control of the debate throughout the evening, getting to lots of topics and not letting either candidate run over them.

Their approach was notable, particularly with viewership expected to be high. When he went to the spin room, Trump added to his pile of grievances, claiming the debate was ""very unfair"" and called it ""three on one.""

Harris arguably handled Trump better than anyone has at a debate, whether it was Hillary Clinton in 2016 or Joe Biden in 2020 - even though most concluded that Clinton and Biden won most, if not all, of those face-offs.

Since getting into this shortened campaign, Harris has done pretty much everything right. She's tacked to the middle, raised more than half-a-billion dollars, staffed up and opened field offices across the swing states, fired up the Democratic base and now even out-debated Trump.

But the political reality is Harris could still lose.

Trump has a strong and devoted base, and the seven swing states - Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada - are more conservative than the country at large.

People still are more pessimistic than optimistic on the economy, even if that's improved some lately, and polls, including the NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll out Tuesday, have shown people trust Trump to handle the economy, immigration and the war in the Middle East more than Harris.

Could this debate have changed some minds? Maybe. But views of Trump have been ingrained. This race is very much a coin flip, according to the polls, and that's unlikely to change very much even after this debate, because of how hyper-polarized this country is."
"Democrats heap praise on Harris' debate performance, say she 'destroyed' Trump's career",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-heap-praise-harris-debate-performance-say-she-destroyed-trumps-career,2024-09-11T06:07:10Z,"Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier announces Fox News' invitation to both presidential candidates after the ABC News Presidential Debate.

Democratic elected officials and political operatives heaped praise on Vice President Kamala Harris for her debate performance against former President Donald Trump on Tuesday evening.

""America got to see tonight the leader I've been proud to work alongside for three and a half years. Wasn't even close. VP Harris proved she's the best choice to lead our nation forward. We're not going back,"" President Biden posted on X early Wednesday morning after the debate wrapped up.

""Well, that was a knockout. I'm looking forward to seeing how Republicans try to spin this one,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer posted to X in another favorable message for Harris.

Trump and Harris took the same debate stage for the first time this election cycle on Tuesday evening in Philadelphia's National Constitution Center. The pair sparred over the top issues concerning voters, including the economy, immigration and abortion.

TRUMP FACT CHECKS HARRIS ON CHARLOTTESVILLE RIOT ACCUSATION: 'DEBUNKED'

Harris' Democratic allies in Congress, as well as Democratic pundits, praised Harris for how she ""destroyed"" Trump's career, and that voters bore witness to a ""serious leader who will work day in and out"" for the American people.

TRUMP SAYS HE 'PROBABLY TOOK A BULLET TO THE HEAD' DUE TO DEM RHETORIC

The Harris campaign also released a statement Tuesday evening, taking a victory lap that ""Harris commanded the stage on every single issue that matters to the American people.""

""Under the bright lights, the American people got to see the choice they will face this fall at the ballot box: between moving forward with Kamala Harris, or going backwards with Trump. That's what they saw tonight and what they should see at a second debate in October. Vice President Harris is ready for a second debate. Is Donald Trump?"" the Harris campaign posted.

Trump and Harris sparred on top issues concerning voters on Tuesday evening, including on abortion, when Harris claimed Trump's platform would install a national abortion ban that would allow for no exceptions to such a procedure.

HARRIS CLAIMS TRUMP ABORTION PLATFORM MAKES 'NO EXCEPTION,' MOMENTS AFTER TRUMP SAYS THE OPPOSITE

""Now, in over 20 states, there are Trump abortion bans, which make it criminal for a doctor or nurse to provide health care in one state. It provides prison for life. Trump abortion bans that make no exception, even for rape and incest, which understand what that means,"" Harris said Tuesday evening from Philadelphia's National Constitution Center.

""A survivor of a crime of violation to their body does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body. That is immoral, and one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body.""

Moments before, however, Trump said he believes in exceptions for abortion, similar to former President Reagan.

""I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother,"" Trump said during the debate. ""I believe strongly in it. Ronald Reagan did also. Eighty-five percent of Republicans knew exceptions are very important.""

Trump and Harris also traded barbs on the issue of crime in the United States, as Harris defended accusations that migrant crime has increased under her watch by citing Trump's legal issues.

""Yeah, it is much higher because of them,"" Trump said during the debate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania discussing crime committed by illegal immigrants in the U.S., some of which entered the country under Biden's watch.

""They allowed criminals, many, many millions of criminals,"" Trump continued, ""They allowed terrorists. They allowed common street criminals. They allowed people to come in drug dealers to come into our country. And then now in the United States and told by their countries like Venezuela, don't ever come back or we're going to kill you. Do you know that crime in Venezuela and crime in countries all over the world is way down?""

TRUMP FLIPS 'I'M TALKING' SCRIPT FROM 2020 DEBATE AGAINST KAMALA HARRIS DURING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE SHOWDOWN

Harris responded by bringing up Trump's criminal convictions and pending indictments.

""Well, I think this is so rich coming from someone who has been prosecuted for national security crimes, economic crimes, election interference has been found liable for sexual assault,"" Harris said.

TRUMP, HARRIS TRADE BARBS ON CRIME DURING FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'THROUGH THE ROOF'

""And his next big court appearance is in November at his own criminal sentencing. And let's be clear where each person stands on the issue of what is important about respect for the rule of law and respect for law enforcement.""

Following the debate, the Harris campaign called for a second debate in October. Trump had repeatedly called for additional debates against Harris, after only having one other presidential debate in June against President Biden.

The biggest loser in the Trump-Harris debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biggest-loser-trump-harris-debate,2024-09-11T05:52:05Z,"The biggest loser in the first (and likely only) presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump was ABC News, which hosted the face-off. The moderators, David Muir and Linsey Davis, embarrassed themselves and their network by, among other things, fact-checking Trump in real time on more than one occasion - sometimes incorrectly - while allowing Harris to spout serial lies and distortions.

Social media blew up early on in the debate with commentators on the right, in particular, calling Tuesday night's face-off the worst and most one-sided debate in history.

IN THE TRUMP-HARRIS FACE-OFF THERE WAS A CLEAR WINNER BUT DON'T BELIEVE THIS ELECTION IS OVER

Some of the non-truths Harris could (and should have been) fact-checked on:

1. Talking about Project 2025 as if it were Trump's manifesto, and saying that he will pass a nationwide abortion ban

2. Dredging up Trump's Charlottesville comment - that there were ""very fine people on both sides"" - which has been debunked

3. Saying Trump had overseen the worst unemployment since the Great Depression, which was caused by the pandemic

4. Saying Donald Trump has opposed IVF

5. Denying that Kamala Harris ever called for gun confiscation (there are videos of her doing just that)

6. Saying that Trump's tax cuts only helped rich people

7. And my special bete noir - saying that she and Biden have ""created"" 800,000 manufacturing jobs, which is simply not true.

There were others. Harris lied about her record and about Trump's and was not challenged on any of it.

LEFT WING FACT-CHECKER ADMITS TRUMP NEVER CALLED CHARLOTTESVILLE NEO-NAZIS 'VERY FINE PEOPLE' IN BLOW TO BIDEN

Perhaps that was inevitable; the liberal media is in full panic mode now that Harris' honeymoon appears to have faded and Trump has pulled even and, in some polls, moved back into the lead.

Harris' pathetic effort to avoid committing to any policies while on the campaign trail has failed; her refusal to do solo interviews and press conferences has left American voters in the dark. Consequently, the debate was important. People want to know where she stands. Unfortunately, because she deflected on most of the questions and did not flesh out the very few policies she has offered, they still have very little idea of her views.

ABC DEBATE MODERATORS SPARK FURY FOR AGGRESSIVE FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP, EASY TREATMENT OF HARRIS

That should have been the job of the moderators, but they declined to do it. Instead, they allowed her to prattle on with Biden-like platitudes. Once again, a bitterly partisan candidate is promising to bring the country together. Remember that one?

The moderators asked Harris early on whether people were better off under the Biden-Harris administration than they had been under Trump, and instead of citing areas of progress (perhaps because there are none), she launched into describing her ""opportunity economy."" This denotes her ""plan,"" which she touted frequently and which apparently rests on giving people money to buy a home, giving people money to start a business and giving people money to help them raise children.

How taxpayers will pay for all these ""opportunities"" was left unsaid. This is, of course, very Bidenesque - promise money to important voting groups like young people who have drifted away from Democrats and small business owners, who have historically lined up behind Trump.

TRUMP SPARS WITH HARRIS, MODERATORS DURING HEATED PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'SHE DOESN'T HAVE A PLAN'

Trump, on the other hand, failed to prosecute his case. While Harris appeared over-prepared and practiced, with ready-to-go gestures and studied mannerisms, Trump was clearly under-prepared. It is frustrating to his supporters, because he has the facts on his side. He actually did build a strong economy, but saw it slammed by COVID. He actually did leave the world at peace, and negotiated significant new alliances between Middle Eastern countries. He actually did demote Iran's ability to wage proxy wars through sanctions and constrained Russia's energy dominance by cancelling the Nordstream 2 Pipeline. And, he alerted the world to China's dishonest intentions and rule-breaking; none of his predecessors had tried to rein in Beijing.

But instead of forcefully arguing about his successes, he meandered. And, he forgot to smile.

TRUMP FLIPS 'I'M TALKING' SCRIPT FROM 2020 DEBATE AGAINST KAMALA HARRIS DURING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE SHOWDOWN

Rather than patiently and systematically challenging Harris with evidence that his administration had helped the middle class more than hers, Trump reverted to form, claiming once again that he actually won the 2020 election.

That was a mistake, and the liberal press was doubtless jumping for joy. His comments will breathe new life into Biden and Harris' warnings about Trump being a threat to democracy, a talking point that had all but vanished from the political discourse in recent months.

He repeatedly bashed Harris over her failure to curb illegal immigration, but failed to specify the damage done by the inflow of migrants to our cities, neglected to talk about the huge number of people killed by fentanyl because of our open border or the 320,000 children that the White House has lost track of. That was low-hanging fruit, and an opportunity missed.

He also rose to the bait more than once. When Harris slammed his rallies, saying people got bored and walked out, he couldn't resist devolving into arguing about crowd sizes...again.

Trump did manage to make some good points, noting, for instance, that despite criticism over his tariff policy, the Biden-Harris White House had left intact his fees on imports from China, because they were effective. He also pushed back on the jobs supposedly ""created"" by the current White House, calling them ""bounce-back"" jobs. He's right.

His most effective moment of the evening was asking, in his concluding statement, why she hadn't moved forward with her ""opportunity economy"" and her other plans during the past three and a half years? Why hadn't she fixed the border or created more jobs?

That's the question the moderators should have asked."

Fox News host Sean Hannity asked Trump about reports Harris' campaign wants a second debate in October, and whether he would be open to it. Fox News has extended a formal invitation to both the Trump and Harris campaigns for a second debate next month.

""She wants it because she lost,"" Trump responded. ""I don't know. I have to think about it. But if you won the debate, I sort of think maybe I shouldn't do it. Why should I do another debate? She immediately said we want another debate. That's... you know what happens when you're a prizefighter, and you lose? You immediately want a new fight.""

""Would you be inclined to say yes?"" Hannity asked.

""Maybe if it was on a fair network, I would do that,"" Trump said.

The 2024 GOP presidential candidate also hit Harris for her answers to some of the debate questions.

""I always say I've been preparing all my life for these debates. You know, you can't go in like she did, she goes into a room, and she memorized lines more or less,"" he told Hannity.

Trump and Harris received positive and negative reactions to their respective debate performances.

Fox News chief political analyst Brit Hume said the former president ""had a bad night.""

""We heard so many of the old grievances that we'd long thought that Trump had learned were not winners politically,"" Hume said after the debate.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH ABORTION FACT-CHECK AGAINST TRUMP: 'COMPLETELY INTERJECTS HERSELF'

Here are fact-checks from the ABC Presidential Debate from the National Constitution Center:

1. Abortion

Trump was asked about his stance on abortion, as ABC's Davis pointed out that the former president has boasted about killing Roe v. Wade and has called himself ""the most pro-life President in American history"" but has since declared he would be great for women's reproductive rights. Trump also recently said Florida's six-week abortion ban ""is too short,"" but said he would vote against a ballot initiative that would overturn the six-week ban on abortions in the state.

""The reason why I'm doing that vote is because... they have abortion in the ninth month. They even have, and you can look at the governor of West Virginia [Viriginia], the previous governor... not the current governor, whose doing an excellent job, but the governor before, he said, 'The baby will be born, and we will decide what to do with the baby,' in other words we'll execute the baby. And that's why I did that,"" Trump said.

Davis raised eyebrows with the first fact-check of the evening.

""There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born,"" Davis said.

2. Pets

Trump said illegal immigrants are eating people's pets

""In Springfield, they're eating the dogs. The people that came in. They're eating the cats. They're eating -- they're eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what's happening in our country. And it's a shame,"" Trump said.

Muir shot back, ""I just want to clarify here, you bring up Springfield, Ohio. And ABC News did reach out to the city manager there. He told us there have been no credible reports of specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.""

Trump said he's seen it on television, but the ABC anchor wasn't amused.

""The people on television say my dog was taken and used for food. So maybe he said that and maybe that's a good thing to say for a city manager,"" Trump responded.

""I'm not taking this from television. I'm taking it from the city manager,"" Muir said.

""But the people on television say their dog was eaten by the people that went there,"" Trump said.

""Again, the Springfield city manager says there's no evidence of that,"" Muir responded.

FOX NEWS MEDIA PROPOSES SECOND HARRIS-TRUMP DEBATE MODERATED BY MARTHA MACCALLUM, BRET BAIER

3. Crime

At one point, Trump said, ""Crime in this country is through the roof,"" but Muir quickly objected.

""President Trump, as you know, the FBI says overall violent crime is coming down in this country,"" the ABC anchor responded.

""The FBI -- they were defrauding statements. They didn't include the worst cities. They didn't include the cities with the worst crime. It was a fraud. Just like their number of 818,000 jobs that they said they created turned out to be a fraud,"" Trump responded.

4. Sarcasm

Trump said he was being sarcastic when he recently said he lost the 2020 election to President Biden.

""I said that sarcastically. You know that. It was said, 'Oh we lost by a whisker.' That was said sarcastically. Look, there's so much proof. All you have to do is look at it. And they should have sent it back to the legislatures for approval. I got almost 75 million votes. The most votes any sitting president has ever gotten. I was told if I got 63, which was what I got in 2016, you can't be beaten.""

Muir shot back, ""I did watch all of these pieces of video. I didn't detect the sarcasm.""

Muir then told viewers that judges have said there was ""no widespread fraud"" and immediately asked Harris is she felt Trump was trying to intimidate voters with claims he would prosecute anyone who helped cheat an election.

5. Pelosi

There were other moments that weren't full-blown fact-checks, but were seen as hostile moments against Trump, such as when Muir snarked that a question was not about former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi when Trump evoked Pelosi during an answer.

""I showed up for a speech. I said, I think it's going to be big. I went to Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington, D.C. And the mayor put it back in writing, as you know. I said, 'You know, this is going to be a very big rally or whatever you want to call it.' And again, it wasn't done by me. It was done by others. I said I'd like to give you 10,000 National Guard or soldiers. They rejected me. Nancy Pelosi rejected me,"" Trump said.

""It would have never happened if Nancy Pelosi and the mayor of Washington did their jobs. I wasn't responsible for security,"" he continued. ""Nancy Pelosi was responsible. She didn't do her job.""

Muir responded, ""The question was about you as president, not about Former Speaker Pelosi.""

ABC DEBATE MODERATORS SPARK FURY FOR AGGRESSIVE FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP, EASY TREATMENT OF HARRIS

There weren't any.

Many have pointed out that Muir and Davis failed to correct Harris for saying that Trump once said there were ""very fine people"" on both sides of the Charlottesville ""Unite the Right"" rally in 2017.''

Critics of Trump have claimed for years that he called neo-Nazis ""very fine people"" when he was actually talking about people protesting over a Robert E. Lee statue, with President Biden and his allies in the mainstream media regularly pushing the notion.

But earlier this year, left-leaning fact-checking website Snopes acknowledged that Trump never called neo-Nazis ""very fine people"" during his press conference following the Charlottesville ""Unite the Right"" rally in 2017.

""In a news conference after the rally protesting the planned removal of a Confederate statue, Trump did say there were 'very fine people on both sides,' referring to the protesters and the counterprotesters. He said in the same statement he wasn't talking about neo-Nazis and white nationalists, who he said should be 'condemned totally,'"" Snopes wrote.

Trump helped out ABC moderators by informing viewers that the claim by Harris has been ""debunked.""

Harris said we need to stop disparaging people and called Trump a ""disgrace"" minutes later, but ABC moderators failed to point that out. Harris also tied Trump to Project 2025, but moderators failed to point out that Trump has completely distanced himself from the polarizing plan.

Harris also mischaracterized Trump's ""bloodbath"" comment and Trump's stance on IVF without being checked, and ABC moderators failed to question Harris on gun bans and mandatory buybacks and that no active military were in a combat zone."
Fact checking the Donald Trump-Kamala Harris presidential debate,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/11/g-s1-21932/fact-check-trump-harris-presidential-debate-2024,2024-09-11T05:09:30Z,"Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump faced off in their first -- and possibly only -- debate of the 2024 campaign Tuesday, taking questions on key issues like the border, the economy and abortion.

With the candidates virtually tied in the polls, and just 55 days until Election Day, Trump and Harris sought to define their visions for America in front of a national audience, and deflect attacks from the other side.

NPR reporters fact-checked the candidates' claims in real time. Here's what they found:

TRUMP: ""I had no inflation, virtually no inflation. They had the highest inflation, perhaps in the history of our country, because I've never seen a worse period of time. People can't go out and buy cereal or bacon or eggs or anything else.""

Inflation soared to a four-decade high of 9.1% in 2022, according to the consumer price index. While inflation has since fallen to 2.9% (as of July), prices -- particularly food prices -- are still higher than many Americans would like.

Other countries have also faced high inflation in the wake of the pandemic, as tangled supply chains struggled to keep pace with surging demand. Russia's invasion of Ukraine also fueled inflation by driving up energy and food prices worldwide.

Government spending in the U.S. under both the Biden-Harris administration and Trump also may have contributed, putting more money in people's pockets and enabling them to keep spending in the face of high prices.

While high prices are a source of frustration for many Americans, the average worker has more buying power today than she did before the pandemic. Since February 2020 (just before the pandemic took hold in the U.S.) consumer prices have risen 21.6% while average wages have risen 23%.

Many prices were depressed early in the pandemic, however, so the comparison is less flattering if you start the clock when President Biden and Vice President Harris took office. Since early 2021, consumer prices have risen 19.6% while average wages have risen 16.9%. Wage gains have been outpacing price increases for over a year, so that gap should eventually close.

HARRIS: ""Donald Trump left us the worst unemployment since the Great Depression.""

At the height of the Great Depression in 1933, the national unemployment rate was near 25%, according to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library.

At the start of the COVID pandemic, the unemployment rate peaked at 14.8% in April 2020, a level not seen since 1948, according to the Congressional Research Service.

But by the time Trump left office, unemployment had fallen to a lower, but still elevated level. The January 2021 unemployment rate was 6.3%.

-- NPR producer Lexie Schapitl

TRUMP: ""You see what's happening with towns throughout the United States. You look at Springfield, Ohio, you look at Aurora in Colorado. They are taking over the towns. They're taking over buildings. They're going in violently. These are the people that she and Biden let into our country, and they're destroying our country. They're dangerous. They're at the highest level of criminality, and we have to get them out.""

Trump attacked Harris and Biden's records on immigration, arguing that they're failing to stem people from other countries from entering the U.S. and causing violence.

In the last two years, more than 40,000 Venezuelan immigrants have arrived in the Denver metro area. And it is true that many now live in Aurora.

A few weeks ago, a video of gang members in an Aurora, Colo., apartment building had right-wing media declaring the city's takeover by Venezuelan gangs. NPR looked into these claims.

Shortly after the video appeared, Colorado's Republican Party sent a fundraising letter claiming the state is under violent attack, and Venezuelan gangs have taken over Aurora.

It's also true Aurora police have recently arrested 10 members of a Venezuelan gang called Tren de Aragua. But Aurora's interim police chief, Heather Morris, says there's no evidence of a gang takeover of apartment buildings in her city.

What's more, violent crime -- including murder, robbery and rape -- is way down nationwide, according to the most recent data from the FBI. Notably, analysts predict violent crime rates this year will fall back down to where they were before they surged during the pandemic, and may even approach a 50-year low.

Trump also claims that migrants are driving up crime rates in the U.S. That is not true. Researchers from Stanford University found that since the 1960s, immigrants have been 60% less likely to be incarcerated than people born in the U.S. The CATO Institute, a libertarian think tank, found undocumented immigrants in Texas were 37% less likely to be convicted of a crime.

TRUMP: ""In Springfield, they're eating the dogs. The people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating the pets of the people that live there.""

This remark refers to a debunked, dehumanizing claim that Haitian migrants living in Springfield, Ohio, are abducting pets and eating them.

The claim, which local police say is baseless, first circulated among far-right activists, local Republicans and neo-Nazis before being picked up by congressional leaders, vice presidential candidate JD Vance and others. A well-known advocate for the Haitian community says she received a wave of racist harassment after Vance shared the theory on social media.

The Springfield News-Sun reported that local police said that incidents of pets being stolen or eaten were ""not something that's on our radar right now."" The paper said the unsubstantiated claim seems to have started with a post in a Springfield Facebook group that was widely shared across social media.

The claim is the latest example of Trump leaning into anti-immigrant rhetoric. Since entering the political arena in 2015, Trump accused immigrants of being criminals, rapists, or ""poisoning the blood of our nation.""

-- NPR disinformation reporter Jude Joffe-Block

TRUMP: ""A lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, [Democrats] are trying to get them to vote.""

It is illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, and there is no credible evidence that it has happened in significant numbers, or that there is an effort underway to illegally register undocumented immigrants to vote this election.

Voter registration forms require voters to sign an oath -- under penalty of perjury -- that they are U.S. citizens. If a noncitizen lies about their citizenship on a registration form and vote, they have created a paper trail of a crime that is punishable with jail time and deportation.

""The deterrent is incredibly strong,"" David Becker, executive director of Center for Election Innovation and Research, told NPR.

Election officials routinely verify information on voter registration forms, which ask registrants for either a driver's license number or the last four of social security numbers.

In 2016, the Brennan Center for Justice surveyed local election officials in 42 jurisdictions with high immigrant populations and found 30 cases of suspected noncitizens voting out of 23.5 million votes cast, or 0.0001%.

Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger launched an audit in 2022 that found fewer than 1,700 suspected noncitizens had attempted to register to vote over the past 25 years. None were able to vote.

TRUMP: ""[Harris] was the border czar. Remember that she was the border czar.""

Republicans have taken to calling Harris the ""border czar"" as a way to blame her for increased migration to the U.S. and what they see as border security policy failures of the Biden administration.

There is no actual ""border czar"" position. In 2021, President Biden tasked Harris with addressing the root causes of migration from Central America.

The ""root causes strategy ... identifies, prioritizes, and coordinates actions to improve security, governance, human rights, and economic conditions in the region,"" the White House said in a statement. ""It integrates various U.S. government tools, including diplomacy, foreign assistance, public diplomacy, and sanctions.""

While Harris has been scrutinized on the right, immigration advocates have also criticized Harris, including for comments in 2021 where she warned prospective migrants, ""Do not come.""

-- NPR immigration correspondent Jasmine Garsd

TRUMP: ""It's execution, no longer abortion. ... You could do abortions in the seventh month, the eighth month, the ninth month, and probably after birth.""

As ABC News anchor Linsey Davis mentioned during her real-time fact check, there is no state where it is legal to kill a baby after birth. A report from KFF earlier this year also noted that abortions ""after birth"" are illegal in every state.

According to the Pew Research Center, the overwhelming majority of abortions -- 93% -- take place during the first trimester. Pew says 1% take place after 21 weeks. Most of those take place before 24 weeks, the approximate timeline for fetal viability, according to a report by KFF Health News.

A separate analysis from KFF earlier this year noted that later abortions are expensive to obtain and offered by relatively few providers, and often occur because of medical complications or because patients face barriers earlier in their pregnancies.

""Nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion. That isn't happening; it's insulting to the women of America,"" Harris said.

Harris also invoked religion in her response, arguing that ""one does not have to abandon their faith"" to agree that the government should not control reproductive health decisions.

As Davis also noted, Trump has offered mixed messages about abortion over the course of the campaign. He has bragged about his instrumental role in overturning Roe v. Wade, while appearing to backpedal on an issue that polling makes clear is a liability for Republicans.

TRUMP: The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan ""was one of the most incompetently handled situations anybody has ever seen.""

Trump and Republicans in Congress say President Biden is to blame for the fall of Kabul to the Taliban three years ago, and the chaotic rush at the airport where 13 U.S. troops died in a suicide bomb attack that killed nearly 200 Afghan civilians trying to flee. Of late, Republicans have been emphasizing Harris' role. But the Afghanistan war spanned four U.S. presidencies, and it's important to note that it was the Trump administration that signed a peace deal that was basically a quick exit plan.

Trump regularly claims there were no casualties in Afghanistan for 18 months under his administration, and it's not true, according to Pentagon records.

-- NPR veterans correspondent Quil Lawrence

HARRIS: ""There is not one member of the military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world for the first time this century.""

This is a common administration talking point, and it's technically true. But thousands of troops in Iraq and on the Syrian border are still in very dangerous terrain. U.S. troops died in Jordan in January on a base that keeps watch over the war with ISIS in Syria.

-- NPR veterans correspondent Quil Lawrence

HARRIS: ""I will not ban fracking. I have not banned fracking as vice president United States, and in fact, I was the tie-breaking vote on the inflation Reduction Act which opened new leases for fracking.""

When she first ran for president in 2019, Harris had said she was firmly in favor of banning fracking -- a stance she later abandoned when she joined President Biden's campaign as his running mate.

In an interview with CNN last month, Harris attempted to explain why her position has changed from being against fracking to being in favor of it.

""What I have seen is that we can grow, and we can increase a clean energy economy without banning fracking,"" Harris told CNN's Dana Bash.

Under the Biden/Harris administration, the U.S. produced a record amount of oil last year -- averaging 12.9 million barrels per day. That eclipsed the previous record of 12.3 million barrels per day, set under Trump in 2019. 2023 was also a record year for domestic production of natural gas. Much of the domestic boom in oil and gas production is the result of hydraulic fracturing or ""fracking"" techniques.

In addition to record oil and gas production, the Biden-Harris administration has also coincided with rapid growth of solar and wind power. Meanwhile, coal has declined as a source of electricity.

-- NPR economics correspondent Scott Horsley

TRUMP: ""I had a choice to make: Do I save [the Affordable Care Act] and make it as good as it can be, or do I let it rot? And I saved it.""

During his presidency, Trump undermined the Affordable Care Act in many ways -- for instance, by slashing funding for advertising and free ""navigators"" who help people sign up for a health insurance plan on HealthCare.gov. And rather than deciding to ""save"" the ACA, he tried hard to get Congress to repeal it, and failed. When pushed Tuesday on what health policy he would put in its place, he said he has ""concepts of a plan.""

The Biden administration has reversed course from Trump's management of the Affordable Care Act. Increased subsidies have made premiums more affordable in the marketplaces, and enrollment has surged. The uninsurance rate has dropped to its lowest point ever during the Biden administration.

The Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010 and is entrenched in the health care system. Republicans successfully ran against Obamacare for about a decade, but it has faded as a campaign issue this year."

(Courtesy: ABC News)

Reactions from conservatives and liberals came pouring in on social media following the conclusion of the first presidential debate between VP Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.

""Tonight's debate was a clear contrast between Donald Trump, who advanced policies that will address America's biggest concerns, and Kamala Harris, who had nothing but cliched talking points,"" Alfredo Ortiz, Job Creators Network President, said in a statement.

""Kamala ducked and dodged from her failed liberal record, flip-flopping on countless important issues. Kamala can run from her record but can't hide from its results. She showed herself as a policy phony who will do whatever it takes to get elected and gain power. She was clearly out of her league. By contrast, Trump showed himself to be a true leader, clearly explaining the policies needed to reinvigorate Main Street and the economy. In short, he was presidential, she was not.""

""My debate score: trump - 3 moderators - 9 harris - N/A,"" Fox News host Greg Gutfeld posted on X.

TRUMP-HARRIS RACE NECK AND NECK NATIONALLY IN NEW SURVEY, POLLSTER SEES 'WARNING SIGN' FOR DEMS

Many on social media criticized the performance of the ABC moderators.

""ABC should be ASHAMED of themselves,"" former Trump press secretary and Fox News host Kayleigh McEnany posted on X. ""1. Where was the question for Kamala about casting the tie breaking vote for inflation (American Rescue Plan etc.)? 2. Where was the question for Kamala about wanting taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for illegal immigrants? 3. Where was the question about Tim Walz allowing babies born alive after abortion to die in Minnesota and then removing reporting requirements NONE - they only prepped TRUMP FACT CHECKS!""

""My debate analysis won't make anyone happy,"" conservative commentator Matt Walsh posted on X. ""I think Kamala was weak and nervous, especially early. She came off as phony and rehearsed the rest of the way. But Trump missed a lot of opportunities to land a blow, rambled too much, and took the bait repeatedly throughout. I don't think this debate moves the needle much for either candidate.""

""Tonight's debate wasn't Harris versus Trump, it was Old Kamala versus New Kamala. Despite an attempt to rewrite history on her support for the most fringe radical policies on everything from the border and immigration, fracking and energy, Bidenomics, and our fundamental government principles, it's clear she still refuses to be honest with the country about where she stands,"" Sentinel Action Fund President Jessica Anderson said in a statement.

VOTERS REPORT KAMALA HARRIS IS MORE RADICAL THAN TRUMP: 'TOO LIBERAL OR PROGRESSIVE'

""Trump did not win the debate but I think he won the election with an assist to ABC because it was so in the tank for Harris that it was repulsive,"" conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt posted on X. ""Voters did see Harris dodge every question that was even slightly difficult and tried to erase her record and Biden's. Voters expected accountability on the economy, inflation and border but got an ABC buffet of lefty agenda journalism that will not cover for the failures of the past three and a half years. Democrats think they won the debate and the election. It is 2016 all over again.""

Others on social media expressed the belief that Harris won the debate.

""Biden gave one of the worst debate performances in history,"" journalist John Ralston posted on X. ""Trump: Hold my beer.""

""Trump's self-image...his political calling card is strength,"" former Obama senior adviser David Axelrod posted on X. ""He was on defense that entire first hour. KamalaHarris pushed all his hot buttons, and he unraveled.""

In a statement, the Harris campaign wrote that Trump was ""incoherent"" and ""angry"" in the debate.

""Tonight, Vice President Harris commanded the stage on every single issue that matters to the American people,"" the campaign said. ""Americans saw exactly what kind of President Kamala Harris will be: one who offers a New Way Forward for the country, who will be a president for all Americans, and who will turn the page once and for all on the darkness and division of Donald Trump. And she reminded the American people that she is the only candidate in this race ready to serve as our next Commander-in-Chief.""

The Trump campaign declared victory in their debate statement.

""President Trump delivered a masterful debate performance tonight, prosecuting Kamala Harris' abysmal record of failure that has hurt Americans for the last 4 years,"" the campaign said.

""We saw President Trump lay out his bold vision of America and how he would continue to build upon the successes of his first term by supercharging the economy, securing the border, and stopping crime from ravaging communities across the country. Conversely, Kamala's vision of America was a dark reminder of the oppressive, big government policies of Joe Biden that she wants to continue. High inflation, a porous border that allows criminals and terrorists to flood across, and being soft on crime -- that is what Kamala represents."""

11 Important Takeaways From The Historic U.S. Presidential Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sughnenyongo/2024/09/11/11-important-takeaways-from-the-historic-us-presidential-debate/,2024-09-11T04:23:59Z,"In a historic face-off, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump took to the stage in Pennsylvania in a fiery debate for the Oval Office, laying out their sharply contrasting visions for America's future. Moderated by ABC News' David Muir and Linsey Davis, the consequential debate kicked off with immediate tension, with former President Donald Trump focused on his familiar themes: border security and economic recovery, repeatedly pointing to his claim of record-breaking tariffs and tough immigration policies. Harris called out what she framed as Trump's failures -- public health mismanagement, saying Trump's administration had triggered a public health epidemic. Harris also ripped into Trump's recession-prone economic plan and his response to the January 6th attack. Sensitive issues like race, abortion, and voting rights also took center stage, with Harris accusing Trump of worsening the country's divides. Trump was also challenged for his controversial and misleading comments about winning the 2020 election.

The debate, which was distinctly different from the 2020 presidential debate, with no audience, saw the two presidential hopefuls rip into each other's policies, with words like ""weak"" and ""stupid"" thrown about. Here are 11 key takeaways from the US presidential debate.

In the first few minutes of her speech, Harris focused on the middle class, young families, and small businesses, pushing her bold ""opportunity economy"" plan by offering tax breaks for small businesses and a $6,000 tax cut for growing families. Her pledge: to lead as president for all Americans and act as a unifying buffer for both sides. Meanwhile, Donald Trump focused on doubling down on immigration and dismissing Harris's vision as a socialist threat. Trump fired at Joe Biden's policies and criticized Harris for aligning with what he called Marxism, claiming that their policies had deteriorated the US economy and led it into economic disaster. Trump also painted Harris as an advocate for Marxism, warning viewers that her economic plans would stifle economic growth. Harris, in response, dismissed these attacks, emphasizing that her ""opportunity economy"" was aimed at uplifting middle-class families, not just the wealthy elite, drawing a sharp contrast between her inclusive economic vision and Trump's policies, which she argued favored only the rich. Trump, in turn, fired back, stating that Harris' leadership was eroding the economy and depriving the American people of being able to afford basic groceries.

During the debate, Trump repeatedly zeroed in on immigration, noting it as a core issue of American national security and patriotism. Trump argued that his border policies had kept America safe and emphasized that a softening of these policies under Harris would open the country to job losses, crime, and economic regression. He pointed to his administration's success in implementing tariffs and border security measures as a defense against what he labeled as ""radical socialist"" policies from Harris. His rhetoric on immigration was designed to appeal to his base, framing the border as a frontline issue that threatened the livelihood and safety of everyday Americans. Harris, on the other hand, aimed to approach voters from a collaborative standpoint, welcoming voters to approach the election with unity and humanity. By leaning into her history as a public servant, Harris aimed to appeal to the people and chart a new path. In a particularly impassioned moment, Trump began to passionately speak about the harm that undocumented immigrants were causing, citing that immigrants were eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, a claim that moderator David Muir quickly challenged.

The abortion debate was one of the most heated exchanges of the night, with Harris passionately defending Roe v. Wade and women's rights. While Trump accused Harris of advocating for executing babies post-birth, Harris argued that her policies were centered around humanizing the conversation by focusing on the personal toll these decisions would have on families, either because of incest or rape. Trump, in contrast, reiterated his pro-life stance but admitted that he would consider exceptions for abortion in cases of incest and rape. He positioned himself as the candidate who would protect religious freedom. At the same time, Harris emphasized the need to separate government from personal medical decisions, particularly for women, and held Trump accountable for putting women through something ""unconscionable."" Harris argued for the reinstatement of Roe v. Wade to set protections in place for women to make collaborative decisions about their healthcare with their providers.

Both candidates clashed over their approaches to the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. Harris said that it was important to uphold international humanitarian law while supporting Israel's right to defend itself. She criticized Trump's foreign policy approach, suggesting that his presidency had weakened America's global standing and that a ceasefire and a two-state solution would be pursued under her administration. Trump, meanwhile, argued that such conflicts would have never happened under his leadership, accusing Harris of abandoning Israel. He also claimed that Iran's growing influence was a direct result of Biden's weak policies, which he said had allowed terror groups like Hamas to thrive.

Trump claimed he could have ended the war between Russia and Ukraine before it began, positioning himself as a proficient leader who commands respect from adversaries like Vladimir Putin. He blamed Biden's ""weak"" foreign policy for allowing the conflict to escalate with no foresight. Harris, in contrast, defended the Biden administration's support of Ukraine and echoed the need for Americans to stand up for democratic values. She argued that Trump's admiration for dictators like Putin only emboldened autocrats, and that his foreign policy record was filled with mistakes that destabilized global security.

Like other raised issues, Trump and Harris offered different views on the state of the American economy. Trump framed his presidency as one of unprecedented economic growth, boasting job creation and record stock market highs. At the same time, Harris blamed the former Trump administration for the ""worst economy since the Great Depression."" He pointed to inflation and rising gas and grocery prices as evidence of Democratic failure, but Harris fired back by pointing to her economic plans, which she argues would focus on tax relief for middle-class families, investment in clean energy jobs, and $25,000 in assistance for first-time home buyers. Harris also positioned herself as a unifying bridge between both parties, arguing that addressing economic inequality and creating a fair economy would benefit all Americans.

The candidates' debate over national security was a flashpoint, with Trump painting Harris as weak and unprepared to handle global threats. He claimed that during his presidency, countries like China, Russia, and North Korea were ""afraid"" of him, and that his strength had kept the world more stable. Harris pushed back, challenging Trump's problematic relationships with authoritarian leaders and his tendency to admire dictators. She emphasized the importance of diplomacy, alliances, and upholding America's role as a leader in promoting global security and democracy. Harris also advocated for strength in national security, which means respecting and supporting the U.S. military and its veterans, which she accused Trump of neglecting.

Racial division was another major topic, with Harris accusing Trump of using race to divide the country. She recalled Trump's history of racial discrimination and raised his refusal to rent to Black tenants in the 1970s to his comments on the Central Park Five. The issue of race was brought up when Muir asked Trump about his comments on Harris' race. Harris, on the other hand, positioned herself as a unifying political figure who would be committed to addressing systemic racism and healing the divisions that have widened under Trump's leadership.

During the debate, David Muir grilled Trump about the January 6th riots at the Capitol and whether he regretted the incident, but the former president did not provide a direct response. Rather, he addressed other topics, challenging the Biden administration for their lackluster response to the riots in Minneapolis. This lack of direct acknowledgment has since drawn attention from critics who have raised concerns about Trump's evasion and his response to the rioters. In contrast, Harris took the opportunity to condemn the violence of January 6, 2021, emphasizing the importance of protecting democratic institutions and holding individuals accountable.

Harris strongly positioned herself as an advocate for climate action and promised to continue expanding renewable energy and reducing America's dependence on fossil fuels. She also criticized Trump's lackadaisical approach to climate change, which Trump dismissed and, in contrast, doubled down on his support for deregulating the fossil fuel industry. He argued that his policies had led to American energy independence, while Harris's plans would cripple the economy with excessive regulations and economy-crippling green initiatives.

Apart from seemingly sidestepping questions about the January 6th riots, Trump also denied any association with Project 2025, a policy agenda outlined by the Heritage Foundation to take over the federal government. The initiative, which includes plans to drastically reduce the size of the federal workforce and increase executive power, has been met with both support and criticism from different political factions. Trump distanced himself from the project during the debate, insisting that it was not part of his campaign strategy, despite speculation about his alignment with its goals. His denial came as part of a broader effort to reframe his policy vision, focusing instead on familiar themes like immigration and the economy, while avoiding detailed discussions on controversial policy proposals tied to his potential second term.

Harris did not hold back when addressing Trump's criminal history during the debate. She pointed to the former president's legal battles, including ongoing investigations and indictments. Since the debate, political analysts have continued to dissect the two contenders' strategy, responses and optics on the debate stage, with some arguing that both candidates did not answer certain questions around economy, immigration and policy as closely as they should have. With less than eight weeks left to election day, this debate will be critical in moving the needle in terms of who wins America's ultimate vote."
Opinion | Who won the debate? Why Trump never even came close,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/who-won-debate-tonight-harris-trump-taylor-swift-rcna170550,2024-09-11T04:19:38Z,"Kamala Harris. Throughout Tuesday's debate, the vice president looked poised, qualified and presidential -- and that's without comparing herself to the clearly frustrated former president with whom she shared a stage. Harris baited Donald Trump repeatedly, and mostly easily. She needled and poked him on crowd size, his rallies, his racist and easily debunked lies about Haitian immigrants and his flip-flops on abortion.

In the process, she exposed both moments of incompetence and the reality that her opponent is concerningly easy to manipulate. If she can do that in front of the entire country -- and, indeed, people around the world -- it's not a stretch to imagine how he might get rolled by the world's autocrats and dictators.

She pushed hard to lay out her policy highlights and pushed back on Trump's various anti-immigrant rants and obfuscations. She humanized issues like abortion and spoke clearly and calmly about the ongoing war in Ukraine, the American withdrawal from Afghanistan and the need for a cease-fire in Gaza.

Harris' performance, with its forceful eloquence and emotional resonance, spotlighted the stark difference between the candidates. And it also contrasted dramatically with the first presidential debate, just a few months ago in June, when Trump was able to overpower a seemingly tired and confused President Joe Biden.

Donald Trump. Let's put it this way: When you find yourself onstage ranting about people ""eating"" dogs and cats, you're not winning this debate. That's a literal quote, by the way: ""They're eating the pets of the people that live there!"" As moderator David Muir noted, there is no evidence that any migrants are eating pets. Obviously. But that didn't stop Trump.

Even in today's ""unconventional"" political environment, the man insisting that migrants are eating domesticated animals in middle America isn't winning over those key undecided voters.

And that's what Trump was supposed to be doing tonight: making the case that he is presidential. That his cognitive health isn't an issue. That he has a plan to improve the economy and make the lives of individual Americans demonstrably better. This performance, with its grumpy asides and meandering monologues, won't quiet the growing criticism of his age -- at 78, he's now the oldest presidential nominee in history. And it won't make him seem presidential. When asked about his plans to replace Obamacare, he said he has ""a concept of a plan."" Whatever that means.

It's easy to mock Trump's embrace of the conspiracy theory that Haitian immigrants are eating pets, but it's also critical to point out this well-documented lie is intended to demonize a subset of the population for political gain. Trump clearly hopes that promoting racist myths about Black and brown people will appeal to the Republican base. It's disingenuous, disgusting and completely baseless.

And to be fair to these ABC moderators, they did a very good job pushing back on Trump in real time, including a strong debunking of the pet-eating myth. ""We checked with the city manager"" of Springfield, Ohio, Muir told the candidate, even as Trump doubled down with an odd point about seeing ""people on television talking about it.""

This will most likely be one of the most viral moments of the debate -- Taylor Swift's endorsement notwithstanding. And that's not going to make Trump's night much better."
"Kamala stays on offense, Trump went to personal attacks, ABC much tougher on former president",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-stays-offense-trump-went-personal-attacks-abc-much-tougher-former-president,2024-09-11T04:15:21Z,"'Special Report' All-Star panelists Howard Kurtz, Byron York and Francesca Chambers examine former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris' path to the presidency.

Kamala Harris and Donald Trump began with their talking points, and she threw the first punches.

Asked at the ABC debate by moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis whether the country was better off than four years ago, the VP said she was ""raised as a middle-class kid,"" wants to raise up those voters, she wants to tackle the housing shortage, and has a ""passion"" for small business. Trump's plan, she said, was to cut taxes for his billionaire friends and big corporations.

DEBATE CHALLENGE: THE PRESSURE'S ON KAMALA AS SHE AND TRUMP TRADE FLIP-FLOP CHARGES

The former president started on the high road, talking about the tariffs he imposed on China.

But he soon resorted to personal attacks. ""Everything she believed four years ago, she's a Marxist.""

And: ""She hates Israel."" If she wins, ""Israel will not exist in two years.""

Trump also said of Joe Biden, without substantiation, ""He hates her. He can't stand her.""

Trump pushed a completely debunked rumor that Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, ""they're eating the dogs, they're eating the pets."" Muir said the city manager confirmed there were no such reports.

Trump looked angrier as the debate wore on, with Harris at one point laughing at him. She pivoted between looking at him and the cameras; he barely glanced at her.

""We did a phenomenal job with the pandemic,"" Trump said, which is, well, debatable.

Harris grew most animated when asked about abortion, and declared that Trump would sign a national abortion ban.

HOW TRUMP, OR KAMALA, COULD WIN, AS ALL SIDES ZERO IN ON THE DEBATE

""You're going to hear a bunch of lies,"" the veep said. Pregnant women were being denied emergency care, a 12-year old survivor of incest was forced to carry the baby to term.

Trump said, as he did to me at Mar-a-Lago, that ""every legal scholar"" wanted the abortion issue returned to the states. That is not true.

Trump said the Democrats are the radicals because they support abortion through the ninth month, and quoted a dumb comment by the former Virginia governor about making a decision after birth, which is illegal.

""This is so rich by someone who has been found liable for sexual assault,"" Harris said, referring to the E. Jean Carroll case and rattling off various indictments.

That's because the administration has ""weaponized"" law enforcement against him, Trump said in an oft-repeated charge. He added, without substantiation, ""They're the ones who made them go after me.""

In another charge without evidence, the ex-president accused Harris of ""paying people"" to attend her rallies.

Referring to the attempted assassination, Trump said, ""I probably took a bullet to the head because of their rhetoric."" Then he said ""Russia Russia Russia"" - the kind of shorthand that may have puzzled casual viewers.

Harris also said things that weren't true. She said she made clear in 2020 that she was not against fracking, but what she actually said was that Biden would not ban fracking. She said he had threatened a ""bloodbath"" if he loses, but he actually said that about the American auto industry.

TRUMP, KAMALA AIMING FOR THE MIDDLE WITH VARYING DEGREES OF SUCCESS

ABC pressed Trump about Jan. 6, asking why he didn't make the video earlier asking protestors to go home. He said what was left out was that in his speech he had asked the demonstrators to be ""peaceful and patriotic.""

Harris countered that Trump had ""incited a violent mob"" in which 150 law enforcement officials were injured, and ""some died.""

ABC did press Harris on her past opposition to fracking and for abolishing private health insurance, but she stuck to varying versions of ""my values haven't changed.""

On another crucial issue, ABC asked twice: ""Do you want Ukraine to win this war?"" Trump would not say yes. ""I want the war to stop,"" he said. ""I think it's in the U.S.'s best interest to get this war done, negotiate a deal.""

Harris responded: ""If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now."" She said she met with Volodomyr Zelenskyy days before the invasion to share U.S. intelligence.

My scorecard:

Kamala Harris did everything she could have reasonably done to brush off Trump's attacks, make her case, and repeatedly attack him while largely maintaining her composure.

Trump turned in a strong performance and landed numerous blows, but Harris increasingly got under his skin rather than the other way around.

ABC tilted against Trump, with a series of tougher questions, more followups, more fact-checking, and more corrections by the network. This vindicated Trump's pregame criticism of ABC as the ""meanest"" network.

Now the partisan spinning gets under way in earnest."
In the Trump-Harris face-off there was a clear winner but don't believe this election is over,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-harris-face-off-there-clear-winner-dont-believe-election-over,2024-09-11T04:09:14Z,"A focus group of voters across the board shared who they believe won the face-off between the 2024 candidates at Tuesday night's debate.

It's pretty clear to me that on Tuesday night, Vice President Kamala Harris won what may be the only debate between herself and former President Donald Trump. The vice president had some help, too. She was aided and abetted by two ABC News moderators who seemingly felt the need to fact-check virtually everything the former president said.

The former president was clearly frustrated and became more strident and divisive as the nearly two-hour debate continued. And the vice president appeared to gain renewed confidence as she saw Trump faltering under relentless questioning from herself and moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis.

Although Harris clearly won the debate in my estimation, it isn't at all clear that this debate, just 56 days before the election, will fundamentally impact the outcome on November 5.

ABC DEBATE MODERATORS SPARK FURY FOR AGGRESSIVE FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP, EASY TREATMENT OF HARRIS

I say that because Trump did speak directly to his base on Tuesday night. His supporters understood, as well as anyone, how much bias ABC News introduced into the process. To be sure, Harris had better answers on abortion, healthcare, climate change and leadership for the future. That much is clear. But what is also clear is that what Trump said in his closing statement remains the case.

Voters remain angry about the direction the country is headed in, about the performance of both President Biden and Vice President Harris, as well as which candidate they trust more on the top two or three issues facing the country: the economy, immigration and law and order.

My best guess is that Harris will get a slight bump from her performance at this face-off, which had Democrats cheering as soon as Trump began turning harsh and hostile within the first 45 minutes of the debate.

HARRIS TELLS TRUMP HE'S 'NOT RUNNING AGAINST JOE BIDEN' DURING DEBATE

Yet, elections rarely turn on a dime as completely as they did after the June 27 debate between Trump and President Biden. And while Trump was a seemingly different man on Tuesday night than he was back in June, the points he made were the same. And many voters, indeed a majority of voters, agree with his core assessment of the current state of our nation.

I also believe that this is likely to be the last debate that the candidates engage in. For Vice President Harris, the calculus is simple: she will claim victory, her supporters will be emboldened, money will continue to flow into her coffers and there will be absolutely no reason for her to reengage in any shape, matter or form with the former president.

The Harris campaign may claim that they want a second debate, but it will almost certainly be under conditions that the former president will never agree to. I doubt that Trump would ever agree to go back to ABC, much less NBC or CBS, and the chance that Harris will appear on Fox News is negligible at best.

TAYLOR SWIFT ENDORSES KAMALA HARRIS FOR PRESIDENT AFTER DEBATE: 'I'VE MADE MY CHOICE'

For the former president, the calculation is very different but reaches the same conclusion: his worst fears were confirmed on Tuesday night. The debate was hardly fair. And absent a debate on Fox News, there's little reason to believe he'll get a fair shake from any other network.

He also knows that in both the 2016 and 2020 presidential contests, the first one a winning effort and the second one a losing effort, he was able to make up ground with voters separate and apart from any direct confrontation with his opponent. Trump, on the campaign trail, has a unique and compelling appeal. We have seen proof of that time and time again. '

He and his advisers will likely conclude that they can do a lot better with voters by eschewing direct confrontation with Harris. They will do that by sending him out on the campaign trail to do both interviews and rallies. That will be far more effective than taking the risks inherent in a night like the one we witnessed on Tuesday.

But, it is important to note that Harris did reaffirm, for her supporters and potentially many swing voters, that she is the real deal. She's ready and able to govern. Still, at the same time, doubts about her as the next president of the United States remain strong and clear. Indeed, the great weakness of Trump's performance on Tuesday night was that he failed to underscore the issue of the economy and the contrast between his economic leadership and that of Joe Biden in a way that was clear and accessible to voters.

Trump's emphasis on the southern border struck me as over the top, even if the points he was making have wide resonance.

Put another way, I am virtually certain many on the left will proclaim the election over based on Harris's strong performance. That will almost certainly be an exaggeration or an overstatement.

Trump will no doubt face a political setback from this week's encounter with the vice president and the two moderators from ABC. But judging by the past, it would be a profound mistake to count him out."
"Trump spars with Harris, moderators during heated presidential debate: 'She doesn't have a plan'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-spars-harris-moderators-during-heated-presidential-debate-doesnt-have-plan,2024-09-11T04:09:07Z,"PHILADELPHIA, PA - Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris faced off in a heated debate Tuesday night, sparring about abortion, immigration, Israel, the economy and a range of other issues -- but Trump also battled the ABC News moderators, who were quick to challenge and ""fact check"" the 45th president, while leaving Harris' numerous distortions untouched.

Trump and Harris engaged in their first, and possibly only debate of the 2024 general election cycle at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pa. Tuesday night -- a highly-anticipated ninety-minute showdown as they traded jabs, and repeatedly, accused each other of lying.

The two met for the first time Tuesday night on the debate stage, with the vice president introducing herself as ""Kamala Harris"" to the former president as they shook hands--before making it a top priority to attempt to get under his skin and bait him throughout the debate.

The debate got underway with questions from ABC News' David Muir and Linsey Davis, who challenged Trump throughout the debate.

TRUMP FLIPS 'I'M TALKING' SCRIPT FROM 2020 DEBATE AGAINST KAMALA HARRIS DURING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE SHOWDOWN

Shortly after it concluded, Trump told Fox News Digital that he thought it was his ""best debate ever, especially because it was three on one.""

Moderators began with the economy -- first questioning the vice president on whether Americans ""are better off than they were four years ago?""

Harris did not directly respond to the question. The Biden-Harris administration has seen rising inflation.

Instead, Harris incorrectly claimed Trump wanted to introduce a ""sales tax"" on everyday goods, but Trump dismissed that claim as an ""incorrect statement.""

Moderators chimed in, suggesting Trump's plan to impose tariffs on other countries would pass on higher costs to consumers.

But Trump countered, pointing to the high inflation of the Biden-Harris administration, calling it the ""worst in our nation's history,"" while touting the record-economy under his administration.

Trump went on to hit Harris on her lack of clear policies, saying her past record and ""everything that she believed three years ago and four years ago is out the window.""

""She's going to my philosophy now,"" he said. ""In fact, I was going to send her a MAGA hat.""

TRUMP, HARRIS TRADE BARBS ON CRIME DURING FIRST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'THROUGH THE ROOF'

Trump accused Harris of being a ""Marxist,"" and said if she is elected, her policies will ""change"" and ""it will be the end of our country.""

Trump accused Harris of not having a plan for the economy -- specifically to combat rising inflation.

""She copied Biden's plan. And it's like four sentences like 'Run, Spot, Run' for sentences that are just, oh, we'll try and lower taxes,"" Trump said. ""She doesn't have a plan.""

Harris fired back, saying Trump ""has no plan for you,"" and instead offered Americans an ""opportunity economy.""

Trump pivoted to the issue of border security and illegal migration into the United States, saying policies of the Biden-Harris administration have been a ""disaster"" for the country with record-high illegal migration.

Trump suggested those policies have ""destroyed our country,"" and said they have policy ""that you say 'they have to hate our country.'""

Next, Harris jumped to the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, claiming that Trump ""intends on implementing"" what she referred to as the ""detailed and dangerous plan.""

Trump has repeatedly denied being involved in that plan, and maintained Tuesday that he has ""nothing to do with Project 2025.""

Trump, though, shifted back to illegal immigration, fueling viral claims that migrants are eating pets in a town in Ohio.

""In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, the people that came in, they're eating the cats, they're eating the pets of the people that live there,"" Trump said, and was met with pushback from moderators, who seemingly attempted to give the former president a live fact-check throughout the debate.

TRUMP FACT CHECKS HARRIS ON CHARLOTTESVILLE RIOT ACCUSATION: 'DEBUNKED'

But Trump stood by his remarks when challenged by the moderators, saying ""people on television say 'my dog was taken and used for food.'""

Meanwhile, as for abortion, Harris claimed Trump would install a national abortion ban that would allow for no exceptions -- despite Trump saying moments before that he believes in exceptions for abortion including rape, incest, and life of the mother.

Trump has repeatedly said he would not sign a national abortion ban and praised the Supreme Court overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, bringing the issue back to the states.

Trump added in his rebuttal that he does not support a national abortion ban and that Harris' comments were an ""absolute lie.""

""As far as the abortion ban, no, I'm not in favor of an abortion ban, but it doesn't matter, because this issue has now been taken over by the states,"" Trump said.

Harris, later, claimed there would be a national abortion ban if Trump is elected, and falsely said there would be a ""monitor that would be monitoring your pregnancies, your miscarriages.""

Harris baited Trump throughout the debate Tuesday night--from claiming people left his massive rallies before they ended; to calling out his legal challenges; mentioning the late-Sen. John McCain; Jan. 6; and more.

As for Jan. 6, Harris accused Trump of inciting ""a violent mob.""

Trump, though, stressed that he urged protesters to demonstrate ""peacefully and patriotically,"" and accused then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser of ignoring his offer for 10,000 National Guard soldiers. Trump said Pelosi ""was responsible"" for Jan. 6.

Biden's disastrous debate performance against Trump instantly fueled questions about his physical and mental abilities to serve another four years in the White House - and spurred a rising chorus of calls from within his own party for the 81-year-old president to end his bid for a second term. Facing increased pressure from fellow Democrats, Biden, in a blockbuster announcement on July 21, ended his re-election campaign and endorsed his vice president.

TRUMP SAYS HE 'PROBABLY TOOK A BULLET TO THE HEAD' DUE TO DEM RHETORIC

The Democratic Party quickly coalesced around Harris, who enjoyed a wave of momentum -including a rise in the polls and skyrocketing fundraising - from late July through August. But Republicans argue that Americans' honeymoon with Harris is waning.

Harris spent five straight days from Thursday through Monday hunkered down in a downtown Pittsburgh hotel, taking part in an intensive ""debate camp,"" which included numerous mock debate sessions. She arrived in Philadelphia on the eve of the debate.

Trump spent much of last weekend at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, taking part in less formal 'policy sessions' with aides and allies. But Trump also traveled to swing state Wisconsin on Saturday to headline a campaign rally.

Trump huddled with advisers at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, before flying to Philadelphia just a couple of hours before the start of the debate.

""Trump is prepared for every style because that's what he's been doing on the campaign trail; has been doing unscripted pressers, pull-asides, interviews,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters on the eve of the debate.

The former president and his allies for weeks have repeatedly criticized Harris for sitting for only one major interview, and holding no news conferences, since taking over for Biden as the Democrats' standard-bearer. And on the eve of the debate, the Trump campaign announced that the former president will hold another news conference Friday in Los Angeles.

With the debate now over, Harris will get right back on the campaign trail, with stops in some of the crucial battlegrounds, starting with two rallies Thursday in North Carolina.

""It is certainly an important moment in the campaign, but it is one moment,"" longtime Democratic strategist and presidential campaign veteran Maria Cardona told Fox News Digital ahead of the debate. ""It was a margin of error race going into the debate, and it will be that afterward.""

Trump also quickly gets back on the trail, with a stop Thursday in swing state Arizona."

Vice President Kamala Harris was dragged on social media for her exaggerated facial expressions during the ABC News Presidential Debate against former President Trump on Tuesday.

Harris' smirk was repeatedly captured on the split screen during Trump's turn to answer questions from the debate moderators. Both Harris' and Trump's microphones were muted when the other candidate was given time to speak, a rule the Harris campaign had tried to change. This left Harris with nothing but her facial gestures to express her contempt for the GOP nominee.

At times, Harris was captured on camera dramatically rolling her eyes, furrowing her brow or squinting at her opponent while he spoke. Other times, she laughed or appeared to mock Trump's responses with exaggerated smiles.

TRUMP SAYS HE 'PROBABLY TOOK A BULLET TO THE HEAD' DUE TO DEM RHETORIC

Her many faces were immediately mocked by social media users, with some saying they represented her nerves and discomfort on stage, while others slammed them as rehearsed and ""pathetic.""

""Kamala Harris is doing obviously rehearsed routines instead of answering questions. Then she does rehearsed and exaggerated facial expressions when Trump talks. She comes across as fake and weak,"" New York Post columnist Miranda Devine posted on X.

""On content, Harris is winning. Visually, she's hurting herself. #Debate2024,"" Pollster Frank Luntz wrote.

""Kamala Harris' overexaggerated facial expressions during this debate are pathetic. They convey a sense of dishonesty and nervousness,"" Daily Wire senior reporter Ryan Saavedra said.

""So far... HARRIS is making faces way more than TRUMP on this split screen. DK how that's going to resonate with voters,"" Fox News congressional correspondent Aisha Hasnie posted.

""Kamala Harris has been way over coached on doing facial expressions because of the muted mics. It is uncomfortable and weird,"" conservative writer Carmine Sabia weighed in.

Journalist Ian Miles Cheong wrote, ""Kamala Harris should've taken more acting classes. Her facial expressions betray only poorly veiled anxiety.""

""#Debate2024 split screen right now is hurting Kamala Harris because of her facial expressions can't believe her debate coaches didn't hone in on that,"" conservative media personality Ford O'Connell agreed.

Former Michigan gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon quipped, ""My kids make the same facial expressions Kamala Harris is making when they are in trouble.""

""Harris only has smug TikTok ready facial expressions and friendly moderators going for her tonight. All her answers are canned and fake,"" Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America and Students for Life Action, posted.

A number of the biggest names in Hollywood came out in support of Biden before he dropped out of the race, before turning their support to Harris. Olivia Rodrigo, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris by sharing a video of a speech the vice president gave promising to ""stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans."" Major Democratic fundraiser George Clooney, who used a New York Times essay to call for Biden to drop out of the race, lent his support to Harris and Barbra Streisand said she would support Harris because of her vow to fight for reproductive rights. Musician John Legend, who performed at the Democratic National Convention in 2024, posted he was ""so ready"" for a Harris presidency. Director Spike Lee, ""West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin, director Ken Burns and Star Wars actor Mark Hamill threw their support behind Harris, along with actresses Rosie O'Donnell and Jamie Lee Curtis. Robert De Niro, who narrated an advertisement for the Biden campaign, praised the president's ""selfless patriotism"" in a statement that did not mention Harris but said ""there is nothing more important for our country than defeating Donald Trump at the ballot box."" British pop artist Charli XCX brought Harris into the Gen Z fold by tweeting ""kamala IS brat,"" an endorsement that was met by Harris' team changing the background photo on her X account to the ""brat"" green color and using the same font used on Charli XCX's album of the same name.

Beyoncé has not made a public endorsement but did give the Harris campaign permission to use her song ""Freedom"" in a video of her first official visit to her campaign's headquarters, a rare approval from the superstar musician. Beyoncé's mom and businesswoman Tina Knowles endorsed Harris with an Instagram post. Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle and former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have also thrown their support behind Harris. Former President Jimmy Carter, 99, reportedly told his son last week he was trying to make it to his 100th birthday so he could cast his vote for Kamala Harris. ""Sex in the City"" actress and former New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon threw her support behind Harris and her Vice Presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, in a post that read: ""I'm Walzing on air!"" Billionaire Mark Cuban, who previously said he was committed to voting for Biden, has also supported Harris and endorsed Walz as her running mate, calling him someone who ""can sit at the kitchen table and make you feel like you have know him forever."" Actor Tony Goldwyn, Republican political commentator Ana Navarro, comedian Mindy Kaling and actress Kerry Washington each supported the Harris-Walz campaign by hosting one evening of the Democratic National Convention.

Former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan ripped off his shirt while on stage at the Republican National Convention last month to reveal a Trump-Vance campaign shirt underneath, and called Trump his ""hero"" and the ""greatest president of the United States."" Musician Kid Rock has been vocal about his support of Trump in the past and at the RNC revamped his song ""American Bad Ass"" to include references to Trump. UFC President and personality Dana White called Trump the ""toughest, most resilient human being."" Rapper and reality TV star Amber Rose gave a speech at the RNC in support of Trump. Country music stars Chris Janson and Jason Aldean also appeared at the convention. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy in January said voting for Trump over Biden was a ""no-brainer."" Public-facing billionaires like Elon Musk and Steve Wynn have also supported the former president. Actress Rosanne Barr, a longtime conservative supporter of Trump, clapped back at Cuban's endorsement of the Harris-Walz ticket and called the VP pick ""another reason Harris is a disaster."" Actor Jon Voight has defended Trump on multiple occasions. 50 Cent's 2023 song ""Many Men (Wish Death)"" started trending online after the assassination attempt of Trump last month. The rapper responded by putting Trump's face on the cover of his ""Get Rich or Die Tryin.'"" While it's hard to call the response an official endorsement, he did appear to support the president in 2020 before apparently backtracking. Other celebrities who have supported Trump in the past, but not outright endorsed him yet this election season, include Lil Wayne and ""Happy Days"" star Scott Baio.

ABC News sparked intense backlash among critics for its aggressive approach to former President Trump versus its soft treatment of Vice President Kamala Harris during Tuesday's presidential debate.

The Disney-owned network shocked the nation as its debate moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis repeatedly fact-checked Trump on various topics from crime, abortion to the former president's past comments about the 2020 election.

""The ABC moderators are fact checking- incorrectly!- and in such a shockingly obviously one-sided way, that Trump enduring the ambush as well as he has is a win,"" conservative radio host Buck Sexton reacted. ""This debate has been a total sham, questions are all attacks on Trump, it's 3 on 1. Outrageous.""

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH ABORTION FACT-CHECK AGAINST TRUMP: 'COMPLETELY INTERJECTS HERSELF'

""So when Trump doesn't directly answer the question, ABC points it out. Kamala will NOT directly answer a single question and they let her off the hook,"" Outkick host Tomi Lahren pointed out.

""These debate questions and moderation is breathtaking. Holy s---. I'm not being hyperbolic. This is incredible. Absolutely outrageous,"" Ruthless co-host Josh Holmes wrote.

""ABC News moderators trying to make Candy Crowley look like a mute,"" author Jerry Dunleavy said, referring to the CNN debate moderator who infamously attempted to fact-check Mitt Romney in the 2012 election.

""The framing of every single question has been awful. Every single one,"" The Federalist editor-in-chief Mollie Hemingway wrote.

Some critics specifically called out Muir for his multiple spats with Trump.

""David Muir is criticizing and attacking Trump more than Kamala is,"" journalist Glenn Greenwald said. ""Kamala can relax because the ABC 'moderators' are handling the debate for her.""

""David Muir is running a strong campaign for president,"" author and activist Christopher Rufo quipped.

Others took aim at the network broadly.

""This has been an absolute disaster for ABC's credibility,"" NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck said.

""I've been telling you guys for years how much @ABC hates republicans..."" former ""The View"" co-host Meghan McCain said.

""ABC/Disney has done its best to help VP Harris. It's astonishing how badly moderated it has been,"" syndicated radio host Hugh Hewitt wrote. ""Trump could have put the election away and didn't. But she is so awful she still couldn't win with both moderators so obviously, terribly biased. Neither of them won but ABC/Disney lost half the country.""

The ABC moderators did earn some praise from other members of the liberal media.

""ABC moderators doing an *excellent* job,"" MSNBC host Chris Hayes reacted.

""I will say it ABC moderators have exceeded expectations. They are fact checking and confronting. Shows how abysmal CNN was,"" Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin wrote.

""Muir has a talent for delivering confrontational ripostes in a way that seems like Bob Ross talking about adding a little magenta to a sunset,"" New York Times correspondent Glenn Thrush said.

Meanwhile, Trump took a lot of flack for constantly ""taking the bait"" from Harris as well as the debate moderators.

""Ever since the crowd size comment, Kamala's been in his head. Trump's taking the bait and getting riled up. It's that easy,"" Puck News correspondent Tara Palmeri said.

""Harris keeps dangling bait for Trump and he keeps burning the first 20 seconds of the response on it,"" Semafor reporter David Weigel wrote.

""Donald Trump is taking every piece of bait - doing what a lot of the commentary was concerned VP Harris was going to do,"" MSNBC host Symone Sanders-Townsend similarly said.

""Trump is not doing what Harris is doing. Which is dodging/pivoting from his worst sections to his best or trying to derail Kamala Instead, he just keeps litigating each bait that Kamala throws him and ignores his own best issues,"" Breaking Points co-host Saagar Enjeti posted.

""You and I can scream all we want about the debate moderators, and they are actively trying to help Harris, but Trump agreed to the debate, took every bit of bait, and low information voters are watching this. His lack of discipline helps Harris,"" conservative radio host Erick Erickson concluded."
ABC's Linsey Davis raises eyebrows with abortion fact-check against Trump: 'Completely interjects herself',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/abcs-linsey-davis-raises-eyebrows-abortion-fact-check-against-trump,2024-09-11T02:50:08Z,"ABC News moderator Linsey Davis fact-checks former President Trump during the presidential debate.

ABC Presidential Debate co-moderator Linsey Davis raised eyebrows on Tuesday when she fact-checked former President Trump on abortion.

Trump was asked about his stance on abortion, as ABC's Davis pointed out that the former president has boasted about killing Roe v. Wade and has called himself ""the most pro-life President in American history"" but has since declared he would be great for women's reproductive rights. Trump also recently said Florida's six-week abortion ban ""is too short,"" but said he would vote against a ballot initiative that would overturn the six-week ban on abortions in the state.

""The reason why I'm doing that vote is because... they have abortion in the ninth month. They even have, and you can look at the governor of West Virginia [Viriginia], the previous governor... not the current governor, whose doing an excellent job, but the governor before, he said, 'The baby will be born, and we will decide what to do with the baby,' in other words we'll execute the baby. And that's why I did that,"" Trump said.

""They're radical. The Democrats are radical,"" Trump continued.

Once Trump was finished, Davis then sharply cut in to correct the record.

""There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born,"" Davis said.

Trump was presumably referring to former Virginia Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, who famously made headlines with comments on third-trimester abortions if severe deformities occur or a fetus is deemed non-viable.

""If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that's what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother,"" Northam said during a radio interview.

Davis' fact-check surprised many on social media.

Fox News host and Trurmp's former press secretary Kayleight McEnany said ABC should be ""ashamed"" of themselves and that the moderators were only prepared to fact-check Trump.

McEnany added, ""Kamala just invoked the Charlottesville 'both sides' hoax that has been fact checked as false by left-wing Snopes and the ""bloodbath"" hoax. Why is Trump having to debunk this and not the moderators?? The ABC moderators only fact check Trump.""

""Linsey Davis completely interjects herself into the debate to help Kamala. No surprise at all there. But I thought Trump nailed his abortion answer. This is Kamala's only issue,"" OutKick founder Clay Travis wrote.

Conservative pundit Stephen L. Miller repeatedly responded, ""Why didn't Lindsey Davis fact check this?,"" when people shared falsehoods told by Harris.

Many others had thoughts on the moment:

Later in the debate, co-moderator David Muir also fact-checked Trump after the former president suggested illegal immigrants are eating dogs and other pets.

Harris claims Trump abortion platform makes 'no exception' moments after Trump says the opposite,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-claims-trump-abortion-platform-makes-no-exception-moments-after-trump-says-opposite-absolute-lie,2024-09-11T02:20:52Z,"Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas interviews former President Trump about his stance against Florida's abortion ballot measure and more on 'Special Report.'

Vice President Kamala Harris claimed former President Donald Trump would install a national abortion ban that would allow for no exceptions, despite Trump saying moments before that he believes in exceptions for abortion.

""Now, in over 20 states there are Trump abortion bans, which make it criminal for a doctor or nurse to provide health care in one state, it provides prison for life. Trump abortion bans that make no exception, even for rape and incest, which understand what that means. A survivor of a crime of violation to their body does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body. That is immoral, and one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government and Donald Trump certainly should not be telling a woman what to do with her body,"" Harris said Tuesday evening from Philadelphia's National Constitution Center.

""Understand, if Donald Trump were to be re-elected, he will sign the national abortion ban,"" Harris added.

Moments before, Trump said he believes in exceptions for abortion, similar to former President Ronald Reagan.

JD VANCE VOWS TRUMP WOULD NOT IMPOSE FEDERAL ABORTION BAN, VETO IT IF COMES ACROSS DESK

""I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother,"" Trump said during the debate. ""I believe strongly in it. Ronald Reagan did also. Eighty-five percent of Republicans knew exceptions are very important,"" he said.

Trump added in his rebuttal that he does not support a national abortion ban and that Harris' comments were an ""absolute lie.""

""As far as the abortion ban, no, I'm not in favor of an abortion ban, but it doesn't matter, because this issue has now been taken over by the states,"" Trump said.

TRUMP SAYS PROJECT 2025 'GOES WAY TOO FAR' WITH ABORTION RESTRICTIONS

The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, with Trump praising the decision. He is now campaigning that abortion laws and issues be left up to individual states following the Dobbs decision.

Earlier this year, Trump did spark the condemnation of some pro-life conservatives for the GOP's more muted language on abortion this election cycle, and for saying last month that Florida's six-week abortion ban ""is too short.""

This story first appeared in NPR's live blog of the presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Follow along for live updates, fact checks and analysis.

In Tuesday's presidential debate, former President Donald Trump again falsely claimed that Democrats support abortions ""after birth"" and ""executing"" babies.

It's an attack line Trump has used repeatedly to paint Democrats as radical on issues of reproductive rights. But as ABC News anchor Linsey Davis mentioned during her real-time fact check, there is no state where it is legal to kill a baby after birth. A report from KFF earlier this year also noted that abortions ""after birth"" are illegal in every state.

According to the Pew Research Center, the overwhelming majority of abortions -- 93% -- take place during the first trimester. Pew says 1% take place after 21 weeks. Most of those take place before 24 weeks, the approximate timeline for fetal viability, according to a report by KFF Health News.

An analysis from KFF earlier this year noted that later abortions are expensive to obtain and offered by relatively few providers, and often occur because of medical complications or because patients face barriers earlier in their pregnancies.

""Nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion. That isn't happening; it's insulting to the women of America,"" Vice President Kamala Harris said on the debate stage Tuesday.

Trump was apparently referring to a statement by former Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, who is also a pediatric neurologist. Northam faced controversy in 2019 over his response to a question about how to care for an infant born with fatal complications.

As Davis also noted, Trump has offered mixed messages about abortion over the course of the campaign. He has bragged about his instrumental role in overturning Roe v. Wade, while appearing to backpedal on an issue that polling makes clear is a liability for Republicans."

This story first appeared in NPR's live blog of the presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Follow along for live updates, fact checks and analysis.

Vice President Kamala Harris quickly attacked former President Donald Trump on his association with the architects of Project 2025 in the presidential debate on Tuesday night.

""I'm going to tell you on this debate tonight, you're going to hear from the same old tired playbook, a bunch of lies, grievances and name-calling,"" Harris said in the first few minutes of the debate.

""What you're going to hear tonight is a detailed and dangerous plan called Project 2025 that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected to again.""

Trump found himself again seeking to defend and distance himself from Project 2025, the controversial plan drafted by the Heritage Foundation to overhaul the U.S. government. For weeks, Trump has been dogged by his relationship to those who drafted the 900-page, pro-Trump plan that calls for mass deportations, eliminating the Department of Education, imposing stricter controls on abortion and slashing climate protections.

""Number one, I have nothing to do -- as you know and as she knows better than anyone -- I have nothing to do with Project 2025,"" Trump said. ""That's out there. I haven't read it. I don't want to read it purposely. I'm not going to read it.""

Democrats have repeatedly sought to tie Trump to the most controversial aspects of the plans.

Allies got involved. Actress Taraji Henson brought it up at the BET awards, adding fuel to the fire.

It was also a big part of the Democratic National Convention, with comedian Kenan Thompson carrying out a cartoon-size version of Project 2025 to make fun of Trump and the effort.

It is true that the Trump campaign did not draft Project 2025. But those involved in the policy proposals include loyalists and allies of Trump, and former Trump officials.

These officials are likely to be candidates in a second Trump administration."
"In New Hampshire, An Attempt To Overturn A Landmark School Funding Decision",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petergreene/2024/09/10/in-new-hampshire-an-attempt-to-overturn-a-landmark-school-funding-decision/,2024-09-11T01:12:26Z,"Last year, Pennsylvania joined the roster of states under a court ordered by the court to get their school funding house in order. In 2021, a North Carolina judge ordered the state to fix funding inequity with $1,75 billion of additional monies. In 2012, the court ruled that Washington was not adequately funding its schools. Other states have faced similar court challenges to their school funding, some successful and some not.

But even when these lawsuits succeed, legislatures can have a long and difficult time meeting the court demands. Finding the political will to meet the requirements over decades can be challenging.

An early landmark case of this sort was Claremont School District v. Governor of News Hampshire. The case bounced around the courts for most of the 90s until the court finally declared that the state's funding system was unconstitutional, leaving poorer districts struggling with inadequate funding. Ruled the court:

While the State may delegate its obligation to provide a constitutionally adequate public education to local school districts, it may not do so in a form underscored by unreasonable and inequitable tax burdens.

Thirty years after the case was launched, the state failed to fix the system, with the results so unsatisfactory that New Hampshire's school funding was declared unconstitutional again last year.

That second ruling came from Contoocook Valley School District v. The State of New Hampshire, and the State Supreme Court has issued a stay based on the argument that the $537,6 million price tag would cause the state to ""suffer irreparable harm.""

Contoocook has been appealed, and in an amicus brief filed with the State Supreme Court, Republican legislators have proposed a simple solution -- throw out the original Claremont decision.

Speaker of the House Sherman Packard, along with 28 members of the Republican House caucus and two GOP senators, have filed an amicus brief arguing that the Claremont suit was incorrectly decided. The brief is by Gregory Sorg, a former GOP representative (2002-2008) who has been a longtime critic of Claremont.

Sorg's argument is novel, resting largely on Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito's ruling overturning of Roe v. Wade. Michael Kitch, reporting for NH Business Review, notes that the sixteen-page brief includes eleven pages about abortion jurisprudence with nine of those about Alito's Roe opinion.

Sorg argues for separation of powers, claiming the court was exercising powers it does not have. He also argues that, as with Roe, the court has failed to correctly understand the historical origin of a constitutional right, and that the court has the power to overturn a precedent that is ""egregiously wrong."" The constitution, he argues, simply says that the legislature has the ability to compel local districts to raise adequate funding and does not require the state to make sure that all schools are fairly and equitably funded.

NH School Funding Fairness Project Executive Director Zack Sheehan's response was quoted by columnist Garry Rayno:

Instead of owning up to their failure to adequately fund education in compliance with the Claremont rulings, these legislators are instead arguing that Claremont should be thrown out. They are trying to blame the Court for their own failure to comply with the Court's rulings over the past 30 years. And this begs the question, what do they think the State's role in funding education should be?

Currently the state pays a base amount of $4,404 per student. In the 2022-2023 school year, the average cost per pupil was $24,234. The NH School Funding Fairness Project found that in 2023, state and federal funds covered only 17.47% of costs for students with special needs. Using state data, the funding fairness project computes that state a federal funding covers only 30% of the revenues funding NH public schools."
Questions For The Kamala Harris And Donald Trump Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanmichelson2/2024/09/10/questions-for-the-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-debate/,2024-09-11T00:17:13Z,"As Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump do their last minute preparations for tonight's debate, I queried a handful of experts for questions they suggest - or would like - to be asked, and tossed in a few of my own.

Here are proposed questions the moderators might want to use:

2. Do you believe in democracy? What is your definition of democracy?

3. The peaceful transfer of power is a fundamental principle of democracy. You and Vice President Harris never met in person before tonight because you refused to attend the peaceful transfer of power during the inauguration. Why didn't you attend?

4. You have repeatedly threatened there would be violence, including referring to a ""bloodbath,"" if you lose this election. We experienced that on January 6th when your supporters stormed the Capitol and tried to hang Vice President Mike Pence. Why are you promoting violence?

5. How will you bring the American people together after the election if you win when at least half the public thinks you are unfit to be president again?

7. You repeatedly say that the United States is a failing nation, yet inflation is now lower than it was when you left office, the stock market has achieved historic highs, unemployment is lower than it was when you took office. The U.S. economy has rebounded faster and better than any other nation after the pandemic. What metrics do you have for describing the U.S. economy as failing?

8. The Inflation Reduction Act is pumping billions of dollars in to Republican-dominated, so called ""red"" states, including Texas, Florida, and Georgia, creating thousands of new jobs and boosting those states' economies. Members of Congress and Senators who voted against those bills have even taken credit for them with their constituents and shown up at ribbon cuttings for projects funded by them. If you are re-elected, you have claimed on the campaign trail that you'll reverse this legislation. Why would you undo all that economic growth across the country?

9. The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued its final climate risk disclosure rules, which are on hold as legal challenges work their way through the system. However, investors have been clamoring for such rules for years, because of the measurable financial risks of climate change as visible in the devastation to communities, homes and businesses from extreme weather events. The financial markets see these rules as a way to measure the financial risk companies are taking and how they are preparing for it. Other countries have similar rules and companies that do business overseas need to meet most of those rules too, so they have to do the same reporting. What action would you take regarding those climate rules?

10. You appointed U.S. Supreme Court judges who would overturn Roe v. Wade and bragged about it. Yet, you have changed your position on abortion over the years. What is your position on abortion and reproductive rights?

1. You have pivoted positions on fracking and oil and gas. Why did you change positions and what is your position today on fracking and can the American people trust that you will stick to that position this time?

2. The Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Act that you helped develop and pass include billions of dollars for energy projects, including mostly clean energy, but also carbon capture and natural gas, which favor the oil and gas sectors. But permitting challenges cause these and other energy and infrastructure projects to take as long as seven years in some cases. What specifically will you do to expedite the permitting process without compromising the analysis of the potential impact on the environment and communities?

3. President Biden angered the environmental community by approving the Willow pipeline and allowing some oil and gas drilling in public lands. What is your position on pipelines and why?

4. What is your position on nuclear energy and why? How will you ensure that communities with even the small nuclear reactors are safe?

5. During the campaign and at the Democratic National Convention, climate change and related policies seem to have been sidelined. There were a couple of very short presentations related to it at the convention, but all the mentions focused on clean air and water and not on the impact of climate change. Why and how much importance will addressing climate change have in your administration?

6. Many areas of the country have repeatedly had devastating hurricanes and floods, yet communities continue to rebuild in those areas, putting their lives, homes, businesses and communities at risk. Some insurance companies have even pulled out of those areas because they are tired of the high payouts. NOAA and other scientists predict that these storms will become more ferocious and more frequent and, therefore, potentially more damaging and life-threatening. Extreme weather events over the past 30-40 years have already cost nearly $3 trillion, according to NOAA. Will your administration put limits on where people can rebuild after such devastating weather events?

7. If elected, will you propose to increase the number of seats on the U.S. Supreme Court? If so, how and why?

. During the Biden-Harris administration, the influx of undocumented immigrants at the border hit historic highs. The numbers are much lower now, down to levels from when you and President Biden took office. What will your border and immigration policies be in your new administration and how will you get them passed if you have a divided Congress and Senate?

9. Most Americans want abortion to be safe, legal and rare, and there are millions of people who are offended by abortion as well. When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and turned these decisions over to the states, about 26 state legislatures passed bans of some level on abortion rights and their governors signed them into law. What will your abortion policy be that respects the various choices of all Americans on this issue?

10. Polling on the American electorate reflects that there is a great deal of divisiveness in the country. If you are elected, there will still be millions of people who did not vote for you and who support the very different policies of Mr. Trump. How will you bring such a divided country together if you are elected?

And then there are plenty of foreign policy questions, related to Israel and Gaza, Ukraine and Russia, China, The European Union and beyond."
DeSantis' controversial election police unit sparks new outrage,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/desantis-controversial-election-police-unit-sparks-new-outrage-rcna170418,2024-09-10T18:12:19Z,"Ron DeSantis isn't just opposed to an abortion-rights measure, his administration has also dispatched officers to check in with some who signed petitions.

Florida Republicans had reason to be pleased with the state's elections in 2020. Not only did GOP candidate excel at multiple levels, but the elections were effectively controversy-free. The Sunshine State has traditionally billed itself as the gold standard in election administration, and 2020 was no exception.

But Donald Trump's conspiracy theories fueled tiresome hysteria in Florida Republican circles, leading GOP officials to impose new restrictions to address a problem that didn't exist. Among the ""reforms"" was the creation of an Office of Election Crimes and Security, which far-right Gov. Ron DeSantis intended to use to pursue election crimes that largely didn't (and don't) exist.

Not surprisingly, the special unit has become controversial, and several of the cases it's pursued ultimately collapsed.

After the multi-million-dollar office was approved in 2022, the Cato Institute's Julian Sanchez summarized the problem nicely: ""There are few things more dangerous than a government agency handed cash and resources with a mandate to solve a problem that does not exist. As a rule, they'll invent it if they have to.""

That quote came to mind anew this week. The Washington Post reported on the Republican governor's election police unit ""investigating alleged fraud in signature gathering for the state's upcoming abortion referendum.""

In his social media message, the local voter wrote that the experience with law enforcement left him ""shaken."" He added that it was ""troubling"" to see the DeSantis administration devote so many resources to such an endeavor.

In case this isn't obvious, it was just last year when the GOP governor and his state legislative allies created a controversial and unpopular six-week abortion ban. Soon after, voters statewide began collecting signatures for a ballot measure that would undo DeSantis' abortion ban and enshrine reproductive rights in Florida's state constitution.

The governor has claimed that wealthy philanthropist George Soros is secretly behind the effort, and DeSantis denounced the all-Republican state Supreme Court for allowing voters to consider the issue.

Evidently, however, that was not the totality of the governor's response. The DeSantis administration also appears to have dispatched police officers to some Floridians' homes to inquire about their signatures on the abortion rights petitions.

Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani responded soon after, ""This is unhinged and undemocratic behavior being pushed by Governor Ron DeSantis in an effort to continue our state's near total abortion ban. It's clear voter intimidation and plain corruption -- continue to call it out and fight back."""
A look back at Trump's past debates,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/look-back-trumps-past-debates,2024-09-10T17:06:14Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are set to face off in their first presidential debate, and the stakes could not be higher. Harris has erased Trump's comfortable lead in the polls, setting up a razor-thin election with less than two months to go.

The highly anticipated matchup is the first time Trump and Harris will meet in person. It comes just 51 days after President Biden withdrew from the 2024 race and 75 days after his disastrous debate performance.

With Trump set to make a record seventh general election debate appearance, here is a look at what to expect in tomorrow's debate as well as his past performances.

THE MANY FACES OF DONALD TRUMP FROM PAST PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES

Although Tuesday's debate is the second one of the 2024 campaign season, it is the first time the current nominees will face off. The 90-minute, audience-free debate will take place at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia.

While Harris is hunkering down in Pittsburgh, Trump has forsaken traditional debate preparation. Trump has, however, employed former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to help him refine his skills. Gabbard, who recently endorsed Trump, had her own famous moment on the debate stage, when in 2020, she attacked Harris for her record as a California prosecutor.

TULSI GABBARD GIVES UPDATE ON TRUMP'S DEBATE PREP: 'HE KNOWS THE ISSUES'

Trump is expected to focus on inflation and immigration, two of the top issues in the 2024 race. The Trump campaign has been linking Harris to some of Biden's weaker areas, a strategy he is expected to employ in the debate. Harris is expected to focus on abortion rights, which is tied with inflation at 14%, as the second-biggest issue in the race. The overturning of Roe v. Wade has proven to be one of Trump's greatest political vulnerabilities.

The only 2024 debate between Biden and Trump was the first time a sitting president and a former president ever debated. It is also perhaps the most consequential in history as it ultimately led Biden to abandon his 2024 bid.

During the debate, the president struggled to mount a coherent defense or finish his sentences at times. As Biden wrapped up an argument about his record on border security, Trump quipped, ""I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said, either.""

FIRST 2024 TRUMP-BIDEN PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: TOP CLASHES OVER ISSUES FROM THE BORDER TO UKRAINE

The Atlanta debate where Trump and Biden clashed over abortion, immigration, foreign policy and inflation amassed 51.3 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. At the time, Real Clear Politics had Trump leading Biden by 1.5 points.

Trump and Biden squared off in Nashville, Tennessee, less than two weeks before Election Day. The debate was more subdued than the first round, in part due to new rules that kept each candidate's microphone muted.

As Biden and Trump squabbled over personal finances, Trump claimed Biden had made money from foreign entities. Trump further sought to paint Biden as a typical, corrupt politician. A recent report from House Republicans alleged that Biden ""participated in a conspiracy to monetize his office of public trust to enrich his family.""

HARRIS WILL HAVE TO 'FACE OFF' AGAINST BIDEN, HIS LEGACY IN DEBATE AGAINST TRUMP: NYT COLUMNIST

Trump also questioned Biden's accomplishments over his nearly 50-year public service career. Trump said he decided to mount a run for president because of the Obama administration's ""poor job.""

""I ran because of you, Joe,"" Trump said. ""I ran because of you.""

Nielsen Media Research recorded 63 million viewers for the final debate of the 2020 cycle. On the day of the debate, Biden led Trump by 7.9 points.

What people most likely recall from this debate is Trump's constant interruptions that led an exasperated Biden to declare, ""will you shut up, man?"" The debate quickly descended into chaos as the two sparred over abortion rights and Trump's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. An unrelenting Trump pushed Biden on whether he would ""pack"" the Supreme Court in the wake of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death. As the two men heatedly talked over each other about the pandemic, Trump declared, ""I'll tell you Joe, you could never have done the job that we did. You don't have it in your blood.""

Trump did not shy away from making personal attacks on Biden, hurling insults about his intelligence, saying, ""There's nothing smart about you, Joe.""

TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT REVEALS WHICH 3 ISSUES TRUMP SHOULD FOCUS ON DURING DEBATE: 'LET HARRIS TALK'

With 73.1 million viewers, the debate in Cleveland was the third-most watched for a Trump-Biden matchup. Real Clear Politics had Biden leading Trump by 6.1 points on the day of the debate.

The final debate of the 2016 cycle had Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton focusing more on personal weaknesses than policy. When Clinton attempted to tie Trump to Russia, he retorted that Russian President Vladimir Putin ""doesn't respect"" Clinton or then-President Barack Obama and insisted that he did not know Putin. As the two contended over Obamacare and Social Security, Trump proceeded to call Clinton, ""such a nasty woman.""

DEBATE FLASHBACK: TRUMP AND CLINTON'S MOST MEMORABLE 2016 MOMENTS

Clinton repeatedly used the debate to belittle Trump's character. Clinton's strongest language came when she challenged Trump's behavior toward women. Trump pushed back, vehemently denying any claims of inappropriate behavior toward women. ""Nobody has more respect for women than I do,"" he said.

A key highlight of the debate came when Trump declined to say he would accept the results of the election (much like his responses in 2020). Trump doubled down on insisting the process was ""rigged"" and that he would ""look at it at the time.""

Trump used this debate as an opportunity to launch a blistering attack against Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. When questioned about his conduct toward women, Trump stated ""there's never been anybody in the history of politics that has been so abusive to women,"" about former President Clinton. Hillary Clinton refused to address his comments about her husband.

TRUMP CLAIMS NO 'LIFTS' OR 'STANDS' WILL BE ALLOWED AT DEBATE WITH KAMALA HARRIS

Trump and Clinton also quarreled over Russian aggression, Trump's refusal to release his tax returns and his plans for the ""extreme vetting"" of immigrants arriving from countries with criminal links.

Trump's first presidential debate was the first to surpass 70 million viewers in nearly four decades, gaining a record 84 million viewers.

Trump came out swinging as he addressed the economy and jobs. As Clinton sought to defend her economic proposals, Trump attacked her political record, declaring she was a ""typical politician: all talk, no action."" However, as the debate progressed, Clinton put Trump more on the defensive. At one point, Clinton pushed Trump on his past comments on race and sex, prompting him to say, ""It's all words, it's all soundbites.""

An overview of Trump's past debates reveals an approach of rapid-fire statements, personal affronts, and ripostes - a strategy aimed at overwhelming his opponents. Additionally, with the race proving to be as tight as it is, Harris is anticipated to face greater pressure as the newer and unproven contender."
What We Know About Kamala Harris' Policy Agenda Before Tonight's Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/09/10/what-we-know-about-kamala-harris-policy-agenda-before-tonights-debate/,2024-09-10T14:01:47Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris will face off against former President Donald Trump at Tuesday's debate, where she's expected to be asked about a range of policy views -- and while the Harris campaign updated its website Sunday to elaborate on her platform, she still has not given many concrete policy proposals outside of economic issues.

Harris has broadly said she wants to support the middle class as president, proposing what she has dubbed an ""opportunity economy."" Tax-wise, that includes expanding the child tax credit -- including $6,000 for newborns in their first year and $3,600 per child in middle and lower-income families -- along with restoring the Earned Income Tax Credit for citizens who earn less than $63,398 and a pledge not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400,000 per year. The vice president also wants to go after price gouging for grocery store prices -- a proposal that economists have had mixed feelings about -- and target housing affordability. She has proposed giving $25,000 in assistance to first-time homebuyers and establishing tax credits for developers to build starter homes and affordable rental units, with a plan for a $40 billion ""innovation fund"" to address the housing crisis. Her administration would also boost small businesses by expanding a startup tax deduction from $5,000 to $50,000. After the Biden administration imposed a $35 monthly insulin cap for seniors, Harris has also called for expanding that to all Americans, along with a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket prescription costs. She said she will also work with states to abolish medical debt and expand Affordable Care Act subsidies. Harris said at the Democratic National Convention her administration would ""protect Social Security and Medicare,"" and her website notes it will ""strengthen"" those programs by raising taxes on high-income earners.

In addition to economic policies dedicated to boosting the middle class, Harris is also targeting higher taxes for the richest Americans, saying on her website the wealthy and large corporations will ""pay their fair share."" The campaign website outlines proposals to accomplish that including rolling back Trump-era tax cuts on the wealthy and implementing a ""billionaire minimum tax"" that imposes a 25% tax rate and taxes unrealized gains. She also proposes ""quadrupling"" the tax on stock buybacks and imposing a 28% long-term capital gains tax for people earning $1 million or more annually. That proposal is actually lower than the 39.6% rate that Biden has previously proposed, however, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has called for the vice president to ""go higher.""

Harris told CNN she does not support a ban on fracking, reversing an earlier position she held prior to 2020. The vice president did back climate change initiatives, telling CNN the ""climate crisis is real"" and ""it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time."" That being said, Harris explained she has learned that ""we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking."" The vice president's website otherwise points to the Biden administration's work on climate change and states Harris' platform ""advances environmental justice, protects public lands and public health, increases resilience to climate disasters, lowers household energy costs, creates millions of new jobs, and continues to hold polluters accountable to secure clean air and water for all"" -- but does not provide any concrete proposals.

While critics on the right have tried to paint Harris as Biden's ""border czar"" -- a position she never actually held -- Harris has faced pressure to outline her views on immigration. She told CNN she still wants to pass the bipartisan border bill that she blames former President Donald Trump for helping to kill earlier this year. Harris walked back earlier statements she made during the 2020 primary suggesting she wanted to decriminalize border crossings, telling CNN, ""We have laws that have to be followed and enforced that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally. And there should be consequences."" On its website, the Harris campaign said the vice president ""knows that our immigration system is broken,"" calling for ""comprehensive reform"" including bolstering border security measures and an ""earned pathway to citizenship.""

Harris told CNN she is ""unequivocal"" and ""unwavering in my commitment to Israel's defense and its ability to defend itself. And that's not going to change."" She pushed for a ceasefire deal with a two-state solution, saying any resolution must also ensure ""the Palestinians have security and self-determination and dignity,"" and her website suggests she would not make any changes to the Biden administration's approach to addressing the conflict. Harris also made comments in support of Ukraine during her convention speech and on her website, though she did not give specifics about any policies or level of aid she would support. The vice president has touted her work in helping Ukraine under Biden and said, ""As president, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies.""

Harris has made her support for reproductive rights a key part of her candidacy after advocating on the issue as vice president, and has heavily opposed attacks on the procedure by Trump and Project 2025 -- a right-wing agenda not formally affiliated with his campaign. She said at the convention and on her website she will sign a bill legalizing abortion into law if elected, which most abortion rights activists have interpreted as her calling for a return to the standard set under Roe v. Wade, in which abortion is allowed nationwide until the fetus is viable. Harris will ""never"" sign an abortion ban into law, her website states.

Harris called at the convention for passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. The John Lewis Voting Rights Act builds on the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and addresses parts of that bill that have been struck down by the Supreme Court, strengthening voting rights protections and restoring a requirement for states to get approval from the Justice Department to enact voting rules. The Freedom to Vote Act would impose sweeping measures like universal early voting, no-excuse voting by mail and automatic voter registration, along with adding protections against gerrymandering and reforming campaign finance laws to strengthen transparency and tighten rules around super PACs. Beyond voting, Harris' website also points to her longtime support for LGBTQ rights and said she will fight to pass the Equality Act that would codify anti-discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity into law.

Harris' website emphasizes she will work so that ""Americans have the freedom to live safe from gun violence,"" specifically backing proposals including bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, universal background checks and red flag laws. She also backs funding for law enforcement and said she would strengthen ""proven gun violence prevention programs."" Her calls to invest in law enforcement come after the Trump campaign has attacked Harris by claiming she wanted to ""defund the police,"" pointing to statements she made during the 2020 racial justice movement expressing some support for that movement -- though she never explicitly said she wanted to defund law enforcement.

In light of a series of controversial rulings by the conservative-leaning Supreme Court, Harris followed Biden in backing a series of reforms to the court, with her website singling out term limits and a binding code of ethics like lower federal judges have to follow. The candidate also expressed support for a federal measure that would undo the Supreme Court's ruling giving Trump and other ex-presidents some immunity from criminal charges, but her website did not specify whether Harris backs negating that ruling through a new constitutional amendment, as Biden supports, or via legislation.

Harris -- whose running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, is a veteran of the Army National Guard -- said on her campaign website that she will take increased steps to support veterans and their families. The website singles out steps like trying to end homelessness among veterans by investing in mental health and suicide prevention programs and eliminating barriers to employment for veterans. The Harris campaign said she will also ""[expand] economic opportunities"" for active duty military families and veterans, but did not specify any concrete proposals.

While her website does now mention a range of issues, she has not released the kind of detailed policy proposals on other issues that she did with the economy, and her website only briefly mentions any more concrete plans on each topic. The Democratic Party has released a platform that includes more detailed proposals, but it was drafted while Biden was still the nominee, so it's unclear if Harris would change those policies were she in office. The vice president has been willing to go beyond Biden's proposals with some issues she's released proposals on so far, such as supporting law enforcement's ability to go after companies for price gouging and raising the amount of assistance first-time home buyers should receive from $10,000 to $25,000.

Whether any of Harris' proposals will change before November. The New York Times reported in August that some of the vice president's big-money donors have asked her to tone down her proposal on taxing the ultra-rich, after she said she supported policies that would tax wealthy Americans on their ""unrealized gains"" -- meaning money that investors have made through assets like stocks, but haven't yet sold for a profit. Donors have reportedly brought their concerns up to Harris' campaign advisors and the candidate herself, and have claimed they do see some room for flexibility in her specific proposals. ""In my interactions with [the campaign], the key is she focuses on her values and is not an ideologue about any particular program,"" billionaire Mark Cuban told the Times. Harris defended changes in her specific policy views over the years to CNN, saying that while specifics of policies she supports may evolve, ""the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed.""

Trump and his campaign have slammed Harris' policies as being too far-left and ""radical."" ""If Kamala's goal was to confirm she's a Radical Left lunatic -- mission accomplished,"" the Trump campaign said in an email to press after Harris' CNN interview aired.

Harris took over as the Democratic nominee in July after Biden suddenly dropped out of the race, with the president endorsing Harris minutes after he announced he was stepping down and Democratic leaders quickly coalescing around the vice president. She had no challengers for the nomination. Harris' policy platform has become a key question her campaign has faced in the weeks since she became the nominee, and while the candidate released her economic agenda and highlighted it in an August 16 speech, those remarks are still the only substantive speech on her policy proposals she has given thus far. The vice president and running mate Gov. Tim Walz sat down with CNN in August following weeks of pressure for Harris to speak with the press, with the Trump campaign claiming the Democrat was ""ducking the media"" by refusing to do a one-on-one interview. Harris had previously only answered shouted questions from reporters and spoke with social media influencers at the convention. Her website had also not had an ""issues"" section previously, further inflaming criticism of not being upfront about her policies."
What Is Agenda47?

The ""platform"" section of Trump's campaign website now lists a set of 20 vague priorities, which are the same as those in the Republican National Committee's formal platform and often overlap with his previous Agenda47 proposals. The proposals now outlined on the website include ""seal[ing]

Trump's Agenda47 is distinct from Project 2025, a potential policy blueprint for the next conservative administration -- namely Trump's -- developed by the Heritage Foundation along with other third-party groups. While Agenda47 was released directly by the Trump campaign, the ex-president has said he doesn't have any involvement with Project 2025 and has attempted to distance himself from it, even as the 900-page policy guidebook was created with help from more than 100 people who served in his administration. Trump has also praised the Heritage Foundation's policy work in the past. The two policy proposals do have many commonalities -- like calling to leave the Paris Climate Agreement, kicking out career bureaucrats, pushing ""school choice"" policies and railing against transgender rights -- and it's unclear how much of Project 2025 Trump could choose to implement if he's elected.

Many of the items in Agenda47 and Project 2025 would probably require acts of Congress, but both agendas have proposed expanding the president's control over the executive branch. Trump's Agenda47 proposes reviving Trump's 2020 executive order (which Biden rescinded) that makes it significantly easier to replace career civil servants with political appointees. He also wants to ""overhaul federal departments and agencies"" to get rid of ""corrupt actors,"" crack down on government leakers and implement a ""Truth and Reconciliation Commission"" to fight what the GOP calls the ""Deep State.""

Since the last Agenda47 video was released in December 2023, Trump has announced other policy proposals separate from those released under the Agenda47 heading. On abortion, Trump has said he believes that the issue should be left to the states -- though many abortion rights advocates still believe he'd restrict abortion if elected. He and the GOP have also vowed mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, which is not mentioned in Agenda47's immigration plans. He's also pushed to eliminate the federal income tax on tips for service workers. Over the weekend, Trump called for mass arrests and prosecutions of people who oppose his claims on voter fraud, which he claims would include ""Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters & Corrupt Election Officials.""

What Trump will do once in office if he's elected. Trump's initial Agenda47 was released during the primary election and with the proposals on his website now offering much less detail, it's still unclear what policies Trump could actually impose if elected. The ex-president has tacked slightly more to the center in the general election on issues like abortion, but it remains to be seen what policies he would adopt once he's back in the White House.

In addition to proposals around more expected issues like immigration, education and defense, Trump's Agenda47 also includes a proposal for ""freedom cities,"" as the ex-president has called for using federal land to create up to 10 new cities, which would be roughly the size of Washington, D.C. Plans for the cities would be chosen via a nationwide contest, and Politico reported in March 2023 Trump's proposal includes investing in ""vertical takeoff-and-landing vehicles"" akin to human-sized drones and ""baby bonuses"" in hopes of staving off a declining birth rate.

Trump will debate Harris Tuesday night, marking the first time the two candidates have gone head-to-head since President Joe Biden left the race. The ex-president released his Agenda47 videos as he faced what was initially a crowded field of Republican primary candidates, though Trump ultimately proved to be the clear frontrunner, clinching the nomination in March. The GOP's policy proposals have come under increased scrutiny in recent months -- particularly as Democrats used the controversial Project 2025 to oppose Trump's candidacy while President Joe Biden faced criticism over his age -- though Project 2025 and Agenda47 have both been published since last year."

2.8. That's how many points Harris leads Trump by, according to FiveThirtyEight's polling average. Prior to Harris launching her candidacy on July 21, Trump led Biden in polls. Harris was up 3.7 points over Trump by Aug. 23, a high in her polling average, according to FiveThirtyEight.

The debate will run live on ABC and most other major networks at 9 p.m. on Tuesday, and on the ABC News Live streaming network, Disney+ and Hulu.

The economy, immigration and abortion are expected to be major topics in Tuesday's debate. Previewing his attacks on Harris, Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said the former president will link her to Biden's economic policies and highlight the more left-leaning proposals she endorsed during her 2020 presidential campaign. Harris, meanwhile, is widely expected to contrast her own background as a prosecutor with Trump's criminal record, highlight his role in Roe v. Wade's reversal and criticize his Project 2025 agenda. The debate is especially high stakes for Harris as she has spent only a month on the campaign trail and voters are less familiar with her background and policy proposals.

Trump said earlier this month he also agreed to a Sept. 4 debate on Fox News and that the ABC debate would be Sept. 25. His campaign quickly clarified the ABC debate would be Sept. 10 and NBC News would host the Sept. 25 debate, though Harris has only agreed to the Sept. 10 debate so far. An NBC spokesperson also indicated the date Trump floated was not official, according to CBS News, which reported the spokesperson said the network has had conversations with both campaigns about a range of dates.

Yes -- Oct. 1 on CBS.

Trump agreed last month to debate Harris after suggesting he might back out amid a feud over the rules. The rules for the ABC News debate mirror the ones Trump and Biden followed during the June 27 debate on CNN, including no live audience and muted microphones. Biden's rocky performance during that debate led him to drop out of the race and endorse Harris, following a weeks-long revolt by many top Democrats. Trump repeatedly waffled over whether he would debate Harris, bashing the network as biased.

It's unclear. The former first lady made a rare appearance at the Republican National Convention in July, and she issued a public statement on X criticizing President Joe Biden, while promoting her new book. ""It has become increasingly apparent that there are significant challenges to free speech as demonstrated by the efforts to silence my husband,"" she said in the statement.

Trump's campaign in 2020 argued against then-host Commission on Presidential Debates' decision to turn off mics during the second debate following repeated interruptions from Trump during the first debate.

Trump Reverses Course: Offers 3 Debates With Harris -- Including ABC Debate He Called Off (Forbes)

Trump Pledges He'll Debate Harris In 'Pretty Near Future' -- After Backing Out Of ABC Debate (Forbes)"
Opinion | The 7 questions Trump and Harris should face at the debate,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-harris-presidential-debate-questions-moderators-ask-rcna169727,2024-09-10T12:03:39Z,"They have 90 minutes to get illuminating answers in a difficult format. Here's some ideas.

Presidential debates are supposed to be Socratic dialogues in which two thoughtful candidates spell out why they have better ideas on how to move the country forward.

But let's be real. That's not going to happen this time.

Republican nominee Donald Trump speaks in cumulonimbus clouds of free association, rewriting history and avoiding being pinned down on specific positions. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is sharper when pressing the case against a rival on stage, but also sometimes leaves her own positions a little vague.

Still, Tuesday's debate between the two will be roughly 90 minutes in which the moderators can pose tough questions.

So what should they ask? ABC moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis will need to hit some of the big issues on voters' minds, but how they approach the question can make a big difference in whether it gets a response that viewers might find helpful.

Here are some suggestions for questions each of the candidates should face.

Project 2025 is a conservative proposal for actions you could take in a second term, written by many of your former aides. You have distanced yourself from it, but you did say that it had some ideas that ""everybody would like."" Can you name some of those ideas?

Trump does not want to be associated with Project 2025 and trying to pin him down on his relationship with it would go nowhere, especially with the tightly controlled debate format. A follow-up question would be to note that he has also called some of the ideas ""absolutely ridiculous"" and ""abysmal"" and ask which ones fit that bill.

When does life begin?

Trump has been all over the issue of abortion, appearing to endorse a Florida referendum that would expand abortion access and then walking it back, claiming that ""everyone"" wanted Roe v. Wade overturned. Sticking with a basic question about first principles would be more illuminating than trying to pin him down on the specifics of a particular proposal.

What is a mistake that you made during your first term and how would you handle it differently?

For anyone else, this would be a softball question, but Trump hates to admit mistakes, rarely even acknowledges them to himself and, when pressed, tends to start attacking and blaming other people for giving him bad advice. This question could elicit a very interesting response, even if on paper it's not a hard question.

As Joe Biden's vice president, you were present for many of the decisions he made over the last four years. Can you name an example of a time when you disagreed with his decision? How would you have handled it differently if you had been president?

Harris has managed to have it both ways, bragging about her role in popular Biden policies while also benefiting from being seen as a fresh start on tougher issues like inflation. Asking her to spell out a difference would also help clarify how she would approach the job.

Even in a best-case scenario for Democrats, you would have a narrow majority in the Senate to pass your agenda. Would you support repealing the filibuster in order to pass laws by a simple majority?

The conversation about ending or even just temporarily lifting the filibuster is happening behind the scenes in Washington, and there are indications that Harris, a former senator, supports it. This may not be top of mind for many voters, but it will have a huge effect on the legislative agenda for a possible Harris administration and deserves a public discussion.

As a local prosecutor, you vowed never to seek the death penalty. But as California attorney general, you changed positions, successfully defending it in court. Why did you change your position? And what is your current position on the death penalty?

Like many long-serving politicians, Harris has switched on several issues, including marijuana legalization and fracking, both of which she now supports. It would be interesting to press her on why she changed her mind on any of these issues, but she's already been asked about fracking in a recent TV interview and there's potential for a contrast here with Trump, who wholeheartedly endorses the death penalty.

Name an issue where you think your opponent has the right idea.

Moderators often like to end the debate by forcing the two candidates to say something positive. (At a 2016 debate, a voter asked the Trump and Hillary Clinton to say something nice about each other.) An interesting twist would be to ask them to highlight an area of agreement. Again, this is mostly a softball but it would be a chance to see what they choose to highlight."
"Trump-Harris race neck and neck nationally in new survey, pollster sees 'warning sign' for Dems",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-harris-race-neck-neck-nationally-new-survey-pollster-sees-warning-sign-dems,2024-09-10T11:54:18Z,"'The Big Money Show' co-host Brian Brenberg sits down with Todd Piro to discuss the role of the economy in the upcoming ABC News Presidential Debate, using tariffs as a negotiating tool and what Trump should focus on in his faceoff with Harris.

Former President Trump and Vice President Harris are neck and neck ahead of their first - and potentially only - debate in Philadelphia on Wednesday, according to a new survey of voters that has some pollsters seeing a ""warning sign"" for Democrats.

Harris leads Trump 49% to 48% among registered voters, showing a race that has tightened since August when Harris held a 3-point lead against Trump, according to an NPR/PBS News/Marist National Poll released Wednesday morning.

Among those who say they definitely plan to vote, the survey found Harris edging Trump by 3 points, 51% to 48%.

Trump, however, leads Harris among Independent voters 49% to 46% - a 14-point shift from August when Harris commanded an 11-point lead in a field that had multiple candidates, such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the poll found.

LIVE UPDATES: KAMALA HARRIS, DONALD TRUMP MEET IN PHILADELPHIA FOR PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE TONIGHT

Republican pollster Whit Ayers told PBS News that the swing in independent support is a ""warning sign"" for Harris' campaign.

""She had the honeymoon period,"" Ayers said of the initial excitement that Harris generated among Democrats after President Biden exited the race.

The latest results of the New York Times/Siena poll released on Sunday also found the two candidates locked in a dead heat.

In that poll, Trump seemingly shrugged off a burst of enthusiasm for Democrats after Harris entered the race, garnering the support of 48% of likely voters, compared to 47% who indicated support for the vice president.

NEW POLL SHOWS TRUMP HOLDS LEAD WITH 'REMARKABLY RESILIENT' SUPPORT

The NPR/PBS News/Marist National Poll also showed Trump up with Latinos voters 51% versus 47% for Harris, a 9-point swing since August.

On the issues, the survey found that a majority of Americans consider Trump better equipped to handle the immigration crisis (53% to 46%), the economy (52% to 48%) and the Middle East (51% to 47%). Harris, however, is perceived as the candidate to better handle the abortion issue, 56% to Trump's 42%.

Republican strategist Kevin Madden told PBS News that Harris' initial surge of support and enthusiasm was an ""enormous sugar high"" because she was ""a new candidate not named Trump or Biden."" Now, Madden says recent polling shows that burst of excitement subsiding.

""This race has snapped back to where it always was, which is a very, very close contest, amongst a very bitterly divided electorate, and that this election is going to be very, very close and it's going to come down to a few hundred thousand voters in a handful of states,"" Madden told the outlet.

Morning Glory: ABC News and its pass/fail test,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-abc-news-its-pass-fail-test,2024-09-10T09:15:10Z,"Syndicated radio host Hugh Hewitt reacts to Vice President Kamala Harris' first sit-down interview on 'Sunday Night in America.'

CNN ""passed"" its test in that came in the form of the first presidential date in June between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Opinions are divided on whether CNN passed or failed in its interview of Vice President Kamala Harris. (Having helped moderate five GOP presidential primary debates and being the only non-network individual in the debate prep rooms, the grade goes to the network involved, not the host. Debates and big interviews are collective efforts by the organizations hosting them.)

Tuesday ABC is carrying a heavy burden. To my knowledge, the network does not have on its payroll even one individual of significant stature as a host, contributor or executive who is a likely Trump voter. This means in a country that polling portrays as evenly divided between ""blue"" and ""red,"" inputs from Trump supporters into the debate preparation process are almost certainly unlikely to occur and thus it is extremely unlikely for the debate to feature questions that such voters believe are relevant and indeed crucial to the choice before the country.

How could ABC get to high ground from which the questions vetted by its debate team and posed by hosts David Muir and Linsey Davis don't result in a ""Bud Lite""-level meltdown for its brand and the brands of its parent company Disney? The surest path is to lean heavily on Commander-in-Chief questions. Presidents don't pass laws. They either sign what Congress sends them or veto such bills. Hypotheticals about whether a candidate would sign this or that hypothetical bill are just hobby horses for ideologues posing the queries.

A president does indisputably have control over America's national security and the deployment and use of its military. The primary relevant examples of this power relevant are (1) President Biden's decision to pull American troops out of Afghanistan in the way that he did with the consequences that pullout had and (2) support or refusal of support for Israel in its multi-front war with Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and of course Iran (the head of the snake"" as many supporters of the Jewish State deem the mullahs in Tehran.) A third obvious question in this category is whether former President Trump did the right thing when he ordered Qasem Soleimani killed in Iraq on January 3, 2020.

There are many other extremely relevant questions in this area including whether American military force will be deployed to defend our treaty ally the Philippines in the escalating confrontations with China's People's Liberation Army Navy or to defend the island state of Taiwan if it is attacked by China?

Another obvious area is America's southern border. What both candidates will do about the more than 10 million migrants who crossed into the country without an invitation in the past three-and-a-half years should be on the agenda.

TRUMP ALLIES OFFER DEBATE STRATEGIES TO BEAT HARRIS

Because the enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 rests with the president and his or her executive branch appointees and the Biden/Harris Administration has proposed new, controversial regulations about Title IX, an obvious and pressing question should be whether and why the candidates support biological boys who identify as girls should be allowed to compete in scholastic sports?

While we know the positions of both candidates on abortion, it is not a priority question but as FDA-approved drugs that result in abortion have been much litigated, a question in that area would not be inappropriate but, if asked, should be matched with one about when such drugs become inappropriate to prescribe? Planned Parenthood states on its website that ""In general, you can have a medication abortion up to 77 days (11 weeks) after the first day of your last period."" The organization adds ""If it's been 78 days or more since the first day of your last period, you can have an in-clinic abortion to end your pregnancy."" A question about ensuring the interstate availability of this federally approved medication is not particularly germane as the Supreme Court has ruled on a case involving the medication's current availability but no doubt liberals and Democrats would welcome a question about these drugs and it's not a wholly hypothetical one. The next president has authority over the Health and Human Services Department which controls the FDA just like they will have authority over the Department of Education which enforces Title IX. These are questions for presidents.

So is the forthcoming response from a new president to the explosion of anti-Semitism on campuses. So is the pace and success of the massive expenditures of the already legislated Green New Deal provisions. So is the future of nuclear energy and permit reform to expedite fossil fuel extraction and export. If a president can unilaterally act in an area, it ought to be on the table.

All of these questions are legitimate. Will any of them get asked? Asking both candidates how they assess each other's choice of a running mate would be interesting. There are a hundred fair and tough questions to pose.

If ABC produces an equal number of questions that strike both red and blue America as pointed but fair, and as many that are difficult for former President Trump to answer as are posed in that category to Vice President Harris, the network, and by extension Disney, will pass. If not, the whole country and its electorate will have rendered a verdict of ""fail"" on both by Wednesday.

Young swing state voters deliver advice for Kamala Harris: 'There needs to be more transparency',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/young-swing-state-voters-deliver-advice-kamala-harris-there-needs-more-transparency,2024-09-10T09:11:24Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Ahead of the ABC News Presidential Debate, Wisconsin college students are calling on Kamala Harris to be ""more honest"" with the American people about her plans and policies if elected president in November.

Fox News Digital spoke with voters at Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, about how they feel about the vice president's 2024 campaign and how they think she would lead the country compared to President Biden.

""I think there's a lot of optimism around what she can bring to the country,"" a student named Dylan said, but added the vice president needs to do more interviews, including about ""specifically what her record is.""

Dylan also encouraged the vice president to do more outreach.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN AGREES TO ABC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE RULES WITH SOME 'ASSURANCES': REPORT

""I think being more honest to the American people, going out and doing interviews, not just speaking on script at a rally, but actually going out and talking to the American people,"" Dylan said.

Dylan said when comparing a possible Harris presidency to Biden's, ""I don't know if there will be a huge difference necessarily. But I think there needs to be more transparency with the American people.""

Sheridan, another student, added, ""I feel like she doesn't really have a political stance on a lot of things. She's just trying to seem like a friendly candidate to everyone to try and get people.""

Additionally, Antonio said he has not heard enough from Harris when it comes to various issues.

""I haven't really heard much on education, on housing, and a lot of other crises that are happening in America,"" he said. ""So I guess I'm really just waiting to hear what else she has to comment on, because I haven't really heard much else.""

Antionio added that he felt that Harris is laser-focused on getting the female vote, but added that she needs to ""broaden her fan base.""

""America isn't only comprised of women,"" he said.

""What I've seen on different forms of media, all I've heard were abortion and women's rights and things like that,"" Antonio added. ""I'm standing for that and all that stuff, like that's cool too... But where do I come into play? I just want to know where I stand, honestly.""

However, Taylor, another student, said she can see positives when it comes to women's health care rights if Harris is elected.

""I think definitely there would be a lot of changes with women's health care rights, which is kind of an important topic to me just because I am a rising adult teen girl. I think that would really help a lot of people in America,"" she said.

Student Giacomo explained what it would take for Harris to win his vote.

""Be a peace candidate, not a war candidate... and then crack down on immigration,"" he said. ""That would win my vote.""

According to a recent CNN poll, Harris holds a 50-44% lead over Trump in Wisconsin. Since 2008, the winner of the general election has won Wisconsin each time, making the state a recent bellwether.

According to a national poll ahead of the debate, Trump garnered the support of 48% of likely voters, compared to 47% who indicated support for Harris, according to the latest results of the New York Times/Siena poll released on Sunday.

The results are essentially identical to the last time the New York Times/Siena poll asked voters for their preference in the aftermath of President Biden dropping out of the race in late July, with that poll also showing Trump with a 48-47 lead.

The Harris campaign takes its attacks against Trump over abortion on the road,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/10/nx-s1-5099060/harris-campaign-abortion-reproductive-freedom-bus-tour-ivf-trump,2024-09-10T09:07:36Z,"Georgia US House Representative Nikema Williams leaves the bus carrying her and other Harris surrogates on a reproductive rights tour of Georgia, at a stop in Macon. Grant Blankenship hide caption

As former President Trump struggles with messaging on the issue of abortion, Vice President Harris' campaign is making a major push focused on the issue.

The Harris campaign is running ads focused on reproductive rights in several key states, and recently launched a bus tour that will make about 50 stops focusing on battleground states between now and Election Day, Nov. 5.

During a recent bus stop in Macon, Ga., Latorya Beasley told her story of sitting in her doctor's office last year when she got the news that an Alabama Supreme Court decision meant her IVF treatment scheduled for about a week later would have to wait.

""My doctor told me despite preparing for this moment for months, we couldn't proceed,"" Beasley told a few dozen people who gathered at a park in Macon for the event organized by the Harris campaign.

Beasley and her husband were trying for their second child when fertility clinics across Alabama stopped offering the procedure. State lawmakers passed an emergency fix, but not before patients like Beasley lost time and money waiting.

""Donald Trump is responsible for what happened in Alabama and what happened to me,"" Beasley said.

And, Beasley added, Georgia voters are no strangers to the impact of the Supreme Court decision that overturned decades of abortion rights precedent just over two years ago. Most abortions are currently illegal in Georgia after about six weeks of pregnancy.

Georgia Rep. Nikema Williams -- who also chairs the state Democratic Party -- says voters she talks to worry another Trump administration will mean more restrictions.

""They are very concerned about what a Trump administration means for what is left of their reproductive freedom,"" she said in an interview with NPR aboard the bus between Macon and Atlanta on Friday. ""What I'm hearing is that voters are very motivated by this issue.""

Throughout the campaign, Trump has offered mixed messages on reproductive rights. In a recent interview with NBC, he said Florida's abortion ban -- which, like Georgia's, prohibits abortion after about six weeks -- was too restrictive. He also seemed open to voting for a reproductive rights initiative.

After pushback from anti-abortion groups, Trump later said he'd vote against it.

Pollster Tresa Undem says abortion is a top voting issue for key Democratic constituencies, and Trump knows that.

""The polling's no secret,"" Undem says. ""For independent women ... pro-choice suburban women, he's got to peel off some to win.

""There's a huge gender gap right now. If he doesn't close that, he loses.""

In a statement, Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated his position that abortion policy should be left to the states. Leavitt said Trump, ""strongly supports ensuring women have access to the care they need,"" including IVF and contraception.

In the meantime, Democrats are trying to remind voters of what Trump has already said and done, and linking him to policy proposals like the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, which calls for more restrictions on reproductive healthcare.

On Friday, at another stop along the tour at a barbecue restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff reminded voters that the state has one of the nation's worst maternal mortality rates, and a shortage of healthcare providers.

Ossoff, who recently led a Senate hearing on Georgia's abortion ban, told NPR he's hearing from doctors in the state about patients who've been denied abortions while facing medical complications.

""This is personal for Georgia women and it's impacting the health of Georgia women,"" he says.

Sitting with friends at the Atlanta event, Ursula Anderson says they're all working to help elect Harris.

""We need to remind them, irregardless of what rhetoric Trump is putting out there, there are American women that need support,"" Anderson says. ""And if they have forgotten because it's been two years, we need to remind them."""
Debate challenge: The pressure's on Kamala as she and Trump trade flip-flop charges,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/debate-challenge-pressures-kamala-she-trump-trade-flip-flop-charges,2024-09-10T07:08:45Z,"Gov. John Carney, D-Del., reacts to concerns over the vice president allegedly abandoning some of her progressive positions on 'America Reports.'

It's impossible to know just how tonight's debate will go, but polling suggests the pressure is on Kamala Harris.

Almost everyone on the planet knows what they think about Donald Trump, love him or loathe him. But the vice president, who has granted exactly one interview (speaking for 16 minutes) and generally avoids the press, hasn't debated in four years.

In a New York Times/Siena College survey, 28% said they needed to know more about Kamala; only 9% felt that way about Trump. (Who are these 9%??)

Some warning signs: More than 60% of likely voters want a major change from Joe Biden, but just 25% said Kamala represented that change, while 53% said Trump did. Not a great sign in what is obviously a change election.

HARRIS FINALLY ADDS POLICY PAGE TO CAMPAIGN WEBSITE, DEVOTES SEVERAL SECTIONS TO TRUMP

What's more, while roughly a third of Trump voters say he's too far to the right, nearly half say the VP is too far to the left.

It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that Trump will try to hang the Biden record around his opponent's neck - a tricky situation since any veep isn't in charge. And Kamala will use her prosecutorial skills not just to debate her opponent but to cite low moments from his four years in office - I'd wager Jan. 6 will come up - as well as pushing her top issue, abortion, where Trump has been softening his stance in a confusing manner.

Overall, the Times found Trump leading Harris 48 to 47% nationally, quickly noting that's within the 3-point margin of error. And the average of battleground state polls also shows 1- or 2-point leads for either candidate, which is a virtual tie (so the pundits need to stop saying Trump or Harris is ""leading"" in this or that state, when they know better).

It turns out that Kamala had no second act. Or that she was riding so high that she got virtually no bump from the Democratic convention. After all, the VP had a solid month of the most gushing coverage I've ever seen for her joy-filled and vibes-based campaign. Well, maybe Obama in 2008, but even he drew some criticism.

Was it a sugar high? Maybe. But the situation has her supporters pretty nervous. Yet all this will be forgotten if she does well in the ABC debate, with Trump working the refs by calling it the ""meanest"" network.

LIBERAL THINK TANK'S DEEP TIES TO BIDEN ADMIN, FAR-LEFT POLICIES COULD COME BACK TO HAUNT HARRIS CAMPAIGN

Here is one game that both sides are playing. Since both have flip-flopped as they move toward the middle, they are taking old or outdated positions and pretending they are current stances.

This is a particular problem for Kamala, since she has walked away from her left-wing rhetoric of 2019, when she didn't make it to Iowa. She said she was against fracking, for decriminalizing the border and for abolishing private health insurance.

And for the most part, she has done this without explanation, other than having anonymous aides say, oh, she doesn't believe that anymore.

That has enabled Trump to say that despite her reversal, she will ban fracking, a huge issue in Pennsylvania, after all.

This is where doing more interviews might have helped her, and I hope she'll do more after the debate.

HOW TRUMP, OR KAMALA, COULD WIN, AS ALL SIDES ZERO IN ON THE DEBATE

On the other side, with Trump opposing Florida's six-week abortion ban, endorsing free IVF treatments and vowing not to sign a national abortion ban, Harris insists he will sign such a ban - and noting that he bragged about his three justices overturning Roe. This, in turn, has sparked a backlash among some pro-life groups.

Corey Lewandowski told me on ""Media Buzz"" that Harris is running on abortion because it's the only issue that favors Democrats, who he argued have the extreme position by allowing the procedure through the ninth month.

In similar fashion, Kamala insists that Trump will carry out the Heritage plan Project 2025, despite the fact that he has repeatedly disavowed it and called parts of it abysmal.

For voters who don't follow the campaign as incessantly as journalists and politicos, this may all seem rather confusing. But ultimately the debate, and the election, won't turn on policy.

Trump has a four-year term in the White House to praise or pick apart. Kamala has to make viewers on all the networks that will simulcast the ABC debate comfortable with her both as a likable person and a potential commander-in-chief.

My own gut feeling is that this will be the only debate between the two. If one of them starts agitating for more debates later on, that will be the candidate who feels like he or she needs a do-over."
Opinion | Mark Robinson's candidacy has gone from bad to worse  --  and it could hurt Trump,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/mark-robinson-north-carolina-scandal-trump-rcna169743,2024-09-09T22:10:47Z,"A man who gives no grace to others can't expect it for himself after so many scandals.

It's possible nobody cares whether or not Mark Robinson, the MAGA Republican running for North Carolina governor, used to hang out at adult video stores, as one explosive investigative piece in that state reported last week.

It's possible, but unlikely.

Robinson's star has been rising since a gun rights rant made him a right-wing star in 2018. Now, he's North Carolina's lieutenant governor and, with former President Donald Trump's blessing, he's trying to be the first Black governor in the state's history.

But Robinson has built his brand on judging, more than any politician I've seen in my two decades covering politics in North Carolina. Women, liberals, public school teachers, atheists, LGBTQ+ people, Jewish people, poor people -- few have been spared Robinson's righteous wrath. God calls men, not women, to lead, he says. LGBTQ+ people are ""demonic."" They're ""filth,"" they're ""maggots."" Women get abortions because they couldn't keep their ""skirt down."" Some folks out there ""need killing.""

The problem with judging so loudly and so often is you invite the same for yourself. A man who gives no grace to others can't expect it for himself.

The Assembly, an online news site in North Carolina, reported last week that in the 1990s and early 2000s, before Robinson was running for any offices, he would visit adult video stores in his hometown as often as five times a week.

According to the report -- which Robinson's campaign denied, calling the reporters ""degenerates"" -- he would bring in pizza from the Papa John's restaurant he worked at and ""preview"" pornography in a booth inside the store. Multiple employees said he was a memorable customer. He was gregarious and funny, they said, albeit homophobic, occasionally cracking jokes at the expense of the store's gay clientele.

""I know he might have problems with gay people, but I don't think he has problems with lesbians,"" one employee said of Robinson's taste in pornography, according to the Assembly.

People will say this isn't news. Many Americans, especially men, have watched or regularly watch pornography. But porn's ubiquitousness has nothing to do with why this story matters.

Voters will forgive bad policies, dumb statements, even crimes, but they rarely forgive humiliation. They won't see the big, strong MAGA superhero Robinson says he is. They'll see a gay-hating man taking a pizza into a private booth in a windowless adult video store to watch lesbian porn.

In politics, there's the person politicians say they are, the person people perceive them to be, and the person they really are. You hope there's not much of a gap between them, but with Robinson -- this ""born again"" Christian who, according to his memoir, found religion in the 1980s -- it's a Grand Canyon-sized chasm.

Not everyone in Robinson's base -- rural, mostly white Christians -- will believe this story. But some will and, for better or for worse, people don't like to talk about sex or pornography in these communities. It's not ""table-talk."" The Assembly's story documented how people of faith picketed the Greensboro, North Carolina, adult video stores that Robinson is accused of going to. Those people are the people who are supposed to be excited to vote for Robinson.

This adult video store story is just the latest trouble for Robinson's struggling campaign. The governor's race should be nail-bitingly close but, according to some polls, Robinson trails his Democratic opponent, North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, by double digits. Some Republicans are even concerned that Robinson might damage former President Donald Trump's hopes of carrying North Carolina, an all-important battleground state in the presidential election.

If that's the case, Republicans have no one but themselves to blame. Robinson's drawbacks as a candidate were obvious. In 2022, after years of anti-abortion statements from Robinson, we learned that he paid for his wife's abortion in 1989, before they were married. That's hard to stomach from a man who's supported a complete abortion ban, called abortion doctors ""butchers of humanity,"" and shamed women who need reproductive health care.

Robinson also has touted himself as a small-business owner who believes in personal responsibility while slamming people who take government ""charity."" But his background includes multiple bankruptcies, five years of unfiled federal taxes and a day care business that, according to state records, was cited numerous times for violations of state standards that are meant to keep children safe. Another report found that state inspectors cited the day care, which Robinson and his wife co-owned, for falsifying certification documents so it could stay open.

Then there's last month's report in the Atlantic that Robinson, a U.S. Army veteran who promised to lead on veterans' issues, hasn't attended a single meeting of North Carolina's Military Affairs Commission in the four years he's been lieutenant governor -- even though the commission is one of the few statutory duties of his office.

Either the state Republican Party performed no background research on its candidate for governor or, more likely, it knew and didn't care. It believed that, after Trump's myriad controversies didn't sink him, that there is no floor, no accountability anymore for a MAGA candidate. But Robinson isn't Trump. He isn't being forgiven like Trump's forgiven. The polls make that clear.

Like Trump, Robinson is light on policy, large on spit and venom. From his speeches, you'd think North Carolina is a blood-soaked, charnel wasteland, not one of the fastest-growing states in the nation -- a pretty place with mountains, beaches, bootleggers, the best historically Black colleges in the nation, a massive veterans' community, race car drivers, Dreamers, poets, musicians and Pride marches. It's a complicated place, the kind of complicated that politicians like Robinson are afraid of.

Republicans assumed the worst of their own base, of people of faith, of North Carolinians -- that they are cruel and stupid people who will reward the same in their political candidates. It's an offensive miscalculation.

Now, the only question is whether North Carolina voters will make Trump and other Republicans on the ballot with Robinson pay for it too."
Obama's half brother rips Biden-Harris agenda while hyping second Trump term: 'We're going to win',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/obamas-half-brother-rips-biden-harris-agenda-hyping-second-trump-term-going-to-win,2024-09-09T20:29:21Z,"Malik Obama explained to Fox News Digital why he is once again supporting former President Trump after leaving the Democratic Party.

Former President Obama's half brother is backing former President Trump for president and spoke to Fox News Digital about why he left the Democratic Party and why he believes Trump is ""going to win"" in November.

""I'm supporting President Trump. I've been a supporter, a supporter since 2016. I like him,"" Malik Obama told Fox News Digital on Monday. ""I like the way he comes across. I like his demeanor. I like his straightforwardness. And I think he's good for the country. And, he put the country back on course. Yes. I'm a Republican, so he's my nominee.""

Malik and Barack are both sons of Barack Hussein Obama Sr. and Malik was the best man at Barack's 1992 wedding, although the two have grown estranged since.

""The main thing is making America strong, you know, in the eyes of the world. And Trump is a strong person. He's known for his mettle, his strength and I like that,"" Malik said. ""He's a no-nonsense guy. He's a businessman, so he knows, you know, how to run a big organization. And the Democrats, I fell out with them because they're hypocrites.""

EX-OBAMA ADVISER WARNS 'IT'S VERY POSSIBLE' TRUMP WOULD WIN ELECTION IF HELD TODAY, SAYS REPORTERS TOO COCKY

Obama explained that the hypocrisy that made him leave the Democratic Party involved the way Democrats have treated Trump and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.

""They've been treating Mr. President Trump horribly,"" Obama said. ""I'm not seeing anything like that in my life. You know, they're going after him for, you know, going through tooth and nail. But using the judiciary to try to lock him up and keep him off the ballot, and I've not seen anything like that in my life. So the way they're treating a former president of the United States of America is despicable to me.""

Obama said that in 2024 he believes ""Democrats will be there doing the same thing they did in 2016.""

5 OVER-THE-TOP DNC MEDIA MOMENTS, FROM COINING THE TERM 'KAMALA HARRIS DEMOCRATS' TO COMPARING OBAMA AND JESUS

""They did it with Hillary, Hillary Clinton, and they were lying. And, you know, they're just hypocrites. And, you know, they're not straightforward and OK, I was a Democrat at that time until, you know, they started lying and, about the emails and I saw through, you know, they're, they're trying to put Hillary Clinton through, by devious means,"" he continued. ""And then Trump came out and called them out. He called them out straight to their face. And I like that. And a light bulb just came on from my head. And I just said, 'Yeah, this is it.' So I've been a big Trump follower since then.""

Obama also took issue with President Biden and the way his party handled transitioning to VP Harris.

""Then you had Joe Biden, old man,"" Obama said. ""He can't even find the door even if you showed him, and he holds on until the last minute and he is the nominee. And all of a sudden, they drop off and they put Kamala Harris. Come on Harris. She's like a joke. I see the way she behaves and everything, and I don't think that she's the right person. Maybe they should have decided to put Michelle Obama instead.""

Obama said his half brother Barack Obama and Harris are ""cut from the same cloth"" and ""wishy-washy,"" especially when it comes to abortion and immigration.

""Going around, fooling around with biology and things like that,"" Obama said. ""I think that is evil. But they stand for that. And I think that is abominable, you know, that they would go ahead and support such things. She's talking about freedom of, what is it? What she's talking about reproductive freedom and reproductive freedom is abortion.

""You know, giving somebody the right to go ahead and kill a baby,"" he added. ""I don't agree with it. I find it really abominable that they would do such a thing.""

""Even the border issue with the immigration and illegal immigrants coming into the United States. It took me forever to get my children [through] and I came in legally to the United States. I had a green card. The papers were put through, and I went through the process, and I was a legal resident for a long time until I decided to become a U.S. citizen. And that also was a process. You have to go and file and apply and do the things you're supposed to do,"" Obama continued. ""And then, my children are now in the USA and had to go put in the papers for them and then legally. And then you got people coming in, illegals and being allowed to vote and things like that. And, and that to me is, you know, that's a no no. I can't stand for that. And I can't support that kind of policy.""

Obama's half-brother went on to tell Fox News Digital that he believes former President Obama is ""fake"" and ""did zilch"" for his family and that's part of the reason Trump is so appealing in comparison, because he ""doesn't beat around the bush.""

""Yeah, we're going to win,"" Obama said about what his message to Trump would be.

""I just say President Trump, you're going to win in November 2024,"" he concluded. ""You're going to win. And I think you're going to win by a landslide because all the hype that's going on with Kamala and she can't even interview, and I'm waiting for tomorrow, and everybody's going to see that she can't interview.

Republicans Try To Derail Abortion Ballot Measures Weeks Before Election,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/09/09/republicans-try-to-derail-abortion-ballot-measures-weeks-before-election/,2024-09-09T20:23:57Z,"Republicans in four states are still challenging abortion ballot measures less than two months before Election Day -- with Missouri's possibly set to be removed from the ballot this week -- as the GOP fights against abortion ballot measures after previous referendums in 2022 and 2023 have always broken in favor of abortion rights.

Additional court battles have already taken place over the ballot measures in Missouri and Florida. Missouri Attorney General Jay Ashcroft, a Republican, had already separately been challenged in court for writing a summary of the ballot measure that abortion rights advocates claimed was misleading. Ashcroft suggested the ballot measure would allow abortion at any point during a pregnancy, which is untrue, and a court agreed with abortion rights advocates who challenged the language. The Florida Supreme Court in April allowed the abortion measure onto the ballot -- though it also separately greenlit the state's six-week ban -- but later ruled in August that a financial impact statement could remain as part of the ballot measure's language. Abortion rights advocates have fought against that language, which says the constitutional amendment, if passed, could lead to Medicaid funds being used on abortion. Court battles have also played out in other states where abortion rights measures are now on the ballot, including Arizona, Montana and New York, while the Arkansas Supreme Court blocked that state from putting abortion rights up for a vote.

Ten states in total are set to have abortion-related ballot measures in the general election: Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York and South Dakota. Nebraska is set to have two competing measures on the ballot in November, one of which would legalize abortion while the other would preserve the state's 12-week ban. It remains to be seen how the ballot measures will fare: though polling in Florida, Arizona and Nevada has shown majority support in favor of preserving abortion rights, polling by the Public Religion Research Institute in 2023 found South Dakota is one of the few states where only a minority of residents (47%) favor abortion rights. The measures stand to have a notable effect on abortion access in the U.S. if they were all to break in favor of abortion rights. While the procedure is still legal in Colorado, Maryland, Montana, Nevada and New York, the measures would overturn total abortion bans in Missouri and South Dakota, along with Florida's six-week ban and Arizona's 15-week ban. In states where the procedure is already legal, advocates argue the constitutional amendments proposed in the ballot measures would safeguard abortion rights in case any politicians try to restrict it in the future.

How the abortion ballot measures will impact the election. Democrats have used abortion as a key catalyst to get the party's base to the polls in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade, with an April memo released by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) arguing, ""When abortion is on the ballot, voters turn out to defend their rights."" Increased turnout on the left could benefit Vice President Kamala Harris in the battleground states of Arizona and Nevada, while Democrats are hoping Montana's referendum will boost vulnerable incumbent Sen. Jon Tester. In its memo, the DCCC identified 18 close House races in states with abortion measures in which Democrats could get a boost from the referendums -- a list that, since being compiled in April, is likely to have grown since then as more states have had ballot measures approved.

The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, ruling there is no longer a federal right to an abortion and kicking off a wave of state-level bans. The ruling and ensuing bans have made abortion a key issue in federal and state elections ever since, with abortion ballot measures becoming a primary tactic for abortion rights advocates to preserve access. Seven states have had abortion-focused ballot measures since the Supreme Court's ruling -- California, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana, Ohio and Vermont -- with all breaking in favor of abortion rights. Polling has repeatedly shown a majority of Americans support abortion being at least mostly legal and oppose banning it, so ballot measures have been a way for abortion rights advocates to harness that support even in states where conservative lawmakers oppose abortion. Republicans' efforts against many of the ballot measures in this election cycle are part of a broader trend of GOP officials trying to prevent abortion from making the ballot: in Ohio, for instance, voters approved a measure in favor of abortion rights last year after Republicans held a referendum months earlier trying to make it harder for such ballot measures to pass. Their efforts to raise the bar failed, paving the way for the reproductive rights measure's success."

Hyper-Targeted Tax Breaks Are A Troubling Campaign Trend,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2024/09/09/hyper-targeted-tax-breaks-are-a-troubling-campaign-trend/,2024-09-09T19:48:55Z,"Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are promoting a troubling idea: Hyper-targeting tax subsidies to narrowly favored activities or occupations. While Trump and Harris are increasingly using this tool, Trump has been far more aggressive.

The tension between using the tax code to raise revenue versus rewarding specific activities or benefitting specially defined groups is hardly new. But this year's collection of proposed credits and deductions would be more tailored than a bespoke suit. And they'd make the tax code less fair and less efficient.

Both Trump and Harris would make certain income entirely tax-free for some workers but not others. Trump would make one medical treatment free but not others, even those aimed at achieving the same result.

Targeting Voters

What is this all about? In part, hyper-targeting may be an effort to limit increases in the deficit. But it's also a way for candidates to attract narrow slices of voters. For instance, both candidates announced their tax-free tips plans in Nevada, a swing state with more tipped workers per capita than any other. Similarly, both are battling to win the support of suburban women, who broadly reject Trump's views on abortion.

Take those tax-exempt tips. Both candidates say tipped workers should get a tax break while other workers making the same amount of money, but in wages, would not. See Trump here and Harris here).

Similarly, Trump would exempt Social Security benefits from tax. But why should government retirement checks be exempt from federal tax while income from most private annuities, another form of retirement savings, is taxable?

Why Is IVF Special?

Then there is Trump's promise to make in vitro fertilization (IVF) free. He has not said how this would work, suggesting he'd either force insurance companies to pay or make it a new government benefit.

While several states already mandate limited insurance coverage for IVF, it seems improbable that Trump would propose a federal coverage mandate. The most likely alternative for government to provide free care to those not receiving public insurance such as Medicare and Medicaid would be a refundable tax credit.

Trump has talked only about free IVF. But what about those who receive other fertility treatments, such as intrauterine insemination, surgery, or medications?

And why should treatment for conditions such as infertility be eligible for a tax credit while cancer or dementia care is not?

Subsidizing Newborns

At the same time, Trump wants to allow parents to deduct their costs of raising a newborn, which averages about $13,000 annually. Such a deduction might benefit middle- and upper-income parents who can claim other itemized deductions but it would be useless for many low-income families who would be better off with the standard deduction ($14,600 for a single filer and $29,200 for a married couple in 2024).

Trump has not said, but this new deduction could come on top of the existing Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit, which already provides a limited subsidy for the cost of caring for a child. It also could be added to the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit (CTC).

Trump's running mate JD Vance wants to increase the CTC to $5,000, though Trump himself has remained silent on that idea.

For her part, Harris has proposed both increasing the CTC amount and adding an additional credit for newborns.

Instead of doubling up on existing subsidies for the care of very young children, why not create a new deduction or credit for the cost of caring for an elderly parent, which on average is vastly more expensive? Or to care for a child with a disability? Are these expenses less ""pro-family?""

Trump's latest: Lowering the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15%, but only for firms ""that make their products in America."" But an arbitrary tax code definition of ""make"" will inevitably create unintentional consequences.

Broadening the Subsidies

Of course, candidates could avoid these inequities by opening the doors to much broader government subsidies. But that could add tens or hundreds of billions of dollars to the cost of these subsidies and might raise some awkward questions, especially for Trump.

For instance, government-funded health care, even for a specific treatment for one condition, would be a departure from past policy. The federal government does cover specific conditions through Medicare, such as end stage renal disease. But Trump seems to be hinting at an entirely new government program. One that, curiously, would be a step in the direction of Medicare for All proposed by Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT), a concept Trump has decried as a ""socialist takeover of our healthcare.""

In fairness, these are not the only examples of hyper-targeting tax benefits. For example, military pay earned in a combat zone is exempt from federal income tax. But the practice is exceedingly rare.

The current crop of highly targeted tax break proposals not only would be unfair and inefficient but present a tempting opportunity to game the revenue code. And that would create an administrative nightmare for the IRS, which, for example, would have to define eligible tipped workers or exactly which fertility treatment would trigger a credit.

Yes, it is the height of campaign season, but that doesn't justify this unfortunate trend."
"Liberal think tank's deep ties to Biden admin, far-left policies could come back to haunt Harris campaign",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/liberal-think-tanks-deep-ties-biden-admin-far-left-policies-could-come-back-haunt-harris-campaign,2024-09-09T19:07:19Z,"Democratic VP candidate Tim Walz accepts his party's nomination on night three of the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago.

As former President Trump faces backlash from Democrats over ties to the Heritage Foundation's ""Project 2025,"" the Biden-Harris administration has been working hand in hand with a prominent liberal think tank through a revolving door of employees working to turn progressive policy recommendations into executive actions and legislation, which could come back to haunt the Harris campaign.

The Center for American Progress (CAP) has been labeled the ""most influential"" think tank in the Biden era, while the group publicly boasts that it has turned at least 10 policy recommendations into ""executive action and policy legislation.""

Patrick Gaspard, the current president of CAP, has visited the Biden White House at least 20 times between December 2021 and January 2024, which included five solo meetings with high-ranking Biden officials.

CAP's ties to the Biden White House go even deeper than Gaspard, as at least 60 alumni from the think tank have joined the administration, including Neera Tanden, who previously served as president of CAP and has served in multiple roles in the Biden administration, including senior adviser and staff secretary.

PETE BUTTIGIEG REGULARLY CONSULTS DARK MONEY-FUNDED GREEN GROUPS, CALENDAR ENTRIES SHOW

She was promoted in May 2023 to the ""Assistant to the President and Domestic Policy Advisor"" titles, replacing Susan Rice, according to a White House press release.

President Biden also hired CAP founder and chairman John Podesta as a senior White House clean energy czar in 2022. Podesta was tasked with overseeing roughly $370 billion in climate spending appropriated by the Inflation Reduction Act.

The former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman was then tapped by Biden earlier this year to serve as his top climate diplomat after John Kerry stepped down to help with campaign efforts, which received backlash from top Republicans due to concerns over his ties to China dating back to his CAP days.

Fox News Digital first reported on his connection to top CCP official Tung Chee-hwa, who he repeatedly referred to as his ""friend"" and took several calls from.

CAP's influence within the Biden White House began months before he entered office. In late 2020, a half dozen of the group's employees joined Biden's transition team in the Treasury, Federal Reserve, Labor Department, Interior Department, National Security Council and Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

CAP's organization appears primed to push a policy agenda on several key issues on the progressive wish list if the Biden administration, now led by Vice President Kamala Harris on the presidential ticket, were to continue into a second term.

CAP has voiced support for both setting term limits for Supreme Court justices and packing the court, which are two efforts being pushed by Demand Justice, a left-wing dark money group that Harris' senior campaign adviser Brian Fallon co-founded and left less than a year ago.

The liberal think tank has signed onto multiple letters pushed by Demand Justice, which was reportedly planning a $10 million offensive against conservative Supreme Court justices this year ""on a range of activities, from conducting opposition research on potential Supreme Court picks to advocating for ethics reforms for the high court,"" Politico reported.

""The Supreme Court has taken off its mask this term by creating unconstitutional de facto immunity for future presidents who act illegally and by gutting the ability of public agencies and Congress to protect Americans from abuse by right-wing special interests,"" CAP states on its website.

BIDEN OMB NOMINEE NEERA TANDEN RECEIVED $731G OVER 2 YEARS FROM LIBERAL NONPROFIT

CAP has pushed a variety of other left-wing efforts, which include censoring speech it believes to be ""misinformation,"" taxpayer-funded student loan bailouts, taxpayer-funded reparations, DEI mandates, federal taxpayer funds for abortion by eliminating the Hyde Amendment, and phasing out gas-powered cars.

""With skyrocketing profits and expanding domestic manufacturing, U.S. automakers have everything they need to help the country switch from fossil fuel-powered vehicles to electric,"" CAP said in a 2024 post, despite multiple reports highlighting how consumers have complained about the cost and lack of charging stations.

CAP's influence on Biden also spread to his messaging on the campaign trail before he dropped out of the race. In 2022, the Washington Post reported that Biden's move to label Trump as ""ultra MAGA"" was the result of a six-month research project from the CAP Action Fund that was headed by his top aide Anita Dunn, who has performed consulting work for CAP.

CAP Action Fund's president, Navin Nayak, has visited the Biden White House at least a couple dozen times, a Fox News Digital review of White House visitor logs found.

Biden's former chief of staff Ron Klain, who was on the CAP Action Fund board for several years, has also repeatedly praised their efforts on his X account.

CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS SUPPORT COMES FROM ALL CORNERS, INCLUDING YOURS

VP Harris has worked with the Center for American Progress dating back to her time as California attorney general, when she joined the group for a press conference via telephone. She has also participated in several events hosted by the liberal think tank and her sister, Maya Harris, joined as a senior fellow, according to a 2013 press release.

Tanden said, ""Maya has worked tirelessly in many different arenas to ensure that the United States is a more inclusive country and that all Americans can live up to their potential"" and looked forward to her involvement with CAP.

Despite its extensive connections to the Biden White House, CAP blasts Project 2025 on its website as a ""far-right assault on America"" that it claims will ""serve as a road map"" for a ""far-right presidential administration.""

A CAP spokesperson dismissed the Heritage Foundation as ""no longer a think tank"" in a statement to Fox News Digital on Sunday.

""When it comes to the Heritage Foundation and their work, one needs to look no further than yesterday's New York Times story exposing Heritage creating fake digital content and pushing lies about election integrity,"" the spokesperson said. ""Couple that with Heritage's embrace of authoritarianism and their president threatening to launch a potentially violent 'second American Revolution' if it doesn't get its way, and I think it's safe to say that Heritage is on an island of its own. This is no longer a think tank.""

As a presidential candidate, Harris has repeatedly criticized Trump over Project 2025 as recently as last week when she ran an ad linking Trump to the project.

While Project 2025 is staffed with several high-level individuals who have previously worked with Trump, he has strongly denied having any direct role with the group.

A Project 2025 spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Sunday that ""Project 2025 does not speak for Donald Trump or his campaign"" and is ""continuing our decades-long legacy of preparing policy and personnel recommendations for the next conservative President.""

""The Heritage Foundation has been producing its Mandate for Leadership since 1980, and President Reagan handed out copies of the book to his cabinet at their first meeting,"" the spokesperson continued. ""The Left always prepares recommendations for liberal presidents, and they are simply upset that two can play this game.""

""The only reason that the Left is in a tailspin over Project 2025 is that it has winning ideas that the American people support, while their own recommendations, which are currently destroying our country, are wildly unpopular,"" the spokesperson added.

Trump campaign spokesperson Danielle Alvarez told Fox News Digital earlier this year that ""Agenda 47 and President Trump's RNC Platform are the only policies endorsed by President Trump for a second term.""

""Team Biden and the DNC are LYING and fear-mongering because they have NOTHING else to offer the American people,"" she added. ""Remember this is the same group that lied to Americans and hid Joe Biden's cognitive decline all these years.""

What We Know About Kamala Harris' Policy Agenda Before Tomorrow's Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/09/09/what-we-know-about-kamala-harris-policy-agenda-before-tomorrows-debate/,2024-09-09T14:28:37Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris updated her campaign website Sunday night to elaborate on her policy views ahead of Tuesday's debate against former President Donald Trump, giving a more fleshed-out picture of her views on issues like gun violence, immigration and abortion, though she still has not given many concrete policy proposals outside of economic issues.

Harris has broadly said she wants to support the middle class as president, proposing what she has dubbed an ""opportunity economy."" Tax-wise, that includes expanding the child tax credit -- including $6,000 for newborns in their first year and $3,600 per child in middle and lower-income families -- along with restoring the Earned Income Tax Credit for citizens who earn less than $63,398 and a pledge not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400,000 per year. The vice president also wants to go after price gouging for grocery store prices -- a proposal that economists have had mixed feelings about -- and target housing affordability. She has proposed giving $25,000 in assistance to first-time homebuyers and establishing tax credits for developers to build starter homes and affordable rental units, with a plan for a $40 billion ""innovation fund"" to address the housing crisis. Her administration would also boost small businesses by expanding a startup tax deduction from $5,000 to $50,000. After the Biden administration imposed a $35 monthly insulin cap for seniors, Harris has also called for expanding that to all Americans, along with a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket prescription costs. She said she will also work with states to abolish medical debt and expand Affordable Care Act subsidies. Harris said at the Democratic National Convention her administration would ""protect Social Security and Medicare,"" and her website notes it will ""strengthen"" those programs by raising taxes on high-income earners.

In addition to economic policies dedicated to boosting the middle class, Harris is also targeting higher taxes for the richest Americans, saying on her website the wealthy and large corporations will ""pay their fair share."" The campaign website outlines proposals to accomplish that including rolling back Trump-era tax cuts on the wealthy and implementing a ""billionaire minimum tax"" that imposes a 25% tax rate and taxes unrealized gains. She also proposes ""quadrupling"" the tax on stock buybacks and imposing a 28% long-term capital gains tax for people earning $1 million or more annually. That proposal is actually lower than the 39.6% rate that Biden has previously proposed, however, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has called for the vice president to ""go higher.""

Harris told CNN she does not support a ban on fracking, reversing an earlier position she held prior to 2020. The vice president did back climate change initiatives, telling CNN the ""climate crisis is real"" and ""it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time."" That being said, Harris explained she has learned that ""we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking."" The vice president's website otherwise points to the Biden administration's work on climate change and states Harris' platform ""advances environmental justice, protects public lands and public health, increases resilience to climate disasters, lowers household energy costs, creates millions of new jobs, and continues to hold polluters accountable to secure clean air and water for all"" -- but does not provide any concrete proposals.

While critics on the right have tried to paint Harris as Biden's ""border czar"" -- a position she never actually held -- Harris has faced pressure to outline her views on immigration. She told CNN she still wants to pass the bipartisan border bill that she blames former President Donald Trump for helping to kill earlier this year. Harris walked back earlier statements she made during the 2020 primary suggesting she wanted to decriminalize border crossings, telling CNN, ""We have laws that have to be followed and enforced that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally. And there should be consequences."" On its website, the Harris campaign said the vice president ""knows that our immigration system is broken,"" calling for ""comprehensive reform"" including bolstering border security measures and an ""earned pathway to citizenship.""

Harris told CNN she is ""unequivocal"" and ""unwavering in my commitment to Israel's defense and its ability to defend itself. And that's not going to change."" She pushed for a ceasefire deal with a two-state solution, saying any resolution must also ensure ""the Palestinians have security and self-determination and dignity,"" and her website suggests she would not make any changes to the Biden administration's approach to addressing the conflict. Harris also made comments in support of Ukraine during her convention speech and on her website, though she did not give specifics about any policies or level of aid she would support. The vice president has touted her work in helping Ukraine under Biden and said, ""As president, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies.""

Harris has made her support for reproductive rights a key part of her candidacy after advocating on the issue as vice president, and has heavily opposed attacks on the procedure by Trump and Project 2025 -- a right-wing agenda not formally affiliated with his campaign. She said at the convention and on her website she will sign a bill legalizing abortion into law if elected, which most abortion rights activists have interpreted as her calling for a return to the standard set under Roe v. Wade, in which abortion is allowed nationwide until the fetus is viable. Harris will ""never"" sign an abortion ban into law, her website states.

Harris called at the convention for passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. The John Lewis Voting Rights Act builds on the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and addresses parts of that bill that have been struck down by the Supreme Court, strengthening voting rights protections and restoring a requirement for states to get approval from the Justice Department to enact voting rules. The Freedom to Vote Act would impose sweeping measures like universal early voting, no-excuse voting by mail and automatic voter registration, along with adding protections against gerrymandering and reforming campaign finance laws to strengthen transparency and tighten rules around super PACs. Beyond voting, Harris' website also points to her longtime support for LGBTQ rights and said she will fight to pass the Equality Act that would codify anti-discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity into law.

Harris' website emphasizes she will work so that ""Americans have the freedom to live safe from gun violence,"" specifically backing proposals including bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, universal background checks and red flag laws. She also backs funding for law enforcement and said she would strengthen ""proven gun violence prevention programs."" Her calls to invest in law enforcement come after the Trump campaign has attacked Harris by claiming she wanted to ""defund the police,"" pointing to statements she made during the 2020 racial justice movement expressing some support for that movement -- though she never explicitly said she wanted to defund law enforcement.

In light of a series of controversial rulings by the conservative-leaning Supreme Court, Harris followed Biden in backing a series of reforms to the court, with her website singling out term limits and a binding code of ethics like lower federal judges have to follow. The candidate also expressed support for a federal measure that would undo the Supreme Court's ruling giving Trump and other ex-presidents some immunity from criminal charges, but her website did not specify whether Harris backs negating that ruling through a new constitutional amendment, as Biden supports, or via legislation.

Harris -- whose running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, is a veteran of the Army National Guard -- said on her campaign website that she will take increased steps to support veterans and their families. The website singles out steps like trying to end homelessness among veterans by investing in mental health and suicide prevention programs and eliminating barriers to employment for veterans. The Harris campaign said she will also ""[expand] economic opportunities"" for active duty military families and veterans, but did not specify any concrete proposals.

While her website does now mention a range of issues, she has not released the kind of detailed policy proposals on other issues that she did with the economy, and her website only briefly mentions any more concrete plans on each topic. The Democratic Party has released a platform that includes more detailed proposals, but it was drafted while Biden was still the nominee, so it's unclear if Harris would change those policies were she in office. The vice president has been willing to go beyond Biden's proposals with some issues she's released proposals on so far, such as supporting law enforcement's ability to go after companies for price gouging and raising the amount of assistance first-time home buyers should receive from $10,000 to $25,000.

Whether any of Harris' proposals will change before November. The New York Times reported in August that some of the vice president's big-money donors have asked her to tone down her proposal on taxing the ultra-rich, after she said she supported policies that would tax wealthy Americans on their ""unrealized gains"" -- meaning money that investors have made through assets like stocks, but haven't yet sold for a profit. Donors have reportedly brought their concerns up to Harris' campaign advisors and the candidate herself, and have claimed they do see some room for flexibility in her specific proposals. ""In my interactions with [the campaign], the key is she focuses on her values and is not an ideologue about any particular program,"" billionaire Mark Cuban told the Times. Harris defended changes in her specific policy views over the years to CNN, saying that while specifics of policies she supports may evolve, ""the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed.""

Trump and his campaign have slammed Harris' policies as being too far-left and ""radical."" ""If Kamala's goal was to confirm she's a Radical Left lunatic -- mission accomplished,"" the Trump campaign said in an email to press after Harris' CNN interview aired.

Harris took over as the Democratic nominee in July after Biden suddenly dropped out of the race, with the president endorsing Harris minutes after he announced he was stepping down and Democratic leaders quickly coalescing around the vice president. She had no challengers for the nomination. Harris' policy platform has become a key question her campaign has faced in the weeks since she became the nominee, and while the candidate released her economic agenda and highlighted it in an August 16 speech, those remarks are still the only substantive speech on her policy proposals she has given thus far. The vice president and running mate Gov. Tim Walz sat down with CNN in August following weeks of pressure for Harris to speak with the press, with the Trump campaign claiming the Democrat was ""ducking the media"" by refusing to do a one-on-one interview. Harris had previously only answered shouted questions from reporters and spoke with social media influencers at the convention. Her website had also not had an ""issues"" section previously, further inflaming criticism of not being upfront about her policies."
"Harris finally adds policy page to campaign website, devotes several sections to Trump",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-finally-adds-policy-page-campaign-website-devotes-several-sections-trump,2024-09-09T12:58:30Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Vice President Harris finally added policies to her campaign website for the first time since President Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her in the presidential race 50 days ago.

The website breaks Harris and her vice-presidential running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz' policy proposals into four sections: ""Build an Opportunity Economy and Lower Costs for Families,"" ""Safeguard Our Fundamental Freedoms,"" ""Ensure Safety and Justice For All,"" and ""Keep America Safe, Secure, and Prosperous.""

Before the new addition, Harris' campaign website had pages to buy merchandise, donate and get to know the candidate's background, but was devoid of any policy plans for weeks even after she formally accepted the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago 17 days ago.

Harris's website now includes a promise to cut taxes for middle class families by ""ensuring no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay more in taxes."" The website promises that Harris and Walz ""will ensure the wealthiest Americans and the largest corporations pay their fair share, so we can take action to build up the middle class while reducing the deficit,"" including by ""rolling back Trump's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, enacting a billionaire minimum tax, quadrupling the tax on stock buybacks, and other reforms to ensure the very wealthy are playing by the same rules as the middle class.""

HARRIS TEAM MOVES TO SOFTEN POTENTIAL DEBATE IMPACT 'BEFORE IT EVEN HAPPENS' AND MORE TOP HEADLINES

The website touts a plan to give more than 100 million working and middle-class families a tax cut by restoring the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit. It says Harris and Walz will also expand the Child Tax Credit to provide a $6,000 credit to families with newborn children.

""Under her plan, the tax rate on long-term capital gains for those earning a million dollars a year or more will be 28 percent, because when the government encourages investment, it leads to broad-based economic growth and creates jobs, which makes our economy stronger,"" the website says.

The website also claims that Harris' ""lowering costs agenda is a stark contrast to Donald Trump's plans to jack up prices, weaken the middle class, cut Social Security and Medicare, eliminate the Department of Education and preschool programs like Head Start, and end the Affordable Care Act.""

Much of the Harris website's policy section focuses on attacking her opponent. Under each policy section, Harris includes a subsection on what she calls ""Trump's Project 2025 Agenda.""

Former President Trump and his campaign have repeatedly said they are not affiliated with Project 2025, which was created by the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation as policy recommendations for the next Republican administration. Harris' website also claims Trump would ban abortion and restrict in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment, despite the Republican nominee stating the opposite. Trump has said he would not enact a federal abortion ban and recently said he would consider making sure the government or insurance companies cover the fertility treatment.

Regarding the economy, Harris claims that Trump's ""plans would increase costs for families by at least $3,900 a year by slapping a Trump sales tax on imported everyday goods that American families rely on, like gas, food, clothing, and medicine"" and would raise rents and add $1,200 a year to the typical American mortgage.

HERITAGE RIPS HARRIS' 'DANGEROUSLY LIBERAL' POLICY RECORD WITH NEW WEBSITE, 6-FIGURE OUTREACH TO INDEPENDENTS

""Trump's economic plans would also trigger a recession by mid-2025, cost America over 3 million jobs, threaten hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs, increase the debt by over $5 trillion, send inflation skyrocketing, and hurt everyone but the richest Americans,"" according to Harris' website.

Under what is intended to be policy proposals to ""ensure safety and justice for all,"" Harris' website slams Trump as ""a convicted criminal who only cares about himself,"" claiming the Republican nominee has ""proven that time and time again - from caving to the gun lobby and doing nothing to address gun violence to killing the bipartisan border security deal that would secure our border and keep America safe, just to help himself politically."" It also says Trump will implement the Project 2025 agenda if elected ""to consolidate power, bring the Department of Justice and the FBI under his direct control so he can give himself unchecked legal power and go after his opponents, and rule as a dictator on 'day one.'""

Fox News Digital reached out to the Trump campaign for comment, but they did not immediately respond.

Regarding foreign affairs, the website claims that Harris ""has been a tireless and effective diplomat on the world stage"" and ""will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to protect U.S. forces and interests from Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups."" Despite Harris boycotting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress in Washington, D.C., earlier this year, her website states Harris ""will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself and she will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself.""

""She and President Biden are working to end the war in Gaza, such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination,"" the website says. ""She and President Biden are working around the clock to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done."""

The Harris campaign has come under criticism from Republicans in recent weeks for offering few concrete policy proposals. Late last month the vice president sat down for an interview with CNN alongside running mate Tim Walz to discuss some of her policy ideas and shifting positions on some issues. In the interview, Harris discussed her plans to build a so-called ""opportunity economy"" and help the middle class. This included expanding the child tax credit, a proposed $25,000 assistance to first-time homebuyers, a cap on out-of-pocket spending on prescription medications and a tax increase for wealthy Americans and large corporations. Harris also noted that her views on fracking have changed and she doesn't support a ban on the fossil fuel extraction process anymore -- a shift from her stance during the 2020 Democratic primaries. Her campaign's policy page makes no mention of fracking, only stating she plans to build on her work on tackling the climate crisis and lowering household energy costs, among other things.

Freedom, an overarching theme for Harris throughout the Democratic National Convention, reappears in the vice president's policy platform including promises to ""restore...reproductive freedom"" and ""protect civil rights."" The campaign assails Trump on these issues, calling him a ""threat to our fundamental rights and freedoms,"" and adds: ""He brags that he is ""proudly"" responsible for handpicking Supreme Court Justices who overturned Roe, unleashing Trump Abortion Bans in states across the country, putting women's lives at risk and threatening doctors and other health providers with jail time.""

Last month, the Republican National Committee launched a website kamala2024policies.com to mock the vice president for not outlining a policy platform on her own campaign website. The RNC-funded website attacks the vice president by calling her ""Weak, Failed, and Dangerously Liberal,"" and her plans as ""radical."" The page accuses Harris of being weak on violent crimes, raising taxes for the middle class, opening the border and giving social security and Medicare to undocumented migrants.

Kamala Harris Addresses Economy In Major CNN Interview -- Here's What To Know About Her Policy Agenda (Forbes)

Democrats Repeatedly Attack Project 2025: 'When Somebody Draws Up A Playbook, They're Going To Use It' (Forbes)"
The political 'flip-flop' attack doesn't always pack a punch for voters,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/08/nx-s1-5105249/flip-flop-debate-harris-trump-bush-kerry,2024-09-09T11:02:51Z,"It's happened before: In 2004, two candidates prepped for the second presidential debate, moderated by ABC. Leading up to the political face-off, the Republican presidential campaign accused the Democratic candidate of flip-flopping on policy.

That race for the White House was between then-President George W. Bush and then-Sen. John Kerry.

During the October debate in St. Louis, Bush attacked Kerry for his shifting stance on the Iraq War. He argued Kerry shouldn't be president because the country needed a commander in chief who ""is steadfast and strong and determined."" The flip-flop attack stuck and became a key moment of the debate and the 2004 presidential election.

While much has changed in last 20 years, presidential campaigns continue to level this sort of attack against one another -- though it may not influence voters as much as the candidates hope.

In recent weeks, former-President Donald Trump and his campaign have seized on shifts in Vice President Harris' stances on fracking, health care and immigration. Trump called Harris the ""greatest flip-flopper"" at a rally in Michigan.

Meanwhile, the Harris campaign criticized Trump for his ""brazen flip-flops"" on marijuana legalization and abortion. Just last month, Trump indicated he would vote in favor of an abortion-access amendment in Florida, before later clarifying he'll vote no.

The talking points are likely to resurface during Tuesday night's debate.

Despite how frequently candidates use the jabs, voters don't seem to mind a politician who flip-flops, according to University of Maryland politics professor Sarah Croco, who has conducted multiple national surveys on voter reaction to policy flip-flops.

""When I do survey experiments, I find that there's really no political cost at all to someone who flips, so long as they flip to the position that the person taking the survey wants,"" Croco said of surveys taken in 2016 and 2019. ""Consistency doesn't really matter to them, so long as you get to the right position.""

In the studies Croco conducted, a politician who flip-flops correctly is believed to have ""seen the light."" The voter tends to give them some slack if they change their view -- but not always.

""If you flip away from a person, that's when all the critiques come out about like, 'Oh, this person is really wishy washy,' "" Croco said. "" 'This person has no principles; this person's a really dumb politician; they can't even keep their position straight.' ""

And during an increasingly polarized political environment, when voters align right and wrong with their political preference, the flip-flop jab becomes even less of a potent attack.

""Voters are generally so locked in to whichever candidate their party supports that I really don't think these flip-flopping critiques are going to have that much of an effect,"" Croco said.

Te professor admitted, though, that not all flip-flops are alike.

Both Trump and Harris have shifted their policy positions during the presidential campaign.

Harris no longer favors a ban on fracking, dropped her support for Medicare for All, and backed a bipartisan immigration bill that would build more walls on the southern border -- all departures from her 2020 presidential bid. Trump doesn't want to ban TikTok anymore, is open to legalizing marijuana, and has oscillated on abortion restrictions and bans -- while maintaining the issue is up to the states.

To Croco, only one flip-flop issue could pose a serious threat during this election cycle: abortion. It's a unique challenge to the Trump campaign in that while abortion access is widely shown to be the winning political position to flip to -- it could simultaneously ostracize voters who oppose abortion rights.

""I think the GOP realizes they need to kind of find a different position on this, but that's really hard for them to do without alienating the evangelical voters of the GOP,"" Croco said. ""So I think that's going to be difficult for them.""

When asked whether Harris' shifting stance on immigration or energy policy could pose a similar risk, Croco didn't think it would to the same degree.

""A lot of the times it's just that the [Harris] campaign has not issued a new position yet, or they might say she's silent on this issue now, whereas she had this opinion in 2020,"" Croco said. ""To me, those come across as weaker attacks, because they aren't on issues that have this clear, kind of binary choice.""

Harking back to the Bush versus Kerry 2004 debate, Croco said the support for or against the Iraq War was a stark, binary position during that election. It's flip-flops on issues like these that pose political risk -- and can define a debate.

""So yeah, I would not be surprised at all if this comes up at the debate,"" Croco said."

Vice President Harris will face off against former President Donald Trump Tuesday for the first time since becoming the Democratic nominee.

The playing field is different than it was two months ago when President Biden's dismal debate performance spurred a wave of concern over his ability to defeat Trump, the Republican nominee.

Since then, a lot has happened. Trump survived an assassination attempt, he accepted the GOP presidential nomination, Biden dropped out of the race and Harris then took over and clinched the Democratic party's nomination.

Harris has since made up the ground Biden lost in swing state polls and now stands virtually tied with Trump. Despite a groundswell of support and reportedly record-breakingfundraising amounts, her campaign's honeymoon phase is likely to end, especially as Trump and Republicans look to ramp up attacks.

Here's what you need to know about this second debate of the 2024 presidential election cycle.

The event will air at 9 p.m. ET for 90 minutes from the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. ABC News anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis are slated to moderate the debate, which will be broadcast by the network and streamed on ABC News Live, Disney+ and Hulu.

Follow NPR's live blog for the latest updates, analysis, fact-checking and color; listen to and watch NPR's special coverage of the ABC News Presidential Debate Simulcast on many public radio stations.

The debate rules echo those agreed on for the June matchup. That means microphones will once again be muted unless a candidate is speaking, something the Harris team asked to change for this debate.

It's a rule initially proposed by the Biden campaign ahead of the first debate and was largely seen as a potential shake-up to Trump's typical debate style. Instead, it ended up benefiting the former president, who has a history of interrupting in these settings to the point of his campaign's detriment. Instead, the technical change helped Trump appear more controlled.

Harris' campaign told ABC that Harris would be disadvantaged by the muted mics because it would shield Trump from direct exchanges -- but said that it would agree to the terms lest Trump drop out of the debate altogether.

A campaign official, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe private negotiations, said that a pool would be on hand to hear what the candidates are saying into muted microphones -- and that if there is ""significant crosstalk,"" the network may unmute both microphones. The moderator will warn candidates to stop frequent interruptions, the official said. ""Our understanding of these things helped inform our decision to accept muted mics,"" the official said.

There will be no audience and candidates will not be permitted to question each other directly. In addition, neither will be allowed to bring pre-written notes or props onto the debate stage.

Harris has mostly campaigned from the trail in her brief time as a presidential contender -- excluding a single sit-down interview with CNN at the end of August. She has also struggled in the past with unscripted moments as vice president, which will put the spotlight on her ability to perform in a debate while also laying out some of her platform and going on the offensive against Trump.

Harris has been putting an emphasis on protecting reproductive rights while campaigning, and she's likely to address it Tuesday night. Leading up to the debate, the Harris-Walz campaign launched its ""Fighting for Reproductive Freedom"" bus tour, pledging to make 50 stops in key states around the issues of abortion, IVF and reproductive rights.

Trump's stance on this issue has been muddy. He's made comments on abortion that appear to clash with some of his past views and statements while president. Recently, he acknowledged that Florida's six-week ban was too restrictive, then clarified shortly after that he would not support the state's upcoming ballot measure that, if passed, would safeguard access to abortions up until fetal viability.

Trump is likely to link Harris to Biden's handling of the economy and immigration, two areas where Republicans have heavily criticized the White House. He may also highlight aspects of her political record, including her past support for decriminalizing border crossings and banning fracking -- two policies she backed during her 2020 presidential bid and has since pivoted on.

On the other hand, Harris has repeatedly tied Trump's platform to Project 2025, a 900-page set of policy proposals for a potential second term put forward by a conservative think tank, The Heritage Foundation. Trump has tried to distance himself from the plan -- which includes further restrictions on abortion access among a slew of moves that would increase executive power.

Tuesday's matchup also poses new stakes for Trump: He's facing a very different opponent.

In the aftermath of the June debate, the former president's mistakes weren't a focus, largely because of Biden's more noticeably poor performance. That said, Trump by no means had a perfect night, repeatedly highlighting false and misleading information. So this time, as NPR's Domenico Montanaro pointed out, ""If Harris has a solid debate, the focus could be on Trump in a way he doesn't want.""

Vice presidential candidates Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Republican Sen. JD Vance will face off on Oct. 1 in a debate hosted by CBS News. The two hold similar roles in their respective campaigns: to appeal to voters in the ""Blue Wall"" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin this fall.

It's unclear whether Harris and Trump will debate a second time. No additional dates have been formally announced."
Democrats driving religious vote away from party as Trump courts Catholics: 'Anti-Christian' party,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-driving-religious-vote-away-from-party-trump-courts-catholics-anti-christian-party,2024-09-08T20:33:13Z,"Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the controversy surrounding Trans Day of Visibility on Easter Sunday and why he believes Biden is pandering to pro-Palestinian voters.

The Democratic Party is pushing away the religious vote with ""anti-Christian"" policies as former President Donald Trump works to court Catholics and other Christians, Catholic League President Bill Donohue said.

""They're anti-Christian, and it's driving people out,"" Donohue said in a phone interview of Democrats, citing similar comments from former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who recently endorsed Trump. ""And the guys I'm talking to, it's not even so much abortion. It's just they feel like they don't speak their language anymore. This whole idea of letting men compete against women in sports abuses the bathrooms, they think they've just gone off the deep end.""

Donohue spoke to Fox News Digital about the Trump campaign launching the ""Catholics for Trump"" coalition, which aims to build ""a nation where the rights of every individual to practice their faith freely is protected.""

""Kamala Harris hates Catholics and everything we hold sacred. We can't pretend otherwise. Our institutions, families, culture and belief in the sanctity of all human life are the antithesis of her vision for America. Donald Trump and JD Vance -- and now RFK -- are the antidote to the ruling class that has destroyed our country,"" Brian Burch, president of conservative non-profit, CatholicVote, said in the Trump campaign's press release.

TRUMP APPLAUDS CATHOLIC GROUP'S MULTI-MILLION ANTI-HARRIS CAMPAIGN APPEALING TO CHURCH FAITHFUL

Trump on Sunday even wished the Virgin Mary a happy birthday. The Catholic Church recognizes the birthday of Jesus' mother on Sept. 8, which falls nine months after the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception on Dec. 8 each year.

President Biden, who is Catholic, dropped out of the presidential race at the end of July. Donohue said that Biden exiting the race likely won't affect the Catholic vote overall, beyond perhaps benefiting Harris due to voters not being as familiar with her policies.

""I would suspect that in terms of Biden dropping out, it might help Harris a little bit, if only because she's less well known. But once people find out that her views are indistinguishable from that of Biden's, including born alive protection laws ... when the baby is born as a result of a botched abortion, the Democrats - for most of them, not all, most of them -say that the doctor has no obligation to rescue the child. You can just let the child die at the table. Most Americans are opposed to that,"" Donohue said.

PRIEST AT TRUMP RALLY WHO GAVE BENEDICTION WARNED OF 'PEOPLE WHO WANT TO SHOOT' FORMER PRESIDENT

Harris voted against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, legislation that would have penalized health care workers who fail to help care for babies born alive after a failed abortion, in 2020 when she served as a California senator. Harris is an ardent supporter of abortion access overall and made history alongside her future 2024 running mate when she visited a Minnesota Planned Parenthood earlier this year - in what was seen as the first time a sitting U.S. vice president has ever visited an abortion provider.

Trump secured the majority of the Catholic vote in his successful 2016 election cycle against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, at 52% to Clinton's 45%, Pew Research data show. In 2020, 52% of all Catholic voters cast their ballots for Biden, and 47% for Trump, according to Gallup.

Donohue noted that there's a vast difference between how practicing Catholics vote, versus baptized Catholics who no longer practice their faith, explaining that religious Catholics ""have almost nothing in common"" with secular Catholics, who more frequently vote for Democrats. He added that the same is often true for religious Jews versus cultural Jews, and evangelical protestants versus mainline protestants.

BIDEN 'DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE CATHOLIC FAITH,' BISHOP SAYS: 'I'M NOT ANGRY AT HIM, HE'S JUST STUPID'

In addition to the Catholics for Trump coalition, the campaign launched the ""Believers for Trump"" coalition, which works with various religious communities to end the Biden-Harris administration's ""anti-faith agenda for good,"" according to its website.

""The Democrat Party and the Harris-Biden Administration have waged war on Christianity with their support for abortion up until birth, the Department of Justice targeting and imprisoning pro-life activists, and the FBI plotting to infiltrate Catholic masses to spy on attendees,"" Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital.

""Kamala and Biden also shamefully declared the Holiest Day on the Christian Calendar as 'Trans Visibility Day' and allowed a transgender activist to take off their shirt and expose themselves on the White House South Lawn. President Trump will restore the Christian conservative values of faith, family, and freedom, end the Harris-Biden Administration's discrimination against Christians, and stand up for religious freedom, as he did in his first term.""

Donohue added that the Catholic vote historically supported Democrats until the 1960s.

""Everybody was a Democrat. All Catholics were Democrats. That didn't shift until really late '60s, early '70s, certainly by the time '72, when McGovern was running against Nixon. And people said, 'wait a minute.' But then Catholics felt homeless, because the Republicans never wanted the Catholics. The Republicans were always the party of abortion,"" he said.

George McGovern ran against President Nixon as a Democrat in the 1972 presidential election and was billed as the candidate who supported ""amnesty, abortion and acid,"" just a year ahead of the Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision.

Fast-forward to current times, the GOP has become the pro-life party. The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, with Trump praising the decision and now campaigning on a platform where abortion laws are left to the individual states.

TRUMP PROMISES 'CHRISTIAN VISIBILITY DAY'

""Since Dobbs, abortion has been more of a monkey on the back of Republicans. They've lost because some of the pro-life extremists in the Republican Party tried to go for all or nothing, but that's a fool's proposition. We always lose on that. You have to make exceptions, the proverbial exceptions everybody accepts. And you know, later into the term, there's less tolerance for abortion. So you have to play off of that. So Trump was advised, I think correctly, to get the abortion issue off your back, because it's a loser for Republicans. And just simply say, 'Listen, the goal was to get rid of Roe v. Wade so that it's up to the states to decide what they want to do,'"" Donohue said.

Trump did spark the condemnation of some pro-life conservatives for the GOP's more muted language on abortion this election cycle, and for saying last month that Florida's six-week abortion ban ""is too short."" He has since said that he will vote against a Florida amendment that would legalize abortion through the 9th month of pregnancy, and has doubled down that abortion laws and issues should be left up to the states to decide.

TRUMP ENDORSES TEN COMMANDMENTS IN LOUISIANA SCHOOLS: 'REVIVAL OF RELIGION'

Anti-Catholic attacks have meanwhile increased in recent years, most notably after the Dobbs decision, when radicals attacked Catholic churches, and when reports of an anti-Catholic FBI memo that targeted traditional Catholics as potential ""racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists"" made national headlines. The DOJ absolved the FBI of wrongdoing earlier this year in an Inspector General review that found the agency did not intentionally target traditional Catholics.

""A lot of Catholics do feel alienated,"" Donohue said, while commending Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan for his work investigating anti-Catholic bias in the federal government.

""Many of them have found a new anchor with the Republicans. And listen, the guys that I hang out with in my Irish Pub,"" Donohue said. ""Every one of these guys are union guys, and many of them are retired. They're all lifelong Democrats, and every single one of them are voting for Trump. Every single one of them are voting for Trump, because they say the Democrats have abandoned them."""
Trump campaign advisor tears into VP Harris: She can 'run' but she can't 'hide' from Biden's record,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-campaign-advisor-vp-harris-run-hide-bidens-record,2024-09-08T17:46:59Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris can run, but she can't hide from her ties to the Biden administration's record, Trump campaign adviser Corey Lewandowski said in a cryptic warning on Sunday.

Speaking to Fox News' Howard Kurtz, Lewandowki railed against Harris' apparent shift in policy positions, including on top issues like border security and fracking and even her more recent move to follow in Trump's footsteps to call for an end to taxing tips for service industry workers.

""She's never been a leader. She should not be promoted. She's continuously changed her position,"" he said.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

""She continuously takes over the Trump agenda on the positions that Donald Trump has, that he's articulated to the American people because she knows that the agenda that she and her boss, Joe Biden, and her running mate Tim Walz, have is so outside of the mainstream that she's unelectable because of it,"" he added.

Harris previously declared her intention to ban fracking, a position she has since rescinded. She also formerly criticized Trump's tough stance on border security but has since walked back that rhetoric and toughened her own stance.

VOTERS REPORT KAMALA HARRIS IS MORE RADICAL THAN TRUMP: 'TOO LIBERAL OR PROGRESSIVE'

On the note of moving toward the center, Kurtz pressed Lewandowski on a number of apparent shifts coming from Trump, including his language surrounding abortion and decriminalizing marijuana.

""Those are positions that most of the American people aren't voting on. They're voting on crime. They're voting on national security issues. And most importantly, the No. 1 issue we continue to see is the economy. It's always the case in the question you have to ask yourself: are you better off today than you were four years ago?"" he said.

2024 SHOWDOWN: ANTI-TRUMP REPUBLICAN LIZ CHENEY SAYS SHE'S BACKING KAMALA HARRIS

""That relates to the issue of pro-life,"" he continued. ""Donald Trump appointed three pro-life judges that are sitting on the Supreme Court that overturned Roe v. Wade, so it goes back to the states. The states now decide, through the elections, what those laws are going to look like. What happens in Kansas and Ohio may be very different than what happens in a state like New York or Arizona.""

Democrats continue to insist that the former president, if elected, would push for a national abortion ban despite the Trump campaign touting its role in returning the issue to the states for the people to decide.

The Democratic Party has also made abortion an integral issue in the 2024 race, stressing their support for restoring a national abortion right."

More voters report that Vice President Kamala Harris is ""too liberal or progressive"" on key policy issues than they considered former President Donald Trump as ""too conservative,"" according to a New York Times poll.

The New York Times/Sienna College poll published Sunday found Trump with a narrow lead over Harris, at 48% to Harris' 47%, signaling her political boost from the DNC after replacing President Biden on the ticket might be dwindling as the election comes down to its final stages.

Among the data compiled in the poll, it found that nearly the majority of voters reported Trump is ""not too far"" to the left or right on key issues, while only around one-third of voters said he's ""too conservative,"" the New York Times poll found.

On the other hand, nearly half of voters surveyed, at 44%, reported that Harris is ""too liberal and progressive,"" and 42% found that she's ""not too far either way.""

""Yes, he's outside of the political mainstream in many respects -- he denied the result of the 2020 election. And yes, he does have conservative views on many issues, like immigration. But he's also taken many positions that would have been likelier to be held by a Democrat than a Republican a decade ago, like opposition to cutting entitlements, support for a cooperative relationship with Russia or opposition to free trade. It's a reputation he's careful to protect, from saying he doesn't support Project 2025 to his cagey position on additional measures to restrict abortion,"" the Times reported.

The poll also found that 11% of voters believe Trump is ""not conservative enough,"" compared to 9% of voters who reported Harris is ""not liberal or progressive enough.""

The poll follows one released in late July, when Biden dropped out of the race amid mounting concern over his mental acuity, which also found Trump in a 48-47 lead.

DNC fly anti-Trump banners over college football games in key swing states as Harris slips in polls,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/dnc-fly-anti-trump-banners-over-college-football-games-key-swing-states-harris-collapses-polls,2024-09-07T19:31:51Z,"Urban Meyer and the ""Big Noon Kickoff"" crew debated whether there should be concern surrounding the struggling offense behind Davis Warren.

The Democratic National Committee flew four planes carrying banners with anti-Trump messaging over college football games in four major swing states in the upcoming election on Saturday, it announced.

The four stadiums set to see the banners are Michigan Stadium at the University of Michigan, Sanford Stadium at the University of Georgia, Beaver Stadium at Pennsylvania State University and Camp Randall Stadium at the University of Wisconsin.

Photographs on social media show the DNC made good on its promise in Pennsylvania.

The planes flying over Michigan and Penn State seek to tie Trump and running mate JD Vance to the far-right manifesto Project 2025, created by the Heritage Foundation. Trump has disavowed Project 2025 multiple times and says he has no intention of implementing its full policy list if he does win the election. However, figures who worked in Trump's first administration contributed to the project.

One of the banners also aims to exploit one of the most historic rivalries in college football. The plane set to fly over Michigan will fly a banner that reads, ""J.D. Vance [loves] Ohio State [plus] Project 2025."" Michigan and Ohio State are considered to boast the fiercest rivalry in the sport, and Vance spent much of his childhood in Ohio, went to Ohio State for undergrad and claims to be a life-long Ohio State Buckeyes fan.

Vance previously revealed that he had told Trump that his loyalty to the Buckeyes could impact the former president's chances in Michigan this November when Trump was selecting Vance as his running mate.

""When he first asked me to be a VP I was like, well, you know, hopefully we don't lose Michigan by like 900 votes, because you're going to regret it. 'Cause it's probably just a thousand p---d-off Wolverine fans who wouldn't vote for a Buckeye. But I think that most Michiganders are going to be able to put sports rivalries aside and put the country first, which is what, of course, all of us believe is the most important thing,"" Vance said during an appearance on OutKick's ""The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show.""

The Democrats' latest campaign gimmick comes just three days before the first presidential debate between Trump and Harris on ABC News, as Harris has fallen steeply in some polls over the last few weeks, especially in key battleground states.

STEPH CURRY SAYS ABORTION IS TOP ISSUE FOR SUPPORTING HARRIS DESPITE PAST NEUTRAL STANCEt

Nate Silver of 538's latest projection on Friday showed Trump gaining ground on Harris in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia.

Silver released his latest election forecast, writing on his Substack, ""The forecast is still in toss-up range, but Trump's chances of winning are his highest since July 30,"" Silver wrote. Silver's model shows Trump's chances of winning the Electoral College have increased from 52.4% to 58.2% since last Thursday. Harris' odds, meanwhile, have decreased from 47.3% to 41.6%.

The current odds on Polymarket show Trump with a 50% chance of winning in November, while Harris holds just a 48% chance.

A recent series of Fox News statewide surveys in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina showed Harris up by 1 percentage point in Arizona and by 2 points in Georgia and Nevada, while Trump is ahead by 1 point in North Carolina. All are within the margin of sampling error.

Trump is spending his Saturday making an in-person appearance for a rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin, about two hours away, where the Wisconsin Badgers will play South Dakota on Saturday.

Meanwhile, Harris made a visit to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which is about two hours away from Penn State's game against Bowling Green. Harris welcomed the endorsement of former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Rep. Liz Cheney while visiting a spice shop called Penzeys Spices.

If Trump's positive polling trends play out, and the DNC's aerial campaign strategy doesn't work out, Vance has proposed that he and Trump make a visit themselves to Ohio Stadium at Ohio State for the Buckeyes' upcoming game against Michigan on November 30.

""Well, let's go to the Ohio State-Michigan game, assuming we win, because I bet I can get some pretty sweet tickets as the VP-elect, and we'll be in a celebratory mood,"" Vance said on OutKick. ""And look, it's, it's going to be a big game this year. I think it's going to determine ultimate seeding in the College Football Playoff. I mean, how both teams might actually make the playoff. I know Michigan's, you know, sort of people aren't putting them as high this year, but you never know, because it's always a good program. So, we'll see, guys.

"5 ways Harris, Walz push Latinos to Trump and could hand him the White House",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/5-reasons-harris-walz-push-latinos-trump-could-give-him-win,2024-09-07T15:31:24Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The Democratic Party's misunderstanding of the Latino voter remains evident. For years, we have tried to convey that their extreme, progressive, hard-left policies do not resonate with our community. Despite this, they continue to push an agenda that drives Latinos further into the conservative camp.

Recent surveys reveal former President Trump capturing 40% of the Latino vote, while Kamala Harris struggles with just 55%. This represents a significant 10% drop from the support Joe Biden received in 2020. The Latino vote may determine the outcome of the 2024 election in battleground states like Nevada, Arizona, and Pennsylvania.

Here are five reasons why Democrats' complacent attitude toward Latino voters could cost them in November and possibly tip the election to Donald Trump.

The party has made this election about abortion without addressing the issue in a way that resonates with Latinos. How many Latino women truly support late-term abortion? The reality is that the vast majority of Latinos find the idea of late-term abortion morally unacceptable. Under President Barack Obama, the stance was that abortion should be ""legal, safe, and rare."" This approach acknowledged the complexity of the issue. The Democratic Party has now shifted dramatically to an ""abortion on demand"" policy, which includes late-term abortions up to the ninth month. This extreme position deeply unsettles many Latinos, particularly those of faith.

The Democratic Party shows Latino voters that, while they may seem affable and open to the Hispanic American experience within the confines of their party, their actions and policies tell a different story.

As a pastor, I firmly believe that life begins at conception. This conviction is deeply rooted in our community. However, the political reality requires a more nuanced approach, especially on an issue that divides so many. Presenting a balanced and nuanced view is more politically effective, even if it does not fully align with personal beliefs.

The Democrats had the opportunity to return to the rhetoric of President Obama, who understood the complexity of the issue while still upholding reproductive rights. Instead, they embraced an extreme, Planned Parenthood-created mantra that conflicts with the values of the Latino community. Many Latinos, who may support some form of reproductive rights, cannot accept the idea of unrestricted abortion up until birth.

The vice president's word remind us of the failed socialist and communist regimes in Latin America -- Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Daniel Ortega, Fidel Castro -- leaders whose policies led to economic collapse and widespread suffering. Latinos fled these countries, risking everything to pursue the American Dream. Hearing similar rhetoric from a candidate for the highest office in the land serves as a stark reminder of why we left our homelands and why we cannot allow America to follow that same destructive path.

Latinos place family above all else. In states like Washington, Oregon, and Massachusetts, laws have passed that could allow the state to take away a child from their parents if the parents do not agree with a new gender identity embraced by the child. When the state has this kind of power, it not only becomes morally reprehensible but also contradicts the values of our Constitution and our God-given rights as parents.

These policies have empowered cartels, flooded our streets with fentanyl, and brought violence into our communities. Venezuelan gang members have entered our nation, contributing to rising crime rates, with little to no pushback from the administration, all for political gain. Just look at the news last week that Venezuelan illegal migrants had taken over an apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado. Wielding military-grade weapons and defying American law and order, they exemplify how Democrats' open border policies endanger our communities.

Similarly, President Obama could have addressed immigration reform, but he prioritized health care during his time in office, sidelining immigration reform.

Once again, the Democratic Party shows Latino voters that, while they may seem affable and open to the Hispanic American experience within the confines of their party, their actions and policies tell a different story. With each election cycle, the Democratic Party is becoming increasingly anti-Latino.

President Trump will likely walk away with at least 40% of the Latino vote. However, do not be surprised if he garners 42% or even 44%, matching the record set by President George W. Bush in the 2004 election. Latinos are no longer a shoo-in for the Democratic Party because they do not understand us."
3 Ways Fights Can Bring People Closer -- According To A Psychologist,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/traversmark/2024/09/06/3-ways-fights-can-bring-people-closer-according-to-a-psychologist/,2024-09-07T01:25:20Z,"It is assumed that discussions about sensitive topics, such as politics or religion, with individuals who hold differing viewpoints will inevitably lead to conflict. Such pessimistic expectations can deter us from having diverse conversations, especially with people we are just getting to know or are trying to form a connection with.

Yet a recent study published in Psychological Science found that conversations between disagreeing parties can be surprisingly positive. Researchers Kristina A. Wald from The Wharton School, alongside Mike Kardas from Oklahoma State University and Nick Epley from the University of Chicago, highlight that engaging in discussions, even amid disagreements, can uncover shared values, foster stronger connections and help bridge divides -- challenging the common fear of conflict.

Here are three ways disagreements can lead to unexpectedly fruitful and affirming discussions:

While it may seem counterintuitive, respectful disagreement can actually enhance relationships by building trust and understanding. It allows individuals to express themselves honestly, which can lead to deeper connections and more effective communication. Disagreements can spark meaningful conversations by encouraging constructive dialogue and engagement with each other's ideas.

""People seem to fail to appreciate the social forces in conversations that create social connections. People, therefore, expect to disagree with others to be more hostile toward them than they actually are. This miscalibration leads to missed opportunities for social bonding and free expression,"" share the researchers.

People's avoidance of discussing disagreements is often based on incorrect assumptions about how these conversations will unfold. This avoidance prevents them from experiencing potentially positive and enriching interactions that could enhance social connections and understanding.

By avoiding conflict, we miss the chance for deeper discussions that reveal another person's ideals and beliefs. Disagreements offer an opportunity to understand someone more profoundly rather than superficially. Instead of seeing disagreement as a threat, embrace it as a gateway to meaningful connection.

Psychologically, when we disagree, we're often motivated to adjust our social responses -- being more thoughtful, careful and respectful in our communication. This process of adjustment helps create more constructive dialogue, where both parties feel heard and valued.

Constructive disagreement is when individuals with different viewpoints engage in discussions that challenge each other's ideas in a respectful and open-minded way.

""People seem to underestimate the degree of common ground they have with those who disagree with them. That is, people seem to fail to take into account the fact that they may still agree on some aspects of an issue even if they have different positions on the issue as a whole. Conversation, in turn, tends to reveal those areas of common ground, fostering a deeper understanding between individuals,"" they explain.

For instance, two people might hold opposing views on abortion -- one is pro-choice, while the other is pro-life. Through conversation, however, they may discover that they both deeply care about the well-being of women and the protection of life. Even though they disagree on how these values should be balanced, recognizing these shared concerns can lead to a more respectful and empathetic dialogue.

Constructive disagreements also frequently uncover uncertainties or incorrect assumptions that people may not have been aware of before. This can help individuals address gaps in their understanding and refine their approach, leading to a meaningful discussion.

Constructive disagreement further leads to the exploration of new ideas that might not have been considered otherwise -- fostering creativity and innovation.

When approached with an open mind, they have the potential to unlock valuable opportunities for creative problem-solving. Often, people avoid conversations involving disagreement due to preconceived notions of conflict or discomfort. However, engaging in these discussions can bring about fresh perspectives and uncover shared understanding, ultimately driving progress.

""Our findings suggest that people may be avoiding these conversations more often than they would if they had well-calibrated expectations of what the conversations would be like -- suggesting that people may be missing out on opportunities to have informative and socially connective interactions,"" explain the researchers.

This type of disagreement can be highly beneficial because it encourages people to think beyond their usual perspectives and consider alternative solutions. When disagreements are handled constructively, they can stimulate critical thinking, push boundaries and lead to the development of novel ideas.

This process can lead to breakthroughs that would not have emerged in a setting where everyone agrees or avoids conflict. In fields like science, business, or entrepreneurship, constructive disagreement is often a key driver of progress.

The next time you encounter a potentially divisive topic, instead of avoiding it, approach it with gentle curiosity. Explore the other person's perspective and where it stems from -- you might find yourself appreciating their viewpoint, even if you don't agree."
