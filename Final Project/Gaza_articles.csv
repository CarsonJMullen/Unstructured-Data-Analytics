The presidential race could come down to slim margins in just a handful of swing states, which means, as we all know, every vote counts in places like Michigan and Wisconsin. One lasting issue that could hurt Vice President Kamala Harris is the criticism from some within her own party over the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Minnesota Public Radio's Clay Masters reports.

CLAY MASTERS, BYLINE: On the final evening of the Democratic National Convention this summer in Chicago, Michigan Delegate Abbas Alawieh addresses a large scrum of reporters outside the United Center.

ABBAS ALAWIEH: This is a watershed moment where Americans all across the country, where Democrats all across the country are saying, free Palestine.

MASTERS: Alawieh helped launch the Uncommitted Movement in Michigan. It led to some Democratic voters across the country protesting President Biden's stance on Gaza by selecting uncommitted or uninstructed on their ballots. Thirty-six uncommitted delegates were allocated to the convention. That's less than 1% of the more than 3,800 who were pledged to President Biden and ultimately supported Harris. In Chicago, they staged a sit-in, demanding a Palestinian American address the convention. While unsuccessful in getting a speaker on stage, Alawieh did not sound defeated.

ALAWIEH: This is the Democratic Party. This is the coalition. We are building for the next four years for equal rights for all.

MASTERS: But now it's October, and many within the protest movement are still not pleased.

SAM DOTEN: I'll be voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. I don't feel good about it.

MASTERS: That's Sam Doten, an uncommitted delegate from Minnesota, the state that sent the most to the convention. Doten has been active in organizing for Democrats in the past, but says, this year, he's not volunteering for the Harris campaign.

DOTEN: I'm talking about hitting doors, you know, talking to all my friends, encouraging them to vote for this ticket, and they've made it impossible for me to put in that work and take that position.

MASTERS: Other delegates say they're still trying to make up their minds. Some say they're voting third party or even leaving the top of the ballot blank. Leaders of the National Uncommitted Movement (ph) are not endorsing Harris or former President Donald Trump or third-party options. Just this week, the group posted a video online where a co-founder said the situation could get much worse under Trump. The voters who protested in the primary election are now left to decide on their own. Taher Herzallah is a Minnesotan Ph.D. student with family in Gaza. He says he's not voting for the Democratic ticket.

TAHER HERZALLAH: On November 6, we'll be able to say we told you so in the event that, you know, Donald Trump or somebody else wins the presidency.

MASTERS: Herzalalah says he can't forgive top Democrats for the Biden administration's policies in the region. Some Democrats offer a warning for not backing their presidential candidate.

ANDY LEVIN: Donald Trump was a disaster for human rights all around the world, and he would be an even worse disaster for the Palestinian people.

MASTERS: That's former Michigan Congressman Andy Levin. He notes it was Trump who pushed to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a long-standing goal of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Levin made the comments during a virtual summit of Emgage last week, one of the nation's largest Muslim American voter mobilization groups, which endorsed Harris and Walz. Governor Walz also joined the summit.

TIM WALZ: We all know on here this war must end, and it must end now. The vice president's working every day to ensure that.

MASTERS: But that message isn't changing how some of these dissatisfied voters are feeling going into Election Day. Matt Grossmann, a political scientist at Michigan State University, says the Uncommitted Movement has been successful at raising attention about how Democrats talk about and mobilize around the Middle East.

MATT GROSSMANN: That just doesn't necessarily translate into actual changes in U.S. foreign policy, especially when there's a long-standing alliance that they're trying to disrupt and a lot of people mobilizing on the other side as well.

MASTERS: Now, those Democratic voters who hope they could change their candidates foreign policy position have to commit to how they think their vote can best help reach that goal.

"The war is in Gaza, but Palestinians in the West Bank are targeted with violence too",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/12/g-s1-27704/west-bank-palestinians-violence-israel-settlers,2024-10-12T12:03:57Z,"Suliman Mleihat, 32, and his nine-year-old son Obeida stand in front of Obeida's classroom, where he sheltered from settlers who attacked the school in the Mu'arrajat Bedouin community in mid-September. Maya Levin for NPR hide caption

This story is a part of an NPR series reflecting on Oct. 7, a year of war and how it has changed life across Israel, the Gaza Strip, the region and the world.

AL-MU'ARRAJAT, West Bank -- In a sun-filled classroom for elementary-aged students, decorations and posters showing the Arabic alphabet have been ripped from the walls, chairs toppled, papers and documents from a filing cabinet crumpled and strewn across the floor. The door to the classroom is tied with rope; its handle lies nearby, bashed and warped after the door was kicked in a day earlier.

A group of extremist Israeli settlers stormed the small primary school last month while it was in session.

In a video filmed that September day by an Israeli human rights activist, the settlers are seen wielding wooden bats and charging through the schoolyard. They beat a young teacher, attack the activist who's filming and try to break into locked classrooms where students were sheltering.

""The teacher told us all to come and hold the door shut so they can't break in,"" remembers nine-year-old Obeida Mleihat. He peeks into the classroom he was sheltering in, and points to a fan in the corner.

""I was standing over there,"" he says. ""I was scared.""

In the year since the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel last Oct. 7 - which Israel says killed around 1,200 people and sparked the current war in Gaza, which has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians - violence by Israeli settlers and the Israeli military has also erupted against Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

Near-nightly military raids take place in many cities. Israel says these are part of counterterrorism efforts against Hamas and other militant groups that have stepped up attacks against Israelis. The military raids have become longer, more frequent, more deadly and more destructive than in the past. According to the United Nations, at least 698 Palestinians have been killed since Oct. 7, 2023. Outside urban areas, settlers have increased threatening attacks on rural Palestinian communities, aiming to push them from their land.

Obeida's dad, Suliman Mleihat, is the head of this rural Palestinian Bedouin community, tucked into the rolling hills of the Jordan Valley. He rushed to the school when he heard the attack was happening -- both his young children were there. He says the Israeli military showed up and blocked him and other parents from entering, but also didn't stop the settlers. (The Israeli military did not directly comment on this incident in response to an NPR request.)

""My children are my soul, so it was incredibly difficult to not be able to get to them, to not know if they were okay,"" Mleihat says. When he did finally get to them, he hugged them both very tightly.

Mleihat says he recognized this group of settlers. They'd attacked the community before - poisoning sheep and hurting people.

""But coming to the school, and threatening children, this is new,"" he says. ""This crossed a major line.""

Mleihat says that the settlers are trying to get them all to leave, to evict the Bedouin community. And he says it's a real possibility, if attacks like this continue. But where would they go?

Allegra Pacheco is an American attorney who heads the West Bank Protection Consortium, a group of international nonprofits focused on protecting Palestinians in the West Bank from forced displacement and attacks.

""Settler violence isn't just about a group of young guys on a hilltop anymore,"" she says, invoking a common stereotype.

Pacheco has been working in the West Bank for decades. She says before last Oct. 7, most Israelis living in settlements in the West Bank -- all of which are illegal under international law, though not necessarily under Israeli law -- were relatively unconcerned with nearby Palestinians as long as they didn't interfere with settler life.

""Now we're seeing much more rhetoric that 'Palestinians are the enemies,' that they're legitimate targets,"" says Pacheco. ""And that, of course, transfers into the violence that we're seeing.""

Attacks by settlers on Palestinians in the West Bank skyrocketed after last Oct. 7. The United Nations has documented nearly 1,400 attacks - not including harassment or threats - in the past year. The years 2023 and 2024 so far have had the highest number of incidents since the organization began collecting data nearly 20 years ago.

The attacks are often orchestrated to intimidate Palestinians into leaving their land - Pacheco says about 17 communities have been forcefully displaced this way in the past year alone.

""Once the Palestinians are chased out of these areas, the settlements move in and make it much harder to give back the land to the Palestinians,"" says Pacheco.

That is the goal.

The Yesha Council, the Israeli umbrella organization for all the settlements in the West Bank, has it listed on its website in English: ""To prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea."" And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government - with ultranationalist lawmakers in major positions of power overseeing the West Bank - encourages the expansion of illegal settlements, and instructs the Israeli police and military to protect them.

Israeli settlements in the West Bank have become so disruptive that the International Court of Justice ruled this year that Israel's occupation of the West Bank is illegal - calling on Israel to cease its presence in the occupied territories, including dismantling Israel settlements there and paying reparations to Palestinians for damages caused from the occupation.

Meanwhile, world leaders, including President Biden in his 2024 State of the Union address, are still pushing for a two-state solution.

In late August, the Israeli military launched one of its most extensive and deadliest raids in the West Bank in years, centered on the Jenin urban refugee camp, home to about 24,000 residents. The raid lasted 10 days and killed 39 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials. Three Israeli police officers were also killed, according to the Israeli military.

The Israeli military left much of Jenin in ruins. Jenin Mayor Nidal Abu Saleh says at least 70% of the city was destroyed in the raid.

Driving through Jenin weeks later, the damage is still clearly visible. The streets have been ripped up and there are giant potholes from explosions. Much of the infrastructure is damaged, too - water and sewage flow through the streets and power lines are ripped down.

The Israeli military says operations like this are necessary for counterterrorism. Jenin and other cities in the West Bank have long been militant strongholds, which have grown more active since last Oct. 7.

As schoolchildren carrying backpacks try to navigate the piles of rubble and debris in the streets, community leader Farha Abu Hejah observes that the violence has been especially difficult for them.

""The children have a hard time getting to school because of the rocks and the holes in the road,"" she says. ""And the raids are terrifying. The children are in panic. Families are in total panic. It really impacts everyone's psychological state.""

Abu Hejah grew up in Jenin, and has lived there all her life. She says the Israeli military has been targeting the refugee camp for many years, but never like this. Now, ""It's a complete destruction of life and infrastructure. It looks like Gaza,"" she says. ""Jenin is Gaza, but in the West Bank.""

Khalil Shikaki, a political scientist and pollster in Ramallah, says his recent polls have show that Palestinians in the West Bank are feeling increasingly unsafe, unprotected by their own leaders and at the mercy of Israeli troops and even airstrikes - which were rare in the West Bank for the past two decades but have become regular in the past year.

""These last few months have essentially brought in tremendous fears that the destruction in Gaza is going to happen in the West Bank as well,"" Shikaki says. ""There is a significant rise in the perception of West Bankers that Gaza is coming to them.""

Near the center of the Jenin refugee camp, through a small courtyard off a ripped-up street, is the Abu Ali family home -- where 26 family members, including eight children, once lived spread over three floors.

Now, the main floor apartment is charred and covered in debris. A melted and warped ceiling fan hangs overhead in the living room, a crumpled refrigerator sits in what was once a kitchen. The back wall is blasted with a giant gaping hole.

The family matriarch, Raeda Abu Ali, says Israeli soldiers arrived in the night and ordered everyone out of the house. They carried a gas canister into the back room.

""They told us to count to three, and you'll hear your home explode,"" she remembers. ""That was a terrible moment, when I listened to my house blow up.""

A burned metal gas container still sits in the middle of the floor.

Abu Ali says the soldiers gave no reason for why they blew up the house. No one in her family is affiliated with any militant groups, she says.

The Israeli military told NPR that it was not aware of this specific incident, but added that ""during the operation in Jenin, laboratories in a civilian area that were used by terrorists to prepare explosives were dismantled.""

She says they hope to rebuild, although she worries their home could be destroyed again. When asked if she can file a complaint, Abu Ali almost laughs.

""Who will listen to us? There's no side that I can address this complaint to,"" she says. ""Look at Gaza. Look at the destruction. Who's listening to them? Why would someone listen to us?""

As she speaks, her sister-in-law Samira Abu Ali begins weeding the front garden. Raeda's three-year-old grandson plays nearby.

Samira says the plants were blown across the courtyard in the explosion, but she picked them up and replanted them.

She points to a small red flower on one of them, and smiles. Even after all that, she says, it bloomed."
What is the U.N. peacekeeping force stationed in Lebanon?,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/11/nx-s1-5150044/un-peacekeepers-lebanon-israel-united-nations,2024-10-11T22:24:15Z,"Peacekeepers from the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) man an observation point along what's called the Blue Line on the border between Lebanon and Israel, near the southern Lebanese town of Marwahin, on Oct. 12, 2023.

As Israel pushes into southern Lebanon with the aim of eliminating Hezbollah fighters and destroying the group's bases, its forces are increasingly coming into contact with members of a United Nations force that has been in place there for decades with a mandate to maintain peace and security along the volatile border.

On Thursday, two peacekeepers from the currently 10,000-strong United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL, were injured when an Israeli tank shell hit an observation tower near the ""Blue Line"" dividing Lebanon from Israel and the Golan Heights. The incident followed an Israeli warning for UNIFIL to relocate from areas Israel said were near Hezbollah positions used to launch rockets into northern Israel. UNIFIL refused to evacuate.

UNIFIL, in a statement on Thursday, said that its headquarters in Lebanon in the town of Naqoura and nearby peacekeeper positions ""have been repeatedly hit"" by Israeli tank fire. It said two peacekeepers were injured. And Friday, it said more explosions hit close to an observation tower, wounding two more personnel, but it didn't blame Israel.

The conflict in Lebanon follows more than a year of fighting between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas -- which, like Hezbollah, is backed by Iran -- in the Gaza Strip. Hamas launched a surprise attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking at least 240 hostages, according to Israeli authorities. As Israel launched its military response in Gaza, Hezbollah militants began firing rockets at Israel in support of Hamas and the Palestinians. In recent weeks, the Israeli military has carried out an air and ground offensive in neighboring Lebanon, an escalation that has drawn alarm from the U.N.

Here are a few facts about UNIFIL and its mission:

UNIFIL is made up of about 10,000 peacekeeping troops and other personnel from around 50 countries, mostly drawn from Indonesia, India, Ghana, Nepal, Italy, Malaysia, Spain, France, China and Ireland. The U.N. peacekeeping website does not list the United States among them.

UNIFIL was created by the U.N. Security Council in 1978 after Israel invaded neighboring Lebanon, following a deadly raid by Palestinian militants based in Lebanon across the border into Israel. Despite the name's indication that it would be temporary, UNIFIL has become one the longest-serving peacekeeping missions in the world, as NPR's Jane Arraf reported. The Security Council called for Israel's withdrawal and to help establish ""territorial integrity, sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon within its internationally recognized boundaries.""

Israel again invaded Lebanon in 1982, kicking off a prolonged occupation until 2000.

Then in 2006, after a monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim militant group whose political wing is a major force in Lebanon, UNIFIL was enlarged and its mandate expanded. The force was tasked with helping Lebanon's armed forces maintain a buffer between Israel and the so-called Blue Line at the Litani River, about 18 miles from the Israel-Lebanon border.

UNIFIL's specific mandate in southern Lebanon was to confirm the withdrawal of Israeli forces, restore peace and security in the border region and assist the Lebanese government in reestablishing control in the southern part of the country.

In the years since, however, the mission has gone beyond that mandate, according to David Schenker, a senior fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ""They are a primary economic driver in south Lebanon, purchasing supplies, helping the local economy, providing computers for classrooms, for Hezbollah's constituents in south Lebanon, building soccer fields, things that aren't actually included in their mandate, but things they do nonetheless,"" he says.

UNIFIL's rules of engagement allow the use of force only if necessary for self-defense or to carry out its duties.

No. Although exact figures are hard to come by, a number of UNIFIL peacekeepers have been killed in the line of duty. For example, last year, five men linked to Hezbollah were charged by a Lebanese military tribunal in the killing of an Irish U.N. peacekeeper. Another Irish peacekeeper was seriously wounded in the incident.

Normally, UNIFIL plays a role in monitoring and reporting cease-fire violations, providing humanitarian assistance and helping to rebuild infrastructure in southern Lebanon that has been destroyed by decades of fighting. In the absence of direct diplomatic relations between Israel and Lebanon, the peacekeepers have also acted as a liaison of sorts between the two countries. Schenker says before the 2023 Hamas attack in Israel, UNIFIL would sit down about once a month with representatives of the Israeli and Lebanese militaries ""to talk about issues of tension, trying to de-escalate, putting mechanisms in place to mediate between the two nominal authorities on the border."" The U.N. force does not communicate directly with Hezbollah, which is designated a terrorist organization by the United States and several other countries.

But UNIFIL has also been criticized for not doing a better job of monitoring and reporting of Hezbollah violations, allowing the group to remilitarize southern Lebanon, says Schenker, a U.S. diplomat who served in the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Donald Trump. The Lebanese government, which includes members of Hezbollah's political wing, has also circumscribed where peacekeepers can operate, drawing a line around sensitive areas that ""basically amount to Hezbollah operational bases in the south,"" he says.

Jeffrey Feltman, the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon during the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, says he doesn't blame UNIFIL for its limited mandate, but does fault the mission for ""its mealymouthed reporting on what Hezbollah was up to.""

That's allowed Hezbollah to reoccupy areas of southern Lebanon that are supposed to be off-limits. As a result many Israelis are skeptical of UNIFIL, according to Paul Salem, vice president for international engagement for the Middle East Institute. Even so, he says ""Israel was well aware that Hezbollah had built up capacities in the zone that it wasn't supposed to.""

And for a long time, the border remained relatively calm -- until after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack in Israel, that is. ""Israel coexisted with that situation and they figured that calm would be maintained long term, both with Hamas [in Gaza] and Hezbollah,"" Salem says.

Last year's Hamas attack and the multifront war that has resulted may have permanently changed that.

""There has to be something different about the way this war ends than in 2006,"" Feltman says. ""I don't think it will be a new [U.N.] resolution, but it can't be simply UNIFIL, because the Israelis won't accept that now."""

Residents are reeling from devastating rain and flooding from Hurricane Helene and now Hurricane Milton. Wars and conflict continue to bring suffering to Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and many other places. People around the world are eager to help. How do you ensure that your donations will do the most good?

These are the guidelines suggested by experts in humanitarian aid.

Giving right away is important for immediate needs, says Ruth Messinger, a global ambassador for the American Jewish World Service and its former president. But, she emphasizes, ""Never give to a brand new charity that does not have a track record."" To find out more about an organization's track record, there are several resources, including BBBWise, Charity Navigator, the Center for Disaster Philanthropy and CharityWatch.

Also take a look at an organization's annual report. It should be found on their website (and if not, ask why not). The report should tell you how the group responded to past crises.

Give priority to local nonprofits that have an established presence in the area, says Victoria Vrana, CEO of Global Giving, an organization that connects donors to nonprofits working toward various humanitarian causes around the globe.

""They understand their community needs better than anyone else. They truly are the first responders, before anyone else swoops in,"" says Vrana. In funding local, ""you're investing in the infrastructure of the place for the future. As you help build them up and keep supporting them, they will be [an ongoing] part of that community.""

Would-be donors can search for local organizations helping a particular cause and see more about the work they're doing on Charity Navigator. And many larger organizations, including Global Giving, vet local organizations and then partner with them to maximize their impact. Partnerships between local and international groups should be spelled out on the group's website or annual report.

Perhaps most obvious, you should get a receipt for your donation for tax purposes. If you don't receive one, something's amiss. The organization should also be able to provide its employee identification number (nonprofits and charities are required to have this government number before filing for tax exemption). You can look them up on ProPublica's nonprofit database if you're interested to see details such as executive compensation, revenue, expenses and more.

Whether it's a natural disaster or a humanitarian crisis, needs on the ground can change rapidly, even within hours. Giving cash allows organizations the flexibility to support what's most needed at all stages of the crisis.

If you are keen on providing aid of a particular kind -- children's health or medical aid or food, for instance -- look for humanitarian organizations that specialize in those areas.

All this advice holds true for supporting people living in war zones or ongoing conflict.

And, it's particularly important to make sure the organization is based in or working in the conflict zone, says Dr. Paul Spiegel, director of the Center for Humanitarian Health and a professor at Johns Hopkins, who responded to questions via email while working in Mali.

""More and more, people may wish to consider [in-country] organizations who are there on the ground, know the culture and speak the language. Many conflicts last for years, and people should consider sustainability; providing funds to local organizations who will be there in the long run.""

In conflict, there are so many needs -- medicine, food, water, shelter, mental health support -- it's important to ensure that organizations are focusing on these humanitarian goals, says Vrana.

""We do screen all the activities and all the missions, to make sure they are fully focused on those things, and not anything that's directly involved in supporting the military or something like that.""

Conflict often lasts for years, leaving people displaced for long periods or permanently, says Siegel, so supporting local organizations and offering ongoing support is vital. ""Once the media have gone, the funding reduces and these people often suffer accordingly.""

Whether it's a natural disaster or a humanitarian crisis, 70-80% funding goes to short-term relief, and most of it is given in the first few months, says Vrana.

Consider making a recurring donation, says Vrana, ""it can be like $5 a month, just set it and know that you're in it for the long term.""

There are also humanitarian crises and wars that never make the headlines, says Vrana, such as in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar, Venezuela and more.

Global Giving recently started a fund to support crises that don't attract high levels of global attention, Vrana says, ""to have a more equitable approach to supporting organizations around the world."""
"In separate strikes, Israel kills 2 Lebanese soldiers and injures 2 U.N. peacekeepers",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/11/nx-s1-5150126/israel-lebanon-strikes-un-peacekeepers-lebanese-soldiers,2024-10-11T15:52:04Z,"BEIRUT -- An Israeli airstrike killed two Lebanese soldiers and wounded three other troops on Friday, Lebanon's military said, an incident that entangles the country's official army in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon.

The Lebanese army said the Israeli airstrike hit a building near a military checkpoint in Kafra, Bint Jbeil province in southern Lebanon. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.

The attack on the Lebanese army comes just hours after Israeli troops fired on the headquarters of United Nations peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, injuring two peacekeepers for the second time in as many days.

Lebanon's army has largely stayed on the sidelines of the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in hopes of preventing it from spiraling out of control. After Israel troops launched their ground invasion in southern Lebanon, Lebanese troops withdrew some 5 kilometers from their observation posts along the border.

But as Israel escalates its campaign against Hezbollah with waves of heavy airstrikes across Lebanon and a ground invasion at the border, Lebanese troops have increasingly found themselves in the crossfire. An Israeli airstrike killed one Lebanese soldier and wounded another earlier this month.

The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, have also been caught in the middle of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. The international force said explosions struck near an observation tower at its headquarters in Lebanon's southern town of Naqoura. One of the injured peacekeepers was hospitalized in the nearby city of Tyre while the other received medical care on site, it said.

UNIFIL did not specify the cause of the blasts. But the Israeli military said that soldiers operating in southern Lebanon identified a threat and responded with fire, ultimately hitting a UNIFIL post and inuring the two peacekeepers. The army said its initial review found that the intended target was located some 50 meters from the UNIFIL position.

The U.N. force said it sent reinforcements to the area following another incident earlier Friday in which an Israeli army bulldozer hit the perimeter of a separate UNIFIL position in southern Lebanon while Israeli tanks moved nearby.

The force said that on Thursday, an Israeli tank had fired directly at an observation tower at the UNIFIL headquarters, injuring two Indonesian peacekeepers. It also said Israeli soldiers had attacked a bunker at a base where peacekeepers were sheltering, damaging vehicles and a communication system.

Those events drew sharp criticism from European countries including Italy and France that contribute troops to the U.N. force. Israel has warned peacekeepers to leave positions near where it said Hezbollah militants have launched rockets into northern Israel over the past year of cross-border attacks.

In central Beirut, rescue workers were searching through the rubble of a collapsed building Friday, hours after two Israeli strikes hit the Lebanese capital, killing at least 22 people and wounding dozens.

The air raid was the deadliest attack on central Beirut in over a year of war, hitting two residential buildings in neighborhoods that have swelled with displaced people fleeing Israeli bombardment elsewhere in the country.

Hezbollah's Al-Manar television and Israeli media said the strikes aimed to kill Wafiq Safa, a top security official with the group. Al-Manar said Safa was not in either building at the time. The Israeli military had no comment on the reports.

Hezbollah has expanded its rocket fire to more populated areas deeper inside Israel. While disrupting life for Israelis, most of Hezbollah's barrages have not caused casualties. But early Friday, an anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon killed a man from Thailand working on a farm in northern Israel.

In Beirut's Burj Abi Haidar neighborhood, civil defense members and municipal workers dug through the pile of concrete and twisted metal from a three-story building knocked down by Thursday night's strike.

In an adjacent building that was badly damaged, Ahmad al-Khatib stood in the apartment of his in-laws where he, his wife, Marwa Hamdan, and their 2 ½-year-old daughter, Ayla, suffered injuries. He had just picked up his wife from work and she was performing the evening Muslim prayers at home when the blast hit.

""The world suddenly turned upside down and darkness prevailed,"" said the 42-year-old, tears running down his cheeks. He pulled his daughter out from under the debris of a wall that collapsed in a bedroom. Al-Khatib, who works for the postal service. said he found the force of the explosion had thrown his wife against a wall and a piece of metal had hit her in the head.

""I looked in her face and shouted, 'Say something!'"" he said, but she only responded with sounds of pain. His wife remains in the ICU at a Beirut hospital. His daughter suffered only minor injuries.

Mohammed Tarhani said he had moved in with his brother nearby in the neighborhood after fleeing around southern Lebanon to escape airstrikes the past weeks. His children were out on the veranda, and he was in the living room when the strike hit.

""We rushed out to look for the children,"" he said. ""Where is one supposed to go now?""

Civil defense official Walid Hashash said they don't expect more bodies under the rubble as no people are missing. He added that once operations are over they will issue a final death toll.

Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in support of Hamas and the Palestinians, drawing Israeli airstrikes in retaliation. Israel says its stepped-up campaign since late September aims to push Hezbollah away from the border to allow tens of thousands of its citizens evacuated from the area to return home.

More than 2,100 Lebanese -- including Hezbollah fighters, civilians and medical personnel -- have been killed the past year by Israeli strikes, more than two thirds of them in the past few weeks. Hezbollah attacks have killed 29 civilians as well as 39 Israeli soldiers in northern Israel since October 2023 and in southern Lebanon since Israel launched its ground invasion on Sept. 30. So far, Israeli troops have been operating in a narrow strip of a few kilometers (miles) along the border.

The war threatens to spiral even further, with Israel aiming to strike a crippling blow to its longtime adversary Hezbollah. Netanyahu this week warned Lebanese they would suffer the same destruction that Israel's campaign against Hamas has inflicted in Gaza unless they take action against Hezbollah.

Israel has also vowed to strike back against the Lebanese group's supporter, Iran, after it launched some 180 ballistic missiles at Israel last week. Iran's barrage was in retaliation for previous Israeli strikes that killed Hamas' leader in Tehran and senior Iranian Revolutionary Guard figures in Lebanon.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday reiterated U.S. support for Israel's escalated campaign against Hezbollah. He said Israel had a ""clear and very legitimate"" interest to try to ensure the return of tens of thousands of its citizens who were evacuated from their homes near the border because of Hezbollah fire since last October."

What happens if a portion of the United States doesn't accept the results of this election? It was on my mind as voters told me why they were voting and what the vote meant to them during my time in Michigan. In Dearborn, I found an Arab and Muslim community fractured on how to express their political power in a time of intense grief and anger at this administration over its continued military support of Israel's war in Gaza and now Lebanon.

There are the voters who want the economy to get better and are choosing the candidate they think can deliver. Many Black voters I spoke to believe Vice President Harris will protect their civil rights and Donald Trump will roll them back. There are those who want abortion to be limited even more and those who want reproductive rights restored. Every American will make their choice on whether to vote and who to vote for in just a few weeks.

So I go back to that question, what happens if millions of Americans claim fraud if their candidate doesn't win? It's something I explored in Hillsdale County, a couple hours outside Detroit. There, the Republican Party is split between a group filled with election deniers and Republicans who still believe in the nation's institutions.

"Her last memory is by the window with her baby in Gaza. Then, Israeli airstrikes hit",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/10/nx-s1-5147783/gaza-israel-airstrike-palestinians,2024-10-11T09:07:31Z,"Palestinians look for survivors under the rubble of a destroyed building following Israeli airstrikes in Nuseirat, central Gaza Strip, Oct. 31, 2023. Mohammed Dahman/AP hide caption

The skies roared with Israeli fighter jets, pummeling Gaza City with bombs that lit the night and grayed the day in dust. Eman Abusaeid, her husband and their children were jolted out of sleep, their faces covered in debris from an Israeli airstrike on their neighbor's home.

""Many of the buildings surrounding us have been bombed by F-16s. We're trying to escape but don't know where to go,"" she said over the phone, two days into the war.

She spoke to NPR on Oct. 9, 2023, just two days after Hamas gunmen launched a stunning ambush on Israel. The full scale of that operation would be known weeks later as Israel combed through the burnt corpses and tested their DNA: Around 1,200 people had been killed; another 250 taken hostage.

The attack shook Israel and scarred its society and sense of safety. Israel's yearlong war and its toll on Abusaeid and her family has shattered life in Gaza and destroyed its hopes for the future.

Across Gaza, Israel's response to the Hamas attack was punishing and immediate. Israel's leadership vowed to wage a war unlike anything ever seen in Gaza, a small territory governed by Hamas and blockaded by Israel and Egypt.

A full siege was declared. No electricity, food or fuel would be allowed in, Israel's defense minister said.

Abusaeid said her daughter, Joudi, 12, and son, Ziyad, 11, were scared. They had never seen life outside Gaza and had already survived four rounds of conflict between Hamas and Israel.

""It's the simplest requirement of our kids and our people here in Gaza. They need to move freely. They need to have adequate services, water, electricity as anyone in the world,"" she said.

""Is it only the right for Israel, the occupation, to defend themselves? What about the Gazans?"" she said. ""Who will defend them?""

Billboards and roundabouts in Gaza City, displaying photos of fighters and civilians killed in past wars with Israel, had always served as daily reminders of what Hamas has long argued is the price Palestinians are forced to pay in their struggle for liberation -- a price tens of thousands would be forced to pay for with their life over the coming year of war.

Abusaeid and her family heeded Israeli evacuation orders the second week of the war, joining more than a million Palestinians fleeing their homes and becoming displaced in what many there called a second Nakba, Arabic for ""catastrophe"" and a reference to the 1948 displacement of Palestinians that Israel marks as the year of its founding.

Flyers dropped from Israeli warplanes told Palestinians where to flee to, for safety. ""If you care about yourself and your loved ones, head south according to our instructions,"" the military said.

Abusaeid sought shelter south of Wadi Gaza, a river valley that cuts across the Palestinian territory and which Israel's army has captured to separate the north of Gaza from the rest of the enclave.

Abusaeid huddled in her parents' three-bedroom apartment in Nuseirat in central Gaza. The Engineers' Building, as it's known, had solar power, making it better off than most after Israel had cut fuel and electricity to Gaza.

Abusaeid, a 39-year-old architect who chose a career in social work, was now living in that apartment with her husband and kids, her parents, six of her siblings, nephews, nieces and other relatives. In all, 24 people, half of them children, were sheltering there.

Then, last Oct. 31 at 2:30 p.m., the Engineers' Building was hit with four munitions in a targeted Israeli attack. The five-storey building collapsed.

Abusaeid, her husband and two children were among at least 106 people killed in the airstrike, according to an investigation by Human Rights Watch.

The Abusaeid family lost 23 people in that attack, including Eman's brother Mahmoud, sisters Yaqeen, Aya, Niqaa and Fatima, their parents, Khaled and Ahlam, 10 other children and two other relatives.

Rescue workers digging through the rubble recovered Eman Abusaeid's body in pieces, relatives tell NPR. Her husband and son's bodies are among thousands across Gaza never recovered from under the rubble and who are not included in the Gaza Health Ministry's death toll from the war, which stands at more than 42,000 people killed.

In her last message to NPR, before she was killed, Abusaeid said there were no words to describe the situation in Gaza.

""Gaza is bleeding,"" she wrote.

The death toll from the attack on the Engineers' Building is likely much higher than what Human Rights Watch could confirm, according to relatives of people killed. More than 350 people had been sheltering in the building.

The rights group says children playing soccer on the street outside were also among those killed by the airstrike. The Human Rights Watch report quotes a man who said he found his 11-year-old son who'd been playing outside lying under concrete bars in the rubble, the back of his head cracked open, his face burned and one of his legs nearly severed from his body. The boy died in the ambulance.

Israel had struck around 300 targets that day, but this wasn't the only attack on this scale on Oct. 31. An attack in northern Gaza's area of Jabalia grabbed headlines and raised questions about whether Israel was violating the laws of war when aerial bombardment took down several buildings in that refugee camp, killing possibly hundreds. Israel said it was targeting a Hamas commander.

Israel's military has accused Hamas militants throughout the war of using civilian infrastructure for cover.

Human Rights Watch, however, said it found there was no military target in the Nuseirat attack, and determined the Israeli airstrike likely violated the laws of war. In its published findings, the group called it an ""apparent war crime.""

""It was a targeted attack on that building. And if you attack a building where there is no military target, and you kill this number of people, it's automatically very likely a war crime,"" Gerry Simpson, associate crisis and conflict director at Human Rights Watch, told NPR.

He says surveillance in the days and even hours before the attack would have shown the building packed with people, and the kids playing soccer outside.

NPR reached out to Israel's military multiple times to ask why the building was hit. The military did not respond to NPR's questions. Simpson said Human Rights Watch also heard nothing back.

""We received nothing and we were quite surprised because of the seriousness of this case, the clear apparent war crime that's involved because there was no apparent military target,"" Simpson said. ""We expected the IDF [Israeli Defense Force] to try and mount some kind of a defense, but we received just a wall of silence.""

There was one survivor, though, pulled from the wreckage of the apartment where Abusaeid and her family were sheltering: Eman's sister, Taqwa.

NPR reached the 32-year-old by phone, nearly 11 months after the attack. Over a crackling phone line from Gaza City, she said the last thing she remembers is sitting in her parents' living room with her 4-month-old baby, Ibrahim. He was the youngest of her six children.

""I was sitting underneath the window and he was in my lap,"" Taqwa Abusaeid said.

She also remembers that on the morning of Oct. 31 last year, the family was running out of food. They had some flour and made crepes with jam and chocolate for the kids.

When she came to consciousness after the attack, she found herself in Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. She would be forced to limp out of the hospital in mid-November with other patients when it was raided by Israeli forces.

Those first weeks at the hospital, she would fade in and out of consciousness many times. She remembers asking the nurses and her husband, who wasn't with her at the time of the attack, about her children: Had Ibrahim gotten any milk? Did her kids have warm clothes?

They'd assure her without much detail that all was well, but when she tried to call her sister, Eman, the phone didn't ring.

""No one would tell me anything, or answer,"" she said.

A month later she would find out the truth: That all six of her kids, her parents, and six of her siblings and their children were killed in the airstrike that she alone survived.

Over the phone, she described what each of her children were like.

Somaya, or Susu, as she calls her, was 12 years old and the eldest. She was ""great at everything,"" including English, taught herself how to swim, was beloved by her teachers and liked to draw.

Suhaib, 11, had memorized much of the Quran and had a knack for learning quickly. He was the reliable one, she said, who would run errands for her. He loved playing soccer with his friends.

Juman, 8, was a fashionista inspired by the trends of girls in South Korea. She liked hanging out with the neighbors' kids and never needed prodding to do her homework.

Mohammed, 5, was a chatterbox and was in preschool, she said. He'd follow his older brother, Suhaib, to play soccer with the other boys in the neighborhood, even if his mom preferred he stay indoors more.

Riman, 3, would tell her stories and spoke in ways older than her age. She also helped her mom with housework. Ibrahim, born in June, was still nursing.

""My life was full. My days were full,"" she said. ""And I had time for myself,"" she added, explaining she would surf the internet, talk to her parents and had just accepted a job to teach.

She said now her days are empty. She spoke faintly, her voice nearly at a whisper at times. She struggled to find the words to describe life now.

In Gaza City, famine-like conditions are widespread, according to experts on hunger, and people don't have gas to cook with. They bake on firewood pulled from the rubble.

It was afternoon when Taqwa Abusaeid spoke with NPR by phone. She'd only had a cup of milk and some bread with herbs that day.

She was severely wounded in the airstrike that killed her family. Her spleen was removed and she suffered burns and injuries on her legs. There's a constant hum in one of her ears that becomes unbearable in quiet spaces.

But it all pales next to the loss of her children.

""Everyday they're on my mind,"" she said. ""Each one of them with their stories, their adventures and what they used to do. But I try to live in reality ... or else when I think about them, I can't cope.""

She lost her phone, and most of their photos and videos, in the attack.

""I don't want to think that they're all gone. In normal times, they were always around me, in my face. We were always together,"" she said.

When people in Gaza celebrated the news in May that Hamas had agreed to a cease-fire, prematurely it would turn out, she said she distanced herself from people and wept. There was no one to celebrate with.

""We've stopped thinking about the future. We just think about the day,"" she said.

She said several times a day she prays to be reunited with her kids, for death, or what people in Gaza call martyrdom.

""There's no life left in Gaza,"" she said. ""Everything's changed. Everything is destroyed."""

What matters to key swing state voters in Wisconsin? A single road offers a glimpse,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/10/nx-s1-5143006/wisconsin-milwaukee-election-result-harris-trump,2024-10-10T13:41:06Z,"The Milwaukee Running Group -- OMG meets up on a rainy morning in Milwaukee recently. Keren Carrión/NPR hide caption

On a recent Tuesday morning, a team from NPR's All Things Considered and member station WUWM embarked on a journey along one of Milwaukee's most diverse streets: North Avenue.

This 15-mile road runs east to west, starting near Lake Michigan and stretching all the way into the suburbs. It cuts through every type of neighborhood: urban, suburban, rich, poor, racially segregated and racially diverse.

There's a reason we chose this spot. Wisconsin is a state of 6 million people where the presidential vote has regularly been decided by a margin of 20,000 voters. That's less than 1%.

And it's not just one demographic group or bloc that can make the difference in 2024 -- it's all of them. So we spoke with voters of many political persuasions about what's important to them this election season.

Because as people here like to say: As goes North Avenue, so goes Wisconsin.

We began our journey of North Avenue on the banks of Lake Michigan, where a handful of runners were braving the rain and assembly before the sun had even risen.

The group doesn't normally talk about politics. But on this day, Hans Goldenberg, 34, was happy to share his thoughts.

""I may or may not vote. I don't like either candidate to be completely honest,"" he said.

Goldenberg thinks Republicans would do a better job addressing what he feels are high taxes and crime, but he's also socially liberal and wrestles with that.

""I've gone both ways in the past ... I feel like sometimes my vote doesn't matter,"" he said.

Jackie Breen, 32, jumps in. Breen said she's a committed Harris voter, but she gets why Goldenberg is frustrated.

""I have felt for many, many elections for a very long time, like, who am I voting for? I don't want either,"" she said. ""Where's someone who is actually closer to my age, who understands that my generation is going to have debt for the rest of their lives?""

Our next stop along North Avenue is Beans & Barley -- a deli, gift shop and restaurant rolled into one.

Jim Neumeyer, 44, began working here as a dishwasher when he was a teen and now he owns the place, which he described as ""kind of like a hippie Cracker Barrel.""

Neumeyer is a staunch Democrat and has a Harris sign in his office, but there are no other political signs easily visible to customers. He wants everyone to feel welcome.

As a small business owner, one of the biggest challenges Neumeyer faces is the price of ingredients. He said some of his costs have gone up 20%.

""We're not like a super duper fancy restaurant. We're like an everyday restaurant. And in order to be a place that people in the community can gather daily, we have to keep it really reasonable,"" he said.

So when it comes to politics, Neumeyer wants someone who is interested in small businesses.

""Not necessarily tax breaks for only the largest of businesses,"" Neumeyer said. ""We also need to see some relief from the prices and hopefully see some of them be able to come down.""

Behind the scenes in the bakery, Rayna Hartmann, 20, is making a vegan almond apricot cake. She's a student at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, where she joined protests against the war in Gaza.

""A lot of the way our money is allocated feels very surreal sometimes, especially being a student,"" she said. ""Seeing more money going to the military than it does education and schools.""

This is the first time she's old enough to vote for president, but she has already wielded her power. In the Democratic primary this year, she was one of almost 50,000 people in Wisconsin to vote ""uninstructed,"" the state's version of an ""uncommitted"" vote protesting the war in Gaza.

""Obviously I don't want to vote for Trump,"" she said. ""And it's kind of tough, the next best choice being Kamala. It's like, OK yes she'd be our first Black woman president, [but] it's hard to improve a system that is inherently just broken.""

She still doesn't know whether she'll vote and for whom, and added that a lot of her college classmates feel the same.

Harold Turner, 82, is a pastor and owner of the Milwaukee Times, a weekly newspaper published in the historically Black neighborhood of Bronzeville.

Turner said he will vote for Harris in November.

""I do believe that Kamala ... is going to be the next commander in chief,"" he said.

On the corner of this block, Turner has a neighbor that stands out: the Wisconsin GOP field office. The windows are plastered with political signs and posters for Trump. When our team stopped by, the lights were on but the door was locked.

A couple of miles further west along North Avenue, we arrive in Metcalf Park, where Bill the Butcher is an institution.

Owner Latoya James, 45, says the corner store and butcher shop has been around for more than 50 years. She took over three years ago and remembers shopping here with her family when she was a kid.

When thinking about the election, James is torn. She voted for Hillary Clinton and then Joe Biden in the last two elections, but this time, she might be leaning towards Trump.

""[Trump] makes good points,"" she said. But then, so does Kamala, she added. ""Trump is kind of firm. He says what he means.""

Bill the Butcher is not a place people talk about politics, James said. Customer Lekeisha Ashford agreed. She can't wait for the campaign to be over.

Ashford's top issues are the price of rent and food. She'll be voting for Harris.

Nestled on a busy block in the suburb of Wauwatosa we found The Little Village Play Cafe, a coffee shop and indoor play space.

Among the parents in this cafe were Leah Bomber, a labor and delivery nurse, and her husband Chris.

Leah Bomber said this election was really important for them because they had their 14-month-old son Jude via IVF.

""It really affects every aspect of my life right now,"" she said.

""I hate that so much of our life is in the balance as well,"" Chris Bomber added. ""We have eggs in the freezer. ... If Trump gets elected, there's a very good chance that legislation goes into effect that makes our situation illegal.""

Another parent, Duane Tomka, voted for Trump in 2016 and sat the election out in 2020.

This time, he's leaning Republican but can't commit just yet.

""[Trump is] abrasive, which I think that shoots him in the foot a lot of times,"" Tomka said. ""Honestly, I think lots of people like me don't want to say what they feel, that they may vote for Trump.""

While the big city [and its neighboring city, Wauwatosa] is heavily Democratic, as North Avenue continues out into the suburbs west of Milwaukee, Trump lawn signs start to appear and the voting patterns shift from blue to red.

The last stop on our trip is in suburban Brookfield, located in Waukesha County -- a base for Republican support, which went for Trump in 2016 and 2020.

Brookfield now is a battleground city within a battleground county within a battleground state.

At the Ruby Commons retirement community, happy hour starts at 2 p.m. so the residents can start dinner at 4 p.m. At a game of bingo, Joanne Carstens, 94, said she avoids talking politics with other residents, but she thinks about it a lot.

""I'm very concerned about the election,"" she said, adding that ""open borders"" and ""lack of police support"" are among the main reasons.

""I'm worried that Trump will not win,"" Carstens said.

Phyllis Glandt, 81, another resident and bingo player, feels the opposite.

""How can a convicted felon run for office? I don't understand that one,"" she said.

Glandt was once a Republican, but switched to supporting Democrats more than 60 years ago over the issue of abortion rights.

""That disturbed me so much because these young kids that might end up pregnant could have to carry a baby to term. I just think that's awful, if they don't want to,"" she said.

In one of the Ruby Commons apartments, we found Louise Fogelstrom watching Fox News with David, her husband of 63 years. The couple, in their 80s, are not fans of Harris.

""Well, she lies,"" Louise Fogelstrom said. ""If she came into this house I'd say get your butt out, I don't wanna see you.""

David Fogelstrom said he is a Trump supporter because they both came from similar industries.

""He was a developer and so forth and I was in the building products industry,"" he said. ""I think he's just a regular guy ... what you see is what you get.""

Our final interview on this trip was with Josseline Clark, 30, a lifestyle enrichment coordinator at Ruby Commons, who said that her views were her own and she wasn't speaking on behalf of her employer.

Clark is celebrating a big moment.

""I am very enthusiastic because this year is the year I became an American citizen,"" she said.

Her family is from Honduras and she moved to the United States eight years ago.

""For me, being able to live in this time where I can vote for the first time and vote for the first female president is super exciting,"" she said, adding that her views were her own and she wasn't speaking on behalf of her employer. ""And it just means a lot because there's a lot of my family that have been here and they have never been able to vote.""

Clark recently voted in her state's primary. She saved the ""I Voted"" sticker and placed it in the same box containing her citizenship papers.

""It just felt great,"" she said. ""Because now you feel like you have a voice and you belong somewhere."""
"These maps and images show what's left of Gaza, 1 year into the Israel-Hamas war",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/09/g-s1-27175/israel-hamas-war-gaza-map,2024-10-10T09:11:55Z,"Within hours of Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel began airstrikes across the Gaza Strip. Last Oct. 27, Israel's ground invasion of Gaza began, and within a few days the Israeli military had encircled Gaza City. In the months since then, the war in Gaza has continued unabated and has yielded one of the most devastating humanitarian crises in recent decades, as almost 2 million residents have fled the onslaught of bombardment, demolition and warfare.

Last year's Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack killed around 1,200 people and about 250 individuals were taken hostage, according to Israeli authorities. Israel's military response since then in Gaza has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Risk of famine in Gaza is widespread.

The conflict has expanded: Hezbollah in Lebanon began firing rockets at Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, leading to Israeli-Hezbollah fighting that has intensified recently, and hostilities have drawn in Iran and militias in Yemen and Iraq. No cease-fire has been reached.

After a year of war, here is what's left of the Gaza Strip.

A year of Israeli airstrikes and demolitions has left Gaza in ruins. It's estimated that nearly 60% of buildings in the enclave have been damaged or destroyed, according to satellite data analysis by Corey Scher of the City University of New York's Graduate Center and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University.

By the beginning of 2024, 71% of buildings in Gaza City and 67% of buildings in northern Gaza were already damaged or destroyed. This destruction then followed Israel's campaign against Hamas as troops moved farther south, with Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis and finally Rafah seeing a steady increase in bombardments and Israeli clearing operations.

The Israeli military says that it has struck more than 40,000 targets from the air, dismantling more than 1,000 rocket launchers and locating about 4,700 Hamas tunnel shafts as of Sept. 25.

The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports that 87% of schools in Gaza have been hit by munitions or been damaged since the beginning of the conflict.

In May, Palestinian civil defense authorities estimated that as many as 10,000 people may be buried under rubble throughout the enclave. These people, presumed dead, are not included in the casualty numbers that Gaza's Health Ministry publishes.

The more than 37 million metric tons of debris include over 800,000 metric tons of asbestos and 7,500 metric tons of unexploded ordnance, according to U.N. estimates.

Adding to the chaos, roads in Gaza are increasingly impassable. An analysis released by the United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT) on Sept. 4 estimates that 68% of roads in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, hampering the movement of millions of repeatedly displaced people, as well as ambulances and aid groups operating in the enclave.

This damage includes demolition by the Israeli military along two strategic corridors, the Philadelphi Corridor adjacent to Egypt and the Netzarim Corridor bisecting the territory south of Gaza City.

Prior to the war, nearly a quarter of the land in Gaza was covered with orchards, crops or greenhouses, according to He Yin, head of the Remote Sensing and Land Science Lab at Kent State University.

Yin has been closely studying agriculture in the Gaza Strip over the past year. Olives, citrus fruits, flowers and vegetables once grew abundantly there. After a year of war, 70% of greenhouses and nearly 70% of tree crops have been damaged or destroyed, according to Yin's analysis of high-resolution satellite imagery of the region. Tree crops include citrus fruits, olives and other orchard trees. They don't include natural trees or shrubs.

""Agriculture [in Gaza] is economically valuable, but it's also a cultural symbol,"" Yin says. Many Gaza residents have been forced to cut down their own olive and citrus trees to create firewood to bake bread and boil water.

Before this war, about 90% of farmers in Gaza worked less than a half acre of land, according to a 2017 report from the nonprofit American Near East Refugee Aid. Others had small home garden plots next to their homes. The loss of a single tree can be devastating.

""No matter what kind of tree crop, it takes years before you have a harvest,"" Yin says. ""So even if the war stops tomorrow, there's no way to recover these [trees].""

Likewise, the loss of greenhouses will be felt for years to come. Greenhouses typically produce higher-value crops, like seasonal market vegetables.

The widespread destruction of buildings, roads and agriculture exacerbates the desperate situation faced by people throughout Gaza.

The U.N. reports that 17 out of 36 hospitals in Gaza are partially functioning, while the remaining 19 are out of service, as of Oct. 2. Many local medical personnel have been killed, wounded or repeatedly displaced, making hospital operations increasingly difficult. In August, NPR reported that hundreds of children in need of medical treatment were not being allowed to evacuate the territory, recently leading to the deaths of at least nine children awaiting care.

With the war stretching south over the past year, very few places in Gaza designated by Israel as safe zones for Palestinian civilians remain, as Israel's military puts more and more of the territory under evacuation orders and carries out attacks there.

This has forced many residents to flee to the narrow strip of coast in al-Mawasi, designated as a humanitarian zone by the Israeli military. Conditions in this area are increasingly overcrowded and unsanitary, as family after family aims to find a safe place to shelter from the Israeli invasion.

But this area is not free from Israeli bombardments either. In September, an Israeli airstrike hit the humanitarian zone, killing at least 19 people. In July, 90 Palestinians were killed in al-Mawasi by an Israeli airstrike. In both cases, Israel's military said it was targeting Hamas commanders.

Using just satellite imagery, Yin can sense the growing desperation in Gaza.

""First they settled areas that [were] pretty empty -- no one's managing that land,"" Yin observed. ""Just barren land and natural fields with shrubs.""

But as safety in Gaza became increasingly elusive, he noticed displaced people finally entering agricultural land.

""They have to, because there's not enough space.""

"Mustafa, Toronto's hood poet, shoulders the stories of the lost",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/g-s1-26454/mustafa-dunya-poet-toronto-review,2024-10-09T09:13:26Z,"Mustafa in a quiet moment from the video for ""SNL,"" a single from his album Dunya. Courtesy of the artist hide caption

Rap is the CNN of the ghetto. An idea espoused by Public Enemy frontman Chuck D since the 1980s, it has since grown into a key hip-hop ideal, defining the music's relationship with its public. Throughout its history, hip-hop has spotlit the turmoil faced by Black communities, in housing projects and neighborhoods from coast to coast -- and, eventually, around the world. Chuck's framing was a bit limited -- rappers could always be so much more than reporters, serving themselves and their communities in other ways as advocates, radicals, lobbyists, franchisers and cult heroes -- but his belief was sturdy, always invested in the genre's function as a beacon. Still, it bears following the analogy to its logical end: Once those ghetto tales are broadcast to the outside world, what happens to them? Who steps in as the stewards of that shared history, archiving all of its beliefs, rituals and myths? Who is there to preserve the memories and traditions of the lost, as folklorists for the streets?

For years, the poet and now singer-songwriter Mustafa has aimed to fill such a void -- particularly for the city of Toronto, and the turbulent Regent Park neighborhood where he was raised, but also for all cities bearing a resemblance. ""So much of what I am is the hood,"" he recently told fellow poet Hanif Abdurraqib. His earliest poetry was about being aware of that distinction from a young age, and being baffled by its complications: ""A Single Rose,"" which he performed at 12 before Nelson Mandela Park Public school, couldn't make sense of the violence happening or those turning a blind eye to it. He has spent his artistic career, across many media, trying to find that sense. The gang Mustafa formed with friends from Regent Park and neighboring Esplanade, Halal Gang, became an arts collective in 2014, centering rap music and trying to put faces to the area's conflicts. In 2016, the writer Safy-Hallan Farah wrote in MTV News that ""the division that springs out of kids' departure from their parents' traditions is the space, place, and time that Halal Gang ... was formed,"" noting the disparate cultures that the collective was navigating and the distance between them. Mustafa laid out his mission plainly to Farah: ""I wanna do it for the kids to see themselves. I wanna refine the narrative.""

The broader strokes of the narrative were clear: Second-generation Canadians, largely children of East African immigrants, were grappling with who they were, and in trying to claim and defend the blocks they were filling, found themselves embroiled in territorial violence. The refinement Mustafa was chasing was in the very role of the gang, a means of protection and of village-building. Halal Gang was living both truths, as ""downtown hood dream,"" as Mustafa put it, and nightmare. Two days after ""Still"" (also known as ""Rabba""), the Drake-cosigned 2016 breakout from Halal Gang members Mo-G and Smoke Dawg, was recorded, their friend Ano was killed. Another friend of Mustafa's, Ali Rizeig, was shot at his Regent Park home in 2017. Then, in 2018, Smoke Dawg was shot dead in front of a nightclub. ""The light of the community dimmed,"" Mustafa told Noisey that same week. In response, he produced and directed the 2019 documentary, Remember Me, Toronto, and in 2021 released his first solo music, When Smoke Rises.

Though rap-adjacent through Halal Gang and pop-adjacent through writing credits for Camila Cabello, the Jonas Brothers and Shawn Mendes, Mustafa is, nominally, a folk musician. His music does draw upon a familiar acoustic, guitar-spun fingerstyle sound, but it is more so ""folk music"" in the sense that he is an actual keeper of street folklore. That lore is both singular and common -- as a document of the East African experience of Toronto gang culture, and an accounting of how persistent and pervasive such an experience can feel across neighborhoods and cities and nations. When Smoke Rises, which was produced by Frank Dukes, a rap beatmaker operating at the pop convergence of genrelessness, stretched the folk sound to fit new contexts. The project seemed to be animated by the minimalist, indie-inflected Canadian R&B of the 2010s, and counted soulful electronic artists Sampha, James Blake and Jamie xx among its contributors, all in pursuit of a roots movement for the hip-hop generation. In its harrowingly heavenly songs you can hear a cross-cultural exchange, and his ability to embody many different frameworks at once quickly drew attention for its clarity of thought and purpose: When Smoke Rises was shortlisted for the Polaris Prize in 2021, and the video for ""Ali,"" the poignant song Mustafa wrote for Rizeig, won the Prism Prize in 2022. In the video, as he sings of trying and failing to usher his friend away from a dangerous place, those sitting around him vanish into smoke around him. It is a powerful image: Mustafa, the lone voice left in the room, singing through the anguish for those lost.

That burden can be heavy, and Mustafa's gorgeous, taxing full-length debut, Dunya, tries to reconcile the effects of carrying so much of your city within you and being a voice for both those killed and those left behind. Across 12 tenderly murmured songs, he sounds weary, the interrogation of the mantle he bears pushing his gaze ever inward. The album appraises spirituality, gratification and agony as the means to negotiate ideas of East and West, home and community, what is personal and what is omnipresent. His songs have always pulled the listener into closed-door heart-to-hearts and pleading reflections so tense and touching they feel both visceral and unknowable, but now all of the borders are dissolving, with only him at the center.

Toward the end of When Smoke Rises, Mustafa sings of being unprepared in the face of so much loss: ""We forgot to talk about Heaven / And leaving / And what it would mean / And how I would grieve,"" he sings. The idea lingers in Dunya: Last July, his brother Mohamed, was shot and killed, and on ""What Happened, Mohamed?"" more questions ring out: Are you lonely? Do you need a homie? He still sees himself as a stand-in for those the streets have claimed, as an emissary or intercessor -- ""Seen Ace on that big bike when I was 12 / I thought he'd live forever, but now he's in hell,"" he sings on ""Beauty, end."" ""Wings ain't built for the size of his cell / So he let me hold his till he gets an appeal"" -- a responsibility that has seemingly always been his to bear, in one way or the other, but on Dunya he refuses to let questions about what leaving means and how he would grieve go unheeded. He spends much of the album asking.

Mustafa sits at a distinctive cultural intersection, as a Sudanese-Canadian Muslim artist with activist bonafides who has stood shoulder to shoulder with both Justin Trudeau and The Weeknd, and as a result has operated as a kind of interpreter between realms. When Smoke Rises, even at its most withdrawn, felt like it was serving a eulogistic function: In speaking for and preserving the memories of others, he recognized the necessity of communicating their trauma and struggle for those who wouldn't see them. But it's clear listening to Dunya that Mustafa is done translating. Songs like ""SNL"" and ""Gaza is Calling"" are decidedly layered with colloquialisms from across cultures, far from indecipherable but not concerned with what nuances may go unspoken. Here, many of the most important parts feel like they are none of the audience's business. And yet, his panorama is so carefully furnished, in sound and detail, that it often feels like you are in the room with him, privy to encounters you don't have context for but can understand intuitively. His aching, sensitive voice is the anchor steadying listeners through a time-dilated spiritual journey. As he remembers images from his past on songs like ""What Happened, Mohamed?"" and ""What good is a heart?"" he sings as if he is seeing them in real time, like Interstellar's Joseph Cooper floating through a fourth-dimensional tesseract composed of infinite copies of his daughter's childhood bedroom. In Islam, ""dunya,"" which roughly means ""this world in which we live,"" is often used in reference to the transient nature of the mortal plane. Mustafa's conception of this on his album tries to reconcile two senses of ""temporary"" -- the Quranic notion of earthly life being but a blip along the path to an eternal afterlife, and the Western one of feeling like every single moment must be seized and cherished.

When ""Imaan,"" the Dunya single co-produced by The National's Aaron Dessner (notably a major collaborator on Taylor Swift's Folklore and Evermore), was released, Mustafa spoke of the song as an anatomizing of this crossing: ""two Muslims journeying through their love of borderless Western ideology and how it contradicts with the modesty and devotion in which they were raised."" There is friction in the way it is overlaid sonically, too -- strings from his homeland, Sudan; oud from Egypt; drums and chords from American folk. The contradictory pull of self-indulgence and adherence to piety is the album's core tension, and in picking at these dueling impulses, he finds himself reconsidering all of his connections, earthly or otherwise. There are far more questions than answers, but the seeking feels like its own response, and his probing yet self-effacing lyrics feel like proof of progress. His songs have always been buoyed by his writing, which is as surgical as it is impenetrable on Dunya, but the album pulls further away from the emphatic poeticism of spoken word, instead moving toward a more hymnal quality representative of such devotional music.

I wrote in 2021 that listening to Mustafa's music could feel like eavesdropping on a prayer, thinking primarily of invocation as a private conversation with a higher power. But on Dunya, nearly every such solemn act is performed as a kind of bonding ritual: a barometer for how close or far he is from others, the vessel ushering Mustafa through scenes of grief and agency. On ""Beauty, end,"" he explains that learning how to pray is one of the things he memorized as a child, along with speaking and jumping and smiling. When he notes on ""What good is a heart?"" how someone with whom he's intimately acquainted has changed, one of the key differences is in the way that they pray. ""At least return, make me believe, those secrets are safe with you / My mother was sick, tell me you prayed / Like I used to pray with you,"" he pleads on ""Old Life,"" seeking some sign of care. Faith can be a tether, but it can also be oxygen, a shared life force from which being separated can feel suffocating, and throughout Dunya, Mustafa seems to be between panic attacks, trying to catch his breath. It is in the moments where he can feel God in the room that he finds comfort and companionship.

So much of Dunya is in conversation with someone specific just out of view: Mohamed and Imaan and Nouri, the nameless Palestinian boy he grows apart from on ""Gaza is Calling,"" and, on ""I'll Go Anywhere,"" God himself. The details are so crisp and particular as to be pointed: a father's taxi in an alley, texts received during a viewing in Rexdale. Even in situations of separation, he seems to be internalizing the ways in which every person on the outside of the frame is an extension of his chosen path, an idea he articulates profoundly on ""Old Life"": ""I'm not yours / But there's a part of your life that is mine.""

Maybe that's why the Daniel Caesar duet ""Leaving Toronto"" feels like the most gut-wrenching song on Dunya to me. In its lyrics, Mustafa has been exhausted by the fight and all that it has taken from him, singing, ""If we're burning this city, tell me where to start."" But there is clearly conflict within him; parting with the city would mean excising part of himself. ""I'm leaving Toronto / I would drown this whole city if I could,"" he sings, before admitting, ""There's nowhere I can go / That has enough room to let me bring my hood."" At the end of the song, he leaves a sort of will and testament: If he's killed, he says, bury him next to his brother, pray for him, and -- he reiterates twice -- make sure that his killer has money for a lawyer. It's that last part that is particularly telling. Everyone, he seems to imply, deserves to be spoken for."
"Trump secretly sent Putin COVID-19 tests during pandemic shortage, a new book reports",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5146501/trump-putin-covid-tests,2024-10-08T23:07:08Z,"Russian President Vladimir Putin and then President Donald Trump shake hands before a meeting in Helsinki, on July 16, 2018. A new book by the journalist Bob Woodward reports that Trump secretly shared COVID-19 tests with Putin in 2020. Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images hide caption

Vice President Harris is criticizing Donald Trump following new reporting by the journalist Bob Woodward that the former president secretly shared COVID-19 test machines with Russia's Vladimir Putin at a moment in 2020 when tests were out of reach for most Americans.

The revelation, first reported by CNN and The Washington Post on Tuesday, is detailed in a forthcoming book called War book by the famed Watergate journalist, about Trump's record on the international stage, as well as President Biden's.

According to the book, Trump sent the secret shipment of testing equipment to the Russian leader at the height of the pandemic in 2020, even as the U.S. and other nations were facing crippling shortages of testing kits.

""I don't want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me. They don't care about me,"" Putin told Trump, according to the book. Trump responded, ""I don't care. Fine,"" according to Woodward.

NPR has not independently verified the account, which was based on interviews with unnamed sources.

Asked about the report during an interview Tuesday with Howard Stern, Harris said Woodward's reporting was an example of why Trump cannot be trusted as commander-in-chief, because she said he is easily manipulated by authoritarians he hopes to befriend.

""He admires strong men, and he gets played by them because he thinks that they're his friends, and they are manipulating him full time and manipulating him by flattery and with favor,"" Harris said. ""Remember, people were dying by the hundreds, everybody was scrambling to get these kits ... and this guy, who was President of the United States, is sending them to Russia to a murderous dictator for his personal use.""

The Trump campaign has dismissed the book as ""made up stories"" written by a ""deranged man,"" according to a statement by its communications director, Steven Cheung.

""President Trump gave him absolutely no access for this trash book that either belongs in the bargain bin of the fiction section of a discount bookstore or used as toilet tissue,"" the statement read.

Woodward's reporting adds to the swirl of questions that have surrounded Trump about his relationship with Putin dating back to his 2016 campaign for the White House, when he publicly called on Russia to find Hillary Clinton's missing emails. Trump has defended his stance toward Putin, maintaining that had he still been in office Russia would not have invaded Ukraine in 2022.

It is a relationship that appears to have continued even after Trump left the White House, according to Woodward, who reports that the former president may have spoken with Putin as many as seven times since Biden took office.

In one episode reported by Woodward, Trump ordered an aide away from his office at Mar-a-Lago in order to take a private call with Putin early in 2024.

The book also details pivotal moments in the Biden presidency, including the administration's response to the war in Ukraine and Biden's fractious relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Woodward recounts the president's frustrations with Netanyahu amid the ongoing war in Gaza as he concluded that Netanyahu's instincts for political survival outweighed his interest in defeating Hamas.

""That son of a b****, Bibi Netanyahu, he's a bad guy. He's a bad f****** guy!"" Biden reportedly told advisers, according to Woodward.

Asked about the anecdote, the White House declined comment, but deputy press secretary Emilie Simons said the U.S-Israel relationship is ""as strong as ever"" and said Biden and Netanyahu have a long and candid relationship.

""They can have very honest and straightforward conversations with each other,"" Simons said."
Some Indian American Democrats see themselves in Harris. Others see the limits,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5131223/some-indian-american-democrats-see-themselves-in-harris-others-see-the-limits,2024-10-08T21:57:10Z,"In the warm Georgia heat, Kannan Udayarajan is sipping chai and talking politics at an Indian restaurant in a small strip mall in suburban Atlanta.

There used to be only one Indian restaurant here, Udayarajan says, in this corner of adjoining suburbs at the edge of Forsyth County.

""Now in a 10 mile radius we probably have 40 to 50 at a minimum.""

The exponential rise in Indian restaurants follows a wave of Desi immigrants here. Desi is a term many people from the South Asian diaspora use to describe themselves. These immigrants are no longer primarily landing in traditional South Asian strongholds, like California and New York, but are also reshaping states like Texas and Georgia, helping transform metropolitan suburbs into some of the most diverse spaces in American life. Indian Americans now make up the second largest immigrant population in the United States.

Udayarajan says he's been a political junkie ever since he came to America for work in 2007. He hadn't planned to stay, but he got married and had kids, and in 2018 he became a citizen. Still, he didn't get involved in local politics until 2020, when former President Donald Trump was running for his second term. Udayarajan organized in his own community, helping register Indian Americans to vote, sometimes teaching them about American democracy.

""Joe Biden won Georgia by 11,780 votes,"" he says. ""And Forsyth County polled16,000 brand new Democratic votes in that election. So we made an impact.""

South Asians are one of the most progressive Asian American communities, a realignment that dates back to 9/11 and the policies and racial animus that followed. A recent Pew Research Center study found that 68 percent of Indian registered voters identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning.

Two years ago, Udayarajan became the head of the Forsyth County Democratic Party. He says this year, he believes Desis could again make the difference in a battleground state like Georgia.

Udayarajan is joined at the restaurant by Ashwin Ramaswami, a 25-year-old who was born and raised just a few blocks away in Johns Creek. Udayarajan asks Ramaswami if he thinks the South Asians here are excited about Vice President Kamala Harris' nomination for president.

""I see a huge amount of excitement,"" Ramaswami tells him. Udayarajan asks if it's more among the immigrant community or among folks who were born here?

""I think everyone,"" Ramaswami says. ""It's so different to have a presidential nominee called Kamala, right? Kamala is a Sanskrit word.""

A meme circulating on messaging apps and other social media has been hard to miss. The meme goes that in Sanskrit, Kamala means ""lotus,"" but in America Kamala means POTUS -- President of the United States.

""The ticket's been supercharged for the Desi community,"" Ramaswami says. He points out a personal overlap: Harris' mother is from the same village as his mother in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

""People can see the connections, they can see their own stories in her, because politics -- a lot of it is about the policy, but it's also about can you trust the person you're going to be electing.""

Ramaswami left John's Creek to go off to school, and then work. Now he's returned and is making a run for Georgia state Senate. He's part of another growing group -- young South Asian Americans running for office.

At the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this past summer, South Asians gathered everywhere: Delegate meetups and happy hours and networking lunches.

""For all the years that I've been involved in politics, I've been part of the broader Asian American community,"" says Ann Lata Kalayil, co-founder of the South Asian American Policy and Research Institute. ""But more recently, we've started talking about South Asian Americans."" She points out the number of times she heard ""Indian American"" mentioned on the DNC stage and in the media to describe Harris. ""There's a real sense of pride, you know?""

Deep Singh Badhesha grew up in predominantly white Colorado Springs, Colo.

""I was the only South Asian there,"" he says. ""I was always trying to find my identity, but it was hard,"" he says, because no one at school looked like him. He describes experiencing a classic Asian American childhood experience -- the lunchbox moment. ""Your mother will make you a deliciously cooked Indian dish"" Badhesha explains, ""and you'll bring it to school and you open it up and everyone's like, oh, what the hell is that gross food?""

He says when it happened to him he felt like an outsider, so he broke off parts of himself to fit in.

""I used to actually be a super Republican and libertarian person because I used to look for folks like Bobby Jindal or Nikki Haley. And I'm like -- 'oh this is where South Asians look like they're having acceptance, right?'""

Then he went to college and met South Asian peers.

""They instilled a lot more pride in who I was,"" he says.

Badhesha believes things are different now.

""Being in this moment and seeing a lot of young folks in particular who see themselves in the Democratic Party -- who see themselves in Ro Khanna or Pramila Jayapal -- and of course Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket, you know, it's like a huge moment for South Asians.""

Back in the Atlanta suburbs, another group of South Asians are meeting to talk politics, but there is no celebration over Harris' nomination.

""It stings, right?"" says Anjali Enjeti. ""I mean, boy, would I love to celebrate a Black, Jamaican, Indian woman.""

Enjeti says she cannot support Harris because of the Democratic party's political, military and financial support for Israel, and what is happening in Gaza and in other parts of the Middle East.

""It feels like a betrayal that when we finally get somebody who we can relate to in some way, to have them support and enforce a genocide is -- it's just devastating.""

Israel stands accused of war crimes and genocide in front of the International Criminal Court, whose preliminary finding is that it is plausible Israel has violated the convention against genocide. Israel and the Biden administration strongly deny the charges.

Enjeti and Harris are both half Indian, and they can each trace their roots back to southern India. Enjeti says that is where the similarities to Harris end.

""I think identity politics is a trap,"" she says. ""It is a trap to think that somebody's shared demographics or community has anything to do with your values.""

Enjeti is sitting with Farhana Rahman, remembering 2020. They registered voters and knocked on doors and drove people to the polls.

""We were screamed at,"" Enjeti says. ""We faced very real physical threats. We risked it all for Biden to win in Georgia.""

""That same me has done nothing this election cycle,"" Rahman adds.

Rahman says as an Indian American Muslim, she believes another Trump presidency is a ""existential threat to democracy,"" even potentially to her own safety. But she says she doesn't feel safe now. She says she's afraid to speak out against the conflict in Gaza and she's reluctant to tell colleagues and acquaintances that she is Muslim.

""I feel like I have to hide my identity,"" she says. ""It's unfortunate, but the level of Islamophobia, just making it so prevalent -- people can say horrible things to Muslims, and it's completely okay.""

She believes she has faced more Islamophobia and repression in the past year than she did after 9/11.

""After October 7th, it has become extremely dividing to the point where being a Muslim automatically means you are pro-Hamas and [an] anti-Semite.""

Rahman says she still doesn't know who she will vote for on Election Day, but she says the options only fill her with sadness and fear."
Two Jewish Democrats reflect on Congressional efforts to combat surge in antisemitism,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5125793/jewish-democrats-antisemitism-congress,2024-10-08T20:41:44Z,"Reps. Jared Moskowitz, Kathy Manning, Josh Gottheimer, and Dan Goldman speak at a press conference in April about allegations of harassment and antisemitism against Jewish students at Columbia University. Stefan Jeremiah/AP/FR171756 AP hide caption

As Congress continues to deal with the policy and political implications of Hamas' attack on southern Israel one year ago, lawmakers are also reflecting on the rise of antisemitism in the United States.

Jewish Americans represent about 2 percent of the population and were the target of 16 percent of hate crimes in 2023 - a surge of over 60 percent from the year before, according to the FBI's hate crime statistics report. Current figures are likely higher, given reports that anti-Jewish animus has been higher since Oct. 7 and the report only captures a few months of data post-attack.

North Carolina Rep. Kathy Manning and Florida Rep. Jared Moskowitz, two Jewish Democratic lawmakers, are working to address the issue despite political divisions within Congress and their own party.

""There's been a change in this country from, you know, the swastika on a wall that happened once in a while or someone being accosted on the street once in a while to the point where you can't even keep up with all the antisemitic attacks that are going on,"" Moskowitz said.

Manning, who co-chairs the House bipartisan task force for combatting antisemitism, said she's been tracking the rise in anti-Jewish hate over the last year.

""I think it's important to remember the attacks began before Israel had any response, before they sent any troops into Gaza,"" she said. ""We saw people being threatened. We saw violent language used against Jews. And, of course, we've seen the eruption of antisemitic behavior on college campuses across the country.""

The rise in demonstrations on college campuses last spring was the subject of various committee hearings in the halls of Congress. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought a Republican delegation to visit Columbia University. Manning and Moskowitz were part of a separate visit with Jewish Democratic lawmakers.

""We didn't go to Columbia because we had a problem with students protesting. They have every right to protest,"" said Moskowitz. ""We went to Columbia because Jewish students were afraid to go to school.""

Protesters on campuses maintained their aim was to show public support for the people in Gaza and to demand their universities divest from companies with ties to Israel.

""We've always been told that you can be anti-Zionist without being antisemitic. And I would say that you could. As it turns out, they're just not,"" Moskowitz said. ""And the reason why is they're not surrounding Israeli students going to class. They're surrounding a kid wearing a Jewish star going to class. They don't know his position on Israel. Maybe he's anti-Israel, but he's Jewish.""

He said the protests highlighted the need for Congress to step in.

""If what was happening on college campuses were not about Jews, if people in hoods were encircling Black kids, blocking them from class, or some right-wing extremist group was targeting the LGBT kids, we don't believe it would have gotten past lunchtime on the first day,"" Moskowitz said. ""We believe Congress would have acted.""

Congress has taken steps over the last year in response to rising antisemitism but there are ongoing divisions about what elements are most important to address at the federal level and which policies will actually lead to solutions.

In May, the House passed the Antisemitism Awareness Act, which would see the adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism when reviewing complaints of discrimination in programs that receive federal financial assistance. The bill goes further than an executive order former President Donald Trump signed in 2019 and opponents say it could restrict free speech. The measure has not been taken up by the Senate.

Manning spent nine months with House colleagues and counterparts in the Senate negotiating what she calls the ""most comprehensive bill"" on antisemitism that incorporates the guidance outlined in the Biden administration's national strategy to counter antisemitism. The result is the Countering Antisemitism Act, which would establish a position in the White House to coordinate federal efforts to counter antisemitism across various agencies and to conduct a study that analyzes the prevalence of online antisemitic content. The bill would also appoint a senior official within the Department of Education to be responsible for addressing antisemitism on college campuses.

That bill has yet to be brought to the floor for a vote by Republican leadership.

Moskowitz says the issue more broadly has highlighted what he calls schisms within his own party.

""It was real easy for Democrats, right, when it was just [GOP Rep.] Marjorie Taylor Greene talking about Jewish space lasers to go call her out, or easy when Tucker Carlson has a Holocaust denier on his show to call him out,"" Moskowitz said. ""I didn't see the same level of interest on calling out the antisemitism when it was within your own tent.""

He said Democratic lawmakers weren't unified in their condemnation of some of the violent language being used on campuses.

""As soon as they saw there was division in our party, the Republicans jumped right in from a political issue, from a fundraising issue, and wanted to drive that wedge. We made it easy for them to do that, by the way, when there are people protesting in front of college campuses saying, 'go back to Poland, kill all the Zionists.' And like several of my progressive members are like, 'Oh, look, it's raining today.'

Manning said the events of the past year have brought Jewish members in the House closer together but support from colleagues has been uneven.

""What I have experienced is not antisemitism from my colleagues, but willful ignorance of what so many of us are experiencing,"" she said.

Moskowitz agreed.

""A lot of other members are scared to step out because they don't want to get targeted,"" he said. ""They don't want to get protested in their district and don't want police in front of their house, which I have 24-hours a day.""

He said that police protection began within weeks of October 7, based on death threats against him and his children, ages 7 and 10.

""It's not a pleasant time to be Jewish at the moment,"" he said. ""Almost every Jewish member has this story. My grandparents were Holocaust survivors. And there are bits and pieces of stories my grandmother's told me that are repeating themselves. Different - not the same, but similar threats. And Jews see and feel that. So we'll have to see what the new Congress wants to do. The schisms that exist on this issue are still going to exist.""

Manning adds she hears from Jews across the country worrying about what the future holds, and asking if Congress can help.

""I think so many Jews, particularly of my generation and older, carry all of those stories on their shoulders -- the history of the Crusades, and the Inquisition, and the pogroms and the Holocaust. When I talk to people about what the difference is today is all those other disasters that happened to the Jews were perpetrated by the governments of those countries. What's happening today in the United States, not only is it not perpetrated by our government, our government is trying to put into place structures to combat that antisemitism,"" she said. ""And that's the thing that gives me hope moving forward."""
I went to a classic Wisconsin supper club to talk politics. This is what I learned,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5138314/wisconsin-supper-club-harris-trump,2024-10-08T15:11:27Z,"The Packing House in Milwaukee caters to diners of all political persuasions. Keren Carrión/NPR hide caption

When we started planning an election reporting trip to swing state Wisconsin, locals told us we had to include a visit to a supper club to experience a unique part of the state's culture. So when I finally met Chris Wiken, whose family opened The Packing House in Milwaukee 50 years ago, my first question was, ""What on earth is a supper club?""

""This is the elusive question,"" he says. ""The whole idea of a supper club is somewhere that you're going to come and spend the evening at.""

Typically, a supper club will include a few things: a Wisconsin brandy old-fashioned cocktail at the bar, seafood or prime rib in the dining room and then live music and a boozy ice cream drink to close out the night.

Even though The Packing House was remodeled about a decade ago, it still has a classic old-time aesthetic with dark wood and dim lighting. Walking through the doors feels like going back in time.

Milwaukee's main airport terminal was just across the street when The Packing House opened in 1974. Now, that terminal serves private jets where former President Donald Trump, Vice President Harris or their running mates park every time they come to town.

""The police and Secret Service come over and go, 'Hey, Chris, they have to close down the street again.' And then I go and shake my fist at them,"" he says, joking that he'll vote for whoever shuts down the street in front of his restaurant fewer times.

You won't see a Harris or Trump sign in front of The Packing House. Wiken doesn't want to alienate his customers, who have a wide range of views, as the All Things Considered crew and I discovered when we started chatting people up at the bar.

Janine Collette, having dinner with an old friend, remembers growing up in Wisconsin before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in the state.

""In high school, we used to raise money in the girls' bathrooms to help girls go to the state of New York to get an abortion,"" she says. ""We're not going back."" Collette is excited to cast her vote for the candidate she expects to become the first female U.S. president.

At the other end of the bar, Ron Raasch says that he has voted for Democrats his whole life and that this election may be the first time he doesn't. He's disillusioned with the two-party system and is considering a vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein.

""It's very hard to see the difference when both of the major parties are going to continue shipping arms all over the world and especially to Gaza,"" he says. Raasch isn't concerned that in 2016 and 2020 the margin of victory in Wisconsin for Trump and Biden, respectively, was less than 1% of the vote. ""People are throwing that as a fear tactic,"" he says. ""And I'm trying to [more so] make a statement that the two-party system is showing its age and its frailties.""

Wearing a Packers hat at the bar, Lee Cielonko is nursing a beer while he waits for his food to arrive. ""I want the economy to be put back together. I want energy. I want to drill, baby, drill, man,"" he says.

He's supporting Trump and is concerned about immigration, saying: ""People come here and they don't have the same culture as us. They don't understand and know a lot of the way our culture works.""

So much about the future, as well as this election, is uncertain; there can be something comforting in the familiar: fish fry Friday, a Wisconsin brandy old-fashioned at the bar and live music in a place that has been doing pretty much the same thing since before most Americans were born."

As Hurricane Milton intensifies and heads toward Florida's Gulf Coast, residents are not only preparing for weather impacts but also dealing with misinformation about FEMA. The disaster relief agency has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in aid so far to help those affected by Hurricane Helene. Former President Donald Trump claims FEMA is running out of money after spending it on undocumented migrants. However, FEMA's administrator says those false claims are discouraging people from applying for the federal funds they desperately need.

Israelis yesterday observed a day of grief and reflection to mark one year since the Hamas-led attacks on communities near the country's border. Multiple memorials took place, partly due to disagreements over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's insistence on continuing the war in Gaza. Families of hostages and their supporters boycotted the official government memorial service. They're seeking an immediate cease-fire deal to end the war and secure the release of the remaining 101 hostages.

In a wide-ranging interview with 60 Minutes yesterday, Vice President Harris was pressed for specifics on how she would pay for her economic plans and work to end the war in Ukraine. Her appearance on the show is part of a long tradition of presidential candidates sitting for interviews with 60 Minutes, dating back to 1968. Trump has criticized Harris for being unwilling to sit for difficult interviews with the press. The show says Trump was scheduled to appear for an interview as well, but his campaign canceled last week. Here's a deeper dive into Harris' responses during the interview.

NPR is visiting six key swing states that will likely decide this year's historic election. This week, Morning Edition is in Michigan to listen to voters about what matters to them and how that will affect their vote.

In 2017, Trump introduced ""Opportunity Zones,"" a tax incentive program aimed at encouraging investment in low-income and distressed communities like Detroit.

One boy's story shows the impact of rising Israeli settler violence in the West Bank,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/the-picture-show/2024/10/08/g-s1-22630/photos-palestinian-family-impact-israeli-settler-violence-occupied-west-bank,2024-10-08T11:33:53Z,"Noor Assi, 15, sits on his bed while watched by his 5-year-old sister Jenna in the village of Qarawat Bani Hassan, Israeli-occupied West Bank, on Feb. 23. Ayman Oghanna for NPR hide caption

In a carpentry shop in the village of Qarawat Bani Hassan, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Noor Assi is at work packaging a wooden table. He tears off strips of tape, tying it to padded cardboard, before flipping the table on its side.

He says he is 15 ""and a half,"" a measurement in age split between the innocence of youth and a desire for manhood.

The war in Gaza has caused tensions to flare across the Middle East, especially in places like the West Bank. The Israeli-occupied territory is the most violent it has been in decades. United Nations figures say that almost 700 Palestinians in the area have been killed, either by Israeli forces or settlers, in the past year. Noor's father was among those fatally shot.

""My childhood is gone,"" Noor says. He was forced to grow up by a grim rite of passage.

On Dec. 2, Israeli settlers raided his village in the central West Bank and shot his father, Ahmed Assi, dead, according to the family, residents and local officials.

The Israeli military told NPR that they responded to a physical confrontation between Palestinians and Israeli citizens in Qarawat Bani Hassan with riot disposal means and live fire and that the circumstances of Assi's death were still under review.

Ahmed Assi's mother, Noor's grandmother, shows bloodied clothes and a sweatshirt with a single bullet hole in the back. Assi's 5-year-old daughter, Jenna, looks on, wearing a necklace with a picture of her dead dad.

""When my father was martyred, I started to work, I took over my father's profession, I started working and spending on the house. I was smart and managed things, meaning I became responsible for the house,"" Noor says.

Noor dropped out of school, working full time in the family's carpentry warehouse, sometimes for 13 hours a day, to provide for his five siblings.

""I am responsible for them now. I take care of them and whatever they want, I get them. I don't let them want for anything.""

Noor looks young, is shy and has a boyish haircut -- long on top, a fade on the sides and back. He maintains his look with regular visits to the village barbershop.

In the Middle East, the barbershop is not just a place to cut your hair. It's also a place to socialize, hang out and talk about everything from family to sports and politics. Not long after Noor gets his trim, the village's mayor, Ibrahim Assi, enters. He is a distant relative of Noor's. It's a small community and family ties are strong. A poster of Noor's deceased father is plastered outside.

The mayor explains that Qarawat Bani Hassan is surrounded by an ever-expanding network of Israeli settlements and outposts. About 500,000 Israeli settlers live in the occupied West Bank, according to the United Nations. The settlements they live in are deemed illegal by the international community. Israeli politicians like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, have promoted their expansion, and they're growing through a web of smaller outposts.

The mayor says that violence from the settlers is terrorizing the Palestinians who live here.

""The West Bank is currently living in a nightmare, a nightmare that has lost its security and safety due to the violence of the Ministry of Settlers, who are -- on a daily basis -- assaulting, killing and harassing and stealing. They are committing real crimes against citizens and farmers that are present on their own land,"" the mayor says.

On Dec. 2, he says, settlers entered the village, damaging property, burning cars, wounding one man and shooting Noor's father dead. His lifeless body was found hours later in an olive grove on the outskirts of Qarawat Bani Hassan.

Noor may maintain his teenage haircut. But he has the hardened hands of an older working man, no longer hanging out with friends, devoting himself, instead, to work, faith and family.

At home, he helps out with the household chores, learning to cook from his mother. He sometimes feels pangs of envy for other teenagers.

""I do get jealous, I sometimes feel like playing, like them, but it doesn't work. I have a family to take care of,"" Noor says.

On Friday, the holiest day of the week in Islam, Noor prays at the village mosque before his weekly ritual of visiting his father's grave, draped in a Palestinian flag.

Prayer is important to Noor, from morning to night. Fighting back tears, he says the Islamic funeral prayer for his father on the porch outside his home.

""O God, forgive him and have mercy on him, and heal him, and pardon him, and grant him an honorable reception.""

Noor says that each night, after prayer, he speaks to his father.

""I tell him what is happening, what we are doing, and who is coming over, for example,"" he says. ""Last time, he came to me in a dream and told me, 'Take care of your family and your brothers.' """
Harris and Trump marked 1 year since the Oct. 7 attacks with tributes to the victims,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5144699/kamala-harris-donald-trump-october-7,2024-10-07T22:25:41Z,"One year after Hamas attacked Israel, both major-party presidential candidates marked the date on Monday with promises of continued support for the Jewish state.

Vice President Harris remembered the victims of the Oct. 7 attack by planting a memorial tree at her residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., while former President Trump visited a sacred site for Hasidic Jews in Queens, N.Y.

""I will never forget October 7, and the world must never forget,"" Harris said during a tree-planting ceremony on the grounds of the vice president's residence. ""We must work to ensure nothing like the horrors of October 7 can ever happen again.""

Hamas, which controls Gaza, killed about 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7 and took some 250 hostage in Gaza, according to Israel. A year later, more than 100 hostages are still unaccounted for. Israel's response to the attack has killed at least 41,000 people in Gaza, according to Gaza health officials.

Harris reiterated her support for Israel's defense, and promised the Biden administration would continue working to free the remaining hostages in Gaza. She then read the names of seven missing American citizens.

Harris also called for efforts to ""relieve the immense suffering of innocent Palestinians in Gaza who have experienced so much pain and loss over the year.""

She appeared alongside her husband Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish and and who has led White House efforts to fight antisemitism.

Trump met with members of an Orthodox Jewish community in New York on Monday morning, and visited the grave of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, an influential orthodox rabbi who died in 1994. Trump was then scheduled to attend an Oct. 7 remembrance event Monday evening with Jewish leaders, according to Trump campaign officials.

Hamas' stated goal is the elimination of Israel and the establishment of a Palestinian state. Israel says the objective of the war in Gaza is to eliminate Hamas.

The war has exposed rifts within the Democratic Party over the Biden-Harris administration's support for Israel. Those divides are particularly pronounced among younger voters -- a key voting bloc for Democrats and a group more likely than older voters to express sympathy for the Palestinian people. According to the Pew Research Center, voters ages 18-29 also are less supportive of U.S. military aid to Israel.

Trump has sought to capitalize on those tensions within his rival's party, saying recently that any Jewish voter who supports a Democrat is a ""fool."" Those remarks drew widespread criticism from Jewish organizations across the ideological spectrum.

He continued emphasizing the message in an interview Monday with radio host Hugh Hewitt. ""I did more for Israel than anybody, I did more for the Jewish people than anybody, and it's not a reciprocal, as they say,"" Trump said."

This story is a part of an NPR series reflecting on Oct. 7, a year of war and how it has changed life across Israel, the Gaza Strip, the region and the world.

NPR journalists have spent the past year witnessing, capturing and documenting the suffering and pain that war has inflicted on people in the Gaza Strip, Israel, the occupied West Bank and Lebanon.

For Israelis, it began when Hamas militants stormed out of the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7 last year, attacking soldiers, families in their homes and a rave packed with young people. The attacks killed around 1,200 people and took 250 hostage, according to Israeli authorities.

Israelis have been divided since: Many have spent the past year in rallies demanding a cease-fire that frees the hostages. Others have pressed their government to continue fighting Hamas, even blocking aid crossing into Gaza.

In Gaza, nothing looks the same a year into the war. Among the more than 41,000 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire this past year are hundreds of families, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. More than half of those killed are women and children. Around 100,000 others in Gaza have been wounded, thousands of them children who have lost limbs.

A year on, nearly everyone in Gaza is displaced, huddling in bombed out schools and under makeshift tents without electricity, running water or safety.

Below is a collection of moments from the past 365 days of this war, captured by NPR photographers and others across the region."

Thousands breached a border fence. Others arrived in speedboats. Some even came by paraglider in a dawn attack by Hamas fighters a year ago that caught Israel by surprise, leaving 1,200 people dead and another 250 as hostages. It also set in motion events that now threaten to turn Israel's long-running conflict with Iran's proxies into a direct and dangerous war with Tehran.

Saturday, Oct. 7, 2023, marked the deadliest day in the history of modern Israel, triggering a devastating attack on Palestinians. The result has been a humanitarian catastrophe for Gaza. Beginning in the days after the Hamas attack, Israeli warplanes began punishing airstrikes inside the narrow strip of Palestinian territory that also lies adjacent to Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. By the end of the month, Israeli forces had launched a full-scale ground invasion of Gaza.

At the one-year mark in the Israel-Hamas war, here are four things that are key to where things stand today.

In the aftermath of the Hamas attack, as Israelis mourned those killed, they also feared for the safety of the hostages. A central plaza in downtown Tel Aviv, unofficially dubbed Hostages Square, was quickly transformed into a gathering place for the families, friends and supporters of the captives. ""Bring them home now!"" emerged as a potent rallying cry, and posters showing the faces and names of the hostages became ubiquitous. Many Israelis began wearing special necklaces, bracelets and T-shirts to show their support for the captives. Daily vigils in Hostages Square drew large crowds.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- already weathering intense criticism for intelligence failures in the lead-up to the surprise attack -- came under intense pressure to halt the fighting in Gaza and secure the release of the hostages.

Although Israel and Hamas managed a brief cease-fire in November that allowed for the exchange of more than 100 hostages for nearly 250 Palestinian prisoners, the truce lasted just a week. Hamas did unilaterally release four hostages, and eight others were rescued by Israeli forces. Israel's military also recovered the bodies of several hostages.

The fate of the remaining captives in Gaza has remained an open wound for many Israelis. Netanyahu's office believes that of the 101 hostages still unaccounted for in Gaza, about a third are likely dead.

The hostages question continues to shape Israel's public response to the conflict.

Since the start of Israel's military response, the country's attacks have killed at least 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza, including 16,500 children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Another 95,000 people have been injured, the ministry says.

Israel's military began its assault on Hamas in the north of Gaza, and as Palestinian civilians sought to escape the fighting, most of them fled southward, displacing them from their homes and cutting them off from critical infrastructure needed for daily survival.

Recent data from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Health Organization and Palestinian officials in Gaza indicate the attacks have damaged or destroyed more than half of Gaza's homes, 80% of its commercial facilities and 85% of the territory's schools.

U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has called the humanitarian situation in Gaza a ""moral stain on us all,"" and the aid group Refugees International has said that Israel's military response ""has wrought disproportionate death and suffering among civilians in Gaza, generating famine-like conditions while obstructing and undermining the humanitarian response.""

Khan Younis, Gaza's second-largest city, which Israeli authorities considered to be a Hamas stronghold, experienced some of the most intense bombardment of the conflict.

In the first few months of fighting, Rafah, near the border with Egypt in southern Gaza, was designated as a ""safe zone"" by the Israeli military -- meant as a place where civilians could shelter and get access to desperately needed international humanitarian aid. Even so, Israel continued to carry out airstrikes on Rafah, some targeted at Hamas fighters or facilities, while others aimed to free Israeli hostages, according to the Israeli military. Some of those airstrikes hit homes, killing and injuring dozens of civilians, and others destroyed food distribution sites. More than half of Gaza's prewar population of 2.2 million was believed to be sheltering in Rafah. In May, Israel issued evacuation orders for the city and launched an offensive that sealed the border with Egypt, which until then was one of the main entry points for humanitarian aid.

Food, drinking water and materials for temporary shelters are in short supply and are being carried in by trucks operated by international relief organizations. People in Gaza are down to one meal every other day, and an estimated 50,000 children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are in urgent need of treatment for malnutrition.

U.S. efforts to speed aid to Gaza have also floundered. A special $230 million temporary floating pier known as the Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore system (JLOTS) operated only intermittently as damage from high winds and rough seas in the eastern Mediterranean repeatedly rendered it inoperable.

Besides the brief cease-fire to facilitate a hostages-for-prisoners swap, repeated rounds of peace talks -- some mediated by Qatar -- have failed to make much progress. Deep-seated animosities and the fragmented nature of the Palestinian leadership have played a part in preventing any lasting peace deal.

Meanwhile, the U.S. has tried to walk a fine line between diplomatic and military support for its long-term ally, Israel, and a desire to mitigate the suffering in Gaza while trying to contain a wider war that increasingly has dragged Iran and Israel into direct conflict and could engulf the rest of the Middle East.

For the moment, cease-fire talks that at times sparked optimism have fallen silent.

In late September, Secretary of State Antony Blinken summed up the U.S. position, saying, ""Israel has the right to defend itself against terrorism. The way it does so matters.""

Meanwhile, public opinion in the U.S. has been split largely along partisan lines, with conservatives showing support for Israel, but some people, younger and more liberal, turning out for pro-Palestinian rallies on college campuses.

Among Democrats, more than half say that Israel bears ""a lot"" of responsibility for the continuation of the war in Gaza, while only about 4 in 10 Republicans do, according to a Pearson Institute/AP-NORC poll published last week.

That political dichotomy could influence the outcome of a likely tight U.S. presidential race, with some Democrats suggesting that Netanyahu is ignoring the Biden administration's peace entreaties in an effort to tip the election toward former President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, voters in key battleground states give Trump higher marks than his opponent, Vice President Harris, on foreign policy matters, according to a recent poll by the New York-based Institute for Global Affairs.

From the opening days of the conflict in Gaza, the Biden administration warned against allowing the Hamas attack to morph into a war that could bring in Hezbollah -- the Lebanon-based, Iran-backed militant group -- as a primary combatant and could eventually lead to a direct conflict with Tehran.

But increasingly in recent weeks, that's exactly what seems to be happening.

On Oct. 8, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets against Israel in support of the Palestinian militants fighting in Gaza. Israel hit back, and for months, low-level conflict simmered along the Lebanon-Israel border. Iran, Hezbollah's main backer, mostly stayed out of the conflict. But an Israeli attack in April against an Iranian diplomatic base in Syria that killed several of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers changed the dynamic. Less than two weeks later, Iran retaliated with a large-scale drone and missile strike on Israel. The attack, heavily telegraphed by Tehran in an apparent effort to contain the fallout, was easily repulsed by Israeli air defenses, assisted by the United States.

Fast-forward to last month: In an operation credited to Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, in synchronized attacks over two days, electronic pagers belonging to members of Hezbollah suddenly exploded across Lebanon, killing more than a dozen people -- including two children -- and wounding thousands more, according to Lebanese health authorities.

Soon after, Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes against southern Lebanon that it said were aimed at Hezbollah targets. One that hit a residential building in downtown Beirut killed a top Hezbollah commander.

As Israeli airstrikes continued days later, multiple residential buildings in southern Beirut were demolished. On Sept. 27, Israel announced that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who led the militant group for more than three decades, was killed in one of the strikes. Hezbollah later confirmed his death.

Israel also hit ports and power stations in Yemen operated by another Iran-backed group, the Houthis.

The United Nations says about 1 million Lebanese have fled their homes amid the Israeli airstrikes. Israeli authorities say about 63,000 Israelis remain displaced from the border area with Lebanon due to Hezbollah rocket fire.

On Oct. 1, Israel opened a ground offensive in southern Lebanon, a move that hearkened back to a similar 1982 invasion of the country's south by Israeli forces, which led to an 18-year occupation and to a monthlong war that Israel fought against Hezbollah in 2006. Less than 24 hours later, Iran launched a massive ballistic missile attack on Israel. The country's extensive defenses -- bolstered by two U.S. destroyers deployed in the region -- intercepted most of the Iranian missiles. However, Israeli officials acknowledge that some of the Iranian missiles did hit an air base."

The war in the Middle East is personal in the swing state of Michigan. The GOP and Democrats are focused on the Arab and Muslim American voting bloc, and the state has the largest Lebanese American population in the country. Many in the state have families living in the areas of Lebanon that are being bombed right now.

A new report has found that both Harris' and Trump's economic plans would increase the national debt. According to the nonpartisan nonprofit Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, Trump's plan would add an estimated $7.5 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade, while Harris' proposals would cost the government an estimated $3.5 trillion. The committee has cautioned that there could be a future fiscal crisis if politicians do not take more decisive action on the national debt. Let's take a closer look at the details of both economic plans.

NPR is visiting six key swing states that will likely decide this year's historic election. This week, Morning Edition is in Michigan to listen to voters about what matters to them and how that will affect their vote.

Michigan, a ""blue wall"" state, is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House. But the victory won't be easy. Harris and former President Donald Trump remain in a close battle. Here are key factors that could decide which way Michigan swings:

This essay was written by Daniel Estrin, NPR's international correspondent in Jerusalem.

""The day still keeps surprising us,"" my colleague Anas Baba in Gaza texted me last Oct. 7, close to midnight.

I was at a hospital in southern Israel. The waiting room was full of parents in a daze, waiting for word about their children who had come under attack at an outdoor techno rave near the Gaza border. In Gaza, our producer Anas was taking photos of families fleeing their homes as Israeli airstrikes rained down.

It was the deadliest day in Israeli history. It sparked the deadliest war in Palestinian history. One year later, it has grown into a regional war. Every day keeps surprising us.

A year later, I find myself thinking about where the survivors and witnesses of this war draw strength.

I think about Batya Ofir, a woman my colleague Itay Stern and I met the other day at Kibbutz Be'eri, the Israeli village that suffered the greatest loss -- 102 people there were killed. Her brother was killed along with his family. She felt survivor's guilt, and she told us she asked herself whether she wanted to keep on living.

""I really thought about it. And then I decided that I wanted to continue to live,"" she said. Today, she is learning how to kayak in the sea to help her face her fears. ""I do everything to give some meaning to life now that they're gone.""

Our colleague Anas Baba in Gaza has been reporting for NPR in Gaza all year. Again and again, he has videotaped bodies brought into the morgue after Israeli airstrikes. He always trains his camera on young children, sheltering near the morgue, standing alone and watching silently as bodies are laid out.

What gives him strength, he said, is collecting biscuits and fruit to give to the children he meets. ""I can help them survive,"" he told me.

He often meets a young girl named Habiba at the hospital in central Gaza. She's been colorblind since birth. One day, she told Anas she saw a man drowning with water coming out of his nose. It wasn't water; it was blood.

""This girl does not know the color of blood,"" Anas told me. ""I wish all the children in Gaza were colorblind now."""
It's a close race for Michigan. These factors could decide it for Harris or Trump,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/nx-s1-5130163/michigan-2024-election-harris-trump,2024-10-07T09:06:21Z,"A Trump and Harris sign side-by-side in a neighborhood on Oct. 3, 2024 in Hillsdale, Mich.

Michigan is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House.

The state is part of the ""blue wall,"" along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, that she and Democrats need to hold to avoid a second Donald Trump presidency.

It's home to some of the key demographics that both parties are courting this election, from white voters without college degrees to the largest Black-majority city, Detroit, and one of the nation's largest Arab American populations.

But the path to victory is not easy this year. Harris and Trump remain in a close battle, as his populist message continues to resonate with white voters and union and blue-collar workers, particularly on the economy.

Dave Dulio, a professor of political science and director of the Center for Civic Engagement at Oakland University, says ""in places like Macomb County, with many blue-collar voters and union workers, Trump made inroads by pledging to get the U.S. out of bad trade deals and renegotiate NAFTA, which he did.""

""I think they still give him credit for that,"" he added.

Dulio underscores the state's significance by noting that small shifts could lead to substantial changes for candidates: ""If you take a small shift among the Arab American community and a small shift among union workers, those multiple small shifts could drive a very different result.""

Both candidates have heaped attention recently on the Wolverine State. On Oct 4, Harris visited a Redford Charter Township firehouse near Detroit, meeting union representatives. She met with Arab American and Muslim leaders then appeared with United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain in Flint and vowed support for Michigan's auto industry. Trump held campaign events twice in September and took his presidential campaign to Saginaw Valley State University in Kochville Township on Oct. 3.

Michigan also plays to the strengths of the vice presidential nominees, who hail from the Midwest. Both Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have stumped in the state in the last month.

To better understand the key issues shaping voters' decisions -- from the economy and immigration to abortion and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East -- we are in Michigan this week hearing directly from voters and political observers as part of our ""We, The Voters"" series.

A September poll by The New York Times and Siena College found that Michigan voters cared most about the economy, followed by abortion and immigration.

Economy

Michigan's unemployment rate is historically low, according to state data, but it has slowly ticked up in recent months. Meanwhile, inflation has eased, but high costs of living remain a concern.

The state continues to suffer from the decades-long decline of automobile manufacturing, and high interest rates have constricted sales of cars, according to a September study from the University of Michigan.

Both parties are trying to put focus on the economy. GOP attack ads argue that Biden and Harris are responsible for inflation, while the vice president's messaging focuses on plans to uplift the middle class and paint Trump-era tax cuts as benefiting the wealthy.

Meghan Wilson, an expert in public policy and urban development, said Harris could expand the Democratic position on economics by appealing to Black business owners and holders of student debt.

""African Americans in Detroit have a lot of small businesses, and so we're looking for capital for those kinds of small businesses. I think Kamala Harris is doing a great job of bringing the small businesses into the conversation,"" Wilson explained.

Organized labor plays a key role in Michigan's economy. Both parties are making a play for Michigan's union members, who accounted for 13% of workers in the state last year. Exit polls in 2020 showed Michigan's union voters favoring President Biden over Trump, and Biden pledged to be ""the most pro-union president"" in U.S. history, which he backed up with a visit to UAW workers striking in Wayne, Mich.

Michigan pollster Bernie Porn said Biden's visit to striking workers helped him bump up his union support, but his policies to advance electric vehicles with tax credits were unpopular with Independent and Republican voters.

""You have Harris leading among union members with 63% which is almost where Biden was in 2020 with 65%, so she's improving her lot among union members, but still, the EVs are a problem,"" he said.

Still, one encouraging sign for the Harris campaign could be Michigan's local Teamsters union backing her candidacy, breaking with the national union that declined to endorse any candidate for U.S. president, after they had supported every Democratic candidate for president since Bill Clinton.

Abortion

Two years ago, Michigan voters approved a landmark amendment to the state constitution, securing the right to abortion and other reproductive health services.

Democrats won control of all three branches of Michigan's governments since making abortion a central voting issue.

But that success may have made it a less influential issue in the 2024 election. A KFF poll in June found that women in Michigan saw abortion as ""decided"" and they were more concerned about inflation and the rising cost of living.

""The Democrats are putting an awful lot of their eggs in the basket of abortion,"" the pollster Porn said.

Dulio pointed out that Trump's main weakness stems from what has driven Democratic success in every election -- and not necessarily abortion since it's already decided in the state: ""His character remains a key weakness. He's deeply unpopular because of the Jan. 6 spectacle and doubling down on his claims that the 2020 election was stolen. That just turns off persuadable voters,"" he said.

Michigan is home to one of the largest Black populations in the nation, ahead of Louisiana, Alabama and South Carolina, and the largest Black-majority city, Detroit.

Harris would herself be the nation's first Black woman president, but some Black voters may not be as motivated to vote as they were in 2020.

""The main challenge is the enthusiasm gap,"" said Ronald Brown, a political scientist at Wayne State University. He said among Black voters in Michigan, those who were in the ""black leadership class"" -- meaning serving in government, churches, Black fraternities and sororities -- were highly likely to vote for Harris. However, those without deep connections to the party, especially working-class and poor Detroit residents, were susceptible to sitting out elections. In particular, he pointed to Detroit's recent voter turnout -- higher in 2020 than it was in 2016 -- as a key factor explaining the state's pick for Biden after it went for Trump four years earlier.

""What could occur is that among working class and poor Black voters, lack of interest could lead to fatigue and this may drive those voters not to vote. And in Michigan, you don't need many. You need enough,"" he said.

Democratic state Sen. Sarah Anthony has a different perspective. She had seen an encouraging gain among young people to help shore up Harris' base.

""The Biden coalition included many working-class white men, a group Vice President Harris has struggled to win over. While there may have been losses there, the data I've seen shows significant gains due to increased enthusiasm among young people and people of color,"" she said.

U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East

The Detroit Metropolitan area has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the U.S. Dearborn, often called the Capital of Arab America, is home to a majority of Lebanese residents who maintain strong ties to southern Lebanon.

Arab and Muslim voters here were largely supportive of Biden in 2020. However, many have since been alienated by his handling of Israel's deadly war in Gaza and the administration's ongoing military aid to Israel. Many now are similarly concerned about Israel's continuing bombardment of Beirut and ground invasion along the countries' shared border.

Abbas Alawieh, a Dearborn Democratic strategist and one of the co-founders of the ""uncommitted movement,"" backed Biden in 2020. But earlier this year, he and other organizers successfully secured more than 100,000 ""uncommitted"" votes in the Michigan primary to protest Biden's handling of the war in Gaza.

Alawieh, who had advocated for a Gaza ceasefire, told Morning Edition host Leila Fadel that he feels more despair now as the conflict spreads to his family's homeland, Lebanon.

""This is a grieving community. So, for us to give guidance to vote for Kamala Harris, when she is part of the administration that's actively killing their family members, it's like giving a campaign speech at a funeral.""

Professor Dubio said the uncommitted movement has the potential to ""have a huge impact,"" and while he believes many of them will ultimately vote for Harris, he added, ""it can't and shouldn't be ignored.""

Abbas mentioned sending letters to Vice President Harris's team, including her national security advisor, requesting meetings with those directly affected by the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. ""So far, the answer is still no.""

He added that Donald Trump visited the community, took photos with leaders, and invited them to his campaign rally.

Saeed Khan, an associate professor of Near Eastern and Asian Studies at Wayne State University, said Muslim and Arab voters were drifting toward Trump in 2016, and some continue to do so today, not only because of a push away from Democrats, but also a pull toward the Republican party's values. Many Arabs and Muslims, immigrant Muslims, voted for the Republican ticket at least until September 11 and then started to move toward the Democratic Party.

""The Republican message of self-reliance, smaller government or less government intrusion, lower taxes, social conservatism really appealed to many, especially immigrant Muslims and Arabs, because it epitomized the American Dream that they had internalized,"" Khan said."
"The Israeli village grieving the biggest loss from Oct. 7, one year later",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/g-s1-25787/israel-october-7-kibbutz-beeri-hamas-attack-anniversary,2024-10-07T09:02:50Z,"Gal Cohen, the head of Kibbutz Be'eri, stands with his daughter Mia, 22, in their home close to the border with Gaza. They survived the Oct. 7 attack locked in their home's safe room. Cohen's goal is to rehabilitate the kibbutz and bring all the survivors back within two and a half years. Maya Levin for NPR hide caption

This story is a part of an NPR series reflecting on Oct. 7, a year of war and how it has changed life across Israel, the Gaza Strip, the region and the world.

KIBBUTZ BE'ERI, Israel -- The natural course of grieving is distorted here, a year after the Oct. 7 attacks.

This tight-knit Israeli community near the Gaza border is digging up its dead from temporary graves further away and reburying them back home, where it is safer to gather now, a year into the Gaza war.

""I'm so exhausted after every funeral that we have to deal with again,"" said Gal Cohen, the head of the kibbutz. ""Because it brings [back] everything, and we cry again.""

Israeli authorities say about 1,200 people were killed last Oct. 7, as Hamas led thousands of attackers bursting out of Gaza, ambushing Israeli towns and communities. Kibbutz Be'eri suffered the biggest loss of any single village: 102 people killed -- about one out of every 13 people living there.

The deadliest single attack in Israeli history led to the deadliest war in Palestinian history, with more than 41,000 Palestinians killed in the Gaza Strip this past year, according to health officials there.

This year, Kibbutz Be'eri has grappled with questions of death, memory, guilt and vengeance.

""Questions from [the] inferno, really,"" says Merav Roth, a prominent Israeli psychologist, and the sister of former Israeli prime minister Yair Lapid, who has counseled the kibbutz members all year long.

This is the story of some of their answers.

Silence is what helped keep the survivors of this small community alive the day of the attack. Silence is what they carried out of hiding from their safe rooms along the Gaza border to a hotel on the Dead Sea that took them in.

""It was the most quiet place I've ever seen,"" says Roth, who met them there. ""Everybody were quiet, defeated. Their bodies were, like, no air inside.""

She had heard their whispers on Oct. 7, carried live on the news.

""The Israelis, we all were on the radio, hearing them whispering to the radio people: 'Why doesn't anyone come? Where are everybody? Where's the army? They're in my house, they're shooting at me.' We will remember this for the rest of our lives, all of us,"" Roth says.

When the Israeli military eventually published its investigation into the attack on Kibbutz Be'eri, it found about 340 attackers had infiltrated the community and that it had taken about seven hours for significant numbers of Israeli forces to arrive to fight off the invasion there.

It took many weeks to account for everyone: who was dead, who was captive in Gaza. Roth sat with the survivors of Kibbutz Be'eri in the Dead Sea hotel basement as the village secretary read the names of 27 identified bodies and 108 people unaccounted for.

""It's just name by name by name,"" Roth said. ""Everybody are, again, quiet, dead quiet.""

This year, Roth has helped the kibbutz make agonizing decisions.

""For instance, there is a boy in the kibbutz who lost four members of his family, two parents and two siblings. So do we tell him about each separately or do we tell him about all of them together?"" she says.

Roth has also counseled former hostages who returned from Hamas captivity in Gaza, families whose loved ones were killed in captivity, and Israelis who didn't experience a personal loss but still suffer from sleeping difficulties, anxiety attacks and depression.

""They are extremely anxious about the future of this place. Many of them leave the country. Because their parents told them that in the Holocaust, those who didn't leave, died,"" she says. ""Hopelessness and helplessness are so strong. The trauma is national.""

From the very first days after the Oct. 7 attack, Roth coached other therapists how to respond.

""When I gave guidelines to the therapists in Be'eri at the beginning, I said, smile and say, how are you? Because these people don't know that it still matters. You have to show them that their wellbeing is still relevant. The life instinct wants to see that someone calls him back.""

At Kibbutz Be'eri, one recent afternoon, teens and parents walked quietly out of the neighborhood cemetery after a funeral for a mother and her 15-year-old son -- two of the many reburials of recent months.

Reburied with the boy was his surfboard: his dying wish as he bled out in his home Oct. 7.

Batya Ofir attended the funeral. She recently reburied her own brother and his family in the kibbutz cemetery, after viewing his partially decomposed body be exhumed from its temporary grave.

""It was not easy,"" she says, ""but I had to see him.""

She wanted to be with his body at the moment it was unearthed. She had not lived on the kibbutz any longer and felt guilty she wasn't with her brother and family in their worst moment on Oct. 7.

Ofir says she made a decision, after her brother was killed.

""I said to myself, what do you want? To continue living? I can also not. I really thought about it. And then I decided that I wanted to continue to live,"" she says. ""I have a family, I have children, I have grandchildren. I draw. I'm learning to kayak, to deal with all my fears. I do everything to give some meaning to life now that they're gone.""

A couple hundred families have moved back to Kibbutz Be'eri. Cohen, the head of the community, is overseeing an ambitious project to bring the residents back within two and a half years.

The kibbutz has broken ground on a new neighborhood of 52 homes.

A short walk away, though, are the homes that were attacked last year. Bullet holes, shattered windows, a pair of children's shoes in the debris: Oct. 7 frozen in time.

There's a debate in the community about what to do with these broken homes. Cohen says it will be put up for a vote.

""Some of the people say, let's make it like Auschwitz. Okay? And it'll be open for people to come and see what happened here,"" he says.

But he says others who survived the attack are taking sleeping pills to cope with the trauma and cannot bear seeing the destroyed homes. ""I believe we'll have to take them all down in the end.""

He doesn't want one person moving back to the kibbutz to see the remnants and relive the nightmare.

Yasmin Raanan, 56, waters her new plants on her patio. She and her husband moved back home to the kibbutz from the Dead Sea hotel a few months ago.

On Oct. 7, she grabbed her personal firearm, and she and her husband locked themselves inside their reinforced shelter room at home. They survived the attack because they had installed a sliding bolt on the safe room. The attackers tried but failed to open the door. Her neighbors' safe rooms only had the standard locks and were breached.

When she was finally rescued that night, and led out of her safe room, she found her living room floor covered in rows of grenades, gas canisters, explosives, rocket-propelled grenades and rifles. She understood: Her home had been transformed into the attack headquarters. Neighbors all around her were gunned down.

Then she saw the man she had heard all day loading gun cartridges in her home. He was sitting outside, she says, stripped naked by orders of the military, and guarded by an Israeli soldier.

""I came with my gun to kill him,"" she recalls. ""A commando soldier said, 'Ma'am, we are a moral people.' I said, 'I have no more morals anymore.'""

The commando took away her weapon, and she says she took the attacker's face in her hands and demanded to know his name. He gave it.

One year later, the Israeli military has left much of Gaza in ruins. That gives her a measure of comfort.

And one year on, the passage of time has taken some of the edge off her anger.

""A year later, things sink in a bit,"" she says. ""Time heals."""
A strike on a mosque kills 19 as Israel bombards northern Gaza and southern Beirut,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/g-s1-26576/israel-bombards-northern-gaza-and-southern-beirut,2024-10-06T12:14:54Z,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An Israeli strike on a mosque in the Gaza Strip early Sunday killed at least 19 people, Palestinian officials said, as Israel intensified its bombardment of northern Gaza and southern Beirut in a widening war with Iran-allied militant groups across the region.

Displaced people were sheltering at the mosque that was struck near the main hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah. A further four people were killed in a strike on a school sheltering displaced people near the town.

The Israeli military said both strikes targeted militants, without providing evidence.

An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital morgue. Hospital records showed that the dead from the strike on the mosque were all men.

Israel is still battling Hamas in Gaza a year after the group's attack on Israel, and has opened a new front in Lebanon against Hezbollah, which has been trading fire with Israel along the border since the war in Gaza began. Israel has also vowed to strike Iran itself after Tehran launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week.

The widening conflict risks drawing in the United States, which has provided crucial military and diplomatic support to Israel, as well as U.S.-allied Arab countries that host American forces. Iran-allied militant groups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen have already joined in with long-distance strikes on Israel.

The Israeli military, meanwhile, announced a new air and ground offensive in Jabaliya, in northern Gaza, home to a densely populated refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. It circulated photos and video footage showing a column of tanks heading toward the area.

Israeli forces encircled Jabaliya as warplanes struck militant sites inside, the military said. Over the course of the war, Israel has carried out several large operations there, only to see militants regroup.

Israel reiterated its call, from the opening weeks of the war, for the complete evacuation of northern Gaza. Up to 300,000 people are estimated to have remained in the heavily destroyed north after earlier Israeli warnings that sent around a million fleeing to the south.

""We are in a new phase of the war,"" the military said in leaflets dropped over the area. ""These areas are considered dangerous combat zones.""

Palestinian residents reported heavy Israeli strikes across northern Gaza. The Civil Defense -- first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government -- said several homes and buildings had been hit and they were not able to reach them because of the bombardment.

Residents posted about the airstrikes and mourned their relatives on social media. Imad Alarabid said in a Facebook post that an airstrike on his home in Jabaliya killed a dozen family members, including his parents. Saeed Abu Elaish, a Health Ministry medic, said he was wounded and bleeding.

""Pray for us,"" he wrote on Facebook.

Hassan Hamd, a freelance TV journalist whose footage had aired on Al Jazeera and othr networks, was killed in artillery shelling on his home in Jabaliya. Anas al-Sharif, an Al Jazeera reporter in northern Gaza, confirmed his death.

The military says it has expanded the so-called humanitarian zone in southern Gaza, urging people to head there. Hundreds of thousands of people have already sought refuge in sprawling tent camps there with little in the way of food, water or toilets. Israel has carried out strikes in the humanitarian zone against what it says are militants hiding among civilians.

Nearly 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were fighters, but says a little more than half were women and children.

Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attack and took another 250 hostage. They are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead.

In Beirut, airstrikes lit up the skyline and loud explosions echoed across the southern suburbs, known as the Dahiyeh, throughout the night, as Israel struck what it said were Hezbollah militant sites.

Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said the area was hit by more than 30 strikes overnight, the heaviest bombardment since Sept. 23 when Israel escalated its air campaign.

The targets included a gas station on the main highway leading to the Beirut airport and a warehouse for medical supplies, the agency said. Some of the overnight strikes set off a long series of explosions, suggesting that ammunition stores may have been hit.

Israel's military confirmed it was striking targets near Beirut and said about 30 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory, with some intercepted.

Hezbollah said it successfully targeted a group of Israeli soldiers in northern Israel ""with a large rocket salvo, hitting them accurately."" It was not possible to confirm the claim.

At least 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters, have been killed and 1.2 million driven from their homes in less than two weeks. Israel says it aims to drive the militant group away from its border so that tens of thousands of Israeli citizens can return to their homes.

Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, calling it a show of support for the Palestinians. Hezbollah and Israel's military have traded fire almost daily.

Last week, Israel launched what it said was a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon after a series of attacks killed longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his top commanders. The fighting is the worst since Israel and Hezbollah fought a monthlong war in 2006. Nine Israeli soldiers have been killed in ground clashes that Israel says have killed 440 Hezbollah fighters.

It is not possible to verify battlefield reports from either side."
"As Oct. 7 approaches, synagogues and mosques bolster security",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5137188/mosques-synagogues-security-october-7,2024-10-05T09:04:16Z,"A member of the New York Police Department patrols in front of the synagogue Congregation Bais Yaakov Nechamia Dsatmar on Oct. 13, 2023 in the Williamsburg neighborhood in the borough of Brooklyn in New York City.

Making one's way into the Chicago Loop Synagogue isn't merely a matter of opening the front door.

First, visitors must ring a doorbell and talk to a receptionist at an office desk. After making their way into the foyer, they buzz another doorbell for entrance. Then, they have to pass through a metal detector scan.

""We have people from all over the world who come here. When they're downtown and they want a place to pray, they come to us,"" synagogue President Lee Zoldan said. ""You never know who's going to show up. That's why we're here, is to serve them.""

In order for the synagogue to focus on that mission of service and remain a spot of refuge in this city's busy downtown, Zoldan said she has to keep a watchful eye.

Jewish, Muslim and Arab American communities have experienced increased threats since the beginning of the war in Gaza. As the one-year mark since the Hamas-led attack on Israel approaches, American Jews and Muslims are preparing special services and memorials to honor lives lost and pray for an end to the violence. Across the country, mosques and synagogues are paying special attention to ways they can strengthen security for their members heading into Oct. 7.

""Virtually every synagogue has been in touch with local police,"" said Nathan Diament, public policy director of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America. ""They're going to have increased patrols, both by police and also by volunteers. We just want to make sure that everybody's safe.""

On Oct. 4, the FBI issued an alert, warning that ""violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators"" may view Oct. 7 ""as an opportunity to conduct an attack or other high-profile, illegal activity.""

""Online messaging associated with (foreign terrorist organizations) and other violent extremists highlighting the one-year anniversary of the October 7 attacks could motivate threat actors across ideologies, including those who espouse violent anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, to engage in violence,"" the FBI warned.

The Chicago Loop Synagogue has experienced hate crimes before. It was attacked in 2017, when vandals smashed the building's front window and pasted swastikas on the entrance.

""We've always been very security conscious,"" Zoldan said. ""I mean, we have to be.""

In addition to the front entrance setup, the synagogue requires guests to call in advance before visiting. Beyond these safety measures, Zoldan declined to fully flesh out the Chicago Loop Synagogue's security measures.

""There are numerous other systems that we have that would be considered best practices for any synagogue,"" Zoldan said. ""We're always looking at what are best practices for security, but I think we do everything that we possibly can. I'm comfortable that we're doing the right thing.""

Zoldan stays in regular contact with local and federal agencies like the Cook County Sheriff Police, Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Justice to update the synagogue's security strategies.

After the Oct. 7 attack and war in Gaza that followed, the Department of Homeland Security offered resources and information for faith leaders to help keep their communities safe.

Among them were recommendations like training greeters on deescalation techniques, evaluating vulnerabilities in their buildings and pursuing grants to provide new resources for security.

In 2005, Congress authorized the federal Nonprofit Security Grant Program. This year, they allocated $675 million to the program -- more than 20 times the amount they gave originally.

Mosques in the Chicago area are also taking precautionary steps ahead of Oct 7. In September, the Council on American-Islamic Relations called for an investigation after the discovery of what appeared to be bullet holes at the Muslim Community Center, one of the city's oldest mosques.

""Other suburbs of Chicago are a little bit luckier just because they might have really large Muslim populations or have sometimes better relationships with police,"" said Maggie Slavin, operations manager at CAIR-Chicago. ""But I know in the city of Chicago, getting CPD to work with us has been extremely challenging.""

CAIR works with more than 30 mosques in the Chicago area. According to Slavin, local Muslims generally do not feel that police follow through on their requests for extra help.

""A lot of people would like to see some added layer, and so we're kind of turning to private security because we were not able to always get in with local police departments and get them to take us seriously,"" Slavin said.

The Chicago Police Department declined a request for an interview. In a statement, the CPD told NPR, ""As always, we are monitoring all activity and while there is no actionable intelligence at this time, we will have an increased police presence to ensure the city's faith communities are not only safe, but feel safe.""

As the conflict in the Middle East escalates, the Orthodox Union's Diament said he sees the safety of all faith communities as connected.

""Every group has to enjoy that religious freedom and be able to exercise their faith without fear,"" Diament said. ""If one group has their religious freedom threatened, then it's really undermining the principle of religious freedom for people."""

Mark Schiefelbein/AP hide caption

Vice President Harris plans to meet briefly on Friday with a group of Arab Americans in Flint, Mich., before she rallies supporters there.

The meeting comes as her campaign works to build support with Arab Americans who have been frustrated with the Biden administration's response to the ongoing war in Gaza and the expanding conflict into Lebanon.

The key swing state of Michigan has one of the largest Arab American populations in the country.

A poll published this week by the Arab American Institute found Harris and her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, at roughly even levels of support among Arab Americans. In recent years, the group had favored Democrats by large margins.

""In our 30 years of polling Arab American voters, we have not witnessed anything like the role that the war on Gaza is having on voter behavior,"" said James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, in a statement.

Yesterday, the Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz spoke to a Muslim group focused on getting out the vote activities. And earlier this week, Harris' national security adviser Phil Gordon met virtually with Muslim and Arab community leaders to reiterate that the Biden administration is working to bring about a cease-fire."
Israeli airstrikes cut off a key crossing between Lebanon and Syria,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/g-s1-26287/israeli-airstrikes-lebanon-syria-crossing,2024-10-04T07:56:14Z,"BEIRUT -- Israel carried out a series of massive airstrikes overnight in southern suburbs of Beirut and another that cut off the main border crossing between Lebanon and Syria.

The new wave of strikes came after Israel warned people to evacuate communities in southern Lebanon that are outside a United Nations-declared buffer zone, as the yearlong conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah escalates.

Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon on Tuesday and its forces have been clashing with Hezbollah militants in a narrow strip along the border. A series of attacks before the incursion killed some of the group's key members, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah.

The blasts overnight rocked Beirut's southern suburbs, sending huge plumes of smoke and flames into the night sky and shaking buildings kilometers (miles) away in the Lebanese capital. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on what the intended target was, and there was no information immediately available on casualties.

Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that there were more than 10 consecutive airstrikes in the area late Thursday.

The agency also reported that an Israeli airstrike led to the closure of the road near the busy Masnaa Border Crossing, from which tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. It gave no other details.

The airstrike that cut the busiest border crossing between the two countries came a day after an Israeli military spokesperson said Lebanon's Hezbollah has been trying to transport military equipment through the border crossing.

Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weaponry from Iran via Syria. The group has a presence on both sides of the border, a region where it has been fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces.

Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles, damaging the road between Masnaa Border Crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous.

It was the first time this major border crossing has been cut off since the beginning of the war. Lebanese General Security recorded 256,614 Syrian citizens and 82,264 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory between Sept. 23 -- when the Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon -- and Sept. 30.

There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanon's minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across Lebanon's southern border almost daily since the day after Hamas' cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, in which the militants killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage.

Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it carried out a strike Thursday in Tulkarem, a militant stronghold in the West Bank, in coordination with the Shin Bet internal security service.

The Palestinian Health Ministry said 18 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a refugee camp there.

Violence has flared across the Israeli-occupied territory since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October 2023. Tulkarem and other northern cities have seen some of the worst violence.

Israel declared war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip in response to their Oct. 7 attack. More than 41,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in that time, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry."

Israel says Iran launched more than 180 missiles but that the assault did little damage. MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP via Getty Images/AFP hide caption

Iran's strike on Israel appears to have been more effective at reaching its targets than an attack in April of this year.

Videos posted to social media and geolocated by NPR and the online investigations group Bellingcat show multiple warheads landing around two Israeli air bases: Nevatim Airbase in the south of the country and Tel Nof Airbase in central Israel. One video filmed near Tel Nof also appeared to show possible secondary explosions, indicating that ammunition or fuel may have been struck by a missile.

Videos also showed warheads landing in northern Tel Aviv, near the headquarters of Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad. Those warheads appear to have missed their target, and did not inflict any real damage. One video showed a large crater around 500 yards from the spy agency's headquarters.

Experts say the attack was somewhat more successful than the one in April of this year, which was almost completely neutralized by Israeli and American air defenses.

""It looks like more missiles seem to be hitting targets in Israel this time around,"" says Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. That could be in part because ""the Iranians seem to be using newer, more sophisticated missiles.""

US Calls Strikes ""Ineffective""

Both the U.S. and Israel downplayed the strikes. ""This attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,"" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a briefing Tuesday. The U.S. said it had fired about a dozen interceptors from warships in an effort to blunt the Iranian assault.

According to reports in the Israeli media, the military acknowledged that the strike had damaged ""several"" airbases. However it said that no aircraft had been destroyed. Israeli media reported that the attacks had mainly damaged maintenance areas and office buildings.

An Israel Defense Forces spokesperson declined to comment to NPR on casualties or damage resulting from the strike. The Israeli military spokesperson, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said in a briefing on the social media platform X that, ""We don't want to tip off Iran... Our air force and air force bases remain operational.""

Although the strike may have been limited in the damage it caused, it was a clear challenge to Israel's much-vaunted air defense systems. Israel's main system, called Iron Dome, has proven incredibly effective rockets from nearby adversaries like the militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. Iron Dome uses relatively cheap interceptor missiles together with state-of-the-art radars and high-speed computing to quickly determine which incoming missiles pose a threat. It only takes shots at the ones it determines are falling in populated areas.

Better missiles and more of them

But ballistic missiles from Iran travel much higher and faster than those fired from nearby Lebanon and Gaza. The missiles fly briefly into space before coming down on their targets near or at hypersonic speeds. Israel has a separate missile defense system known as Arrow, which is capable of intercepting missiles near or in space, but Arrow has fewer interceptors than Iron Dome.

When Iran attacked Israel in April, it used around 100 ballistic missiles in conjunction with roughly 200 low flying drones and cruise missiles, according to Yehoshua Kalisky, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv, Israel. The drones and cruise missiles were shot down easily by fighter jets, leaving the missiles for Arrow, he says.

This time, Iran launched around 180 ballistic missiles, putting more strain on the Arrow system. ""The job for the Arrow was much easier [in April],"" he says.

Moreover, images of the missiles being fired out of Iran, together with pictures of debris that fell in Israel, suggests more sophisticated ballistic missiles were used, Lewis says.

In the April attack, Lewis says Iran used primarily liquid-fueled missiles that were relatively inaccurate. Half of the missiles fell more than a half mile from their targets. ""It's pretty hard to destroy something with that level of accuracy,"" he says.

In this latest attack, Iran used new solid-propellant missiles that are more accurate, he says. Lewis and other researchers say at least some of the missiles used appear to be Iran's newest design, the Fattah, a medium-range ballistic missile that may have a degree of maneuverability as it enters the atmosphere, allowing it to alter course and avoid interceptor missiles.

Lewis says he believes Iran's latest strike was designed to show some restraint. The warheads fell primarily on air bases which may have been used in last week's attacks on Hezbollah's leadership, he points out. ""It's very typical to see Iranians pick military targets that are linked to the military strike that they're responding to,"" he says.

The strike also appeared to largely avoid civilian areas. The only publicly acknowledged death from the attack so far was a Palestinian man in the West Bank who was apparently struck by a falling missile body. A school in central Israel was also hit, though no casualties were reported.

Despite the attempt to control escalation, Israel is likely to respond with force, says Tom Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Following the April attack, Israel knocked out an air defense radar near Iran's nuclear facilities in Natanz, he points out. That limited attack was designed to send a message: ""The Israelis can penetrate Iranian airspace, they've demonstrated that time and time again,"" he says. ""They can bring the hurt to Iran.""

Israel's military spokesperson Peter Lerner suggested that it would only be a matter of time before the nation struck back directly against Iran. ""One ballistic missile is an unacceptable reality for any sovereign state,"" he told reporters. ""One hundred and eighty means there will be consequences."""
VP debate: JD Vance and Tim Walz face off tonight. Here's how to watch and when,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/live-updates/jd-vance-tim-walz-debate-2024,2024-10-01T21:58:31Z,"One question likely on the minds of many people watching tonight's faceoff: Who is this for?

National polls show a tight race between Trump and Harris, suggesting the race will come down to voters in a handful of swing states -- depending on who they vote for or whether they vote at all.

And as NPR's Domenico Montanaro reports, only a ""tiny slice"" of the electorate -- from 6% to the low teens -- is considered persuadable.

In NPR's own polling, there have been nearly four dozen undecided voters in the last four months who gave their permission to be contacted.

Montanaro spoke with 10 of them in the days after the Harris-Trump debate, and detailed their reflections here.

""The debate was important for Harris. Most who watched said she performed better than Trump. They were not all moved to vote for her as a result, but four who seemed to need a degree of reassurance about Harris are now voting for her or leaning Harris' direction after the debate.

And while undecided voters often have unique reasons for what influences their votes, there was a clear gender divide. All four who say they are now voting for or leaning toward Harris are women. That also reflects the wide gender gap seen in polls between the candidates.

The other six -- one woman and five men -- were a mix. Five said they likely won't be voting for Harris, most citing the economy or immigration as reasons. One other said he is still truly undecided, but said prices are a major concern.

Two are leaning toward Trump; another said she aligns more with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.; a self-described progressive said he doesn't like Harris' stance on the war in Gaza; and one other, a conservative, said he might not vote at all.""

One thing the group had in common? Many did not want their names used, citing security concerns in the current political climate."
Lebanon's government urges international community for support amid Israel's invasion,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5134606/lebanon-israel-invasion-hezbollah-international-support,2024-10-01T16:07:04Z,"A man documents destroyed buildings at the site of an Israeli airstrike in Beirut's southern suburb, Lebanon, on Tuesday.

Lebanese politicians urgently called on the international community to pressure Israel to stop its advance into Lebanese territory on Tuesday, as Israeli troops crossed into southern Lebanon in an operation targeting Hezbollah outposts.

Lebanon's caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, warned on Tuesday that his country was facing ""one of the most dangerous phases of its history,"" urging the United Nations for emergency funding for civilians impacted by the conflict.

Imran Riza, the U.N's deputy special coordinator in Lebanon, said the country was seeking $426 million in U.N. assistance.

""As violence escalates, we call on the global community to provide this much needed support and to ensure protection of civilians,"" Riza said. ""Without sufficient resources, humanitarians risk leaving the population of an entire country without the support they urgently require.""

Israeli airstrikes have killed more than 1,000 people in Lebanon over the last two weeks, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The U.N. says around 1 million people -- nearly a fifth of the country -- have been displaced from their homes while fleeing this bombardment.

Israel's offensive follows days of intensifying fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Lebanese militant group.

The conflict entered a dramatic new phase over the weekend, following Israel's killing of Hezbollah's longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, as well as several other top officials.

And now Israel says it is running a ""limited"" incursion of ""targeted ground raids"" in southern Lebanon aimed at Hezbollah militants that pose a threat to communities in northern Israel. Israeli authorities say about 63,000 Israelis remain displaced from the border area with Lebanon due to Hezbollah rocket fire.

Israel used similar wording about limited raids at the start of its invasion of the Gaza Strip following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, and the Israeli invasion of Gaza has since expanded and continued to grind on one year later. So Israel's latest comments have raised skepticism in Lebanon about the actual scope of the operation.

""This is not an incursion, this is an invasion,"" Najat Aoun Saliba, a Lebanese member of parliament, told NPR. ""We've been invaded by another country and we have to call on the international community to call it as such.""

Saliba urged world leaders to call on Israel to put an immediate end to its military offensive in Lebanon.

""We definitely keep saying violence cannot stop violence. We need diplomatic efforts to stop the violence,"" Saliba said. ""We don't want Lebanon to also turn into another Gaza.""

Israel and Hezbollah began trading attacks back and forth across the Israel-Lebanon border after the Oct. 7 assault on Israel led by the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

In support of Hamas, Hezbollah says it will continue firing rockets into northern Israel until there's a cease-fire in Israel's military campaign in Gaza."
"Iran is poised to attack Israel, officials say, fueling Mideast turmoil",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25707/iran-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-attack,2024-10-01T15:31:01Z,"Iran is poised to launch airstrikes against Israel, two senior U.S. officials say, following Israel's killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon last week.

A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss security issues, said there are indications Iran is preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack.

""We are actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack. A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran,"" the official said.

The threat builds on tension across the region, as Israel fights with Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and continues its war in Gaza against Hamas -- both groups backed by Iran.

Israel on Monday began a ground invasion into southern Lebanon. The Israeli military said it is targeting Hezbollah militants. The Israeli offensive follows days of intensifying fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon have killed more than 1,000 people in less than two weeks and forced many civilians to flee their homes, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The strikes have targeted Hezbollah and its weapons, killing Nasrallah and several top officials, but they have also killed many civilians.

Iran attacked Israel in April with over 300 drones and missiles, but nearly all of the weapons were intercepted by Israel and its allies, including the United States. A few missiles did cause some damage. A 7-year-old girl was severely injured and a military base in southern Israel suffered minor damage, according to Israeli officials."

The Israeli military pressed its ground incursion into southern Lebanon on Tuesday, calling the operations ""limited incursions"" targeting Hezbollah militants.

The military said late Monday when it began its operations that it is aimed at Hezbollah targets that pose an immediate threat to communities in northern Israel. The incursion follows Friday's airstrike that killed longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.

The operation, approved by political and security officials, involves ground raids by Israeli commandos against Hezbollah targets and infrastructure in villages in southern Lebanon. The Israeli air force and artillery troops are providing back up to the ground forces.

The Israeli military has closed off the area of three Israeli towns near the border with southeast Lebanon. Israeli authorities say about 63,000 Israelis remain displaced from the border area with Lebanon due to Hezbollah rocket fire, and the U.N. says about one million Lebanese have been displaced from their homes fleeing Israeli airstrikes.

An Israeli security official, speaking anonymously, told NPR that Israeli troops have entered Lebanon targeting Hezbollah military compounds close to the border. The official said the military is ""acting in a limited area focusing on the villages right by the border. Some homes are 100 meters from the border, some dozens of meters from the border, and some hundreds of meters from the border."" The official said that a ground incursion into Beirut is ""not on the table.""

On Tuesday an IDF spokesperson asked residents of a number of villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate and move north of the Awali river.

On Monday, Hezbollah's deputy leader, Naim Kassem, said in a televised address that ""the resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement."" That was despite a series of devastating Israeli attacks on Hezbollah leaders and members in recent weeks.

The Lebanese army had moved back from some checkpoints at the southern border with Israel amid intense artillery shelling by Israeli forces. A Lebanese army official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly, told NPR this was a ""redeployment"" from forward positions vulnerable to an Israeli incursion.

A White House official told NPR the U.S. supports the incursion but is warning Israel about ""mission creep."" The Israeli ambassador to the U.S. told Israeli public radio the U.S. has not restricted the duration of Israel's incursion but that it is concerned about a regional escalation.

A senior U.S. official told NPR that the Pentagon will send a ""few thousand"" more troops to the Middle East, focused on air defense capabilities.

The Israeli offensive follows days of intensifying fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Israeli strikes across Lebanon have killed more than 1,000 people in less than two weeks and forced many to flee their homes, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The strikes have targeted Hezbollah and its weapons, killing leader Hassan Nasrallah and several top officials, but they have also killed many civilians.

Israel and Hezbollah began trading attacks back and forth across the Israel-Lebanon border after the Oct. 7 assault on Israel led by the Palestinian militant group Hamas. In support of Hamas, Hezbollah says it will continue firing rockets into northern Israel until there's a cease-fire in Israel's military campaign in Gaza.

Israeli officials say that the goal of this incursion is to push Hezbollah back from the border, to create what they call a ""buffer zone."" Israel says it will keep targeting Hezbollah until Israeli residents can safely return to their homes in northern Israel after fleeing attacks from militants on the Lebanese side of the border.

The Israeli military is now engaged in warfare on multiple fronts. Israel's operation in Gaza continues with deadly strikes. On Sunday, Israel's military said it sent dozens of fighter jets more than 1,000 miles away to Yemen, where it said it bombed power plants and a seaport used by the Houthis to import oil for military purposes. The Houthis said the areas hit were civilian targets and that at least four people were killed and dozens wounded in the Israeli strikes.

Israeli security analysts said Israel's bombing campaign in Yemen was a message to Iran, showing Israel's long-range flight capability as a tacit warning to Iran that it, too, was within Israel's reach.

Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a warning Monday to Iran, which backs Hezbollah and Hamas: ""There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach.""

On Monday, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Israel's defense minister about the ""serious consequences for Iran"" if it launched a strike against Israel. The U.S. is concerned about Iran-backed groups threatening U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria as the conflict between Israel and Iran-backed groups intensifies. Defense secretary Austin said the U.S. supports Israel dismantling Hezbollah infrastructure along the Lebanon Israel border so Hezbollah cannot threaten Israeli border towns. But he called on Israel to ultimately pivot to diplomacy."

Israel began a series of attacks against the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah with pagers and walkie talkies that exploded. They then launched airstrikes targeting the group's leadership. One strike killed Hezbollah's leader of over thirty years, Hassan Nasrallah. The attacks are an effort to prevent Hezbollah from continuing to fire rockets at northern Israel, which it has been doing since the war in Gaza began. Israel's airstrikes are continuing to widen and their military is massing at the border, pointing to a possible ground invasion.

Israel conducts intel raids in southern Lebanon ahead of a possible ground invasion,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/nx-s1-5133463/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-invasion,2024-09-30T17:07:55Z,"TEL AVIV, Israel -- Israeli commandos are conducting limited intelligence-gathering raids inside southern Lebanon, and there are indications that Israel will be carrying out a limited ground incursion, a senior U.S. official told NPR.

""Everything is on the table,"" the official said about the possibility of a ground incursion, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the operation.

U.S. officials have estimated that Israel is not prepared for a major ground offensive inside Lebanon because its troops are stretched thin following a year of ground operations inside Gaza after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack.

Tamir Hayman, who served as the head of Israel's military intelligence directorate until 2021, said in an interview on Israeli Army Radio on Monday that Israel's airstrikes in Lebanon had successfully knocked Hezbollah off balance.

But he said Israel should decide soon whether to launch a ground invasion, and for what purpose: to create a permanent security buffer zone that Israel would occupy long term, with much international opposition, or only to remain temporarily to destroy Hezbollah infrastructure?

""Are we there in order to reach a deal and then leaving? Are we there in order to stay?"" Hayman said, referring to the choices Israel must make.

Hezbollah's acting leader, Naim Kassem, said the group's fighters are ready if Israel does launch a ground invasion into southern Lebanon, according to remarks reported by The Associated Press.

The senior U.S. official told NPR that the Pentagon will send a ""a few thousand"" more troops to the Middle East, focused on air defense capabilities.

The U.S. is concerned about retaliation to Israel's moves by Iran and Iranian-supported militias in the region. Such a retaliation could threaten U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria.

Israel's conflict with the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen is also intensifying.

On Saturday, the Houthis, the main military group in Yemen, launched a ballistic missile toward central Israel, saying it was targeting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's airplane returning from addressing the United Nations General Assembly in New York.

Netanyahu landed in Israel shortly before air raid sirens wailed at the airport and throughout central Israel. The Israeli military said it intercepted the missile midair.

On Sunday, Israel's military said it sent dozens of fighter jets and refueling aircraft more than 1,000 miles away to Yemen, where it said it bombed power plants and a seaport used by the Houthis to import oil for military purposes. The Houthis said the areas hit were civilian targets and that at least four people were killed and dozens wounded in the Israeli strikes.

An NPR investigation: A murder in Hebron,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/g-s1-17637/hebron-west-bank-israel-asylum-ahmad-abu-markhiya,2024-09-30T10:05:03Z,"Note: This story contains graphic descriptions of violence.

HEBRON, West Bank -- Around sunset on Oct. 5, 2022, two 24-year-old men drank tea on a terrace overlooking the hills of their ancient holy city. The evening ended with one of them decapitated and the other under arrest.

Palestinian law enforcement officers in Hebron, the largest Palestinian city in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, say they have witnessed many crime scenes, but never one with a severed head. The city's historical core -- a militarized zone with Palestinians, Israeli settlers and the tomb of the patriarch Abraham, revered by them both -- has seen some of the ugliest violence and injustices of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but that was not this story.

Images of the crime scene quickly spread on social media, as did the suspect's last name. A mall and butcher shop belonging to the suspect's extended family were vandalized. ""A horrific crime,"" read one Palestinian news headline. The Palestinian police called it a ""new type of crime to be seen in the Palestinian areas."" A Palestinian talk show asked the victim's cousin what happened. ""This thing,"" he said, ""cannot be discussed in the media.""

In Israel, news of the murder was reported very differently. ""Kidnapped to the Palestinian Authority territories and murdered because of his sexual orientation,"" read one Israeli report. ""A bloody reminder of the LGBTQ situation in the Palestinian Authority,"" read another.

Ahmad Abu Markhiya was among a rare group of Palestinians from the West Bank granted the temporary right to live in Israel: those deemed to face threats to their lives because they are gay.

His gruesome murder received international attention and then faded from headlines. During the Gaza war, it has come to light again. Pro-Israel campaigns have cited his killing as an example of Palestinian savagery. Pro-Palestinian advocates say Israel weaponizes gay rights to distract from its actions in Gaza.

A one-and-a-half-year NPR investigation into the life and murder of Abu Markhiya -- drawing from police files, court documents and more than 40 interviews in Israel and the West Bank -- reveals a far more complex web of circumstances surrounding the killing than has previously been reported.

This is the story of a man in search of home, caught between two societies that never fully granted him one. For some, his murder was to be weighed against the shame he caused in life. For others, his murder robbed him of the chance to extricate himself from a society that refused him dignity and freedom.

Our investigation traces the victim's escape from the West Bank to Israel, probes the mystery of what drew him back and identifies his accused killer for the first time. It also explores the parallel justice systems -- official and traditional -- that have examined his murder but have yet to resolve it.

Two years -- and one war -- later, justice remains deferred for Ahmad Abu Markhiya.

It was the spring of 2021, a year and a half before his murder, when Abu Markhiya sent a Facebook message asking for help.

Rita Petrenko answered it. At the time, she ran The Different House, an Israeli nonprofit organization advocating on behalf of LGBTQ+ Palestinians seeking safety in Israel. Homosexuality is largely shunned in Palestinian society. Palestinians contacted her to say they were fleeing life-threatening persecution from their families, and she helped them secure official papers to stay in Israel.

Abu Markhiya told her he had been on the run from city to city in the West Bank for more than a year, ever since his uncle caught him being intimate with another young man, and men in his family beat him. (His family denies it threatened him.)

He told Petrenko he fled to the streets of Hebron, then to the West Bank cities of Beitunia, Ramallah and Tulkarem, as men in his family pursued him. He told her a relative opened fire on his car, so he took the risk of slipping through Israel's network of concrete walls, wire fences and military checkpoints -- built after a wave of Palestinian bombings in Israel two decades ago and designed to control Palestinian entry into Israel. Then he slept in a Tel Aviv parking lot for two weeks.

In a previous life in her native Russia, Petrenko worked for the police, training dogs to detect clues at crime scenes, so she considered herself a good lie detector. She believed there were some Palestinians who pretended to be gay to seek asylum abroad -- and others who were indeed gay and fabricated threats from their family to gain access to Israel and live a freer life. But Abu Markhiya's story struck her as credible. It didn't seem likely he would suffer weeks on the streets to back up a false story. ""That's not a life worth making something up for,"" she said.

Palestinians and Israelis who knew him say there was no doubt he was gay.

Petrenko submitted Abu Markhiya's testimony to the Israeli defense unit that grants Palestinians permits, and officers summoned him to an interview at a military facility. They concluded that sending him back to the West Bank would put him at risk.

But Israel would not grant him permanent asylum as a Palestinian. Historically, Israel has granted non-Jews asylum only in rare cases. It is especially opposed to an influx of Palestinians. But over the years, Israel has taken in Palestinians who spied for Israeli security agencies and needed cover, and in the last few years, it has granted protection to a couple of hundred Palestinians facing threats to their lives in the West Bank because of their gender or sexuality.

Israel granted Abu Markhiya a temporary residency permit, on condition that he apply for resettlement abroad through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. On June 1, 2021, Petrenko applied to the UNHCR on Abu Markhiya's behalf. She hoped Canada or Australia would accept him, as they had taken in Palestinian LGBTQ+ asylum-seekers in exceptional cases. But other categories of Palestinians seemed to be given priority, she said, like people with academic degrees and women facing immediate threats to their lives. (The UNHCR said it does not comment on individual resettlement requests.)

While Abu Markhiya waited for an answer, he lived in at-risk-youth shelters and worked restaurant jobs illegally. At the time, Israel would not grant LGBTQ+ Palestinians work permits or health care. Given their tenuous status, many gay Palestinian asylum-seekers were coerced by their circumstances into sex work. Israeli welfare programs offered them -- including Abu Markhiya -- housing and rehabilitation programs to escape sexual exploitation, said Asma Alssaad, one of his shelter counselors.

In Israel, Abu Markhiya chose the nickname Esso. Alssaad said it was Arabic for Esau, the grandson of Abraham in Islamic and Jewish tradition. ""Many young Palestinians who escape to Israel choose an alias for themselves. It serves the purpose of dividing between the life they used to have in the West Bank and the life they have in Israel. Of course, it's also for reasons of confidentiality,"" Alssaad said.

Israeli shelter volunteers said Abu Markhiya was more mature than other young residents. He was clean-shaven and well-groomed, and he kept his locker organized.

He had plans for his future.

""To rent a house with a friend. To be loved,"" said Maiyan Price Zohar, 28, his primary Israeli counselor at the shelter. ""He wanted to live.""

In the summer of 2022, an Israeli Supreme Court petition by human rights groups prompted Israel to grant work rights and health care to LGBTQ+ Palestinians with Israeli permits. By then, Abu Markhiya had been in Israel for a year. Israeli defense officials renewed his permit but sought answers from the UNHCR: How much longer would it take to resettle him abroad?

In late August 2022, Petrenko asked the UNHCR to expedite Abu Markhiya's request for resettlement. Out of all the Palestinians she represented, he had waited the longest. He was receiving threatening calls and was eager to move abroad.

Weeks later, Abu Markhiya was dead.

The day after his murder, his community of gay Palestinian asylum-seekers and their Israeli advocates held a small memorial ceremony in Tel Aviv. They lit candles arrayed to spell out his name, Ahmad, in Hebrew.

His counselors and friends at the shelter were distraught: How did he disappear from Israel to the Palestinian city of Hebron? They were certain he would have never gone willingly to the same city where he was under threat.

Many were convinced he was kidnapped or lured there, and all were convinced his killing was an anti-gay attack. But the Israeli police did not contact them to seek their testimony. They heard no word about any formal investigation, nor did they expect to. His Israeli counselors didn't think Israeli police would care about a murder of a Palestinian in the Palestinian territories, and they didn't think Palestinian police would bother to investigate the murder of a gay man.

""It's a black hole,"" said Ofir Zweigenbom, one of Abu Markhiya's Israeli counselors.

In the twilight zone between Abu Markhiya's conditional life in Israel and gruesome death in the West Bank, they thought there would never be answers.

What his supporters in Israel did not know was that the chief Palestinian prosecutor of Hebron was pressing charges against the suspected murderer.

In a gleaming new limestone courthouse funded by the Canadian government, Nashat Ayoush sat at a large desk dressed in a white shirt and tie, in front of framed photos of the late Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat and the current leader, Mahmoud Abbas.

Ayoush had spent his entire career in the Palestinian state prosecutor's office, part of the civil justice system set up in the 1990s, as Palestinians built the institutions they hoped would eventually form the core of a country independent from Israel.

He collected all the details of Abu Markhiya's murder -- witness testimony, the autopsy and a photo of the 24-year-old defendant taken shortly after his arrest -- in an orange file folder held together by a black cord, Criminal File 2725/2022.

The evening of the murder, according to a copy of the indictment obtained by NPR, a family of four heard a commotion outside the old stone house they were renting in Hebron. ""When they looked out of their window, a few meters from the crime scene, they saw the suspect stabbing the victim with a knife in his neck and then dragging him,"" the indictment says.

They called their landlord, Mohammed Abu Eisheh, a respected dentist who lived in a stately house next door. He rushed home from his dental clinic downtown and alerted police, who arrived moments later. They found a young man standing under an oak tree next to a decapitated body. ""Upon seeing the police, he attempted to flee but was arrested, his hands and clothes stained with blood,"" the indictment says.

It was the dentist's son, Anas Abu Eisheh. The crime took place in his backyard. ""We caught him red-handed,"" Ayoush said.

A trail of blood ran from a storage room attached to the stone house, where the victim was killed, to the side of a hill under the oak tree some 20 yards away, where Anas Abu Eisheh had dragged the body and tried to hide it, according to the indictment.

The cause of death, according to the autopsy report reviewed by NPR, was 10 stab wounds to the chest and lower neck. Only after he died had he been beheaded.

""It was a shock for us,"" Ayoush said.

As news reports spread about a gay Palestinian murder case in Hebron, officials from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights raised the case with Ayoush, and a U.S. diplomat inquired with the Palestinian Authority's attorney general. The Palestinian Authority has long been scrutinized for lax prosecution of family violence against women and girls. A gruesome anti-LGBTQ+ killing would be a stain on the Palestinian leadership, which was reliant on international support.

""We explained to them that our investigations did not indicate any link between his being gay and the murder,"" Ayoush said. In fact, Ayoush said, the question of the victim's sexuality never came up in the Palestinian police interrogations, despite all the press reports alleging Abu Markhiya had faced anti-gay threats in the West Bank. Homosexuality is taboo in the West Bank's traditional Palestinian society, but it is not outlawed, he told us repeatedly.

Documented anti-gay killings are rare in the West Bank. LGBTQ+ advocates say some killings are framed as accidents. Others are shrouded in accusations of treason. Six months after Abu Markhiya's murder, a 23-year-old Palestinian was killed by militants who accused him of spying for Israel. In a purported confession video, he claimed Israeli agents blackmailed him with video footage of him having sex with another man.

In 2014, an anonymous group of former Israeli intelligence officers said they were instructed to extort gay Palestinians to spy for Israel or be exposed.

In 2019, after years of quiet activism, the Palestinian queer group alQaws staged a public demonstration in Haifa, a city in Israel with a large progressive Arab community, to protest the stabbing of a gay teenage Palestinian citizen of Israel. Weeks later, Palestinian police banned the queer group from holding events in the West Bank, saying it violated Palestinian values.

The Palestinian activist community saw this public struggle as progress; there were other countries in the region that had no queer organizing at all.

But then the community faced a setback in the months before Abu Markhiya's murder. Vigilantes in the West Bank attacked a venue hosting an openly gay Palestinian singer and disrupted a march perceived to be associated with the gay community. Palestinian police failed to prosecute the suspects. The Palestinian LGBTQ+ activist community has maintained a low profile ever since. No queer organization in the West Bank issued a statement about Abu Markhiya's murder.

The chairman of the Palestinian Psychiatric Association, Dr. Tawfiq Salman, has counseled West Bank families whose children have come out as gay in recent years. ""I'm convincing the families how to accept their sons, their daughters, as they are,"" he said. ""They have to deal without violence."" He said one client said he was moving his family to the U.S. to protect his gay son from repercussions from his community.

In our conversations with Abu Eisheh, he did not deny his son Anas, a law student at Hebron University, killed Abu Markhiya. But he said the killing had nothing to do with homosexuality. He said that his son, a longtime friend of Abu Markhiya, was mentally ill -- and that Abu Markhiya was to blame.

A few years prior, he said, Abu Markhiya had given Anas drugs, which he claimed induced schizophrenia that his son was treated for with antipsychotics. Abu Eisheh said his son began engaging in violent outbursts against his family. He believes on the day of the murder, Abu Markhiya gave his son an illegal substance that interacted with his medicines, triggering a psychotic episode that resulted in the gruesome crime. His son told investigators he had no recollection of the killing.

NPR was unable to verify that Anas was being treated for mental illness at the time of the crime. Abu Eisheh provided two psychiatric reports citing his son's aggressive behavior and religious delusions about resembling an Islamic messianic figure, but one document was dated three years before the killing and the other, written at the request of the family, was dated three days after the murder.

Salman, the psychiatric association chairman, said some Palestinian murder suspects' families claim mental illness to protect the family's reputation and prevent revenge killings. Ayoush, the Hebron prosecutor, said the suspect's motive in this murder case was irrelevant.

""We have sufficient proof against him. ... We are not obliged by Palestinian law to search for the motive,"" Ayoush said. He said he was treating the case like any other. That was the essence of justice he was hoping to prove the Palestinian government would be able to pursue.

On March 29, 2023, the Palestinian public prosecutor charged Anas Abu Eisheh with premeditated murder. The prosecutor said it was a crime punishable by life imprisonment.

NPR attended a hearing at the Hebron First Instance Court on Sept. 6, 2023, five months into the proceedings. The courtroom was covered in sleek wooden paneling, and the judge sat high atop a raised bench. The mood was tense: Guards were spread throughout the room, separating the defendant's brother and the victim's cousin.

Abu Eisheh, handcuffed and flanked by more guards, was ushered into the defendant's glass cage. He stood tall and appeared attentive but showed no emotion. In a raised voice, the counsel for the prosecution read the charge against him.

Earlier that year, the defendant had been transferred from detention in Hebron to a Bethlehem psychiatric hospital for an examination. The judge had requested a psychiatric evaluation as to whether the defendant was aware of his actions at the time of the crime. The judge read aloud the hospital's response: It was inconclusive. The judge ordered the hospital to conduct a repeat psychiatric evaluation, and court was adjourned.

Outside the walls of the courthouse, a different kind of justice was being pursued.

Sheikh Walid Tawil sat in his downtown Hebron office wearing a brown shawl with gold embroidered trim, a red-and-white-checked keffiyeh headscarf and a thick gold and silver watch. In his hands he held a chunky chain of shiny wooden prayer beads. He is a member of the Tawil tribe, one of 176 tribes or family clans present in Hebron. The 52-year-old sheikh leads an ultrareligious Islamic life -- four wives, 20 children -- and is a central figure in a parallel justice system of community reconciliation called sulh.

The tradition, practiced since before the creation of modern Palestinian criminal courts, centers on the asha'er, the family clans that play powerful roles in Palestinian society. Crimes between individuals become disputes between families. The goal is to prevent retaliation, assign responsibility, restore civil peace and reintroduce the offending family back into society.

Four days after Abu Markhiya's murder, Tawil presided over a large mediation ceremony as the representative of the defendant's family. Another sheikh, Fayez Al-Rajabi, represented the victim's family.

The two men brokered the traditional one-year atwa -- a written admission of guilt and a truce to prevent a blood feud between the families. The defendant's family paid the victim's family the standard compensation of 100,000 Jordanian dinars, the equivalent of about $141,000 -- a sum pegged to the currency of Jordan, which ruled the West Bank before Israel occupied it. The two families agreed to hold negotiations to determine whether the victim's family was owed any more money, in order to reach a final reconciliation before the truce expired a year later on Oct. 9, 2023.

Unlike the Palestinian civil justice system, which played down the question of homosexuality in this murder case, the traditional system appeared to place it front and center.

""Gays have no rights in society, religion or family,"" Tawil told us. The Quran condemns sex between men, according to traditional readings of the text, and some sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad prescribe the death penalty for it, but Islamic scholars have debated the topic for centuries.

Tawil was not suggesting that Abu Markhiya was killed because of his sexuality. But proving that he was gay would be a mitigating circumstance for the perpetrator. It could compel the victim's family to drop any further demands for financial compensation and to reach a final resolution.

""We are an Islamic society in Hebron,"" the sheikh said. ""If the victim has a bad reputation, the reconciliation fee is less.""

Both Palestinian justice systems, official and traditional, seek to avoid strife between family clans. A compromise between the families is preferable. Whatever the families decide in the traditional arbitration process affects the sentencing in the official criminal case. With a homicide, a family reconciliation agreement can reduce a prison sentence by a third, according to Ayoush, the prosecutor.

The first time we met, Abu Eisheh, the defendant's father, welcomed us into his dental clinic in downtown Hebron. He sat behind his desk wearing blue scrubs. The wall next to him was covered in diplomas and certificates.

He did not condone the murder. But it was a family feud to resolve, and rumors about the victim's sexuality gave the defendant's family the advantage.

""When the event took place, everyone denounced it and were very upset with the event, with Anas,"" his father said.

That changed when the Israeli media reported that Abu Markhiya was a gay asylum-seeker.

""The Israeli media provided us with a free service and broadcasted videos and broadcasted reports that the boy was gay. Within 24 hours ... the entire public opinion flipped from being against Anas to being with Anas. The pressure let up on us a lot, as a family,"" Abu Eisheh said.

He let out a small laugh.

""If we prove that Ahmad is gay, the problem will resolve more easily,"" Abu Eisheh explained. He said the victim's family ""will try to finish the issue quickly because this would be considered a shame for the family.""

On the outskirts of Hebron, on the side of a scraggly mound and up a set of exposed concrete steps, is the small home of Awatef Abu Markhiya, Ahmad Abu Markhiya's mother. His father died some years ago, and she remarried. She has the same angular jaw and almond-shaped eyes as her late son.

Her family advised her not to speak about her son's murder. Whatever she said could prejudice the reconciliation negotiations.

""Ahmad had a very, very good heart,"" she said. She cried, describing a beloved son, and repeatedly denied he was gay.

""We know he was not gay,"" Al-Rajabi, the Abu Markhiya family's arbitrator in the mediation, told us. ""We don't have homosexuality in Hebron. This is Abraham's city.""

Why did Abu Markhiya return to the city he had fled?

""I know the whole story from the beginning to the end,"" a man in his early 20s from Hebron told NPR in the summer of 2023.

This young man was both a friend of the victim and a relative of the defendant. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is also gay and had run away from home after the murder, afraid of being targeted for his sexuality.

He said Abu Markhiya had been haunted by a case of blackmail from the time he fled to Israel until the end of his life.

He said there was a man in Hebron who had pursued Abu Markhiya for sex and threatened to release an intimate photo of him. Abu Markhiya knew the man personally and complained to the police three weeks before fleeing to Israel, and he filed an additional complaint against the alleged blackmailer several months later, according to police records reviewed by NPR.

In a phone interview with NPR, the alleged blackmailer, whom NPR is not naming due to possible repercussions against him given the intense taboos in the West Bank against homosexuality, said he was detained and denied the allegations, and he said that his family convinced Abu Markhiya to withdraw the complaint a few weeks before his murder.

Abu Markhiya arrived in Hebron. His family said that he was there to seek Palestinian health insurance coverage for a work-related injury (at the time, it was still difficult for gay Palestinian asylum-seekers to access Israeli health care) and that he intended to withdraw his police complaint (though the Hebron prosecutor's office said he did not end up withdrawing it). He told his family he needed to settle his affairs because he planned to move abroad. His advocate in Israel -- Rita Petrenko -- had asked the U.N. to expedite his resettlement request.

Hours before the murder, the young man said he saw Abu Markhiya: He had gotten a haircut in downtown Hebron. Then he went to meet Abu Eisheh.

The young man said that Abu Eisheh had also been pursuing Abu Markhiya, wanting to be in an intimate relationship together and promising to protect him, but that Abu Markhiya refused.

It remains unclear why the two met that evening and what compelled the killer to murder and behead Abu Markhiya. The accused killer's family denies that Abu Eisheh is gay or that his relationship to the victim was more than just friendship.

But what compelled Abu Markhiya to return to the city he had escaped appears to have been the hope of tying up loose ends and getting a fresh start.

On Oct. 7, 2023, almost exactly one year after Abu Markhiya's murder, Hamas carried out the deadliest single attack on Israelis in history, and Israel began its deadliest Gaza offensive in history.

In the global debate over the Gaza war, LGBTQ+ rights have taken center stage. Groups like Queers for Palestine have been a fixture at anti-war rallies, accusing Israel of embracing gay rights to ""pinkwash"" war crimes.

Israel's advocates have fired back, criticizing queer protesters for condemning Israel rather than Hamas Islamists, who reject gay rights. ""Some of these protesters hold up signs proclaiming gays for Gaza,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a joint meeting of U.S. Congress in July. ""They might as well hold up signs saying 'Chickens for KFC.'""

Abu Markhiya's story has been resurrected in this firestorm by pro-Israel campaigns online. One of them, Queer in Gaza, cites his killing and states: ""Protect LGBT Palestinians. Only Israel does.""

During the war, Israel revoked all Palestinians' permits in Israel, citing security concerns. In a survey of 73 Palestinian LGBTQ+ asylum-seekers, conducted three months into the war by the Association for LGBTQ Equality in Israel, most said they lost their jobs, were assaulted and were arrested. Some said they were also deported to the West Bank. Human rights groups intervened, and Israel reversed the deportations of protected LGBTQ+ Palestinians.

The war also brought sweeping Israeli crackdowns to the West Bank, putting the Abu Markhiya murder proceedings into a deep freeze.

About six months had passed since Abu Eisheh was charged with premediated murder for the killing and beheading of Abu Markhiya. Ayoush, the Hebron prosecutor heading up the case, could not reach his own courthouse for a month due to Israeli roadblocks. (He was later reassigned to another role in the justice system and is no longer on the case.) Lawyers were kept waiting hours at Israeli checkpoints when traveling from one city to another. The Palestinian Bar Association went on strike for six months due to the movement restrictions. Neither the accused murderer nor his lawyer appeared at court hearings during that time.

The court proceedings are still dragging on, with no progress a year and a half after they began. Abu Eisheh remains in a Hebron detention center, where he is allowed weekly family visits. Whether due to a high sensitivity around this murder, incompetence, indifference or some other reason, the Bethlehem psychiatric hospital has not heeded repeated court requests to submit an evaluation of the defendant and whether he is fit to stand trial. In May, the director of the hospital told NPR, ""We will contact the court soon.""

To this day, it has not submitted its evaluation.

While the official West Bank criminal justice system was paralyzed at the start of the Gaza war, the traditional justice system thrived. Fresh tragedies sidelined older ones, and families resolved pending disputes. The war offered an opportunity to put the Abu Markhiya murder case to rest as well.

The atwa, the truce between the Abu Markhiya and Abu Eisheh families, had expired on Oct. 9, 2023, two days into the war. On Oct. 16, the Abu Eisheh family paid a visit to the Abu Markhiya family home. They asked the victim's family to reconcile, but the victim's family demanded more money as compensation for the murder. The two sides agreed to convene a council of city dignitaries to reach a final reconciliation, saq al-sulh, by January 2024.

That committee has never convened.

Sheikh Tawil, the Abu Eisheh family's arbitrator, was not concerned. He was confident the Abu Markhiya family would not seek revenge or more money. He was convinced by the documents attesting to the defendant's mental illness, and he held up his phone to show us Israeli news articles that identified the victim as gay and photos of the memorial candles in Tel Aviv spelling out his name, Ahmad, in Hebrew.

""This of course in our society is completely forbidden. We cannot allow any homosexual person to have any kind of rights in society,"" he said.

The arbitrator for the Abu Markhiya family insists the case remains unsettled. But convening a council of city dignitaries would only resurface the central question of the unresolved case -- whether Abu Markhiya was gay. Answering that question could risk the family's reputation by association. It also would weaken the family's ability to make further claims for accountability for their son's murder.

By this logic, in Hebron's communal justice system, the scales are now balanced.

""Ahmad deserves accountability and he deserves dignity,"" said Sa'ed Atshan, an associate professor at Swarthmore College and a Palestinian LGBTQ+ human rights advocate who authored a book on queer Palestinians and has been following the murder case. ""What a travesty. He was so close to freedom.""

One spring evening, several months into the war, Abu Eisheh walked across his rocky backyard to the old stone house where the murder took place. An Israeli warplane rumbled in the sky; Hebron is a short distance from Gaza.

It was sunset, around the same time his son drank tea with Abu Markhiya on the terrace before the stabbing. From there, the young men had looked out onto an expansive view of the hilly city.

On the horizon were the onion domes of Hebron's Russian Orthodox church, the city's only surviving church. Thousands of years ago, according to tradition, the patriarch Abraham came to the city and pitched his tent near an oak tree that still stands on the church grounds.

A much younger oak tree marks the spot where the victim's head and body were found. He was buried in the center of Hebron, not far from the tomb of Abraham.

Nearly two years have passed since Ahmad Abu Markhiya was killed. His mother, Awatef, still denies he was gay. She still does not know why he was killed or whether the murder case will ever be laid to rest. She prays for justice of a different kind."
An airstrike hits a Beirut residential building as Israel expands attacks in Lebanon,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/g-s1-25396/israel-beirut-lebanon-hezbollah,2024-09-30T07:30:35Z,"JERUSALEM -- The first apparent Israeli airstrike on central Beirut in nearly a year of conflict leveled an apartment building early Monday. It came after Israel hit targets across Lebanon and killed dozens of people, as Hezbollah sustained heavy blows to its command structure, including the killing of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah.

The airstrike hit a multistory residential building, according to an Associated Press journalist at the scene. Videos showed ambulances and a crowd gathered near the building in a mainly Sunni district with a busy thoroughfare lined with shops.

A Palestinian leftist faction in Lebanon said three of its members were killed in the airstrike. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said in a statement early Monday that its military and security commanders in Lebanon, and a third member, were killed in the attack.

The group has not played a significant role in the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Shiite militant group Hezbollah.

An official with Lebanon's Civil Defense had earlier said that a member of the al-Jamaa al-Islamiya was killed in the strike and that 16 other people were wounded, but the Sunni militant group, which fights alongside Hezbollah, has not confirmed the death of any of its members.

Also early Monday, another strike killed a commander with the militant group Hamas, which has a presence in Lebanon's Palestinian refugee camps. Hamas said Fatah Sharif and his family were killed in an airstrike on the Al-Buss refugee camp in the southern port city of Tyre.

In the past week, Israel has frequently targeted Beirut's southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence -- including a major strike on Friday that killed Nasrallah -- but had not hit locations near the city center.

Israeli officials had no immediate comment.

Earlier, Hezbollah confirmed that Nabil Kaouk, the deputy head of its Central Council, was killed Saturday, making him the seventh senior Hezbollah leader killed in Israeli strikes in a little over a week. They include the group's founding members who had evaded death or detention for decades.

Hezbollah also confirmed that Ali Karaki, another senior commander, died in the strike that killed Nasrallah. Israel says at least 20 other Hezbollah militants were killed, including one in charge of Nasrallah's security detail.

The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least 105 people were killed around the country in airstrikes Sunday. Two strikes near the southern city of Sidon, about 45 kilometers (28 miles) south of Beirut, killed at least 32 people, the ministry said. Separately, Israeli strikes in the northern province of Baalbek Hermel killed 21 people and wounded at least 47.

Lebanese media reported dozens of strikes in the central, eastern and western Bekaa and in the south, besides strikes on Beirut. Israel says it targets militants, but the strikes have hit buildings where civilians were living and the death toll was expected to rise.

In a video of a strike in Sidon, verified by the AP, a building swayed before collapsing as neighbors filmed. One TV station called on viewers to pray for a family caught under the rubble, posting their pictures, as rescuers failed to reach them. The Lebanese Health Ministry reported at least 14 medics were killed over two days in the south.

President Joe Biden said Sunday that he would speak soon with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and believes that an all-out war in the Middle East must be avoided. ""It has to be,"" Biden told reporters at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware as he boarded Air Force One for Washington.

Meanwhile, wreckage from Friday's strike that killed Nasrallah was still smoldering. Smoke rose over the rubble as people flocked to the site, some to check on what was left of their homes and others to pay respects, pray or simply to see the destruction.

In response to the dramatic escalation in Israeli strikes on Lebanon, Hezbollah significantly increased its rocket attacks in the past week, from several dozen to several hundred daily, the Israeli military said. The attacks injured several people and caused damage, but most of the rockets and drones were intercepted by Israel's air defense systems or fell in open areas.

The army says its strikes have degraded Hezbollah's capabilities and the number of launches would be much higher if Hezbollah had not been hit.

Also on Sunday, the Israeli military said dozens of its aircraft struck Houthi targets in Yemen in response to a recent attack. The military said it targeted power plants and sea port facilities in the city of Hodeida.

The Houthis launched a ballistic missile attack toward Israel's Ben Gurion airport on Saturday when Netanyahu was arriving. The Houthi media office said the Israeli strikes hit the Hodeida and Rass Issa ports, along with two power plants in Hodeida city, a stronghold for the Iranian-backed rebels. The Houthi-run Health Ministry said the strikes killed four people and wounded 40 others.

The Houthis claimed they took precautionary measures ahead of the strikes, emptying oil stored in the ports, according to Nasruddin Ammer, deputy director of the Houthi media office. He said in a post on X that the strikes won't stop the rebels' attacks on shipping routes and on Israel.

Meanwhile, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Israel's airstrikes in Lebanon had ""wiped out"" Hezbollah's command structure, but he warned the group will work quickly to rebuild it.

""I think people are safer without him walking around,"" Kirby said of Nasrallah. ""But they will try to recover. We're watching to see what they do to try to fill this leadership vacuum. It's going to be tough. ... Much of their command structure has now been wiped out.""

Speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Kirby sidestepped questions about whether the Biden administration agrees with how the Israelis are targeting Hezbollah leaders. The White House continues to call on Israel and Hezbollah to agree to a 21-day temporary cease-fire floated by the U.S., France and other countries during the U.N. General Assembly last week.

A wave of Israeli airstrikes across large parts of Lebanon have killed more than 1,030 people -- including 156 women and 87 children -- in less than two weeks, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry.

Hundreds of thousands of people have been driven from their homes. The government estimates around 250,000 are in shelters, with three to four times as many staying with friends or relatives, or camping out on the streets.

Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group and political party backed by Iran, Israel's chief regional rival, rose to regional prominence after fighting a devastating monthlong war with Israel in 2006 that ended in a draw.

Kaouk was a veteran member of Hezbollah going back to the 1980s and served as Hezbollah's military commander in southern Lebanon during the 2006 war with Israel. The United States announced sanctions against him in 2020.

Hezbollah began firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack out of Gaza triggered the war there. Hezbollah and Hamas are allies that consider themselves part of an Iran-backed ""Axis of Resistance"" against Israel.

The conflict has steadily ratcheted up to the brink of all-out war, raising fears of a region-wide conflagration.

Israel says it is determined to return some 60,000 of its citizens to communities in the north that were evacuated nearly a year ago. Hezbollah has said it will only halt its rocket fire if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which has proven elusive despite months of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas led by the United States, Qatar and Egypt."
Writer Ta-Nehisi Coates returns to nonfiction with his essay collection 'The Message',NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/nx-s1-5043643/writer-ta-nehisi-coates-returns-to-nonfiction-with-his-essay-collection-the-message,2024-09-29T23:46:37Z,"NPR's Ayesha Rascoe asks Ta-Nehisi Coates about his new collection of three essays, ""The Message."" It is Coates' return to nonfiction after nearly a decade.

Ta-Nehisi Coates is no stranger to tackling fraught topics. A decade ago, his article in The Atlantic titled ""The Case For Reparations"" spurred a national conversation about compensating African Americans. His goal, he says, was to get people to stop laughing about the idea and start talking. He followed up a year later with a book called ""Between The World And Me,"" an exploration of his own history and the realities of being Black in the U.S. History is complicated, Ta-Nehisi Coates says, and so in his new book, ""The Message,"" he takes on the stories that we tell and that others tell about three places - the Middle East, the American South, and Africa. His journey begins with travel to Goree Island just off the coast of Senegal, to the Door of No Return, a memorial to the victims of the Atlantic slave trade. Coates says that place and that portal, which legend says enslaved people pass through to be shipped to the new world left him speechless, and that in the end, he rejects romantic notions that Black people's worth is based on potential royal ancestry, snatched from dignity into slavery.

TA-NEHISI COATES: To base your self-worth as a people, to base your self-esteem on being Black or being part of the African diaspora or part of the Black diaspora, on the same metrics of the people that enslaved you, is a mistake. So all of this conversation about who we are the descendants of, our need to put ourselves in the shoes of people that did, quote-unquote, ""great things"" or made great, you know, works, is to, in fact, to repeat the mistake.

RASCOE: What is it, though? Because I think it is so complicated as a Black American born in this country to go to Africa. I haven't been, but I know people will feel a connection. And I'm sure you've heard of the diaspora wars. You know this. There are Black Americans who say, I'm not African. I've never been there. That's not me. How do you reckon with all that? And what is Africa to you?

COATES: I can't make anybody feel a certain kind of way. And I wouldn't ask anybody. If you don't know feel a connection in Africa, that's certainly, you know, your right. I didn't go there looking for acceptance necessarily from Africans...

COATES: Well, maybe kinship, but not necessarily acceptance.

COATES: But, you know, I didn't show up, you know, like, break out the drums for me and say, welcome home, brother. You know, I didn't need that. This is the site of my creation as an African American. My great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandmothers were taken from this place on the water, and then in the plantations of this country here, we were genocided and created into a new people. But the process begins there. The great epic that I rooted myself in, the great Black American epic, the great Black diasporic epic - I was at the origin point. That was deeply moving.

RASCOE: You also go to South Carolina. You talk about a teacher who risked her job to keep teaching your book ""Between The World And Me."" And this is where you get into book bans and censorship. But you say in one passage that much of the hoopla about book bans and censorship gets it wrong. What do we get wrong?

COATES: I think the first thing I would say off the top is that I as the writer and the author of the book, I am not the victim.

RASCOE: You don't take it personally. It's not - you are not being victimized.

COATES: I don't. But I'm also not the person who's going to suffer. My personal offense and to make it about me misses the point. The people that are really hurt are the children and the students there. They're not necessarily hurt because they need to be exposed to my voice or my books, or they need to adopt my politics or my particular view of the world. But I know that the seat of me as a writer is so much varied literature in terms of its type and genre, and what all of that literature had in common was to open the world for me, and to say that I was free to find my own politics, my own views, my own future, I did not necessarily have to even believe everything that was said within my own house.

RASCOE: Is there a reason why you think writing catches it more than even other...

RASCOE: ...You would think with the internet and all these things, that would be much more dangerous...

RASCOE: No, the writing is extremely dangerous. And the books in particular are very dangerous. In fact, I think the people who are in favor of book bans understand the power of books much, much better than those that oppose them. Books are intimate. It's a one-on-one connection. So that kid in South Carolina, that 15-year-old, 16-year-old kid is taking ""Between The World And Me"" or whatever other book they're reading - they're taking it into their bedroom, and they're having a connection with them that nobody else can actually perceive. Even if you took the book from the kid and read it yourself, you would still not have the same interaction because the way books work is they are necessarily a union between the imagination of the reader and the words that are on the page.

RASCOE: The longest essay in the book is on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Why did you choose to delve into this topic, which is one of the most, if not the most, fraught topic of public discourse today?

COATES: Well, the fact was probably my most celebrated work of journalism is ""The Case For Reparations."" That essay has a section in which it talks about reparations from the state of Germany to the state of Israel as recompense for the survivors of the Holocaust or those fleeing the Holocaust, in fact, fleeing Nazi Germany's existential violence to Israel. And I was roundly and sometimes loudly critiqued for using that as an example.

RASCOE: What was the criticism that you faced for that?

COATES: The criticism was that German reparations had been paid to build a project that necessarily was taking the land from other people, and itself was perpetrating another atrocity. What I wanted to do was I wanted to see that firsthand myself. I wanted to read as much as I could about it within the time I had to get this book done. I wanted to spend as much time as I could out of the three chapters in the book. One of the reasons why that's as long as it is because it's the place that I spent the most time. It's the place I talked to the most people. I felt the responsibility to take that criticism as seriously as I could.

RASCOE: In the essay, you draw parallels to the Jim Crow South with the treatment of Palestinians. And you also say that people say this issue is so complicated, and you say it is not complicated.

COATES: Well, the first thing I will say is history is always complicated. Stories are always complicated. What I saw over there was not especially complicated. It was not any more complicated than American history. Look, I am the descendant and the child of people born into Jim Crow America. When I step into a city like old Hebron, and a man stops me, a man young enough to be my son, with a gun that looks like it's about half his body weight - if I'm walking with a guy whose family has lived in that old city from time immemorial, for generation after generation, and that soldier tells me, I can walk down the street, but he can't, that evokes certain things in me. When I'm around a group of people who have been denied any real ability to determine their fate because of who they are, by which I mean the ability to vote, I can't look at that and say, that's complicated. That's not complicated to me, not with my background.

RASCOE: It doesn't sound like it, but did you have any pause about taking this on? You could have looked at this and said, this is not my conflict. This is not my fight.

COATES: I did. I did, I did. But every single fighter jet that drops a bomb in Gaza is of American providence. This is ours. You know, I think it's irresponsible as an American to say that this isn't really my struggle while your tax dollars undergird this war. I don't think that's an option.

RASCOE: Yes. It criticizes you for, quote, ""refusing to countenance conversations with Jews who don't share his opinions and don't denounce their nation."" How would you respond to that?

COATES: I would respond to that by pointing out that I've spent the vast majority of my career around people, be they Jewish or not, who were very much believers in the dream and the idea of Israel and the Israeli project. That is the waters of journalism that I swam in. That's how that example ended up in ""The Case For Reparations"" in the first place.

RASCOE: Some may hear that and think, like, is the contention that Jewish people control the media or things of that nature - can you clarify what you meant by the representation?

COATES: I meant exactly what I said. I would like to know the number of Palestinians that are working at a major bureau for a major outlet, be that TV, newspaper, magazines. I would like to know the number of Palestinians specifically.

COATES: Who are covering the West Bank, who are covering Israel, who are covering this conflict, as we call it. I would like to know that. I don't necessarily need the numbers of anybody else. I need the numbers of Palestinians.

COATES: Well, here's what I would say. I am here talking about this book as a Black writer. And I'm being interviewed by Black journalists. There is a kind of conversation that you and I can have that is very, very different than the conversation that somebody who doesn't have that experience has. That doesn't mean I'm not going to talk to anybody else. That doesn't mean I shouldn't talk to anybody else. It just means that there is a certain perspective. I think we recognize that across journalism. I think we would say if The New York Times did not have any Black people covering race in this country - I think we would say that's a problem. I am asking that we export that same standard to Israel, to Palestine, to the Jerusalem Bureau.

RASCOE: What would you say to those who I am sure listening to this, who will be concerned, who will say, look, I love ""Between The World And Me."" But on this, I think this could lead to antisemitism. This has gone too far. What do you say to those?

COATES: Not much. I'd say, well, if that's how you feel, that's how you feel. I can't really influence that. You have to do what you have to do. As a writer, what I have to do is I have to be able to look at myself in the mirror and be OK. I got to be able to wake up in the morning and say, I feel like I did the right thing. Folks who feel that it's doing something else and that, you know, it offends their particular politics. I'm sorry, but I have to do what I have to do, and I have to say what I have to say.

RASCOE: That's Ta-Nehisi Coates. He is the author of ""The Message."" Thank you so much for joining us.

Israel announced on Saturday that it had killed Hassan Nasrallah, the longtime leader of Hezbollah, in a powerful series of airstrikes that rocked Beirut on Friday evening. The Iranian-backed militia later confirmed Nasrallah's death.

The announcement came after an eventful and deadly 12 days in the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah -- including the killing of several other high-ranking Hezbollah officials and more than 1,000 people in Lebanon after a series of near-synchronized explosions followed by thousands of Israeli airstrikes over several days. These attacks left thousands more wounded and displaced tens of thousands of people.

Hezbollah also retaliated against Israel, firing hundreds of rockets toward northern Israel, and at least one long-range cruise missile toward Tel Aviv, which was intercepted by Israel's air defense system. It was the first time the militant group had ever done so. Although most of these projectiles were shot down, several did make it through, causing damage to residential homes, a regional hospital and injuring several civilians.

Here's a more detailed timeline of how these dramatic events unfolded:

Sept. 17: Thousands of pagers -- many belonging to Hezbollah members -- simultaneously explode across Lebanon and Syria, killing at least 13 people, including some children, and injuring around 4,000, hundreds of them critically. Israel is widely believed to be behind the attack, but does not publicly take credit for it. Earlier in the day, Israel had announced a new goal in the war: to return tens of thousands of displaced Israelis who had been driven from their homes near the border with Lebanon by almost a year of Hezbollah rocket fire, signaling it might take further military action against Hezbollah.

Sept. 18: A fresh wave of explosions of communications devices, including walkie-talkies, strikes Lebanon, killing 14 and wounding some 450, according to Lebanese health officials. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant speaks about ""excellent achievements"" by Israel's military and intelligence branches leading to ""impressive results,"" but does not mention the device attacks of the previous two days.

Sept. 19: Israel says it struck hundreds of rocket launchers in southern Lebanon, putting them out of commission.

Sept. 20: Israel strikes a residential building in a crowded Beirut suburb during rush hour, later announcing it has killed Ibrahim Akil, Hezbollah's military commander. Thirty-seven people were killed in the strike, including entire families, and dozens were wounded. Hezbollah later confirmed Akil's death, along with 15 other Hezbollah members. Akil had been wanted by the U.S. for involvement in a deadly attack on the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in 1983, according to the State Department. The Israeli military said Akil was planning an attack on northern Israel, similar to the Hamas-led attack last Oct. 7 that sparked the war in Gaza.

Sept. 21: The Israeli Air Force strikes approximately 400 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, including rocket launchers and additional military infrastructure in southern Lebanon, saying that the launchers were aimed at Israel. Lebanon's interior minister, Bassam Mawlawi, says its intelligence agencies are working to dismantle a spy network, saying that Lebanon is in a ""delicate and dangerous"" security climate.

Sept. 22: Hezbollah and Israel trade heavy fire overnight and into the early morning hours. In southern Lebanon, residents described huge explosions that lit up the night sky. The Israeli military said it hit some 290 targets, including Hezbollah rocket launchers, while some of Hezbollah's rockets hit deeper into Israel than they have previously in this war.

Sept. 23: Israel calls on residents of southern Lebanon to leave only hours before blanketing the area with more than 1,300 airstrikes. Those strikes kill at least 558 people, including women, children and health care workers, and injure more than 1,800, according to Lebanon's ministry of health. This is the highest single-day death toll in Lebanon in decades. On the same day, Hezbollah fires around 200 rockets at northern Israel, most of which were intercepted by Israel's aerial defense system. In the evening, Israel strikes an apartment in Beirut where Ali Karaki, Hezbollah's southern front commander and third in the organization's hierarchy, was staying. He survives.

Sirens sound in the northern Israeli city of Haifa and nearby towns. Israel said Haifa was targeted for the first time since the war began nearly a year ago.

Sept. 24: Hezbollah and Israel continue to trade fire through the night. Israel issues more warnings to residents in southern Lebanon to flee, while heavily bombarding the area with hundreds of additional airstrikes, killing dozens more -- including two U.N. workers -- and wounding many others. Iran's president warns in an interview with CNN that Lebanon must not become ""another Gaza at the hands of Israel."" Israel says a strike in Beirut killed the head of Hezbollah's missile division, Ibrahim Kobeissi.

Sept. 25: Early in the morning, Hezbollah launches a long-range missile that reaches Tel Aviv airspace before being shot down by Israeli forces -- the first time the militant group has launched a missile like this toward central Israel. Israel continued its airstrike campaign across much of southern Lebanon, killing at least another 72 people and injuring about 400, according to Lebanese health officials. The Israeli military also announces it is calling up two additional brigades of reserves for the north, saying that it must ""prepare very strongly"" for a ground invasion into southern Lebanon.

Sept. 26: Amidst the backdrop of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, the U.S. and France, backed by other members of the G-7, propose a 21-day cease-fire plan between Israel and Lebanon. Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, are quick to reject it.

Hezbollah fires dozens of rockets toward northern Israel, most of which were intercepted, while Israel says it carried out more than 200 airstrikes in Lebanon, killing another 92 people and wounding more than 150, according to Lebanese health officials. This brings the total number of people killed in Lebanon by Israeli airstrikes during the week to more than 700. Tens of thousands of Lebanese are displaced while fleeing Israel's constant bombardment. Lebanese officials say it is the country's largest displacement in decades.

Later, Israel says it has killed Hezbollah's air force commander, Mohammed Hussein Sarour, in a strike in southern Beirut.

Sept. 27: In a fiery speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Netanyahu says Israel is ""winning"" on multiple fronts and would attack Iran and its proxies anywhere in the Middle East. Many of the delegates in the U.N. hall leave in a public snub at the start of his address -- in which he calls the U.N. a ""swamp of antisemitic bile.""

Shortly after Netanyahu finishes speaking, several Israeli airstrikes rock southern Beirut in a series of blasts that can be felt around the city. The strikes demolished multiple residential buildings in southern Beirut, which Israeli officials almost immediately label the headquarters of Hezbollah, even as the smoke and debris clouds from the explosion rose above the city.

Sept. 28: Several hours later, the Israeli military announces that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in the strike in Beirut. Hezbollah later confirms his death. Analysts say the killing of Nasrallah has transformed an already complex and deadly regional conflict, with a broad array of potential outcomes for Israel, Gaza, Lebanon and beyond."

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption

The U.S. wants to stop Iran and its allies from spreading conflict in the Middle East following the killing of Hezbollah's leader in Lebanon, the Pentagon said on Sunday.

""Secretary Austin stressed that the United States is determined to prevent Iran and Iranian-backed partners and proxies from exploiting the situation or expanding the conflict,"" Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement.

""Secretary Austin made clear that should Iran, its partners, or its proxies use this moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, the United States will take every necessary measure to defend our people.""

The statement comes amid concerns that conflict could spread further across the Middle East and spark a wider war after Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Lebanon last week. Israel's military has indicated that it is preparing to invade southern Lebanon and said Sunday it had launched additional raids on targets in Lebanon.

The Department of Defense also said it ""continues to maintain a significant amount of capability in the region and to dynamically adjust our force posture based on the evolving security situation.""

""The Secretary has also increased the readiness of additional U.S. forces to deploy, elevating our preparedness to respond to various contingencies,"" Ryder said in the statement. ""And DoD maintains robust and integrated air-defense capabilities across the Middle East, ensuring the protection of U.S. forces operating in the region.""

White House officials said Friday afternoon that President Biden had directed the Pentagon to ""assess and adjust as necessary U.S. force posture in the region to enhance deterrence, ensure force protection, and support the full range of U.S. objectives.""

Iran provides weapons and other support to Hezbollah, Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen, while the U.S. is a strong ally of Israel and has provided the country with billions of dollars' worth of military aid each year."
IDF prepares to invade southern Lebanon as 2 more Hezbollah leaders are presumed dead,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/g-s1-25330/idf-strikes-hezbollah-invasion-lebanon,2024-09-29T13:41:30Z,"A woman reads the Quran at the site of the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut's southern suburbs, Sunday.

Israel's military says it carried out ""dozens"" of additional raids on Hezbollah targets early Sunday, as reports circulated that another two senior Hezbollah commanders were assassinated following the assassination of the militant group's leader Hassan Nasrallah in a southern suburb of Beirut.

In a statement, the IDF said it had eliminated Nabil Kaouk, head of Hezbollah's preventative security council.

Hezbollah did not comment on Kaouk's whereabouts, but it separately confirmed the death of another senior commander, Ali Karaki.

At least 11 people were killed in the latest strikes, according to Lebanon's National News Agency.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned to Israel earlier than expected from his trip to the United Nations as Israel was said to be preparing for an invasion into southern Lebanon after reservists were called up to Israel's north.

In a statement on the messaging app Telegram, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its air forces targeted ""buildings where weapons and military structures of the organization were stored.""

The IDF says it has attacked hundreds of Hezbollah targets since Saturday, aiming its attacks in Dahieh, a densely populated southern suburb of Beirut and Hezbollah stronghold.

""The IDF continues to attack with force, damage and degrade Hezbollah's military capabilities and infrastructure in Lebanon,"" the Israeli military said in a post on X.

Israeli strikes left another 33 people dead on Saturday, according to the Lebanese health ministry, and an additional 195 people wounded.

Meanwhile, the IDF also said it had intercepted eight projectiles launched from Lebanon into Israel on Sunday, hitting open areas near Tiberias in Israel's north.

The latest exchanges of fire, combined with Israel's preparations to invade southern Lebanon has mounted fears that the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah was heading toward an all-out war.

Israel's killing of Nasrallah, in particular, represents another dramatic new development for a conflict that has metastasized across the Middle East region since last October.

In a statement on Saturday, Netanyahu stood by the move, calling it necessary to ""change the balance of power in the region for years to come.""

""Nasrallah was not a terrorist; he was the terrorist,"" Netanyahu said in a statement, warning of challenging days ahead.

Even as Israeli forces prepared for a response to retaliatory strikes from Hezbollah, Lebanon's Information Minister said on Sunday that negotiations for a ceasefire with Israel were still ""underway"" even as cross-border exchanges of fire continued.

The U.S., France, the U.K. and other allies have called for a 21-day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, even as the prospect of any such agreement appears less and less likely.

""It's time for a ceasefire now,"" President Joe Biden told reporters on Saturday as he left a church in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.

Asked about Nasrallah's killing, however, Biden said the longtime Hezbollah leader's death was ""a measure of justice"" for victims of his four-decade ""reign of terror.""

In a separate statement, Biden noted the operation to take out Nasrallah happened within the wider context of the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attacks against Israel.

""Nasrallah, the next day, made the fateful decision to join hands with Hamas and open what he called a 'northern front' against Israel,"" Biden said in a statement.

On Saturday, the U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy reiterated calls for a ceasefire, saying in a post on X that he had spoken with the Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati.

""We agreed on the need for an immediate ceasefire to bring an end to the bloodshed,"" Lammy said. ""A diplomatic solution is the only way to restore security and stability for the Lebanese and Israeli people.""

Mikati told reporters on Sunday that he ""welcomes"" a ceasefire, adding that if one were to occur, it would need to apply to both Gaza and Lebanon."
Why the U.S. government is hailing Israel's killing of Hezbollah's leader as 'justice',NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/g-s1-25322/biden-nasrallah-hezbollah-israel,2024-09-29T10:31:10Z,"Shiite Muslims light candles during a protest against the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, in Karachi, Pakistan on Saturday. Fareed Khan/AP hide caption

The death of Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah by an Israeli airstrike on Saturday could reshape the war in the Middle East in ways not yet known. The civilian death toll from the strikes is likely to rise. And the Iran-backed Lebanese militacnt group is known for its resilience and retaliation.

But many U.S. leaders have united in their support of Israel's killing of Nasrallah for what they see an appropriate action for the longtime decision maker of an organization that killed many innocent lives.

President Biden said the death of Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, by an Israeli airstrike on Saturday was ""a measure of justice for his many victims.""

""Hassan Nasrallah and the terrorist group he led, Hezbollah, were responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four-decade reign of terror,"" Biden said in a statement.

Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson also added their support for the attack.

Harris called Nasrallah ""a terrorist with American blood on his hands"" whose leadership ""destabilized the Middle East and led to the killing of countless innocent people in Lebanon, Israel, Syria, and around the world. Today, Hezbollah's victims have a measure of justice.""

Biden and Harris reiterated their support for Israel's right to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups.

Hezbollah has been linked to several anti-U.S. terrorist attacks since the 1980s. Hezbollah was formed in 1982 in response to Israel's invasion of Lebanon and three years later pledged allegiance to the supreme leader of Iran and called for the destruction of Israel.

The groups attacks against Americans and U.S. interests include the suicide truck bombings in 1983 and 1984 in Beirut that targeted the U.S. embassy, the U.S. Marine barracks and the U.S. embassy annex. The death toll of those attacks was more than 300 Americans and Lebanese.

In 1985, a Trans World Airlines flight was hijacked by an alleged Hezbollah member who fatally shot a U.S. Navy diver.

During the Iraq War, Hezbollah members reportedly armed and trained Shia militias that carried out attacks on U.S. forces during their deployments between 2003 and 2011, according to a U.S. congressional report published last week.

In the Middle East, more than 500 Lebanese and over 30 Israelis have reportedly been killed in recent fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, according to the report.

The Lebanese militant group and Israel have been trading attacks since the current conflict in the Middle East began nearly a year ago. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group governing Gaza and is also backed by Iran, carried out an attack on Israel on Oct. 7. That attack killed around 1,200 Israelis and Hamas militants took some 250 hostages. Israel responded with what's become a months-long assault in the Gaza Strip that has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians.

The 2024 annual threat assessment put out by U.S. intelligence agencies states that Hezbollah ""maintains the capability to target U.S. persons and interests in the [Middle East] region, worldwide, and, to a lesser extent, in the United States."""
Hezbollah leader's death sparks joy and rage across the Middle East,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/nx-s1-5132098/hezbollah-nasrallah-world-reaction-israel-us-lebanon,2024-09-29T09:05:47Z,"Demonstrators hold pictures of Hassan Nasrallah, late leader of the Lebanese group Hezbollah, during a protest vigil in the southern Lebanese city of Sidon on Saturday.

Israel's killing of Hassan Nasrallah was met with joy and rage across the Middle East, opposing reactions that expose the deep divisions in the region.

Hezbollah confirmed that its leader of 32 years was killed in Lebanon by an Israeli airstrike, and offered condolences for others killed with him, after what the group called a ""treacherous Zionist raid on the southern suburb"" of Beirut.

It described Nasrallah as ""a great martyr, a heroic, bold, brave, wise, insightful, and faithful leader,"" and would remain, despite his death, ""still among us with his thought, spirit, line and sacred approach.""

In Washington, President Biden in a White House statement said Nasrallah and Hezbollah ""were responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four-decade reign of terror.""

The president called Nasrallah's death ""a measure of justice for his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis, and Lebanese civilians."" He also reiterated full support for ""Israel's right to defend itself against Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and any other Iranian-supported terrorist groups.""

The Israeli military said the Hezbollah leader was killed at his main headquarters underneath a residential building in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh. It said Hezbollah's acting deputy, Ali Karki, and other Hezbollah commanders were among those killed as they were planning further attacks on Israel.

To highlight the attack's potential to ignite an even wider Middle East conflict, the semiofficial Iranian news agency, Mehr, reported that an operational head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, Brig. Gen. Abbas Nilforoushan, had also been killed in the strike. Iran has long financed and supported Hezbollah, while also supplying weapons and missile technology to the group.

The attack on Hezbollah's headquarters took place just after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the U.N. General Assembly. An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with protocol, said Netanyahu greenlit the strike before he delivered his address.

In his first public remarks on Friday's attack, Netanyahu said the assassination of Nasrallah, who he described as ""the architect"" of a plan to ""annihilate"" Israel, was an ""essential condition"" for Israel to achieve its war goals.

The mood among Israelis was jubilant. One Tel Aviv apartment building blasted a song with the Hebrew lyrics: ""Oh Nasrallah, we'll take you down, God willing, and send you back to God along with all of Hezbollah."" At a beach in southern Israel, a lifeguard announced to beachgoers over a loudspeaker: ""With happiness, joy and cheer, we announce officially that the rat Hassan Nasrallah was assassinated yesterday. The people of Israel live.""

The Israeli military ordered limitations on public gatherings in central Israel in a sign that the country was preparing for possible retaliatory strikes by Hezbollah or other Iran-supported militias.

In the past few days, thousands of reservists have also been called up and deployed to the country's border with Lebanon, as Hezbollah continues to trade rocket fire with Israeli ground forces using artillery and tanks.

Meanwhile, senior figures across the Israeli political spectrum and the country's military leaders praised the assassination. ""He was an immediate threat to the lives of thousands of Israelis and other citizens,"" said the country's defense minister, Yoav Gallant. ""This action closed a long-standing account with the arch-murderer Nasrallah, whose hands were covered with the blood of thousands of civilians and soldiers.""

""Nasrallah will no longer be able to terrorize the world,"" said Daniel Hagari, the spokesperson for the Israeli military. ""Justice has been served.""

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei condemned what he called an Israeli massacre in Lebanon, and vowed that the fate of the Mideast will be determined by ""the forces of resistance, with Hezbollah at the forefront."" Iran announced five days of mourning for Nasrallah.

Khamenei told Muslims to stand by the people of Lebanon and Hezbollah to confront Israel. Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, called Nasrallah's killing a war crime.

Since Hezbollah began sending missiles into northern Israel on Oct. 8, a day after the Hamas-led assault on southern Israel, the group has fired 9,300 rockets, killing 49 people and wounding 372, according to the Israeli prime minister's office. The Lebanese health ministry separately announced Saturday that more than 1,000 people had been killed in Lebanon over just the past 10 days, including dozens of women and children. More than 6,000 had been wounded, it said.

Tens of thousands of Lebanese have fled the country's southern and eastern regions that have borne repeated Israeli strikes in the past week. And many have also been pouring over the border to neighboring Syria, Syrian journalist Danny Makki told NPR, speaking from the capital Damascus.

""Syrians are more concerned at the moment with getting them to safety, and helping them in the humanitarian sense,"" Makki said, while acknowledging the broader impact of the Hezbollah leader's death. ""Nasrallah is a very huge individual in the region and has been part and parcel of the politics of the Middle East.""

In Syria, where Hezbollah has backed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the country's brutal civil war, people in Idlib province celebrated on the streets, Syrian journalist Fared Al Mahlool told NPR. ""People are happy to hear it. ... Too many people have been displaced, killed, and lost loved ones because of Nasrallah's support to the Syrian regime. They took part in destroying several cities and displacing so many people,"" he said.

Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad, the two main militant groups in Gaza that have been labeled as terrorist organizations by the United States and several other nations, were defiant. Islamic Jihad said it was ""fully confident"" that Nasrallah's death would ""increase the strength, steadfastness and determination of the resistance in Lebanon, Palestine and the region,"" while a statement released by Hamas said history showed the deaths of leaders such as Nasrallah meant they would be ""succeeded on the same path by a generation of leaders who are more valiant, stronger and more determined."" Hamas senior figure Khalil al-Hayya, speaking on Al Jazeera, said the souls of Nasrallah and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh -- assassinated in July -- ""are inside the birds of heaven.""

In Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, there were massive demonstrations Saturday night, with people vowing to continue resistance.

Iraqi state television announced a three-day period of mourning to honor the martyrdom of Nasrullah. On the station's official website, it said: ""This heinous crime will enhance the spirit of resistance in people's hearts and enhance the will of victory in facing the mean Zionist entity.""

Some members of Iraq's parliament cried on television on the news of Nasrallah's assassination. One lawmaker vowed that his death would ""open the gates of fire against Zionists.""

Russia's foreign ministry issued a statement condemning the killing of Nasrallah, saying it ""is fraught with even greater dramatic consequences for Lebanon and the entire Middle East."" Moscow called on Israel to stop hostilities aimed at Lebanon.

Meanwhile, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, in a post on X, said he had spoken with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati on Saturday. ""We agreed on the need for an immediate ceasefire to bring an end to the bloodshed,"" Lammy said, adding that ""a diplomatic solution is the only way to restore security and stability for the Lebanese and Israeli people."""
Analysis: Hassan Nasrallah's killing transforms an already deadly regional conflict,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25311/analysis-hassan-nasrallahs-killing-transforms-an-already-deadly-regional-conflict,2024-09-28T17:59:35Z,"Israel's killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the long-time Hezbollah leader, has transformed an already complex and deadly regional conflict, with a broad array of potential outcomes for Israel, Gaza, Lebanon and beyond.

Prior to the powerful series of airstrikes that hit several residential buildings in southern Beirut on Friday, analysts in the Mideast had speculated that Nasrallah had left Lebanon following the widespread pager explosions earlier this month, but then soon after returned, as the United States presented an initiative that would lead to a 21-day ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel.

Those thousands of remotely detonated blasts -- subsequently sourced to walkie-talkies too -- had targeted members and allies of Hezbollah, and represented a significant blow to the group. A subsequent Israeli airstrike had then killed Hezbollah's chief of staff, and by Friday the Israeli military says Nasrallah was meeting with several other senior commanders.

Amer Al Sabaileh, a Jordanian security expert and close observer of Hezbollah, said the fact Nasrallah was willing to take the high risk to his life of gathering with other Hezbollah commanders amid Israel's campaign indicates the group was in crisis after two weeks of crippling Israeli attacks.

""The level of shock among Hezbollah cannot be measured,"" Al Sabaileh said. ""Simply, they never expected that Israel would initiate and would continue, and does not stop attacking Hezbollah.""

And the regional consequences could be significant too, according to Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the British think tank Chatham House.

""Iran will be looking for some way to turn the tables and save some face,"" Vakil wrote in a long series of online posts about the killing and its impact on Iran's so-called ""axis of resistance"" that includes Hezbollah, Hamas and other militant groups like the Houthis in Yemen. ""The axis has not proven effective at providing Iran deterrence against Israel, or a Gaza cease-fire.""

But Orna Mizrahi, an Israeli security expert from the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, said Israel's successes in degrading Hezbollah's leadership structure and military capabilities could be leveraged to reach a lasting agreement that would force Hezbollah forces back from Lebanon's border with northern Israel.

""The weakened and battered state of Hezbollah provides a short window of opportunity to diminish its strategic capabilities further before civilian harm prompts international pressure on Israel to cease operations,"" she wrote in an analysis. ""Simultaneously, Israel must develop a coordinated exit strategy with the U.S. to end the northern conflict.""

Hezbollah's succession plans and the process by which Nasrallah may be replaced are opaque, but should follow a blueprint that saw his own elevation more than 30 years ago, according to Nick Blanford, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council's Middle East Programs and long-time expert of Hezbollah based in Beirut.

""The morale blow is going to be massive for Hezbollah, but technically it should be a repetition of what happened in '92,"" says Blanford. ""The Shura Council sits down and they elect somebody else."""
Israel strikes Hezbollah in blast targeting the militant group's leader,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25272/israel-strikes-hezbollah-in-blast-targeting-leader,2024-09-28T07:58:55Z,"BEIRUT -- The Israeli military said it struck Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut on Friday in a series of massive explosions that targeted the leader of the militant group and leveled multiple high-rise apartment buildings.

At least six people were killed and 91 were wounded, Lebanon's health ministry said. It was the biggest blast to hit the Lebanese capital in the past year and appeared likely to push the escalating conflict closer to full-fledged war.

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was the target of the strikes, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity, including one United States official. The Israeli army declined to comment on who it was targeting. It was not immediately clear if Nasrallah was at the site, and Hezbollah did not comment on the report.

The death toll is likely to rise significantly as teams comb through the rubble of six buildings. Israel launched a series of strikes on other areas of the southern suburbs following the initial blast.

After the strikes, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abruptly cut short a visit to the United States to return home. Hours earlier, he addressed the United Nations, vowing that Israel's intensified campaign against Hezbollah over the past two weeks would continue -- further dimming hopes for an internationally backed cease-fire.

News of the blasts came as Netanyahu was briefing reporters after his U.N. address. A military aide whispered into his ear, and Netanyahu quickly ended the briefing.

Israeli army spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the strikes targeted the main Hezbollah headquarters, saying it was located underground beneath residential buildings.

The series of blasts at around nightfall reduced six apartment towers to rubble in Haret Hreik, a densely populated, predominantly Shiite district of Beirut's Dahiyeh suburbs, according to Lebanon's national news agency. A wall of billowing black and orange smoke rose into the sky as windows were rattled and houses shaken some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Beirut.

Footage showed rescue workers clambering over large slabs of concrete, surrounded by high piles of twisted metal and wreckage. Several craters were visible, one with a car toppled into it. A stream of residents carrying their belongings were seen fleeing along a main road out of the district.

Israel provided no immediate comment about the type of bomb or how many it used, but the resulting explosion levelled an area greater than a city block. The Israeli army has in its arsenal 2,000-pound, American-made ""Bunker Buster"" guided bombs designed specifically for hitting subterranean targets.

Richard Weir, crisis and weapons researcher with Human Rights Watch, said the blasts were consistent with that class of bomb.

Israel's air forces followed with a new set of strikes early Saturday, also in the southern suburbs, shortly after warning residents of three buildings to evacuate. It said they were being used by Hezbollah to hide weapons, including anti-ship missiles.

Israel's military announced additional attacks on Beqaa in eastern Lebanon and Tyre in the south.

To a degree unseen in past conflicts, Israel spent the week pushing to eliminate Hezbollah's senior leadership. But an attempt to assassinate Nasrallah -- successful or not -- would be a major escalation. The Pentagon said the U.S. had no advance warning of the strikes.

Nasrallah has been in hiding for years, very rarely appearing in public. He regularly gives speeches, but always by video from unknown locations.

The site hit Friday evening had not been publicly known as Hezbollah's main headquarters, though it is located in the group's ""security quarters,"" a heavily guarded part of Haret Hreik where it has offices and runs several nearby hospitals.

Four hours after the strike, Hezbollah had still not issued any statement referring to it. Instead, it announced that it had launched a salvo of rockets at the Israeli city of Safed, which it said was ""in defense of Lebanon and its people, and in response to the barbaric Israeli violation of cities, villages and civilians.""

The Israeli military said a house and a car in Safed were hit, and officials said a 68-year-old woman sustained mild shrapnel wounds.

Israel dramatically intensified its airstrikes in Lebanon this week, saying it is determined to put an end to more than 11 months of Hezbollah fire into its territory. The escalated campaign has killed more than 720 people in Lebanon, including dozens of women and children, according to Health Ministry statistics. A predawn strike Friday in the mainly Sunni border town of Chebaa killed nine members of the same family, the state news agency said.

The United Nations said the fighting has displaced 211,000 people, including 85,000 now staying in public schools and other shelters. Airstrikes have forced 20 primary health care centers to shut down and disrupted access to clean water for nearly 300,000 people.

The scope of Israel's operation remains unclear, but officials have said a ground invasion to push the militant group away from the border is a possibility. Israel moved thousands of troops toward the border in preparation.

At the U.N., Netanyahu vowed to ""continue degrading Hezbollah"" until Israel achieves its goals. His comments dampened hopes for a U.S.-backed call for a 21-day truce between Israel and Hezbollah to allow time for a diplomatic solution. Hezbollah has not responded to the proposal.

Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, saying it was a show of support for the Palestinians. Since then, it and the Israeli military have traded fire almost daily, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee their homes on both sides of the border.

An Israeli security official said he expects the campaign against Hezbollah would not last for as long as the current war in Gaza, because the military's goals are much narrower.

In Gaza, Israel aims to dismantle Hamas' military and political regime, but the goal in Lebanon is to push Hezbollah away from the border -- ""not a high bar like Gaza"" in terms of operational objectives, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to military briefing guidelines.

In the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, civil defense workers pulled the bodies of two women -- 35-year-old Hiba Ataya and her mother Sabah Olyan -- from the rubble of a building brought down by a strike.

""That's Sabah, these are her clothes, my love,"" one man cried out as her body emerged.

Israel says its accelerated strikes have already inflicted heavy damage on Hezbollah's weapons capabilities and its fighters. A strike Tuesday in southern Lebanon killed a Hezbollah missile unit commander, Muhammad Ali Ismail, and his deputy, Israel's military said Saturday. There was no immediate confirmation from Hezbollah.

But Hezbollah boasted a large arsenal of rockets and missiles and its remaining capacities are unknown.

Hezbollah officials and their supporters remain defiant. Not long before the explosions Friday evening, thousands gathered in another part of Beirut's suburbs for the funeral of three Hezbollah members killed in earlier strikes, including the head of the group's drone unit, Mohammed Surour.

People in the giant crowd waved their fists in the air and chanted, ""We will never accept humiliation,"" as they marched marched behind the three coffins, wrapped in the group's yellow flag.

Hussein Fadlallah, Hezbollah's top official in Beirut, said in a speech that no matter how many commanders Israel kills, the group has endless numbers of experienced fighters. He vowed that Hezbollah will keep fighting until Israel stops its offensive in Gaza.

""We will not abandon the support of Palestine, Jerusalem and oppressed Gaza,"" Fadlallah said. ""There is no place for neutrality in this battle."""

New York City Mayor Eric Adams was indicted Thursday on at several federal criminal charges. Investigators have spent months looking into allegations of campaign finance violations and foreign influence in Adams' election.

A new Senate report released this week revealed troubling details about the Secret Service's handling of security at the Pennsylvania rally where former President Donald Trump was shot. The document details ""foreseeable, preventable"" problems that have yet to be addressed.

Despite prosecutors and the victim's family asking he be spared, Marcellus Williams was executed by the state of Missouri for the killing of Felicia Gayle, a former newspaper reporter who was stabbed to death in her home in 1998.

Israeli military officials have informed service members that its air strikes in Lebanon might lead to an invasion of the country, supposedly aimed at allowing Israelis displaced by fighting at the border to return to their homes.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Congress that he and his agency had not concluded that Israel had deliberately blocked humanitarian aid from entering Gaza during its attacks in the area. However, new reporting from ProPublica indicates that two other government agencies concluded that Israel had indeed blocked aid, and had informed Blinken of that fact.

"Netanyahu defies calls for a cease-fire at the U.N., as Israel strikes Lebanon",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5131429/israel-netanyahu-un-speech-lebanon-gaza-iran,2024-09-27T20:28:12Z,"Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu hold signs as he addresses the 79th session of the United Nations General Assembly on Friday. Pamela Smith/AP hide caption

In a fiery speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country is ""winning"" on multiple fronts and would attack Iran and its proxies anywhere in the Middle East, even as Israeli air force jets were preparing to pound a complex of buildings in central Beirut that Israel says serve as a headquarters for the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah.

Many of the delegates inside the U.N. hall stood at the start of his speech -- in which he called the U.N. a ""swamp of antisemitic bile"" -- and swiftly left the room in a public snub.

For days, Arab leaders including Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had been assailing the behavior of the Israeli military in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and Lebanon.

Abbas told delegates that Israel did not deserve its U.N. membership, given that its government has, in his words, ""exploited"" the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack in Israel to ""launch a comprehensive war of genocide on the Gaza Strip, and committed and continues to commit war crimes recognized by the international community."" Israel has denied committing genocide or other war crimes, arguing that it is fighting to defeat militant groups and defend itself from further attacks.

Netanyahu insisted he traveled to New York after he ""heard the lies and slanders leveled at my country by many of the speakers at this podium.""

But his trip had been planned well in advance, and though his arrival in New York for the annual General Assembly had been slightly delayed due to domestic considerations, he told the audience of dignitaries and world leaders that he had ""decided to come here and set the record straight.""

""Israel yearns for peace,"" Netanyahu continued during his address Friday. ""Israel has made peace and will make peace again.""

His office soon after his speech confirmed that he would be returning to Israel early from New York.

But nearly a year into Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza, the Israeli leader's behavior during many months of on-again-off-again cease-fire negotiations has not only infuriated his political opponents and a sizable chunk of his own citizens, but has confounded many world leaders too.

Critics have often in recent months said that Netanyahu -- whose political savvy has helped him survive repeatedly to become Israel's longest-serving prime minister in history -- will agree to show negotiating flexibility during private meetings, before issuing public statements that block progress during peace talks.

Such contradictions have repeatedly occurred during negotiations brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar over a cease-fire in Gaza. And now -- according to Israeli media outlets -- this form of dissembling obstruction has reoccurred in the recent cease-fire proposal developed by the U.S. and France.

Danny Danon, Israel's U.N. ambassador, said the government is pushing for certain terms in any deal. ""If we can achieve the goals of the war through diplomacy, we prefer that,"" he said outside the U.N. Security Council on Friday. ""And the goals are to allow the citizens of Israel, 70,000 refugees to move back to their homes. And to push Hezbollah from the southern Lebanon area.""

In the meantime, Israel has continued its military campaign. Danon said Israeli forces carried out a ""precise attack on Hezbollah's central headquarters"" in Beirut Friday.

As the Israeli military calls up further reserves close to the northern border and responds to Hezbollah rocket fire with dozens of airstrikes in Lebanon, Netanyahu also remains at the center of a high-profile demand for an arrest warrant against him, issued by the chief prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, which is based in The Hague, Netherlands.

The Israeli premier met with his Dutch counterpart during one of several meetings in New York this week, and raised the proceedings currently underway at the court. According to Netanyahu's office, he insisted during the bilateral conversation that the prosecutor's actions constituted ""a political proceeding based on false libels that endanger every democracy defending itself against terrorism."""
Israel says it struck Hezbollah's headquarters as huge explosions rocked Beirut,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/nx-s1-5131238/israel-strikes-hezbollah-headquarters-beirut-lebanon,2024-09-27T16:28:26Z,"BEIRUT -- The Israeli military said Friday it carried out an airstrike on the central headquarters of Hezbollah in Beirut, where a massive explosion leveled buildings in a southern district, sending clouds of orange and black smoke billowing in the skies.

The strike in the Beirut suburb of Dahiyeh came shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the U.N., vowing that Israel's campaign against Hezbollah would continue. Not long before the explosion, thousands were massed in the suburb for the funeral of three Hezbollah members, including a senior commander, killed in earlier strikes.

There was no immediate word on casualties in the strike. The Israeli army spokesman, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said it targeted the main Hezbollah headquarters, located beneath residential buildings. Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV said four buildings were reduced to rubble in the blast, so powerful it rattled windows and shook houses some 30 kilometers north of Beirut. Ambulances were seen headed to the scene of the explosions, sirens wailing.

Earlier in the day, an Israeli airstrike killed a family of nine in a Lebanese border village, authorities said, as Lebanon struggled to deal with a rising death toll, a wave of tens of thousands fleeing their homes and the possibility of an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah.

Israel dramatically intensified its airstrikes in Lebanon this week, saying it is determined to put an end to more than 11 months of Hezbollah fire into its territory. The scope of Israel's operation remains unclear, but officials have said a ground invasion to push the militant group away from the border is a possibility. Israel has moved thousands of troops toward the border in preparation.

At the U.N., Netanyahu vowed to ""continue degrading Hezbollah"" until Israel achieves its goals, further dimming hopes for an internationally backed cease-fire.

That has Lebanese fearing a repeat of the last Israel-Hezbollah war, in 2006, which lasted a month and caused heavy destruction over parts of their country. Or worse, they fear, Lebanon could suffer devastation on the scale caused in Gaza by Israel's nearly yearlong campaign against Hamas.

At least 25 people were killed in Israeli strikes early Friday, Health Minister Firass Abiad said, bringing the death toll in Lebanon this week to more than 720. He said the dead included dozens of women and children.

The Israeli military said it carried out dozens of strikes over the course of two hours around the south on Friday, including in the cities of Sidon and Nabatiyeh. It said it was targeting Hezbollah rocket launchers and infrastructure. It said Hezbollah fired a volley of rockets toward the northern Israeli city of Tiberias."

Hurricane Helene weakened to a Category 1 storm as it moved north from Florida to Georgia after hitting Florida's Big Bend region as a powerful Category 4 storm late Thursday. The storm made landfall with winds up to 140 miles per hour and a storm surge of 20 feet. Early reports say there have been three storm-related deaths. Helene could potentially cause destruction across a vast area of the South in the hours and days to come.

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to make his case with the United Nations today as he continues to reject a U.S.-backed Lebanon cease-fire proposal. This week at the U.N., world leaders have been calling for cease-fires in Gaza in Lebanon. More than 90,000 people in Lebanon have fled their homes amid Israel's attacks this week.

Sudan's army has launched a major offensive against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in Khartoum in a bid to regain the capital. The RSF has controlled the capital for more than a year. Millions have been displaced since the beginning of the war, marking the worst displacement and hunger crises in the world.

Pessimism, skepticism and exhaustion are the three things that I'll remember from voters about my trip to Nevada.

When I went door-to-door with canvassers, I'd ask people how they were feeling about how the election was going. Before they'd answer, I'd notice eye rolls, shaking heads, sighs or some other non-verbal ways to express how tired they are...before saying how they just want it to be over already.

I thought tipped workers might be optimistic, considering both presidential candidates promised in Las Vegas campaign stops that if elected, their tips would no longer be taxed. Nope. There was a feeling that nothing comes for free and many wondered how the government would make up for the lost tax revenue on their tips.

An hour and half west of Las Vegas, I visited the town of Pahrump in rural and conservative Nye County. I talked to lots of Trump supporters who were convinced that even if Trump wins, Congress would somehow stop him from fulfilling his campaign promises.

My last question to everyone I spoke to was this: Where do you hope we are as a country the day after the election? Pretty much every answer had the word ""united"" in it...just like it says in the name: United States of America.

When thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies exploded throughout Lebanon last week, it was a success for the planners of the attack.

Was it also a war crime, with dozens of people killed and some 3,000 people injured?

That type of question, along with all of the ensuing questions about whether to prosecute, how to prosecute, falls to Karim Khan, the lead prosecutor for the International Criminal Court, which was set up two decades ago to investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity.

As for saying whether the attack constitutes a war crime, Khan says he can't answer.

""I need to be very disciplined, in terms of what I say. We don't have jurisdiction in relation to Lebanon. Lebanon is not a state party, unlike Palestine. We're focusing on situations that are clearly, we say, within our jurisdiction.""

Back in May, the ICC applied for arrest warrants against leaders of Hamas, and Israeli leaders Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.

Last week, Israel's foreign ministry filed a petition to appeal the warrant, and the foreign ministry says that the ICC failed to, ""provide Israel with the opportunity to exercise its right to investigate by itself the claims raised by the prosecutor before proceeding.""

Does Khan agree with that assessment?

""Well, no is the short answer. I've said it repeatedly, publicly, that we're investigating, only the crimes alleged against Hamas but also that Israel and leaders in Israel have responsibilities to comply with international law,"" Khan told Consider This host Mary Louise Kelly.

""I was investigating, and there was no applications by Israel since 2021 until today. But we'll deal with the filings in the normal way. It would only be right to respond first to the judges.""

Other major leaders have also criticized this move, namely President Biden, who has called the application for warrants against Israeli leaders 'outrageous' and said that they implied an equivalence between Hamas and Israel.

""You know, U.S. values make it clear that every individual has rights. The United States doesn't say Hispanics or Blacks or whites or people from the East Coast or West Coast have different rights. I say the same thing,"" Khan said.

""As an officer of the court, the umbrella of the law should apply equally. And I have just as much compassion for Kfir Bibas, who was a 10-month-old snatched from a kibbutz that I visited and taken by Hamas, as I do for children 10 months old or younger or older that have also died in Gaza.""

Last month, Khan addressed the U.N. Security Council regarding the civil war in Sudan that has also led to a humanitarian crisis involving starvation and mass death and displacement.

He said the ICC is not and never has been a silver bullet, and that to solve crises of the world, it requires the support of states. So what support is needed?

""After the horrors of the second world war, we gave a promise of never again. How do we build that confidence if there's not a proper solution in Darfur? At the moment, people are being hunted down and killed because of the color of their skin and because of a sense of impunity that has built up over 20 years. We don't have a police force. We don't have military. We need states to live up to their responsibilities - that's, first and foremost, Sudan,"" Khan said.

""And then also, African Union, the United Nations and powerful states, including the United States of America, the European Union - everybody should care that the allegations are so horrendous of famine, of starvation, of rape on a big scale. We need that support in terms of enforcement, and we haven't seen it,"" he added."
"Over 90,000 people in Lebanon had to flee Israel's bombardments this week",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/26/nx-s1-5127325/israel-hezbollah-conflict-lebanon-displaced-residents,2024-09-26T21:08:38Z,"BEIRUT -- Around the concrete courtyard of Ahliah School in the center of Lebanon's capital, families perch on plastic chairs, sharing news of what houses they've heard have been destroyed in their villages near the southern border with Israel.

Many arrived Tuesday, fleeing south Lebanon amid what Lebanese authorities have called the largest displacement of its citizens in decades. More than 90,000 people fled their homes in intense Israeli attacks that killed almost 600 people in just two days this week, according to the United Nations' humanitarian coordination office.

The attacks that Israeli said were aimed at Hezbollah fighters and installations were an intensification of nearly a year of Israel and the militant Lebanese group trading rocket, missile and drone strikes across the Israeli-Lebanese border since the start of the Gaza war last October.

Many Lebanese fleeing the south took refuge with relatives in Beirut and other places, or searched for apartments to rent. But according to the U.N., about 40,000 of them sought shelter in more than 200 schools, which the Lebanese government asked to accommodate displaced people.

Outside the metal gates of the century-old Ahliah School cars full of exhausted-looking passengers pulled up on Tuesday. An aid official waved them on to other schools serving as temporary shelters. With more than 600 arriving in 24 hours, there was no room left.

It was supposed to be the first day of classes at the K-12 private school. Instead, Ahliah had to clear out desks, piling them up in the hallways, and make room for families to move in.

Children's laundry hung from some of the classroom windows to dry. But most of the families arrived with nothing at all -- only the clothes they were wearing.

One couple sat scrolling through social media videos to try to see whether their home was still standing. For security reasons, they asked to be identified as Um Ali and Abu Ali, which means their son Ali's mother and father, respectively.

Um Ali says she was told that 18 houses in the neighborhood in a southern Lebanese village had been destroyed.

Their 12-year-old daughter was so traumatized by the airstrikes and their escape that she has barely spoken, Um Ali says.

""The airstrikes were right next to our cars and the children were screaming and crying,"" she says. With her husband's arm bandaged and in a cast after being hit by shrapnel a month ago from an Israeli airstrike, the mother bundled 10 family members into a car and drove south on Monday.

She says as they drove away there was blood ""all over the street. You'd see a child lying in front of you bleeding and you can't do anything to help.""

There were so many people fleeing south Lebanon on Monday, Lebanese soldiers turned the divided highway into a single route north. A 50-mile drive which normally would have taken an hour stretched in seven or eight hours, as panicked families crammed into any vehicle they could find.

Um Ali says in addition to not talking, her daughter has been unable to sleep and her heart races. Standing behind her mother, the girl says she's OK, but then buries her face in her mother's shoulder and starts to cry.

Her father says it is understandable that fighters would suffer in a war. But the effect on children is a different matter.

""Suddenly someone comes and makes your kids live in a state of fear, blood and destruction,"" says her mother. ""Nobody accepts living like that -- to be humiliated and see their lives torn apart.""

""Would Americans accept that for their children?"" the father, Abu Ali, asks.

It was too soon for the sense of loss that follows displacement to kick in. Abu Ali, a construction worker, and his wife refer to life in their border village in the present tense.

""We have a normal life,"" he says. ""My wife is at home, my kids are in school, and we have a nice house in the south with fresh air.""

""I grow everything and raise a few sheep,"" adds Um Ali, her face for a moment radiant with the memory of life in the countryside. ""We live a happy and beautiful life.""

The Israeli military says it is targeting Iran-backed Hezbollah, designated by the U.S. and other countries as a terrorist group, and its weapons and rocket launchers in southern Lebanon and the Bekaa region to the northeast. Israel has hit targets north of Beirut and in Beirut's southern suburbs as well. The strikes have also killed and injured civilians, including hundreds of children.

Hezbollah began attacks last October to support Hamas in its fight against Israel in Gaza. Despite intense efforts by the United States and France to broker a cease-fire between Lebanon and Israel, Hezbollah has made clear that it will stop only when the fighting in Gaza stops.

The militant group is still reeling from unprecedented attacks recently, including explosions of thousands of its pagers and walkie-talkies last week that killed dozens of people, including children, and injured more than 3,500 others, according to Lebanese health officials. Israel is widely believed to be responsible for having detonated the devices, but the Israeli government has not confirmed any involvement.

Behind the school, a few boys kick around a blue ball on a concrete soccer field. In the courtyard, two sisters from the border town of Nabitieh sit on a low wall. The younger is 18 -- her nails recently manicured in a bright purple. Her sister, 20, has long dark hair that is carefully styled.

The younger one struggles to describe how terrifying it was experiencing the airstrikes and then scrambling to flee.

""It was so scary -- not a little, a lot,"" she says, adding they slept in their clothes when the strikes began during the night to be able to flee early the next morning.

""Every night the planes would pass by to scare us,"" says her older sister. ""There were sonic booms and strikes that were very close.""

Neither wants their name used out of fear for their security.

On the long terrifying drive to Beirut they say they recited the shahada -- the Muslim prayer before death -- over and over in case their car was hit.

By the time they reached the southern suburbs late on Monday, where they had planned to stay, Israeli aircraft were launching strikes there too, forcing them to seek shelter in the city center. Israel has repeatedly hit the mostly Shia suburb of Dahiya, targeting Hezbollah commanders but also killing civilians in the densely populated area.

The streets of the capital are packed with displaced families. And for those who can afford it, so are the hotels. At the reception desk of one, a man asked for five rooms -- but only for a night until the family figure out their options.

Outside another downtown hotel, the cafe tables are full of families with plastic bags of snacks.

""We have been trying to find an apartment but everyone now wants so much money, or six months in advance,"" says a woman, sitting with her sister at one table. Like most displaced people, they did not want to be identified because they said they were afraid they could be targeted by Israel.

The woman, a supermarket cashier, says she left so quickly she did not even have her identification with her.

""The missiles were falling like rain,"" she says. She and her sister have lived through three wars with Israel.

But this one, she insists, has already been the worst."

US and allies call for an immediate 21-day cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/25/g-s1-24617/us-and-allies-call-for-an-immediate-21-day-cease-fire-between-israel-and-hezbollah,2024-09-26T03:51:52Z,"NEW YORK -- The U.S., France and other allies jointly called Wednesday for an immediate 21-day cease-fire to allow for negotiations in the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that has killed more than 600 people in Lebanon in recent days.

The joint statement, negotiated on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, says the recent fighting is ""intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation.""

""We call for an immediate 21-day cease-fire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy,"" the statement said. ""We call on all parties, including the governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary cease-fire immediately.""

There was no immediate reaction from the Israeli or Lebanese governments -- or Hezbollah -- but senior U.S. officials said all parties were aware of the call for a cease-fire. Earlier, representatives for Israel and Lebanon reiterated their support for a U.N. resolution that ended the 2006 war between Israel and the Iranian-backed militant group.

The U.S. hopes the new deal could lead to longer-term stability along the border between Israel and Lebanon. Months of Israeli and Hezbollah exchanges of fire have driven tens of thousands of people from their homes, and escalated attacks over the past week have rekindled fears of a broader war in the Middle East.

The U.S. officials said Hezbollah would not be a signatory to the cease-fire but believed the Lebanese government would coordinate its acceptance with the group. They said they expected Israel to ""welcome"" the proposal and perhaps formally accept it when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks at the General Assembly on Friday.

While the deal applies only to the Israel-Lebanon border, the U.S. officials said they were looking to use a three-week pause in fighting to restart stalled negotiations for a cease-fire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, another Iranian-backed militant group, after nearly a year of war in Gaza.

The nations calling for a halt to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict are the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar.

Work on the proposal came together quickly this week with President Joe Biden's national security team, led by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, meeting with world leaders in New York and lobbying other countries to support the plan, according to U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic conversations.

Blinken first raised the proposal with the French foreign minister Monday and then broadened his outreach that evening at a dinner with the foreign ministers of all the Group of Seven industrialized democracies.

During a meeting Wednesday morning with Gulf Cooperation Council foreign ministers, Blinken approached Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan to ask their approval and got it. Blinken and senior White House adviser Amos Hochstein then met with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, who signed off on the deal.

Sullivan, Hochstein and senior adviser Brett McGurk were also in touch with Israeli officials about the proposal, one of the U.S. officials said. McGurk and Hochstein have been the White House's chief interlocutors with Israel and Lebanon since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas launched the war in Gaza.

The officials said the deal crystallized by late Wednesday afternoon during a conversation on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly between Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron.

Blinken expects to meet Netanyahu's top strategic adviser in New York on Thursday ahead of the prime minister's arrival.

An Israeli official said Netanyahu has given the green light to pursue a possible deal, but only if it includes the return of Israeli civilians to their homes. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing behind-the-scenes diplomacy.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told the U.N. Security Council during a special meeting that ""we are counting on both parties to accept it without delay"" and added that ""war is not unavoidable.""

At the meeting, Mikati, the Lebanese prime minister, publicly threw his support behind the French-U.S. plan that ""enjoys international support and which would put an end to this dirty war.""

He called on the Security Council ""to guarantee the withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Lebanese territories and the violations that are repeated on a daily basis.""

Israel's U.N. Ambassador, Danny Danon, told journalists that Israel would like to see a cease-fire and the return of people to their homes near the border: ""It will happen, either after a war or before a war. We hope it will be before.""

Addressing the Security Council later, he made no mention of a temporary cease-fire but said Israel ""does not seek a full-scale war.""

Both Danon and Mikati reaffirmed their governments' commitment to a Security Council resolution that ended the 2006 Israeli-Hezbollah war. Never fully implemented, it called for a cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon to be replaced by Lebanese forces and U.N. peacekeepers, and the disarmament of all armed groups including Hezbollah.

Earlier Wednesday, Biden warned in an appearance on ABC's ""The View"" that ""an all-out war is possible"" but said he thinks the opportunity also exists ""to have a settlement that can fundamentally change the whole region.""

Biden suggested that getting Israel and Hezbollah to agree to a cease-fire could help achieve a cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

That war is approaching the one-year mark after Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking hostages. Israel responded with an offensive that has since killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, who do not provide a breakdown of civilians and fighters in their count.

""It's possible and I'm using every bit of energy I have with my team ... to get this done,"" Biden said. ""There's a desire to see change in the region.""

The U.S. government also raised the pressure with additional sanctions targeting more than a dozen ships and other entities it says were involved in illicit shipments of Iranian petroleum for the financial benefit of Iran's Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah."
"In the occupied West Bank, Palestinians struggle to access water",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/25/g-s1-24207/palestinians-west-bank-water-israel,2024-09-25T19:21:26Z,"JORDAN VALLEY, West Bank -- Mansour Arara, 24, sits in the shade of a tree with a group of friends next to the Al-Auja freshwater spring. His young nephew and a friend jump and splash in the cool water. It's a hot July day, nearly 100 degrees, and the sun beats off the dusty landscape around them.

Arara and his friends are boiling water from the spring for tea over a small cooking stove, keeping an eye on the younger boys as they play.

""We were so happy to get here today and not be stopped by the soldiers,"" he says.

This is the fourth spring the group tried to visit today -- the other three were blocked by Israeli settlers with the help of the Israeli military, Arara says. When they tried to come to this spring on other days in the weeks before, he says, Israeli soldiers sent them back.

""They told us that since Oct. 7, we are forbidden from coming here,"" Arara says. Meanwhile, he says he could see Israeli settlers using the spring and collecting water.

For Palestinians living in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, access to water has been a struggle for years. Interim agreements from the 1990s have allowed for a water disparity between Israelis and Palestinians, and Israel's occupation of the West Bank has often meant Israeli settlers' water needs are prioritized over Palestinians'.

But since last Oct. 7, when the Hamas-led attack on Israel sparked the current war in Gaza, water has been even harder to come by. In rural areas, hardline Israeli settlers are taking over freshwater springs. And many Palestinians living in West Bank cities say that tap water now flows much less frequently -- sometimes just once a month. Amid growing violence and economic pain, it's one of the less obvious but fundamental ways life has become more difficult for Palestinians in the West Bank in the past year.

The Al-Auja spring isn't just for cooling off during hot summer days. It's a vital water source to the nearby Palestinian towns, farms and sheep herders. A few months ago, Israeli settlers established a new outpost just a few hundred feet from it. Such outposts are illegal under both Israeli and international law, but increasingly common in the West Bank, as Israeli authorities turn a blind eye -- or in some cases, urge settlers to claim more land.

""I think within a year, [Al-Auja] might be just totally off-limits to Palestinians,"" says Sarit Michaeli, head of international advocacy for B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization that tracks abuses in the West Bank.

Michaeli visits the al-Auja spring often. In the weeks since NPR was there in July, she says settlers have encroached even further.

Settlers taking over water sources isn't a new phenomenon, but it has increased dramatically since the war began. Dozens of new settler outposts like the one near Al-Auja have been built since then, often near or around natural water sources traditionally used by Palestinians.

And, Michaeli says, it's not random.

""It's done deliberately in order to take over land,"" she says. ""The settlers talk about it openly. They make videos about it. None of it is a secret. It's done with support, both financial support and also security support of all aspects, all parts of the Israeli government and Israeli authorities.""

Israeli policy in the West Bank -- bolstered by ultranationalist lawmakers who have become powerful in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government -- encourages the expansion of illegal settlements, and instructs the Israeli police and military to protect them.

In the town of Mazra'a al Gharbieh, 70-year-old Samhan Shreiteh says that for as long as he can remember, every morning, he would go to the water spring nearby to collect water for his family. But last Oct. 8, the day after the war started, he was met at the spring by settlers carrying guns.

""They approached me, they pointed the guns at me, and they said, 'Either you leave now or we'll shoot,'"" he remembers.

Shreiteh says he thought they would kill him. He hasn't been back since -- but he gets close enough to see they're still there, guarding the water.

Losing access to the nearby spring meant Shreiteh's household of 10 now has to rely on water that flows through their taps at home -- something that was already unreliable before Oct. 7 due to persistent water shortages, but now has become even more so.

On this day, the taps are dry. He says there hasn't been water for 20 days. So Shreiteh has to buy water from a water delivery service -- something he's never had to do before -- which the family stores in tanks and buckets outside the house. For this service, he says he's paying five times as much for water as he was before Oct. 7.

He and his family ration water now. They do laundry only once a week, take very limited showers, wash dishes in a big batch at the end of the day, and water their garden only enough to keep it alive.

""I used to work in the garden all day, I would water it every single day,"" he says, standing between rows of olive and lemon trees behind the house. ""But now I sit at home. I only water it once a week, and only if we can afford it.""

In the distance on a hilltop is the established Israeli settlement of Harshan. The steady hammer of construction floats through the air.

""Look, they're building, and we can't even access our land,"" Shreiteh says and points. ""And they have water 24 hours a day.""

In the established Israeli settlements -- legal according to Israel, but still illegal under international law -- the taps don't run dry. That's largely because they're connected to the Israeli water grid. Palestinian cities and towns in the West Bank are not.

Interim peace accords in the 1990s -- which were only supposed to last five years, but are still in effect today -- gave Israel control over 80% of the West Bank's water reserves.

The allocations in those agreements, which haven't changed in 30 years, just aren't enough water for the Palestinians, especially as the occupied West Bank population has nearly doubled since they were signed. Meanwhile, Israel has managed to build a water surplus become a water superpower, due to good planning and investment in desalination technology.

So to make up the difference between water the West Bank has and water it needs, the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank, is forced to purchase water from Mekorot, the national Israeli water company, at several times the cost.

Palestinians also need Israel's permission for virtually any building or maintenance in much of the West Bank, meaning that the Palestinian Authority cannot build a cohesive water grid to allow water-rich areas to easily share with water-poor ones -- or even complete less complicated tasks, like repairing leaky pipes.

All of this has caused a major disparity: A study published by B'Tselem last year found that Israelis, including those living in settlements in the West Bank, on average used 247 liters [65 gallons] of water per day per person -- three times as much as the 82.4 liters [22 gallons] used per Palestinian in the West Bank.

That same study found that nearly all Israelis, including those in settlements, have running water every day, while only about a third of Palestinians in the West Bank do.

But since Oct. 7, Palestinians say it's gotten worse.

""What we feel is that of course there is much less water. That's a fact, and we know it,"" says Dr. Ayman Rabi, executive director of the Palestinian Hydrology Group, an independent organization focused on water access in the West Bank and Gaza.

Water officials across the West Bank estimate that water has been cut by around 35% since Oct. 7. But Rabi says it's hard to know why.

""How is this decision made and what are the grounds for this kind of shortage and cut? Unfortunately, it's really hard to tell. The policy is unclear. But of course, the Palestinians have to suffer from it,"" Rabi says.

Mekorot, the Israeli water company that supplies much of the water to the West Bank, has said it provides water in alignment with the Oslo accords from the 1990s, and directed NPR to the Israeli agency in charge of Palestinian affairs to respond to specific questions about water access in the West Bank. That agency, the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories or COGAT, denies any reduction in water flow since Oct. 7, placing the blame for shortages on the Palestinian Authority.

The Palestinian Water Authority says Israel has been prioritizing Israeli settlements and reducing the amount of water for the Palestinians.

Meanwhile, throughout the West Bank, Palestinians are increasingly thirsty.

In Ramallah, one of the biggest cities, almost every building has big plastic tanks on the roof -- a way to store water when it does flow to use when it doesn't.

Samer Shini sells those water tanks in Ramallah. On the day NPR visits, he's receiving a new shipment of 10. Shini says they'll sell in less than an hour.

Sure enough, it only takes a few minutes before Abdel Jawad Ewais walks in and buys three to add to the two tanks he already has at home. Ewais, a resident of nearby El-Bireh, says two were enough in past years, but this year, the water comes so infrequently he needs more.

""This year is much worse. Yeah. This year, you know, once a week, we get the water -- three, four hours. And that's it,"" says Ewais, who is Palestinian American, born and raised in Cleveland. ""After October 7, the water decreased a lot, you know -- not just for me, but for everybody. The whole neighborhood.""

Ewais notes it's not just these tanks he has to buy to make up for it. He's also bought a pump and other infrastructure to get the water to flow in his home. All in all, he estimates it has cost him about $1,000 just this year.

""Fortunately I can afford this stuff, because many other people can't,"" he says.

In downtown Ramallah, shopkeeper Adham Nasser sits outside his small store selling elaborately decorated awnings. He lives in a village outside of town and he says his family hasn't had running water in over a month.

He says they have to buy bottled water for all their water needs, including bathing. It's unsustainable for him.

When asked what he'll do if water doesn't flow soon, he replies: ""We will wait for God's relief.""

Nasser worries that in the future there will be no running water for them at all.

""But people are dying in Gaza,"" he says with a sigh. ""So, let them cut our water.""

It's a sentiment you hear often from Palestinians in the West Bank since the war began: As difficult as life gets, at least it's not Gaza."
Hezbollah fires missile at Tel Aviv after heavy Israeli strikes on Lebanon,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/25/g-s1-24452/hezbollah-fires-missile-tel-aviv,2024-09-25T07:28:40Z,"BEIRUT -- Hezbollah launched a ballistic missile at Tel Aviv early Wednesday, in a further escalation after Israel carried out strikes on Lebanon that killed hundreds of people and the militants fired rockets across wider areas of northern Israel.

The Israeli military said it intercepted the surface-to-surface missile, which set off air raid sirens in Tel Aviv and across central Israel, and there were no reports of casualties or damage. The military said it struck the site in southern Lebanon from which the projectile was launched.

Hezbollah said it fired a Qader 1 ballistic missile targeting the headquarters of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, which it blames for a recent string of targeted killings of its top commanders and for an attack last week in which bombs hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies killed dozens of people and wounded thousands, including many Hezbollah members.

The Israeli military said it was the first time a projectile fired from Lebanon had reached central Israel. Hezbollah claimed to have targeted an intelligence base near Tel Aviv last month in an aerial attack, but there was no confirmation. The Palestinian Hamas militant group in Gaza repeatedly targeted Tel Aviv in the opening months of the war.

The launch ratcheted up tensions as the region appears to be teetering toward another all-out war, even as Israel continues to battle Hamas in the Gaza Strip. A wave of Israeli strikes on Monday and Tuesday killed at least 560 people in Lebanon and forced thousands to seek refuge.

Families have fled southern Lebanon, flocking to Beirut and the coastal city of Sidon, sleeping in schools turned into shelters, as well as in cars, parks and along the beach. Some sought to leave the country, causing a traffic jam at the border with Syria.

Israel said late Tuesday that fighter jets carried out ""extensive strikes"" on Hezbollah weapons and rocket launchers across southern Lebanon and in the Bekaa region to the north. The military has said it has no immediate plans for a ground invasion but has declined to give a timetable for the air campaign.

Tensions between Israel and the Lebanese militant group have steadily escalated over the last 11 months. Hezbollah has been firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and its ally Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group.

Israel has responded with increasingly heavy airstrikes and the targeted killing of Hezbollah commanders while threatening a wider operation.

The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on Lebanon for Wednesday at the request of France.

Nearly a year of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel had already displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border before this week's escalation. Israel has vowed to do whatever it takes to ensure its citizens can return to their homes in the north, while Hezbollah has said it will keep up its rocket attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, something which appears increasingly remote.

Israel has moved thousands of troops who had been serving in Gaza to the northern border. It says Hezbollah has some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including some capable of striking anywhere in Israel, and that the group has fired some 9,000 rockets and drones since last October.

Cross-border exchanges began ramping up on Sunday in the wake of the pager and walkie-talkie bombings, which killed 39 people and wounded nearly 3,000, many of them civilians. Lebanon blamed Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny responsibility.

On Sunday, Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel.

The next day, Israel said its warplanes struck 1,600 Hezbollah targets, destroying cruise missiles, long- and short-range rockets and attack drones, including weapons concealed in private homes. The strikes racked up the highest one-day death toll in Lebanon since Israel and Hezbollah fought a bruising monthlong war in 2006.

An Israeli airstrike in Beirut on Tuesday killed Ibrahim Kobeisi, who Israel described as a top Hezbollah commander with the group's rocket and missile unit. Military officials said Kobeisi was responsible for launches towards Israel and planned a 2000 attack in which three Israeli soldiers were kidnapped and killed. Hezbollah later confirmed his death.

It was the latest in a string of assassinations and other setbacks for Hezbollah, which is Lebanon's strongest political and military actor and is widely considered the top paramilitary force in the Arab world.

Lebanon's Health Ministry said six people were killed and 15 were wounded in the strike in a southern Beirut suburb, an area where Hezbollah has a strong presence. The country's National News Agency said the attack destroyed three floors of a six-story apartment building.

The U.N.'s High Commissioner for Refugees in Lebanon said one of its staffers and her young son were among those killed Monday in the Bekaa region, while a cleaner under contract was killed in a strike in the south.

Hezbollah fired 300 rockets on Tuesday, injuring six Israeli soldiers and civilians, most of them lightly, according to the Israeli military.

The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least 564 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since Monday, including 50 children and 94 women, and that more than 1,800 have been wounded, a staggering toll for a country still reeling from the deadly pager and walkie-talkie bombings last week."
Biden pledges mpox aid to Africa in his valedictory speech to the United Nations,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/24/nx-s1-5121426/biden-mpox-unga-ukraine-gaza-sudan-ai,2024-09-24T16:37:02Z,"President Biden waves as he leaves the stage after his final address to the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 24. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images hide caption

President Biden on Tuesday announced new aid to try to stem the mpox epidemic in a valedictory address to the United Nations where he expressed optimism in the face of wars and other global challenges.

Biden said the United States would give African countries $500 million to help prevent and respond to mpox and will donate 1 million doses of mpox vaccine. ""Now we call on our partners to match our pledge and make this a billion-dollar commitment to the people of Africa,"" Biden said in his speech.

Biden told leaders he had seen ""a remarkable sweep of history"" since he was first elected to office during the Cold War, noting the United States was still embroiled in the Vietnam War at that time.

""Our country was divided and angry, and there were questions about our staying power and our future,"" he said.

But last year, the United States and Vietnam officially elevated their diplomatic and trade ties, Biden noted -- part of a long list of other global issues that have changed for the better, he said.

""It's proof that even from the horrors of war, there was a way forward. Things can get better. We should never forget that,"" he said.

""I know many look at the world today and see difficulties and react with despair, but I do not. I won't,"" Biden said, urging leaders to stand against forces causing division and chaos in the world.

He said the world must not let up on its support for Ukraine in its war with Russia, and must continue to work to end the war in Gaza, and de-escalate tensions in the Middle East. He urged UN members to act to end the conflict in Sudan and address the humanitarian crisis there.

""The world needs to stop arming the generals. To speak with one voice and tell them, 'Stop tearing your country apart. Stop blocking aid to the Sudanese people. End this war now,'"" Biden said.

Biden praised China for its cooperation to stop global flows of synthetic narcotics, but said the world must continue to stand up against economic and military coercion.

""Our task -- our test -- is to make sure that the forces holding us together are stronger than those that are pulling us apart,"" he said.

Biden devoted considerable time in his speech to artificial intelligence, saying it is the greatest test of international leadership, and that the technology could profoundly change life, work, war and science.

""AI also brings profound risks, from deep fakes to disinformation to novel pathogens to bioweapons,"" Biden said, noting preliminary international work on ""global rules of the road"" for the technology.

""But let's be honest, this is just the tip of the iceberg. What we need to do to manage this new technology,"" he said, saying an ""urgent effort"" is needed to ensure AI is safe, secure and equitable.

""We must make certain that the awesome capabilities of AI will be used to uplift and empower everyday people, not to give dictators more powerful shackles on the human spirit in the years ahead,"" he said.

Biden ended his address with a plea to leaders to listen and serve their people, explaining that preserving democracy had been the central cause of his presidency.

""The future will be won by those who unleash the full potential of their people to breathe free, to think freely, to innovate, to educate, to live and love openly, without fear,"" Biden said, drawing a through line from the fall of the Berlin Wall to the end of apartheid to the recent disputed election in Venezuela to LGBT activism in Uganda.

""My fellow leaders, let us never forget, some things are more important than staying in power. It's your people. It's your people that matter the most. Never forget we are here to serve the people, not the other way around,"" he said."
U.S. officials say Russia is embracing AI for its election influence efforts,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/nx-s1-5123927/russia-artificial-intelligence-election,2024-09-23T23:07:59Z,"Russia is the most prolific foreign influence actor using artificial intelligence to generate content targeting the 2024 presidential election, U.S. intelligence officials said on Monday.

The cutting-edge technology is making it easier for Russia as well as Iran to quickly and more convincingly tailor often-polarizing content aimed at swaying American voters, an official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told reporters at a briefing.

""The [intelligence community] considers AI a malign influence accelerant, not yet a revolutionary influence tool,"" the official said. ""In other words, information operations are the threat, and AI is an enabler.""

Intelligence officials have previously said they saw AI used in elections overseas. ""Our update today makes clear that this is now happening here,"" the ODNI official said.

Russian influence operations have spread synthetic images, video, audio, and text online, officials said. That includes AI-generated content ""of and about prominent U.S. figures"" and material seeking to emphasize divisive issues such as immigration. Officials said that's consistent with the Kremlin's broader goal to boost former President Donald Trump and denigrate Vice President Kamala Harris.

But Russia is also using lower-tech methods. The ODNI official said Russian influence actors staged a video in which a woman claimed to be a victim of a hit-and-run by Harris in 2011. There's no evidence that ever happened. Last week, Microsoft also said Russia was behind the video, which was spread by a website claiming to be a nonexistent local San Francisco TV station.

Russia is also behind manipulated videos of Harris's speeches, the ODNI official said. They may have been altered using editing tools or with AI. They were disseminated on social media and using other methods.

""One of the efforts we see Russian influence actors do is, when they create this media, try to encourage its spread,"" the ODNI official said.

The official said the videos of Harris had been altered in a range of ways, to ""paint her in a bad light both personally but also in comparison to her opponent"" and to focus on issues Russia believes are divisive.

Iran has also tapped AI to generate social media posts and write fake stories for websites posing as legitimate news outlets, officials said. The intelligence community has said Iran is seeking to undercut Trump in the 2024 election.

Iran has used AI to create such content in both English and Spanish, and is targeting Americans ""across the political spectrum on polarizing issues"" including the war in Gaza and the presidential candidates, officials said.

China, the third main foreign threat to U.S. elections, is using AI in its broader influence operations that aim to shape global views of China and amplify divisive topics in the U.S. such as drug use, immigration, and abortion, officials said.

However, officials said they had not identified any AI-powered operations targeting the outcome of voting in the U.S. The intelligence community has said Beijing's influence operations are more focused on down-ballot races in the U.S. than the presidential contest.

U.S. officials, lawmakers, tech companies, and researchers have been concerned about the potential for AI-powered manipulation to upend this year's election campaign, such as deepfake videos or audio depicting candidates doing or saying something they didn't or misleading voters about the voting process.

While those threats may yet still materialize as election day draws closer, so far AI has been used more frequently in different ways: by foreign adversaries to improve productivity and boost volume, and by political partisans to generate memes and jokes.

On Monday, the ODNI official said foreign actors have been slow to overcome three main obstacles to AI-generated content becoming a greater risk to American elections: first, overcome guardrails built into many AI tools without being detected; second, develop their own sophisticated models; and third, strategically target and distribute AI content.

As Election Day nears, the intelligence community will be monitoring for foreign efforts to introduce deceptive or AI-generated content in a variety of ways, including ""laundering material through prominent figures,"" using fake social media accounts or websites posing as news outlets, or ""releasing supposed 'leaks' of AI-generated content that appear sensitive or controversial,"" the ODNI report said.

Earlier this month, the Justice Department accused Russian state broadcaster RT, which the U.S. government says operates as an arm of Russian intelligence services, of funneling nearly $10 million to pro-Trump American influencers who posted videos critical of Harris and Ukraine. The influencers say they didn't know the money came from Russia."
"Israel's strikes in Lebanon kill more than 180 people, Lebanese officials say",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/nx-s1-5123377/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-fighting,2024-09-23T14:14:21Z,"BEIRUT -- Fighting has escalated at the Israeli-Lebanese border, as Israeli strikes killed more than 180 people largely in southern Lebanon on Monday, according to Lebanese health authorities, in one of the deadliest days of nearly a year of conflict in the region.

Lebanon's Health Ministry says children, women and health care workers were among those killed in Israeli cross-border attacks in southern Lebanon.

Israel and the Iran-backed Lebanese militia Hezbollah have been trading large numbers of attacks across the border since the war in Gaza began in October last year. Hezbollah's leadership says it is acting out of solidarity with Palestinians and the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza.

The Israeli military says it is fighting Hezbollah, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, to prevent an assault in northern Israel similar to the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel. Israel says it wants degrade Hezbollah's rocket-launching capabilities, push Hezbollah fighters away from the border and allow Israeli families who evacuated the northern region to return home, as NPR's Daniel Estrin reported on Morning Edition.

The Israeli military says its forces struck more than 300 targets, many of which it described as Hezbollah weapons storage depots. Strikes damaged several buildings inside populated areas in Lebanon's south as well as farther east in the country's Bekaa Valley, but at least one landed some 80 miles north of the border near the city of Byblos, according to Lebanon's state-run broadcaster.

Hezbollah has fired hundreds of rockets at Israel in recent days, following the explosion of thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies last week that killed dozens of people and injured thousands more mainly in Lebanon. Israel has not publicly acknowledged a role in the blasts. But a U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told NPR that Israel notified Washington it carried out last Tuesday's attacks in Lebanon.

Hezbollah's leadership said in a statement Monday it was targeting dozens of rockets at an Israeli military post in northern Israel. Residents in the city of Nazareth told NPR it was a ""scary night"" into early Monday morning, with ""rockets and interceptions over us all night.""

Israeli authorities acknowledge there have been repeated air raid sirens in the country's north, indicating incoming rocket fire from Lebanon.

On Friday, an airstrike over the Lebanese capital city, Beirut, killed at least 50 Hezbollah fighters and civilians, including children. Israel's military said that strike had targeted a senior Hezbollah commander.

Across villages and towns in southern Lebanon, residents have been departing for safer regions away from the border. Several months ago, Israeli military officials ordered residents living in communities on the Israeli side of that border to also evacuate as skirmishes and tit-for-tat missile barrages intensified.

The Israeli military spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, warned people living in southern and eastern Lebanon to leave their homes as the air campaign against Hezbollah's fighters and positions increases to widen.

Residents in southern regions received messages in Arabic instructing them to move away from known weapons storage sites controlled by Hezbollah, according to local Lebanese media, prompting a large migration of people inside Lebanon.

Cars filled the main road north from the southern city of Sidon, up the coastline toward Beirut, although some Israeli airstrikes have repeatedly landed dozens of miles inside Lebanese territory."

The Israeli military is carrying out extensive strikes in Lebanon this morning and has published a video warning some villagers to evacuate immediately if they suspect Hezbollah is hiding weapons in their area. This comes as Hezbollah landed rockets deeper into Israel and after last week's attack on Hezbollah by way of exploding pagers and walkie-talkies. The incidents mark the most significant escalation on the Israeli-Lebanese border in almost a year of war.

World leaders are at the United Nations this week in New York, and conversations are expected to focus on the Middle East. President Biden is expected to give a speech tomorrow. The high-level week will also include meetings on the sidelines to try to push forward diplomacy. Gaza and the escalating war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon are all parts of the world that need solutions addressed.

Police are looking for the people responsible for a mass shooting that left four people dead and at least 17 others injured over the weekend in Birmingham, Ala. The possible murder-for-hire incident happened Saturday night in a popular entertainment district, outside of a hookah bar where people were lined up to enter. Multiple suspects involved drove into the area, got out of the car, began shooting and then fled in the vehicle. This has the city's mayor, Randall Woodfin, talking about the need to solve America's gun violence epidemic.

NPR is visiting six key swing states that will likely decide this year's historic election. This week, Morning Edition is in Nevada to listen to voters about what matters to them and how that will affect their vote.

Nevada could help determine who wins the White House in November with its six Electoral College votes. Though that doesn't sound like many, it doesn't negate the state's importance. In the last two presidential elections, 15 of the state's 17 counties voted Republican. The two that didn't made up 90% of Nevada's population. For Republicans to make their mark and win, they'll have to focus on those two counties. Around 40% of registered voters in the state don't identify with a specific party, meaning candidates will have to find out if they lean left or right in order to reach them.

Here's a deeper dive into the voters' concerns heading into this election.

We all wash our bodies. The concept is simple enough. But when you get to the details... things can get complicated. How often you should wash? When you should get a new loofah?

"From Gaza to Ukraine, why do so many modern wars last so long?",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/nx-s1-5039157/from-gaza-to-ukraine-why-do-so-many-modern-wars-last-so-long,2024-09-23T10:07:01Z,"A Ukrainian rescue worker looks on at a burning electrical substation hit by a Russian bomb in the Dnipropetrovsk region in eastern Ukraine on Sept. 2. Evgeniy Maloletka/AP hide caption

Shortly after Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, Ukrainian war correspondent Andriy Tsaplienko was live on TV. The anchor asked him how long the fighting might last.

""I said it could take a couple of years to calm down the situation,"" Tsaplienko recalled. ""When the anchor heard it, he was really terrified on a live broadcast.""

In the 10 years since then, Tsaplienko has been detained and beaten by Russian troops. He's also suffered shrapnel wounds that left him with a limp. He's covered every twist and turn in the fighting -- and still doesn't know when the war will end.

""I don't want to say forever, but for a long time, maybe another next decade,"" he said in an interview in Ukraine's capital Kyiv.

The Ukraine-Russia war, and the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza, are both part of feuds with long histories. Ukraine declared independence from Russia in 1918, then lost a war in the years that followed. Ukraine didn't gain independence from Moscow until the 1991 Soviet Union breakup. Meanwhile, the Israel-Hamas battle is part of the larger Israeli-Palestinian dispute that also stretches back a century.

In both current wars, a common question is, ""When will the fighting end?"" But given the tortured history, it might be better to ask, ""Will it ever end?""

""Both of these conflicts have very, very, high stakes that are relatively indivisible,"" said Gideon Rose, who's with the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of How Wars End.

""Russia is trying to conquer Ukraine. Ukraine is trying to fight for its life. The Israelis are trying to suppress all attacks from Gaza and the Palestinians are trying to avoid being completely subjugated,"" said Rose, adding that this doesn't leave a lot of room for compromise.

These conflicts also reflect a harsh reality of many moderns wars. They can grind on inconclusively -- even when the fighting reaches the point where neither side can score a complete battlefield victory.

""Sometimes there is no solution for a decade or two,"" said Paul Salem, who's based in Beirut with the Middle East Institute. ""You've got to manage the problem. You got to contain it. You got to make sure we don't go into World War III.""

These current battlefield scenarios aren't new. In the past, some wars endured for many years, or even decades. But several factors contribute to making modern wars last a long time, and these two in particular.

First, weapons and technology have never flowed so freely. This means a smaller military can get its hands on more and better weapons than previously. Ukraine uses cheap drones to counter Russia's much larger traditional army.

""Drones are just a toy turned into a weapon,"" Andriy Tsaplienko. ""One drone can cost maybe up to $1,000, and you can attack a bigger target like a tank, and destroy the tank, which costs $3 million.""

In the Middle East, Israel receives the vast majority of its advanced weapons from the U.S. Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon used to fire short-range rockets that only threatened communities just across the border in southern and northern Israel.

But with help from Iran, those two groups have been firing thousands of rockets into Israel, and can now strike throughout much of the country.

A second key factor in both conflicts is how they have repeatedly defied lasting political solutions.

""It's not enough to have a military strategy,"" said Chuck Freilich, a former deputy national security advisor in Israel. ""You have to have a political one as well. And Israel hasn't had one for years and years, to my thinking, on the Palestinian issue.""

The Israelis and Palestinians were close to a political settlement way back in the year 2000. Today, a full-fledged peace deal appears more distant than ever.

Paul Salem notes that Israel used to fight traditional state-versus-state wars against neighboring Arab countries -- like Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Now Israel is trying to maintain long-term control over Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.

""You can win a war, but it's hard to win an occupation,"" said Salem. ""Beating a state and getting the state to say, 'OK, I lose,' or 'I'm going to stop,' is different than maintaining an occupation, which the Israelis have not managed to do sustainably.""

Meanwhile, Russian leader Vladimir Putin meddled in Ukraine's politics for years, seeking to place or keep a Kremlin-friendly leader in power in Kyiv. When that failed, Russia invaded, initially in 2014, and then again, on a much larger scale in 2022.

Leaders often have an incentive to keep fighting

Ultimately, most wars do end with negotiations, though the two sides tend to make a deal only after one or both have reached the point of exhaustion.

""We assume war is so terrible, therefore it must be the incentive of people to stop it,"" said Gideon Rose. ""That's not necessarily the case.""

He notes that leaders waging the wars often make very different calculations than soldiers and civilians bearing the brunt of the conflict.

""Somebody who initiates a war usually has a strong incentive to keep fighting, because unless he can get a real victory when it ends, he's kind of in trouble,"" said Rose.

Leaders who lose wars tend to be tossed out of power, and the potential consequences can be even more serious.

The International Criminal Court in The Hague has issued an arrest warrant for Russia's Vladimir Putin, and prosecutors are seeking warrants for Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.

And in times of war, leaders often pursue goals that may be beyond their reach. Israel's Netanyahu calls for ""total victory"" over Hamas. He wants to end the group's rule over Gaza, and its threat to Israel, once and for all.

Yet Chuck Freilich said Hamas and its allies, Iran and Hezbollah, see mere survival as a victory, and are pursuing their own long-term plans.

""This is a multi-decade war in which there will be round-after-round. And they [Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran] are fully cognizant of that,"" he said.

Freilich also added this sobering note.

""I would say that Iran is an enemy which is too big, too far away, too powerful and maybe too sophisticated in its thinking for Israel to be able to defeat it,"" he said. ""Now, I believe Israel can defend itself against Iran, but I'm not sure that we can defeat it as we did to the Arab countries.""

In the Russia-Ukraine war, Putin describes Ukraine as not being a real country, a place that should be part of Russia.

Andriy Tsaplienko, the Ukrainian war correspondent, says this is exactly why Ukraine keeps fighting.

""We realize this war is crucially important for Ukrainians,"" he said. ""This is the existential war. We will live or we won't live. That's it. I mean, as a nation in general. So that's why we will fight to the end."""
Israel tells Lebanese to leave area where Hezbollah stores arms as it launches strikes,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/g-s1-24128/israel-tells-lebanese-to-leave-area-where-hezbollah-stores-arms-as-it-launches-strikes,2024-09-23T08:01:27Z,"JERUSALEM -- The Israeli military on Monday called on residents of southern Lebanon to immediately evacuate homes and other buildings where Hezbollah stores weapons and said it was carrying out ""extensive strikes"" against the militant group.

It was the first warning of its kind in nearly a year of steadily escalating conflict and came after a particularly heavy exchange of fire on Sunday. Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in retaliation for strikes that killed a top commander and dozens of fighters

The escalating strikes and counterstrikes have raised fears of an all-out war, even as Israel is still battling the Palestinian Hamas in Gaza and trying to return scores of hostages taken in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Hezbollah has vowed to continue its strikes in solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group, while Israel says it is committed to returning calm to the border.

An Israeli military official said Israel is focused on aerial operations and has no immediate plans for a ground operation. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with regulations, said the strikes are aimed at curbing Hezbollah's ability to launch more strikes into Israel.

Lebanese media reported that residents received text messages urging them to move away from any building where Hezbollah stores arms until further notice.

""If you are in a building housing weapons for Hezbollah, move away from the village until further notice,"" the Arabic message reads, according to Lebanese media.

It was not immediately clear how many people would be affected by the Israeli orders. Communities on both sides of the border have largely emptied out because of the near-daily exchanges of fire.

Israel has accused Hezbollah of transforming entire communities in the south into militant bases, with hidden rocket launchers and other infrastructure. That could lead it to wage an especially heavy bombing campaign, even if no ground forces move in.

The military said it had targeted more than 150 militant sites early Monday. Residents of different villages in southern Lebanon posted photos on social media of airstrikes and large plumes of smoke. The state-run National News Agency also reported airstrikes on different areas.

An Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb on Friday killed a top Hezbollah military commander and more than a dozen fighters, as well as dozens of civilians, including women and children.

Last week, thousands of communications devices, used mainly by Hezbollah members, exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000. Lebanon blamed Israel for the attacks, but Israel did not confirm or deny its responsibility.

Hezbollah began firing into Israel a day after the Oct. 7 attack in what it said was an attempt to pin down Israeli forces to help Palestinian fighters in Gaza. Israel has retaliated with airstrikes, and the conflict has steadily intensified over the past year.

The fighting has killed hundreds of people in Lebanon, dozens in Israel and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border. It has also sparked brush fires that have destroyed agriculture and scarred the landscape.

Israel has vowed to push Hezbollah back from the border so its citizens can return to their homes, saying it prefers to do so diplomatically but is willing to use force. Hezbollah has said it will keep up its attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but that appears increasingly elusive as the war nears its anniversary.

Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 captives are still held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead, after most of the rest were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November.

Israel's offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and fighters in its count. It says women and children make up a little over half of those killed. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence."
Third-party voters face a tough choice in a tight election,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/22/nx-s1-5113108/third-party-voters,2024-09-22T17:46:52Z,"Voters considering a third-party candidate face the same dilemma every presidential election cycle: should they vote their values and get behind a candidate who likely won't win, or settle and support a Democrat or Republican nominee they see as flawed.

This year, Pope Francis weighed in.

""One must choose the lesser of two evils,"" he said during a news conference on the papal plane in September. He didn't say who -- between Vice President Kamala Harris or Former President Donald Trump -- was less evil. But he did describe both candidates as anti-life, citing Harris' views on abortion and Trump's on immigration.

Still, many voters can't swallow supporting either candidate. Every four years, millions of American support third-party candidates. While their candidates don't win, these voters can be influential in elections with razor-thin margins.

""It's extremely close and the third party candidates, though very low in percentage numbers, are still factors,"" Tim Malloy, polling analyst for the Quinnipiac University Poll, said. ""When you are looking at a race that could be determined by three or four percentage points, or maybe less, they are still there.""

Most polls, including the latest one from NPR/PBS News/Marist, show Trump and Harris locked in a tight race.

Third-party voters are often dedicated to single issues, Malloy said. Topics like abortion, the environment or the war in Gaza ""can determine where they go,"" he said.

GOP's 'messing around on' abortion

John Quinn of Maryland, is a millennial and self described pro-life voter. This year, he plans to vote for the American Solidarity Party -- a Christian democratic political party that opposes abortion rights.

Quinn said he knows candidates Peter Sonski and Lauren Onak -- the ASP's ticket -- will lose, but he says he believes his vote means something.

""If the American Solidarity Party's few votes for a truly pro-life vision are what costs the Republican ticket the election, hopefully in 2028 they take pro-lifers more seriously and aren't messing around on the issue the way they are this year,"" Quinn said.

Since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and handed abortion back to the states, reproductive rights have become a galvanizing political position. During the 2022 midterms, voters supported the abortion-rights option on ballot measures in five states -- including Kentucky and Montana, which typically have more conservative voters

Harris has made reproductive rights a key part of her candidacy. Meanwhile, Trump has flip-flopped on his abortion stance. Just last month, he indicated he would vote in favor of an abortion-access amendment in Florida, before later clarifying he'll vote no.

For Quinn, these two options left him no choice but to vote third party.

""I wouldn't even know how to weigh which is the lesser of two evils,"" Quinn said.

It's unclear how many voters Trump stands to lose over his position on abortions, but Onak -- who is the vice presidential candidate on the ASP ticket -- said her campaign has seen an increase in interest.

""After the GOP changed its platform language on abortion, we saw an increase in people reaching out to us, following us on social media, volunteering for the campaign,"" Onak said. ""We saw an increase in donations.""

In July, the Republican Party, in new platform langue, removed references to supporting a national 20-week ban and a constitutional amendment restricting abortion.

Beyond abortion, voters are also struggling with the Republican party's shifting economic and foreign policy position. Former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is a self-described ""Reagan conservative"" who supports Ukraine in its war against Russia and believes in the rule of law. He also unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination this cycle.

""I expect to write in a good Republicans name on the ballot,"" Hutchinson said. ""I'm going to stick with my pledge that I'm not going to support a convicted felon [Trump], and that's the reasons for it.""

Several high-profile Republicans, including Trump-era officials, have said they will back Harris, but Hutchinson said he believes many Republicans are in the same position as him: and will write in the name of another candidate.

Green Party 'earned my vote' over war in Gaza

In white text on a black background, Anton Navaso posted a paragraph on Instagram explaining his support for the Green Party's Jill Stein -- and his rejection of both Harris and Trump.

""First and foremost, I'm opposed to both the Republican and Democratic support for the Israeli government's actions in Palestine, and I like that the Green Party is too,"" Navaso said in a phone call while packing up for a move to Seattle.

Navazo voted for Biden in the last election. He has little hope Stein will win in 2024, but said it could matter for 2028.

""If either the Democrats or the Republicans think that the Green Party or a third-party vote is why they lost the election, then I think that the next election cycle, they need to try harder to earn the votes of those people,"" Navazo said.

Roman Fritz, a 20-year-old college student in Wisconsin, said he largely agreed with Navaso, but is conflicted.

""In November, I think I plan to vote for Harris,"" Fritz said pausing. ""I do plan to vote for Harris. However, I'm not going to campaign for Harris. I'm not going to encourage anybody to vote for Harris.""

Fritz was the only delegate from the badger state to vote ""present"" during the nomination of Harris at the Democratic National Convention. And he supports the Green Party's Stein on the issues, but can't stomach a Trump victory .

""I think that the only candidate that could win are Trump or Kamala Harris,"" Fritz said. ""Kamala Harris is the better of the two. My heart definitely, like, isn't fully there just because of the lack of a coherent cease-fire plan"" in Gaza.

Last Thursday, leaders of the ""uncommitted"" movement, a Democratic group that opposes Biden's policy toward Israel and Gaza, said they won't endorse Harris -- but encouraged Americans to vote against Trump.

Hundreds of thousands of voters cast ""uncommitted"" ballots during the Democratic primary in several states -- including Michigan and Wisconsin. Biden was at the top of the ticket then, and while Harris has garnered support from younger more liberal voters, it remains unclear how many will vote against Harris over her support of Israel.

'Wednesday morning' thought experiment

Single-issue voters feeling left in the lurch by both Harris and Trump face a dilemma in an election with high stakes.

Archon Fung, a Harvard political science professor who teaches a course titled Politics and Ethics in Unstable Times -- offered a solution to voters caught in indecision.

""If you're not in a close state, it's probably OK to really vote your values and vote for a third-party candidate,"" Fung said because that vote won't throw the election either way. ""But if you're in a state that is very close Electoral-College wise, then it's a much, much more difficult decision for you.""

Regardless, he said voters have to ""own that choice"" if they cast a ballot for a third-party candidate -- say Stein -- in a swing state like Wisconsin and their least preferred candidate wins -- Trump, for example.

In this case, Fung suggested the voter close their eyes and imagine it's Nov. 6.

""It's Wednesday morning and it's a Trump win in Wisconsin, and Wisconsin is decisive in the Electoral College,"" Fung said. ""What do you say to yourself when you look yourself in the mirror?""

If the answer is ""I'm OK"" -- then vote third party, Fung said. But if your answer is ""what have I done?"", then vote for the best between the major candidates.

""I would like for everyone to kind of run through that thought experiment,"" the Harvard professor said. ""What do I say to myself on Wednesday morning?"""
"Dozens of rockets fired into Israel from Lebanon, IDF says",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/22/g-s1-24085/dozens-of-rockets-fired-into-israel-from-lebanon-idf-says,2024-09-22T05:58:32Z,"NAHARIYA, Israel -- Over 100 rockets were fired into Israel from Lebanon early Sunday, with some landing near the northern city of Haifa, as Israel and the Hezbollah militant group appeared to be spiraling toward all-out war following months of escalating tensions.

The rockets streaked over a wider and deeper area of northern Israel than previous volleys and set off air raid sirens across the region. The Israeli military said rockets had been fired ""toward civilian areas,"" pointing to a possible escalation after previous barrages had mainly been aimed at military targets.

Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said it treated four people for shrapnel wounds, including a 76-year-old man who was moderately wounded near Haifa, where buildings were damaged and cars set on fire. It was not immediately clear if the damage was caused by a rocket or an Israeli interceptor.

The barrage came after an Israeli airstrike in Beirut killed at least 37 people, including one of Hezbollah's top leaders as well as women and children. Hezbollah was already reeling from a sophisticated attack that caused thousands of personal devices to explod e just days earlier.

The Israeli military said it carried out a wave of strikes across southern Lebanon over the past 24 hours, hitting some 400 militant sites, including rocket launchers.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire since the outbreak of the war in Gaza nearly a year ago, when the militant group began firing rockets in solidarity with the Palestinians and its fellow Iran-backed ally Hamas. The low-level fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the frontier.

Neither side is believed to be seeking a war. But in recent weeks, Israel has shifted its focus from Gaza to Lebanon and vowed to bring back calm to the border so that its citizens can return to their homes. Hezbollah has said it will only halt its attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which appears increasingly elusive as long-running negotiations led by the United States, Egypt and Qatar have repeatedly bogged down.

The war in Gaza began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people and took around 250 hostage. They are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Gaza's Health Ministry says over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed. It does not say how many were fighters but says women and children make up over half of the dead.

Israeli media reported that rockets fired from Lebanon early Sunday were intercepted in the areas of Haifa and Nazareth, which are further south than most of the rocket fire to date. Israel canceled school across the north, deepening the sense of crisis.

Hezbollah said it had launched dozens of Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 missiles -- a new type of weapon the group had not used before -- at the Ramat David airbase, southeast of Haifa, ""in response to the repeated Israeli attacks that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs.""

In July, the group released a video with what it said was footage it had filmed of the base with surveillance drones.

Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate against Israel for a wave of explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 37 people -- including two children -- and wounding around 3,000. The attacks were widely blamed on Israel, which has not confirmed or denied responsibility.

On Friday, an Israeli airstrike took down an eight-story building in a densely populated neighborhood in Beirut's southern suburbs as Hezbollah members were meeting in the basement, according to Israel. Among those killed was Ibrahim Akil, a top Hezbollah official who commanded the group's special forces unit, known as the Radwan Force.

Lebanon's health minister, Firass Abiad, told reporters Saturday that at least seven women and three children were killed in Friday's airstrike on the building. He said another 68 people were injured, including 15 who were hospitalized.

It was the deadliest strike on Beirut since the bruising monthlong war in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah, and the casualty count could grow, with 23 people still missing, a government official said.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the attack broke up the group's chain of command while taking out Akil, who he said was responsible for Israeli deaths. He had been on the U.S. most wanted list for years, with a $7 million reward, over his alleged role in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and the taking of American and German hostages in Lebanon during the civil war in the 1980s."
Israel raids and shuts down Al Jazeera's bureau in Ramallah in the West Bank,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/22/g-s1-24083/israel-shuts-down-al-jazeera-bureau-ramallah-west-bank,2024-09-22T05:19:31Z,"This image made from video provided by Al Jazeera English shows Israeli troops raiding their bureau in Ramallah, West Bank, Sunday, Sept. 22, 2024. Al Jazeera/AP/Al Jazeera hide caption

Israeli troops raided the offices of the satellite news network Al Jazeera in the Israeli-occupied West Bank early Sunday, ordering the bureau to shut down amid a widening campaign by Israel targeting the Qatar-funded broadcaster as it covers the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.

Al Jazeera aired footage of Israeli troops live on its Arabic-language channel ordering the office to be shut for 45 days. It follows an extraordinary order issued in May that saw Israeli police raid Al Jazeera's broadcast position in East Jerusalem, seizing equipment there, preventing its broadcasts in Israel and blocking its websites.

The move marked the first time Israel has ever shuttered a foreign news outlet operating in the country. However, Al Jazeera has continued operating in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, territories that the Palestinians hope to have for their future state.

There was no immediate acknowledgement of the shutdown by Israeli forces. The Israeli military did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. Al Jazeera denounced the move as it continued broadcasting live from Amman in neighboring Jordan.

Armed Israeli troops entered the office and told a reporter live on air it would be shut down, saying that staff needed to leave immediately. The network later aired what appeared to be Israel troops tearing down a banner on a balcony used by the Al Jazeera office. Al Jazeera said it bore an image of Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American journalist shot dead by Israeli forces in May 2022.

""There is a court ruling for closing down Al Jazeera for 45 days,"" an Israeli soldier told Al Jazeera's local bureau chief, Walid al-Omari, in the live footage. ""I ask you to take all the cameras and leave the office at this moment.""

Al-Omari later said that Israeli troops began confiscating documents and equipment in the bureau, as tear gas and gunshots could be seen and heard in the area.

The Palestinians secured limited self-rule in Gaza and parts of the occupied West Bank through the 1993 Oslo agreements. While Israel occupies and controls vast areas of the West Bank, Ramallah is under full Palestinian political and security control, making the Israeli raid on the Al Jazeera office that much more surprising.

The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate denounced the Israeli raid and order.

""This arbitrary military decision is a new aggression against journalistic work and media outlets,"" it said.

The Palestinian Authority administers parts of the West Bank. Its forces were driven from Gaza when Hamas seized power in 2007, and it has no power there.

The network has reported on the Israeli-Hamas war nonstop since the militants' initial cross-border attack on Oct. 7 and has maintained 24-hour coverage in the Gaza Strip amid Israel's grinding ground offensive that has killed and wounded members of its staff. It remains unclear whether the Israeli military would target Al Jazeera's operation in Gaza as well.

While including on-the-ground reporting of the war's casualties, Al Jazeera's Arabic arm often publishes verbatim video statements from Hamas and other regional militant groups.

That has led to Israeli claims by officials up to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the network has ""harmed Israel's security and incited against soldiers."" Those claims have been vehemently denied by Al Jazeera, whose main funder, Qatar, has been key in negotiations between Israel and Hamas to reach a cease-fire to end the war.

An order closing Al Jazeera in Israel has been repeatedly renewed in the time since, but it hadn't as of yet ordered the Ramallah offices closed.

The Israeli government has taken action against individual reporters over the decades since its founding in 1948, but broadly allows for a rambunctious media scene that includes foreign bureaus from around the world, even from Arab nations. It also blocked the foreign broadcasts of the Hezbollah-affiliated, Beirut-based Al Mayadeen news channel at the start of the war.

Criticism of Al Jazeera is not new. The U.S. government singled out the broadcaster during America's occupation of Iraq after its 2003 invasion toppled dictator Saddam Hussein and for airing videos of the late al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden.

Al Jazeera has been closed or blocked by other Mideast governments.

Most notably in 2013, Egyptian authorities raided a luxury hotel used by Al Jazeera as an operating base after the military takeover that followed mass protests against President Mohammed Morsi. Three Al Jazeera staff members received 10-year prison sentences, but were released in 2015 following widespread international criticism.

The Israel-Hamas war began when Hamas-led fighters killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in an Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. They abducted another 250 people and are still holding around 100 hostages. Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed at least 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between fighters and civilians.

The closure of Al Jazeera's Ramallah office also comes as tensions continue to rise over a possible expansion of the war to Lebanon, where electronic devices exploded last week in a likely sabotage campaign by Israel targeting the Shiite militia Hezbollah.

The explosions Tuesday and Wednesday killed at least 37 people -- including two children -- and wounded around 3,000 others."

The Secret Service has come under renewed scrutiny, as this incident follows the July shooting at one of his rallies in Butler, Pennsylvania. The acting director says he wants a ""paradigm shift"" for the agency.

Major coalitions made their feelings on the election known this week. More than 100 past Republican national security leaders signed a statement supporting Vice President Harris. But one of the country's most powerful unions, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said it won't endorse a candidate this year. The group backed Democratic candidates in the last six presidential elections.

The Federal Reserve announced Wednesday after its September meeting that it has cut its main interest rate by half of a percent. It's the first cut to interest rates since the beginning of the pandemic in March 20-20.

Meanwhile, two waves of deadly explosions involving pagers, walkie talkies, and other electronic devices rocked Lebanon and Syria this week. Israeli officials notified the U.S. that the country was going to carry out an operation in Lebanon on Tuesday but did not give any details about what was planned.

On Monday, a European Union naval mission said salvagers successfully towed a Greek-flagged oil tanker that was on fire for weeks in the Red Sea to safety. It was carrying one million barrels of crude oil. The tanker was attacked by Houthi rebels in early September. Houthi rebels continue to threaten ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza.

China's legislature this week passed a new policy that would raise the retirement age for the country's workers. Starting next year, the retirement ages will be raised over the course of 15 years. It will go from 60 to 63 for men. For women, it will depend on their trade. The retirement age for women in blue-collar jobs will go from 50 to 55. For women in white-collar jobs, the retirement age will go from 55 to 58."

Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images hide caption

Former President Donald Trump is casting himself as Israel's ""protector"" and warning Jewish voters against supporting his rival, Vice President Harris.

Trump addressed the Israeli-American Council summit in Washington, D.C, on Thursday, during an evening focused on commemorating the October 7 attacks that sparked Israel's war with Hamas.

Speaking to a mostly friendly crowd, Trump touted his past support for Israel and, without providing evidence, claimed that the Jewish state will soon cease to exist unless he's elected.

""It's total annihilation -- that's what you're talking about,"" Trump said. ""You have a big protector in me. You don't have a protector on the other side.""

Trump also accused Harris of ""pandering"" to Hamas supporters and said ""Jewish people have no excuse"" for supporting his Democratic rival. Trump has a long history of accusing Jewish Democrats of being disloyal to Israel.

Harris has said that she will support Israel's right to defend itself while also calling the suffering in Gaza ""devastating.""

The Hamas attack on October 7 killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took more than 200 hostages, including some American citizens. Since then, health officials in Gaza say more than 40,000 Palestinians have died.

Trump's address to the Israeli-American Council comes just weeks after a 23-year-old Israeli-American, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, was found shot dead in a Hamas tunnel in Gaza, along with the bodies of five other hostages.

Other featured speakers Thursday night included Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York and Republican megadonor Miriam Adelson."

JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: I'm Joanna Kakissis at a school called Lyceum No. 153 in Kyiv, Ukraine. And right behind me, children in the first grade are drawing right on the asphalt. They're drawing footballs, Ukrainian flags, flowers.

Hi (laughter).

About 800 students from grades one to 11 attend this school. This past summer, it was damaged when a Russian missile hit a children's hospital across the street. Veteran Alexander Artemenko (ph) teaches English. He has a zigzag scar on his arm.

ALEXANDER ARTEMENKO: Russians attacked, and I was wounded by a tank.

KAKISSIS: He says the dads of several students are on the front line.

ARTEMENKO: It's quite difficult for them to concentrate. They can't study because they're worried about their dads, and they know where they are. I think they found me a person who can understand the problem and the troubles which they have.

KAKISSIS: Casius Torojuc (ph), also 16, says air raid sirens often interrupt classes. Students have to run to a shelter underground.

CASIUS TOROJUC: We've been doing it for three years. It is a part of my life. And we don't have a choice.

(SOUNDBITE OF SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

KAKISSIS: She says she's lucky she has a school. Russian strikes have destroyed almost 200 Ukrainian schools since the full-scale war began.

DANIEL ESTRIN, BYLINE: I'm Daniel Estrin, NPR correspondent covering the Gaza war. There are no functioning schools in Gaza now. Most have been destroyed, damaged or turned into shelters. But there is this.

UNIDENTIFIED SCHOOLTEACHER #2: Morning, everybody.

UNIDENTIFIED STUDENTS: (Singing) How are you?

ESTRIN: English class in a tent. There are a few dozen makeshift classrooms like this in displaced persons tent camps.

YAZAN: I am Yazan (ph). I'm 10 years old. My dream is to stop war and back to school soon.

ESTRIN: NPR producer Anas Baba met him with a notebook in the tent.

ESTRIN: Some of the kids in this tent lost a parent in the war. Safa Al Arami (ph) is one of the volunteer teachers.

SAFA AL ARAMI: We give each other strength. And I hope to keep the educational process going on and to save our children future.

ESTRIN: Gaza has about 1 million children, half of Gaza's population - 99% of those children are not going to any of these makeshift classes, according to the U.N. agency UNICEF. Spokeswoman Tess Ingram visited Gaza this year.

TESS INGRAM: There was one boy in particular who said, kind of with shock, well, I can go back, can't I? And that was upsetting because he didn't even know whether school would resume at any point in time and whether that was something that he could return to one day.

ESTRIN: Many children spend their day collecting water and food and have forgotten how to read and write.

UNIDENTIFIED STUDENTS: (Singing in Arabic).

ESTRIN: In the morning, our colleague Anas Baba recorded this singing from a tent class. And in the afternoon, he rushed to the scene of an Israeli airstrike on a United Nations school sheltering families.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: (Crying).

ESTRIN: It's become a common scene. Israel says it's targeting Hamas militants. It says they're increasingly hiding in school shelters. Gaza first responders say it's the fifth time this particular school shelter has been hit.

EMMANUEL AKINWOTU, BYLINE: I'm Emmanuel Akinwotu, reporting from Sudan's wartime capital, Port Sudan. I'm at a school here, but like many across the country, it's now a displacement camp. It's run by UNICEF and hosts hundreds of families. They're among the more than 10 million people internally displaced from the war. After almost 18 months of fighting, the displacement crisis is the worst in the world.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

AKINWOTU: At a tent within the school grounds, aid workers have gathered dozens of children, clapping and dancing to pop music, working on a group performance. Since the camp opened, UNICEF staff have been working to keep the children learning and active.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

UNIDENTIFIED MUSICAL ARTIST: (Singing in non-English language).

AKINWOTU: The school term in Sudan would normally start next month, but the war has made this an unlikely prospect. According to UNICEF, 19 million school-aged children here currently have no access to formal education. The war and the prospect of famine has put learning on hold not just because schools have been repurposed, but alongside their pupils, their teachers have also been displaced. An even darker side of the war sees the increasing sexual violence against children and the use of child soldiers.

Several children who were enlisted to fight for the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, who are at war with Sudan's army, have been arrested by the military. And on the road from Port Sudan towards the capital, Khartoum, our NPR team saw a number of young boys, teenagers, carrying rifles, standing at checkpoints. Several actors have exploited children during the war.

UNIDENTIFIED STUDENTS: (Singing in non-English language).

AKINWOTU: At the former school in Port Sudan, these activities offer a precious semblance of normal life and joy in an otherwise desperate context. But it's not enough to fill the void left by so many school closures. For many in Sudan, the chance of a carefree childhood has vanished in the space of 18 months.

"Uncommitted movement doesn't endorse Harris, but asks supporters to vote against Trump",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/19/g-s1-23736/uncommitted-movement-no-endorsement-harris-trump-2024,2024-09-19T17:39:44Z,"The leaders of the ""uncommitted"" movement, which grew out of Democratic opposition to President Biden's policy towards Israel and Gaza, will not endorse Vice President Harris for president, but urged supporters to ""vote against"" former President Donald Trump and ""avoid"" third party candidates.

""Harris's unwillingness to shift on unconditional weapons policy or to even make a clear campaign statement in support of upholding existing U.S. and international human rights law has made it impossible for us to endorse her,"" organizers of the Uncommitted National Movement said in a statement.

""At this time, our movement 1) cannot endorse Vice President Harris; 2) opposes a Donald Trump presidency, whose agenda includes plans to accelerate the killing in Gaza while intensifying the suppression of anti-war organizing; and 3) is not recommending a third-party vote in the Presidential election, especially as third party votes in key swing states could help inadvertently deliver a Trump presidency given our country's broken electoral college system,"" the statement continued.

The uncommitted movement grew out of the ""Listen to Michigan"" campaign ahead of that state's February presidential primary. Its goal was to send a message to Biden that he needed to do more to prevent civilian deaths in Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of voters eventually cast uncommitted ballots throughout the Democratic primary in several states.

Organizers' key demands are for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and an end to U.S. weapons transfers to Israel. When Harris replaced Biden at the top of the ticket, they initially expressed optimism that Harris would be more open to their demands, providing a ""window of opportunity.""

But the group was angered when their request to have a Palestinian-American speak at the Democratic National Convention was denied. Organizers had also given the Harris campaign a Sept. 15 deadline to respond to requests to meet with Palestinian-American families in Michigan who had lost loved ones in Gaza. Abbas Alawieh, a co-founder of the movement, said the campaign's response was ""not satisfactory.""

In a press conference after the announcement, leaders stressed that they are urging voters to ""block"" a second Trump term. But telling voters who have lost loved ones in Gaza to support Harris, Alawieh said, would be ""inappropriate.""

Alawieh called the non-endorsement ""something we have to do.""

""We know how dangerous Donald Trump is,"" he said. ""There was no way, ever, that our movement...would recommend a vote that would specifically help Donald Trump.""

""We said to [disenchanted voters] that the way that we would endorse vice president Harris is if she moved her policy, or if she turned the page to a new approach, and she just hasn't done that yet,"" Alaweih said.

A Harris campaign spokesperson said in a statement, ""The vice president is committed to work to earn every vote, unite our country, and to be a President for all Americans. She will continue working to bring the war in Gaza to an end in a way where Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination."""
10 undecided voters explain why they haven't picked a side in this election,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/19/nx-s1-5118393/undecided-voters-kamala-harris-donald-trump,2024-09-19T09:07:33Z,"People watch the presidential debate between Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump during a debate watch party at Penn Social on Sept. 10 in Washington, D.C. Alex Wong/Getty Images hide caption

Most people have decided who they are going to vote for. Former President Donald Trump is well known and polarizing -- people either love him or hate him. Vice President Harris is famous, but voters say they don't know her as well.

Polls show an incredibly tight race between them, and a handful of swing voters could decide the election, depending on who they vote for or if they decide to stay home.

Only a tiny slice of the electorate is considered persuadable -- anywhere from 6% or less to the low teens.

There were nearly four dozen undecided voters in the NPR/PBS News/Marist poll in the last four months who gave permission to call them back to follow up. To understand their current thinking and motivations, NPR tried them all and got in touch with 10 by phone in the days following the Harris-Trump debate. What we found was notable.

First, the debate was important for Harris. Most who watched said she performed better than Trump. They were not all moved to vote for her as a result, but four who seemed to need a degree of reassurance about Harris are now voting for her or leaning Harris' direction after the debate.

And while undecided voters often have unique reasons for what influences their votes, there was a clear gender divide. All four who say they are now voting for or leaning toward Harris are women. That also reflects the wide gender gap seen in polls between the candidates.

The other six -- one woman and five men -- were a mix. Five said they likely won't be voting for Harris, most citing the economy or immigration as reasons. One other said he is still truly undecided, but said prices are a major concern. Two are leaning toward Trump; another said she aligns more with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.; a self-described progressive said he doesn't like Harris' stance on the war in Gaza; and one other, a conservative, said he might not vote at all.

Many did not want to use their full names; some didn't want us to use any name at all. They cited security concerns. They said in this political environment, they were apprehensive about giving out too much personally identifiable information.

Here's what they had to say:

On the debate, Brady said, ""Kamala [Harris] did a better job articulating her points, obviously.""

He added: ""I don't want to go through another four years of a Trump presidency.""

But his vote is largely contingent on his personal financial situation, and he noted, ""Things have gotten more expensive.""

""I have probably a middle-class income for my family,"" he said, ""and it doesn't feel like it's getting any easier -- even as my wife and I have advanced in our careers.""

Brady said he aligned more with former President Barack Obama, and said he doesn't ""like her policies"" on the economy.

Asked what specifically he doesn't like, he said, ""I can't say I'm super knowledgeable about the specifics, but from a how-our-family-is-feeling standpoint, just not sure.""

Lee did not like how ABC handled the debate, specifically the fact-checking. He felt the moderators ""teamed up on Trump.""

He felt Harris did almost too well, saying it was ""almost like rehearsed."" But he said he ""never got any message from Harris"" and said she ""skirted issues,"" including the Biden administration's ""inability to stop the flow of migrants"" and the economy.

""Trump stuck his foot in his mouth multiple times,"" Lee said, though.

He said he wanted to see Trump, whom he trusts more on the economy, debate again and was unaware that Trump had said he would not do another debate with Harris. When told that, Lee said he was ""disappointed.""

He said he's ""not a big Republican, not a big Democrat."" He voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders, the progressive independent from Vermont, in the 2016 primary and is now leaning toward Trump, independent Cornel West or the Green Party's Jill Stein (not from an environmental standpoint, however, because he thinks the Green New Deal ""went too far"").

""But I don't want to piss away my vote,"" he said, pointing out that he is leaning most toward Trump because of that.

Of the debate, the respondent said, ""I was like, OK, who are these people? They were like bad actors. Kamala, suddenly she was so articulate when it's usually word salad. There was something weird going on there.""

Trump, on the other hand, she said, it was like ""something was in his water,"" and he wasn't his usual self.

She said this of her ideal ticket: ""If RFK [Jr.] was on the ticket with [former Rep.] Tulsi Gabbard [of Hawaii], it would have been a slam dunk for me.""

Of Trump and Harris, she said: ""I am reluctant to vote for Trump, but I have absolutely no confidence about Kamala Harris' ability to do anything about the border at all. We're suffering for it.""

She said she didn't vote in the 2020 election, and that she doesn't trust Trump fully, because he signed the CARES act, a COVID relief bill.

""He is aesthetically lacking,"" she said, laughing, but ""the major Trump haters are missing the whole point. They're not looking at issues; they're looking at personality.""

Proffitt did not see the debate or follow news about it afterward. She said she voted for Trump in 2016 and did not vote for president in 2020. But she is resolved to do so this time.

""I'm going to go out and will vote this year,"" said Proffitt, a mother of five. ""It's a right I should exercise. I want to show my kids that's a right.""

Of the candidates, she said she doesn't know much at this point about Harris' policy positions, but she is leaning her direction because of Trump.

""I feel Trump's disrespect for women is not befitting of a president,"" she said. ""He is not someone I want my girls to look up to as a role model.""

About Harris, she added: ""She's a woman, and maybe having a female president would do the country some good. ... I gave the other guy a try, why not give her a try?""

A Republican and former interior decorator and rancher, Bohlman said she made the switch to vote Democratic when Trump came on the scene.

""No, I have not voted for Trump, nor will I ever,"" Bohlman said. ""I have never been able to stand the guy since he came into the picture years ago. I even took a book away from my 16-year-old son that [Trump] had written about making money. He didn't make his money; he inherited it and lost it. He's not a good businessman. He's not anything but a narcissistic misogynist.""

She was undecided in May, but is now locked in for Harris. She said she saw the debate and thought Harris performed well.

""I will vote Democrat,"" Bohlman said. ""I will vote for Kamala. I liked the way she came across in the debate. She is a very astute, intelligent woman, who knows exactly where she's going. She doesn't hinge her judgment on whether she likes someone or not.""

She went on to cite the overturning of Roe v. Wade abortion protections, which she blames squarely on Trump, as another motivating factor for her to vote for Harris.

""I am so angry about that,"" she said of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision. ""It's so unfair that a bunch of men are making decisions for women. I think it's horrific.""

Bohlman also brought up the siege at the Capitol on Jan. 6, which she said was ""appalling,"" called out GOP leaders' hypocrisy in criticizing Trump initially and then trying to get back in his good graces, and she noted that she has lots of family members who are ""adamantly pro-Trump.""

""They do not look at the whole picture,"" she said of Trump supporters. ""I'm sure after this second [assassination] attempt, they'll be saying, 'God is protecting him.' It's just a bunch of crock.""

Annette is a registered independent who generally votes Democratic. In June, she was undecided if she would vote at all because she was concerned about President Biden's age and ability to do the job.

""I didn't realize how bad he was,"" Annette said after watching Biden in the June 27 debate. ""He lost his oomph. He made Trump look good.""

But now, she is enthusiastically backing Harris.

""I would never vote for him,"" Annette said of Trump. She called herself ""happily surprised, maybe not surprised, but happy with [Harris'] presentation"" at the debate. Annette said Harris proved she's ""perfectly capable.""

Remensnyder is a registered independent, but described herself as a ""Republican at heart.""

""I really liked Nikki Haley,"" Remensnyder said. ""I was hoping she would run [as the Republican nominee].""

The retired audiologist voted for Trump in 2016 and then Biden in 2020. Remensnyder said she owned three doctors' practices. As a business owner, she said, ""I thought I could trust Trump. He was a businessman, but he was an absolute disaster"" from the start, Remensnyder said.

And ""as a medical professional,"" she said she thought ""what he did with COVID was embarrassing.""

But this time around, Remensnyder said she was ""despondent"" at the choice between Biden and Trump. She felt Biden's mental fitness had declined too much to do the job any longer.

""I couldn't trust him to run the government. ... It really scared me,"" she said.

When Harris entered, Remensnyder gave her a shot.

""I watched her,"" she said. ""I listened to her. I am a woman, and women's needs are first, even before party.""

Remensnyder is pro-abortion rights and said she liked how Harris has advocated for women's reproductive freedom, and she liked Harris' experience as a litigator.

Remensnyder said she thought Harris did fairly well in the debate, but ""did not answer most of the questions. She did skirt the issues. I don't think she's the best. I really, really wanted Nikki Haley.""

But she added that she is ""confident"" in Harris' ability to do the job, though not confident she will win because of the clear gender divide she sees. Remensnyder said her husband and son are conservative and tell her they are leaving the presidential line on the ballot blank.

""They can't force themselves to vote Democratic,"" she said.

A college student born in Brazil, he described himself as a progressive whose top issue is the war in Gaza.

""Donald Trump won't get my vote,"" Thiago said, pointing out that Trump's position on the war is a nonstarter.

After Biden dropped out, he was waiting to see what Harris would do, but Thiago said her posture on Gaza ""hasn't been a great one.""

""I'm still undecided whether it's worth it to vote for Kamala, given her not-great stance on Palestine,"" Thiago said, ""and given she's reaching out more to conservatives than more-progressive members of her party.""

He watched the debate and said Trump was ""off the ball in the same way Biden seemed entirely way too old and needing to step aside. Trump seemed to inherit that and seemed rattled by Kamala.""

Even if you're on Trump's side, Thiago said, it was ""obvious"" that ""Trump didn't do great in that debate.""

Thiago said he's still going to vote down-ballot, but short of Harris saying she will cut off weapons shipments to Israel, he likely will leave the presidential line blank.

A registered Republican, Gideon voted for Trump in 2016, but didn't vote for him in 2020 ""because of some of the choices he made."" He didn't specify which ones.

Of Trump and Harris: ""They both have their challenges.""

But he won't be voting for Harris. ""I understand her economic plan,"" he said, ""but her liberalism is a little bit too liberal.""

Gideon added: ""This might be a situation where neither one of them gets my vote.""

John is a registered independent originally from Nassau County, N.Y., and has a blue-collar background as the son of a firefighter. He considers himself a ""liberal union Democrat."" He voted for Obama twice, even volunteered to ""work the phones,"" he said, and thought former President Bill Clinton ""did a great job as president.""

He did not vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 because of a personal experience; she didn't show to an event he was involved with planning. In 2020, he said his son, who was 5 then, essentially cast his ballot for Biden, because he wanted to vote for him.

John said he's not following the current presidential race that much, but did watch ""a little bit"" of the debate. His biggest concerns are housing affordability, groceries and gas prices.

""Trump was cuckoo for saying that the dogs and cats were being eaten,"" John said, ""but Kamala Harris wasn't really answering any of the questions,"" especially about the economy.

John said he wants to see something put forward to ""stop the inflation."" John also doesn't trust Harris (mispronouncing her name as ""Camilla"" at one point) because of her changed positions on things like fracking.

""I think Joe Biden did the best he could,"" John said. ""If he could have just grabbed the horns on inflation -- things are through the roof. ... It's gone freakin' nuts."""
Israel rigged pagers and radios to explode across Lebanon : Consider This from NPR,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/18/1200121029/lebanon-hezbollah-attacks-pager-communications-device,2024-09-18T23:04:40Z,"Smoke billows from a house in Baalbek in east Lebanon after a reported explosion of a radio device, on September 18.

On Tuesday, electronic pagers belonging to members of Hezbollah became small bombs, exploding almost simultaneously across Lebanon. The blasts killed at least a dozen people - including two children - and wounded thousands more, according to Lebanese health authorities.

Then, on Wednesday - barely 24 hours after the first synchronized attack - more communication devices used by the militant group detonated across southern Lebanon. The Lebanese health ministry reports that the second round of explosions killed at least 14 people and injured several hundred.

Hezbollah has blamed Israel for the attack. And while Israel's military declined to comment, a U.S. official told NPR that Israel privately claimed responsibility for the attack on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant hinted at the ""excellent achievements"" by Israel's military and intelligence branches. He said Israel was at ""the beginning of a new era in this war.""

The two unprecedented attacks come at a time when ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas in Gaza have stalled, and tensions between Israel and Hezbollah continue to grow.

NPR's Jane Arraf says the attack has rattled Lebanon.

""It's hard to explain just how used to bad things happening Lebanese are,"" she told All Things Considered host Ari Shapiro, ""but this has been largely a conflict involving warplanes, artillery, drones.""

As a result, Tuesday's attack was especially shocking, Arraf says.

Hezbollah fighters, officials and office staff often use the messaging devices targeted in the attacks for communications. Many of the casualties were Hezbollah fighters, medics and office workers, but many nearby civilians were also caught in the blasts.

According to Lebanese health minister Firas Abiad, most of the injuries people sustained were to the abdomen, legs, hands, face and eyes. Reuters said it viewed footage that showed many of the pagers buzzing, then exploding as people reached for them.

After Hamas attacked Israel last October 7, Hezbollah fired rockets across the Lebanese border into Israel in support of Hamas. Israel and Hezbollah have been at low-grade war since then.

This week's attacks mark a surprising development that could deter Hezbollah from further escalating its attacks on Israel in the short term at least.

Security experts in the region say Hezbollah's communications have been hijacked, thousands of their operatives are wounded and there is likely deep suspicion within the group over who collaborated with Israel to orchestrate the attack.

Amer Al Sabaileh, a Jordanian security expert, says Hezbollah might not be in any condition to fight an all-out war with Israel: ""You don't know the level of infiltration, and what next surprise Israel is preparing for you."""
"Another wave of blasts hits Lebanon, as Hezbollah reels from pager explosions",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/18/g-s1-23577/pagers-devices-explode-hezbollah-lebanon-israel,2024-09-18T18:20:57Z,"BEIRUT, Lebanon, and TEL AVIV, Israel -- A fresh wave of explosions in communications devices struck in Lebanon on Wednesday, leaving 14 people dead and 450 wounded, according to Lebanese health officials.

The new explosions took place barely 24 hours after the near-synchronized pager blasts on Tuesday that left 12 people dead and nearly 3,000 injured in Lebanon and parts of Syria.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant spoke on Wednesday about ""excellent achievements"" by Israel's military and intelligence branches leading to ""impressive results,"" but without mentioning device attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday.

""We are at the beginning of a new era in this war,"" Gallant said, adding that the ""center of gravity is moving north.""

The latest incident came as the Lebanese militia Hezbollah vowed that Israel will face punishment for Tuesday's attacks, further raising fears among analysts that the region may be pushed to an all-out war that the United States has been trying to prevent.

Israel has not explicitly taken responsibility for this week's attacks on Hezbollah's communications devices. But a U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak to reporters, told NPR that Israel notified Washington that it had carried out Tuesday's attacks.

Even before this week's blasts that injured and claimed the lives of the Hezbollah militia's operatives, the group had already feared spying on its digital devices.

From his hideout somewhere in Lebanon, its leader Hassan Nasrallah in February warned his followers: Get rid of your cellphones.

""Please break it, bury it, lock it up in a metal box,"" Nasrallah said in a televised speech then. ""Do it for a week, two weeks, a month ... these are deadly spies.""

Fearing that Israeli intelligence had infiltrated Hezbollah's communications, Hezbollah officials adopted old-fashioned handheld beepers, security experts say.

A second wave of explosions of wireless devices ripped through Beirut on Wednesday afternoon, including at a funeral for Hezbollah members and a child killed in Tuesday's bombings, Hezbollah said.

A day after the Hamas-led attack on Israel last Oct. 7, the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia began firing rockets across the Lebanese border into northern Israel in solidarity with Hamas. Israel has since regularly targeted Hezbollah militants and weapons stockpiles, as the two sides trade attacks daily.

Between January and February, Hezbollah stopped using smartphones and adopted pagers to avoid Israeli surveillance, said Amer Al Sabaileh, a Jordanian geopolitical analyst and security expert with contacts inside Hezbollah.

""It's not limited just for specific cells inside Hezbollah. It started to be the common method of communication,"" Al Sabaileh said.

Hezbollah handed these pagers out among its militant operatives as well as its civilian functionaries, the group told NPR. Four health care workers including one working at a Hezbollah-affiliated hospital, an 8-year-old girl and 11-year-old boy were among those killed, Lebanon's acting health minister said. Hezbollah is a political party in Lebanon as well as an armed militia.

In the days leading up to Tuesday's pagers operation, Israel's leadership had publicly warned that only military action could stop Hezbollah's attacks and allow Israeli civilians to return to their homes near the Lebanese border.

Some Israeli columnists praised the explosions as an operational success, but reported that Israel had not originally planned to detonate the devices now but did so out of concern that information might leak and compromise the mission.

""Officials in Jerusalem, within the defense establishment, and several experts, argue that the current timing should be leveraged to launch a comprehensive campaign in Lebanon,"" wrote veteran war correspondent Ron Ben-Yishay on the Israeli news site Ynet. ""This campaign could destroy a significant portion of Hezbollah's missile and other capabilities, acquired with Iranian assistance, which pose a serious threat to Israel's home front.""

The strike also drew domestic criticism.

""Israel might be dreaming of reestablishing a 'security zone' in Lebanon, or replicating the 'perimeter' tactic -- creating a buffer zone around the Gaza Strip -- to push back the threat,"" wrote columnist Zvi Bar'el in the left-leaning Haaretz. ""This would imply a long-term occupation inside Lebanon, repeating the same mistake and expecting different results.""

Hezbollah has vowed Israel will face punishment for the attacks. It has not specified what form that punishment could take. But the group's capacity to initiate an all-out war has been severely limited, security experts say.

Hezbollah's communications have been hijacked. Thousands of operatives and functionaries are wounded. And there is likely deep suspicion within the group's ranks that could spark internal probes into who may have collaborated with Israel to booby-trap the pagers and other devices.

""You cannot go to war while your house is not protected,"" Al Sabaileh said. ""You don't know the level of infiltration, and what next surprise Israel is preparing for you, and this means that going to war in such conditions might be a suicide recipe for Hezbollah.""

Iran, whose ambassador to Lebanon was wounded in Tuesday's pager attack, may be motivated to retaliate against Israel following the explosions targeting its Lebanese proxy, especially because it has yet to avenge a July 31 bombing that killed Hamas' leader Ismail Haniyeh in his guest room in the Iranian capital.

""The Iranians are still talking about retaliating after the elimination of Haniyeh,"" said Orna Mizrahi, a Hezbollah watcher and senior researcher at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies. ""The Iranians may have a bigger appetite to do something after this action."""
Harris calls Trump's remarks about Haitian immigrants in Springfield a 'crying shame',NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/17/nx-s1-5114278/kamala-harris-donald-trump-springfield-ohio-haitian-immigrants,2024-09-17T20:30:38Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris answers questions during a moderated conversation with members of the National Association of Black Journalists hosted by WHYY on Tuesday in Philadelphia. Win McNamee/Getty Images hide caption

Vice President Kamala Harris denounced the baseless claims that former President Trump has made about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, saying it was a ""crying shame"" that the community has seen daily life interrupted by bomb threats in the wake of Trump's remarks.

Speaking Tuesday in a panel interview with the National Association of Black Journalists, Harris said that the debunked claims elevated by Trump during last week's presidential debate were an example of why the GOP nominee should not be trusted with the highest office in the land. During the debate, Trump said Haitian immigrants in Springfield were stealing their neighbors' cats and dogs and eating them -- a claim that city and state leaders have said are untrue.

""It's a crying shame -- I mean, my heart breaks for this community,"" Harris told the panel. She said Trump's remarks were lies rooted in racist tropes, and in some of her most forceful language about the remarks since the debate, insisted it ""has to to stop.""

""When you are bestowed with a microphone that is that big, there is a profound responsibility that comes with that,"" Harris said. While addressing Trump's comments, Harris recounted seeing images of elementary school children dressed up for picture day having to leave their schools in Springfield because of the threats.

Harris sought to connect Trump's rhetoric to the conversation around political violence that has taken on new urgency in the wake of the apparent assassination attempt against the former president on Sunday. Harris said she has confidence in the Secret Service protection that she is provided, but then stressed that many Americans feel particularly vulnerable in the current political environment.

""Not everybody has Secret Service, and there are far too many people in our country right now who are not feeling safe,"" specifically referencing people in Springfield, the LGBTQ community in Florida, immigrants and women.

Harris did note, however, that she spoke to Trump after the assassination attempt ""to see if he was OK.""

""I told him what I have said publicly: There is no place for political violence in our country,"" she said.

Over the course of the nearly hour-long conversation, Harris was pressed for specifics on a variety of her policy positions, but gave few new details.

She said that no working family should have to pay more than 7% of their income on child care -- a pledge that echoed a Biden administration policy from February to families that receive child care assistance from the Department of Health and Human Services.

Harris was also pressed on how her policy on Israel and Gaza would differ from President Biden's policy. She reiterated that a hostage and cease-fire deal was needed as soon as possible -- and repeated her support for a two-state solution."

Hussein Malla/AP hide caption

Scores of fighters from the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah were seriously injured on Tuesday, when the pagers they used for communications unexpectedly exploded.

In what appears to be an widespread attack on part of the militant group's communications system, the explosions took place in Beirut's southern suburbs where Hezbollah has offices and in the south of the country.

The group has been trading cross-border attacks with Israel since the start of the war in Gaza last year.

On Tuesday, Lebanon's public health ministry directed hospitals in the country to prepare for mass casualties and warned anyone with a pager to immediately throw it away.

The authorities also called for all health workers to report for duty, for people to donate blood and for all citizens with similar devices to not use them until ""the situation is fully understood.""

One video posted on social media showed a man falling to the ground injured in a vegetable market after a loud bang.

It is unclear what has led to this series of explosions. Citing security sources, Reuters news agency reported that pagers that detonated were the latest model brought in by Hezbollah in recent months.

Some Israelis are leaving the country due to the war in Gaza,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/17/g-s1-22080/israel-emigration-gaza-war,2024-09-17T14:27:18Z,"TEL AVIV, Israel -- The Green household was taken over by piles of clothing, books, and kid's toys this summer, as 40-year old Inbal Green and her husband Shlomy Green, 37, packed up their lives. Along with their dog, cat and four-year-old daughter Riley, the Israeli couple were leaving suburban life outside Tel Aviv and moving to Thailand. Since the war in Gaza began last October, they'd felt too unsafe to stay.

Shlomy opened a kitchen cabinet filled to the brim with stacks of canned goods, cereal and teabags.

""Now we have to sort through the entire house and decide only what we want to take with us,"" he said. ""That's why the house is in complete shambles.""

The Greens, born and raised in Israel, are among a growing number of Jewish Israelis looking for jobs abroad and leaving since last Oct. 7. Israeli media reported figures from Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics showing a spike in the number of Israelis -- more than 12,000 -- who left the country last October and had not returned by June.

The war in Gaza, which has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to health officials there, was triggered when Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 250 others hostage.

The vast majority of Jewish Israelis support the defeat of Hamas as essential to the country's future security. But the toll of this war -- for both Israelis and Palestinians -- is also driving some Jewish Israelis to choose to leave the country. Some, like the Greens, say they're leaving for good.

The Greens said that with their country's shaky political and security situation, they've previously toyed with the idea of leaving. But after last October's Hamas-led attack, they just didn't feel safe in Israel, Shlomy said. They believed the Israeli government wasn't doing -- or going to do -- enough to protect them from future attacks.

""The thing is we want to feel safe and secure in our home,"" he said. ""And we're not willing to compromise on that.""

The Greens said that in the early morning of Oct. 7, they were awoken by air raid sirens warning residents of incoming rockets from Hamas or Hezbollah. Most homes in Israel have a safe room that people will shelter in when these sirens go off.

All three ran into their safe room, and that's when they started getting text messages from family and friends telling them the news of the Hamas-led attacks in the south.

Inbal said they grew concerned that the attacks might spread further into Israel. Tel Aviv is only about 40 miles from the Gaza Strip. So they packed up some essentials and made their way to the airport, getting on one of the last flights to Cyprus by noon that day

""We felt like we were fleeing,"" Shlomy said. ""We were basically just thankful that we left in time.""

The Greens spent two months abroad but had to make their way back to Israel for practical reasons -- their Israeli health insurance stopped paying their medical bills because they were abroad, Shlomy broke his leg and his employer wanted him back in Israel.

But by then, Inbal said, leaving Israel for good had become their shared goal. Shlomy, a software developer, applied for jobs all over the world and landed one in Thailand. He said they did their research and felt they would be able to lead a comfortable life there.

""There are very low or nonexistent antisemitism rates there right now,"" he explained. ""Almost no pro-Palestinian protests, life is calm there, which is what we were looking for.""

Shlomy said he used to believe that peace was possible with Palestinians, but after the Hamas attack, he's unsure.

Labor and corporate immigration lawyer Liam Schwartz works at one of Israel's largest law firms. From a meeting room at his firm, there's a magnificent view of Tel Aviv, the sea on one side, skyscrapers on the other.

Schwartz helps Israeli businesses relocate their employees to parent companies in the U.S., and works with families who want to move there. He normally sees hundreds of cases a year, but says his workload has increased by at least 40% in the past few months. What makes this year unique is Oct. 7, he said.

""I've never been this busy ever in my career,"" Shwartz said. ""This is way beyond expectations.""

Schwartz said that Israeli companies are worried about a possible all-out war in northern Israel with Hezbollah. The two sides have been trading fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the conflict in Gaza started. Because of this, companies, especially those in high tech, are relocating entire teams to the United States.

He's also seeing Israeli employees pressure their companies to sponsor them for work visas to the U.S. Many of these employees just don't feel safe or comfortable in Israel anymore, he said.

""Companies are interested in not losing talent, so many of them are just saying yes,"" Schwartz said.

Schwartz acknowledged that these are privileged Israelis. Many others don't have the luxury of applying for work visas or even a regular visa, because they are unskilled or don't have the means. ""For the woman who sweeps the floor where I work, there's basically nothing there,"" he said, because she is unskilled and her employer would most probably not sponsor her.

Some Israelis say they want to leave because they are disillusioned with how their government is handling the war in Gaza. The families of the hostages kidnapped from Israel on Oct. 7 have been protesting, along with thousands of other Israelis, to pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept the peace deal presented by President Biden in May.

At a weekly anti-government protest in May in Tel Aviv, Hadar Behrendt held up a sign saying ""Nine Months Already,"" referring to the length of the war in Gaza at the time and how hostages are still there.

She said she doesn't want to be ashamed of what Israel has become. She'd rather go elsewhere.

""It's like being foreign in my own country,"" said Behrendt. ""We are kidnapped by this government.""

Behrendt, who said her family escaped Germany in 1936, said she will be using her German passport to move to Greece with her husband.

""It's very hard for us,"" she said. ""All our family is here, but I can't be part of this.""

Inbal Green, packing for her own family's departure, said she grew up in a Zionist family, believing that she had a duty to protect and serve Israel. She was a reservist for 14 years, volunteered with the Israeli police and the Israeli national medical emergency organization.

""And then here comes October 7th, and after all that, I still have to pack my things,"" she said.

Her grandmother survived the Holocaust and settled in Israel, she said. But she doesn't want what she calls the instability and chaos of today's Israel to be her daughter's responsibility.

""The country suffers from PTSD. I don't want her to carry that on her tiny shoulders,"" Inbal said.

She admitted that she is also tired of carrying what she says is the burden of feeling insecure and uncertain about the future in her own country.

""I don't want to carry that anymore,"" she said. ""I think it's OK to say ... I want to breathe.""

Inbal insisted she was sure she didn't want to come back to live in Israel ever again. Only one thing would bring her back -- if her daughter chooses to serve in the Israeli military.

""I still think it is important,"" Inbal said about the compulsory Israeli military service. ""It is a character builder."""
Iran says it launched a satellite under program criticized by West over missile fears,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/14/nx-s1-5112422/iran-satellite-launch,2024-09-14T15:43:28Z,"TEHRAN, Iran -- Iran launched a satellite into space Saturday with a rocket built by the country's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, state-run media reported, the latest for a program the West fears helps Tehran advance its ballistic missile program.

Iran described the launch as a success, which would be the second such launch to put a satellite into orbit with the rocket. There was no immediate independent confirmation of the launch's success.

Footage later released by Iranian media showed the rocket blast off from a mobile launcher. An Associated Press analysis of the video and other imagery later released suggested the launch happened at the Guard's launch pad on the outskirts of the city of Shahroud, some 215 miles east of the capital, Tehran.

The launch comes amid heightened tensions gripping the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, during which Tehran launched an unprecedented direct missile-and-drone attack on Israel. Meanwhile, Iran continues to enrich uranium to nearly weapons-grade levels, raising concerns among nonproliferation experts about Tehran's program.

Iran identified the satellite-carrying rocket as the Qaem-100, which the Guard used in January for another successful launch. Qaem means ""upright"" in Iran's Farsi language.

The solid-fuel, three-stage rocket put the Chamran-1 satellite, weighing 60 kilograms (132 pounds), into a 550-kilometer (340-mile) orbit, state media reported. The rocket bore a Quranic verse: ""That which is left by Allah is better for you, if you are believers.""

A state-owned subsidiary of Iran's Defense Ministry and experts at the Aerospace Research Institute built the satellite with others to ""test hardware and software systems for orbital maneuver technology validation,"" state media said, without elaborating.

Gen. Hossein Salami, the head of the Guard, praised the launch in a statement and said scientists successfully overcame ""the atmosphere of extensive and oppressive international sanctions.""

The U.S. State Department and the American military did not immediately respond to requests for comment over the Iranian launch.

The United States had previously said Iran's satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution and called on Tehran to undertake no activity involving ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. U.N. sanctions related to Iran's ballistic missile program expired last October.

Under Iran's relatively moderate former President Hassan Rouhani, the Islamic Republic slowed its space program for fear of raising tensions with the West. Hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, a protege of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who came to power in 2021, has pushed the program forward. Raisi died in a helicopter crash in May.

It's unclear what Iran's new president, the reformist Masoud Pezeshkian, wants for the program as he was silent on the issue while campaigning.

The U.S. intelligence community's worldwide threat assessment this year said Iran's development of satellite launch vehicles ""would shorten the timeline"" for Iran to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile because it uses similar technology.

Intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Iran is now producing uranium close to weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran has enough enriched uranium for ""several"" nuclear weapons, if it chooses to produce them, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency repeatedly has warned.

Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003.

The launch also came ahead of the second anniversary of the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, which sparked nationwide protests against Iran's mandatory headscarf, or hijab, law and the country's Shiite theocracy."

The first wave of a massive vaccination campaign against polio is wrapping up in Gaza.

The World Health Organization (WHO) says that in less than two weeks, they've helped administer more than 550,000 polio vaccines to children across the enclave. But the work is only half done.

""We start the race against time for the second stage of the campaign,"" says Juliette Touma with the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, the group that's administering the vaccines. ""We have to do all of this all over again to give the children the second doses of vaccines against polio.""

Polio is a highly infectious virus that can lead to paralysis and even death. It often spreads through fecal matter. This is a problem in Gaza, which has suffered destruction of much of its water treatment infrastructure.

""Solid waste everywhere,"" says Dr. Majdi Duhair, a retired epidemiologist in Gaza. ""No clean drinking water, no hygiene.""

This has all led to plenty of sewage in the streets -- the perfect recipe for the spread of polio. So when the virus turned up in wastewater samples in the enclave, alarm bells went off, especially because vaccination programs in Gaza have collapsed since the war began.

Sure enough, last month, a little boy not quite one year old became paralyzed in both of his legs. He is Gaza's first confirmed case of polio in a quarter century.

""Scientifically, one confirmed case of polio -- it is considered as an outbreak,"" says Duhair. That's because a single case points to roughly 200 more people who are infected but not showing symptoms. No other cases have surfaced in Gaza so far, but ""we are expecting the circulation of this virus is very high in the community,"" he says.

Health officials sequenced the polio virus that appeared in Gaza and traced it to a strain last seen in Egypt in 2023. ""There are obviously interactions between people in Egypt and in Gaza,"" says Raul Andino, an immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco. ""And this virus is very infectious, very easy to transmit.""

Andino explains that the oral vaccine -- which is comprised of a weakened form of the polio virus -- is ""extremely safe"" to get and that it protects the recipient from polio. It's also easy to administer, requiring just two drops in the mouth and no needles. Rarely, however, when that weakened virus is shed in a person's stool, it can mutate and regain its ability to cause disease.

This is what happened with the strain now in Gaza. People were vaccinated orally in Egypt and at some point, the virus that they shed in their fecal matter became virulent again.

But here's where the real problem lies: ""When you reduce the regular vaccinations in a given population,"" says Andino, ""you end up having a number of individuals that are susceptible to be infected.""

This is the reason that public health officials moved quickly to launch a mass campaign of polio vaccination.

Duhair worked as the director of public health in Gaza's Ministry of Health for three decades. Since he retired two years ago, he's been asked for advice on various matters. Then, in mid-July, he got a call from the Ministry to head up the committee overseeing the planning and rollout of the vaccination effort.

""Without hesitation, I cannot refuse serving my population,"" says Duhair. ""I am a Palestinian, and they are our children. Immediately, I accept[ed] the job.""

Andino helped develop the novel oral polio vaccine that was used in the campaign. Unlike the previous version (used in Egypt among many other places worldwide) that only needed one mutation to recapture the capacity to cause disease, this new vaccine requires three. ""That makes the virus safer,"" Andino says. ""It's not perfect, but it's safer.""

The goal of the vaccination effort was to reach at least 90% of the kids in Gaza under ten. (The risk for adults is much lower.) There was a lot to do in very little time.

Duhair and his colleagues coordinated with groups like UNICEF to deliver the vaccine to Gaza and WHO to bring in the refrigeration to keep the vaccine cool.

Right off the bat, the team faced challenges. Chief among them was running the campaign in the middle of a war zone. ""It's impossible to undertake a vaccination campaign of such volume and scale under a sky full of airstrikes,"" says Touma. ""Impossible.""

That's why it was crucial that the Israeli army and Hamas agree to briefly pause the fighting in different areas specially for the immunization effort. These respites allowed the vaccination teams to disperse throughout the enclave.

They also had to figure out how to drive the vaccine and the vaccinators around Gaza, a little territory crammed full of people displaced from months of Israeli air strikes.

""It is a matter of overcrowding of a small area,"" explains Duhair. ""And of course, the streets are damaged.""

So Duhair and his team planned accordingly. They started early at 6 a.m every day. And they put extra vehicles on the roads in case any were delayed.

Usually, a campaign like this would move house to house to vaccinate as many children as possible. But in Gaza, they couldn't since there are so few houses left and people are often moving hour by hour.

""That presented an immense level of challenge in terms of mapping the population and also correctly estimating the population sizes in each location,"" WHO's Deepak Kumar said at a press briefing.

He says more than 200 teams have been involved with the vaccination effort, tracking the numbers of children in Gaza and how many have been vaccinated. ""The data was watched over very closely until we were confident that we have reached more than 95% of coverage,"" says Kumar.

""We go from shelter to shelter and tent to tent,"" says Touma. ""People are literally everywhere. I mean, in the middle of the street, you have people living by the beach. So the idea is to reach every child wherever they are.""

WHO reports that families were enthusiastic about having their children vaccinated.

""We are happy with this polio campaign,"" says Dr. Richard Peeperkorn, WHO Representative for the West Bank and Gaza. ""And I think we are also quite confident that we reached an enormous amount of children in this short time.""

It was a considerable undertaking. ""I don't think a polio campaign has ever been done like this globally, constrained by time and security as we're currently undergoing in Gaza,"" says Scott Anderson, deputy humanitarian coordinator with the U.N.

Anderson is stationed in Gaza, and he likens the vaccination effort to putting a band aid on a much deeper wound -- a territory whose people and infrastructure have been bombarded for over 11 months by Israeli air strikes after the war that started after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7.

""We're really just hoping and praying that there's not a larger outbreak of disease,"" he says.

Vaccination is just a piece of the polio response. For the next six months, officials will need to be vigilant to ensure there's no virus circulating in either the people or the wastewater of Gaza. That's when they'll know if the outbreak is over.

Still, this territory is but one place in the world where the virus is present. These spots have things in common, like insecurity, poor hygiene and reduced access to health care and routine vaccination programs.

Zubair Wawood is an epidemiologist and polio expert with WHO, one of several groups that comprise the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.

""There's a 99.9% reduction in the number of polio cases since the start of this initiative more than three decades back,"" says Wawood, ""and we are at the very, very last mile of this.""

And yet, Wawood says that upheavals like the one in Gaza and elsewhere in the world -- involving war, displacement, chronic disruption -- make that last mile a lot longer."

"In Jordan's elections, anger at Israel over the Gaza war fuels Islamist gains",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/12/g-s1-22336/jordan-elections-islamists-israel-gaza-war,2024-09-12T19:33:29Z,"AMMAN, Jordan -- Jordan's Islamist opposition made the biggest gains of any opposition party in parliamentary elections held this week, winning one-fifth of the seats amid increasing anger against Israel over the war in Gaza.

The Islamic Action Front, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, is now the single biggest opposition bloc in the 138-member parliament. The legislative body has limited power, and will continue to be dominated by pro-government and tribal political groups.

The IAF's showing in the election has been widely watched as a gauge of whether the increased support for Hamas, which is at war with Israel, would translate into more seats for the Brotherhood-linked party in Jordan and more influence for Islamist parties in other countries.

Voting turnout was relatively low -- an average of 32% across the country. The percentage of voters going to the polls was much higher in tribal areas and much lower in the capital Amman.

Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood leader Murad Adailah told Reuters the IAF victory was a ""popular referendum"" endorsing support for Hamas and its allies and rejection of the 1994 peace treaty between Jordan and Israel.

Jordan's highest court dissolved the Muslim Brotherhood organization four years ago, citing failure to comply with registration laws. The Brotherhood stills operates in Jordan but is not allowed to directly field parliamentary candidates. Many Arab rulers have banned the Brotherhood, fearing threats to their hereditary power and to more secular political agendas.

Jordan's monarchy has tried to balance legislative and judicial moves to limit the power of the Brotherhood while allowing its supporters some free expression. At protests after Friday prayers, Brotherhood speakers regularly lead chants of ""we are all Hamas"" and call for Jordan to break its peace treaty with Israel.

The United States, Jordan's main foreign donor, has designated Hamas a terrorist organization.

Jordan signed its 1994 peace treaty with neighboring Israel under the late King Hussein, becoming the second country to do so after Egypt. A majority of Jordan's population is originally Palestinian, descendants of families who fled or were forced from their homes in the war in 1948, the year Israel was created -- and in subsequent wars, and were never allowed back.

Anger has grown along with the death toll in Gaza, where the health ministry says more than 40,000 people, many of them women and children, have been killed in Israeli attacks. Israel says it needs to destroy Hamas after Hamas militants led a cross-border attack last October that Israeli authorities say killed roughly 1,200 people.

Along with appealing to Jordanians enraged over Israeli attacks in Gaza and the West Bank, the IAF managed to form alliances to appeal to a wider group of voters than its traditional urban conservative Muslim base and successfully fielded candidates including tribal leaders and Christians.

Jordan is a constitutional monarchy and King Abdullah II implemented electoral reforms two years ago aimed at encouraging the role of political parties as a step toward greater democratization. The new laws also increased the number of seats for women and lowered the age at which candidates can run from 30 to 25.

The king still appoints government leaders and can dissolve parliament, which introduces and passes laws and has the ability to force a government resignation through a no-confidence vote.

Jordan, a resource-poor country, has been hit particularly hard by the economic fallout of the Gaza war. Tourism, one of the country's main sectors, has plummeted and unemployment, while officially about 22% of the working population, is believed to be much higher.

The head of European Union election mission, Željana Zovko, praised Jordan for succeeding in holding elections as scheduled, despite the ongoing turmoil in the region."
The U.N. says 6 staff were killed in an Israeli strike on a Gaza school,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/12/nx-s1-5109856/unrwa-israel-strike-school-gaza-hamas-war,2024-09-12T15:24:46Z,"NUSEIRAT REFUGEE CAMP, Gaza Strip -- The United Nations relief agency for Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip says Israeli airstrikes hit a school that was sheltering families in central Gaza, killing six of its employees.

The U.N. agency, UNRWA, says this is the fifth time the al-Jaouni school has been hit since the start of the war. It says that some 12,000 people -- mostly women and children -- are taking shelter there and the manager of the UNWRA team helping people was killed in Wednesday's strike.

First responders say 18 people died in the attack that caused the roof of a shelter to cave in. Families were left scrambling to find their loved ones amid the wreckage.

""No one is safe in Gaza,"" the agency said in a statement. ""No one is spared.""

António Guterres, the U.N. Secretary General, called the strikes ""dramatic violations of international humanitarian law.""

""What's happening in Gaza is totally unacceptable,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

The Israeli military said Hamas was using the school as a ""command and control center.""

Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, responded to Guterres' criticism by writing on X: ""It is unconscionable that the UN continues to condemn Israel in its just war against terrorists, while Hamas continues to use women and children as human shields.""

UNWRA called on all parties in the conflict to ""never use schools or the areas around them for military or fighting purposes"" and said that ""schools and other civilian infrastructure must be protected at all times.""

Sixteen people were reported killed in a previous Israeli attack on several structures in the Al-Jaouni school compound in July, which Israel said was being used by Hamas fighters.

UNRWA says Wednesday's attack caused the highest number of staff killed in a single incident. At least 220 agency staff have lost their lives since the war began. Philippe Lazzarini, the UNRWA Commissioner-General, said humanitarian staff are being ""disregarded"" in the Gaza war.

""The longer impunity prevails, the more international humanitarian law and the Geneva conventions will become irrelevant,"" he wrote on social media.

Gaza's Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed and 95,125 injured in Israel's military offensive on Gaza since Oct. 7, the day that Hamas-led militants attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages.

Millions of Gaza residents have been displaced in the war, many of them multiple times. The population is blighted by hunger and the spread of disease.

The World Health Organization said on Wednesday it carried out its largest medical evacuation from Gaza since the start of the war, taking 97 sick and severely injured patients and 155 companions to the United Arab Emirates for treatment. The patients were 45 children and 52 adults with a wide range of conditions, including cancer and other diseases and injuries from the conflict.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director-general, said the evacuation was a ""highly complex operation"" that was ""completed under immense time pressure to bring all patients together.""

A WHO report published Thursday found that some 22,500 people -- about a quarter of those wounded in the war in Gaza -- have injuries that will require rehabilitation now and for years to come. According to the report, some 3,105 and 4,050 limbs have been amputated as a result of the conflict. Many, including thousands of women and children, suffer from injured spinal cords, traumatic brain injuries or major burns.

""The huge surge in rehabilitation needs occurs in parallel with the ongoing decimation of the health system,"" said Dr. Richard Peeperkorn, a WHO representative for the West Bank and Gaza. ""Patients can't get the care they need. Acute rehabilitation services are severely disrupted and specialized care for complex injuries is not available, placing patients' lives at risk. Immediate and long-term support is urgently needed to address the enormous rehabilitation needs.""

Gaza's only limb reconstruction and rehabilitation center, supported by WHO, stopped functioning in December 2023 because of lack of supplies, and because specialized health workers were themselves being forced to leave the area in search of safety. The report says 39 physiotherapists have been killed.

The WHO says its latest report highlights how vast the unmet medical needs are in Gaza today."
'The Bibi Files.' Benjamin Netanyahu fails to block documentary from screening,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/11/g-s1-22040/the-documentary-netanyahu-wants-to-block,2024-09-11T11:01:23Z,"TEL AVIV -- An Israeli court this week rejected a request from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to block a documentary about his legal troubles from screening at a Canadian film festival.

The film, The Bibi Files, a reference to the prime minister's nickname, contains video clips documenting Netanyahu, his wife Sara, and his son Yair, during police interrogations between 2016 and 2018 that sought to examine whether Netanyahu was involved in the corruption offenses attributed to him.

The prime minister is on trial for allegedly granting favors to media moguls in exchange for gifts and favorable media coverage. He denies wrongdoing and has called the trial, which began in 2020, a witch hunt.

The film casts a spotlight on the Israeli prime minister as he faces intense domestic and international pressure over his responsibility for the security failures leading to the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel and the ongoing war in Gaza.

Ahead of the film screening in Canada on Monday, the Israeli leader filed a lawsuit against the State of Israel and a leading Israeli investigative journalist, Raviv Drucker. Netanyahu argued that the film, produced by Oscar-winning director Alex Gibney, violates Israeli law by screening unpublished footage from his police interrogations.

In the suit against Israeli journalist Drucker, who is also one of the producers of the film, Netanyahu's attorney claimed that Drucker ""publicly identified himself as a political opponent of the Prime Minister and expressed a desire for the end of his tenure.""

The Israeli leader further argued that Drucker was well aware of the law prohibiting the publication of audio or visual recordings from interrogation rooms without prior approval. Despite this, he claimed that Drucker ""facilitated the release of such footage.""

But a judge in Jerusalem District Court on Monday rejected Netanyahu's request, saying that since Netanyahu's motion was filed on the same day as the screening at the Toronto International Film Festival, there was not enough time for a proper hearing.

The almost two-hour long documentary begins in 2015, when Netanyahu won re-election for the fourth time. It specifically focuses on the politician's long-running legal troubles and Israeli police investigations into his conduct.

The film is still in its final edits, but the rough cut screening early this week attracted about 200 people at the 2024 Toronto Film Festival, according to attendees.

Toward the end of the screening on Monday, Gibney announced to the audience that Netanyahu had filed a motion to stop the showing of the film, but that the court had denied his request.

Gibney said: ""There were two reasons to come here to Toronto. One is because people are dying every day, and we wanted to make a statement with this film. The other was that we wanted to show it here, in the market, and have people that can take it up, so we can show it to the rest of the world. That's the idea. The interest is to get it out as quickly as possible so it can be seen everywhere.""

Alexis Bloom, the director of the film, said that although the film was still ""a work in progress,"" the team felt a ""great urgency"" to bring it to a wider audience, so that people can be better informed about one of Israel's most consequential political leaders.

""We are all very passionate about this subject. We feel it needs to get out there,"" she said, adding that she and Gibney began working on this film before October 7, when Netanyahu's right-wing government was enacting a contentious judicial overhaul that weakened the oversight powers of Israel's supreme court which it sees as too liberal.

""You can see that worldwide, the democratic backsliding. You see parallels with what's going on here, in Hungary, in Russia. This is strongman syndrome. That's what interested me,"" Bloom told the audience.

Despite the fanfare at the Canadian film festival, The Bibi Files will not be shown in Israel, due to a law in Israel that says if one is videotaped in an official proceeding - they have right to privacy and the footage can't be shown.

But Gibney said he suspected the film will find a way into Israel, although not through official distribution channels.

This is not the first time the Oscar-winning producer has shined a spotlight on Netanyahu. In 2016, Gibney directed the film Zero Days, which focused on the Stuxnet malware, developed by Israel and the U.S. to hurt the development of Iran's nuclear weapons, but got out of control, according to the film, due to Netanyahu's insistence on activating it prematurely and without the approval of the U.S..

In an interview with Variety published last week, Gibney said he hoped his film could shed light on Netanyahu's character in a way that is ""unprecedented and extraordinary.""

""They are powerful evidence of his venal and corrupt character and how that led us to where we are at right now."""
Opinion | Kamala Harris' chat on 'Call Her Daddy' shouldn't have been such a big deal,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-call-her-daddy-interview-media-rcna175070,2024-10-11T19:48:05Z,"Countless outlets have popped up to stoke the misogyny and racism of young white men as feminist media has suffered.

Vice President Kamala Harris went on a media blitz this week, visiting CBS's The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, ""The Howard Stern Show""on SiriusXM radio, CBS's ""60 Minutes"" and ABC's ""The View."" Harris unveiled a smattering of new policy proposals as well, including an idea to cover long-term care under Medicare, which would ease the burden on middle-aged women who often serve as the primary caretakers for aging parents.

While those visits, with the exception of Stern's, were fairly par-for-the-course appearances by a presidential candidate looking for low-pressure interviews designed to hit fairly low-information voters, it was Harris' appearance on the hit podcast ""Call Her Daddy,"" followed by 5 million mostly Gen Z female listeners, that garnered the most attention from her critics.

In her interview with podcast host Alex Cooper, Harris talked in depth about women's issues like abortion, a topic Cooper said in a pre-interview video that she felt most comfortable asking about. The interview was friendly, and at times, poignant, with Harris recounting how a high school friend's story of sexual abuse once inspired her to seek the job as California's top prosecutor. At another point, the two talked about what young women should do when they are being sexually assaulted.

Some political commentators, however, felt that, with that appearance, Harris was showing a reluctance to move away from friendly ground during an election that has seen an extreme gender split among young voters. New York Post columnist Kirsten Fleming called the interview a ""joke,"" saying, ""it is a safe spot for Harris -- who has been showered with soft-focus media features and fawning takes on her cooking and clothing -- to once again be treated like a glittering celebrity.""

Personally, I think we missed getting more substantive, in-depth policy questions that more experienced journalists at others would have asked. You can't deny the reach of the ""Call Her Daddy"" audience, but someone more familiar with the finer points of abortion or sex discrimination policy could have perhaps extracted more detailed responses from Harris. But then again, I can't fault Harris for going on a show so popular with young women.

According to a Harvard Institute of Politics poll, Harris leads overall among voters under 30, 61% to 30%, but a quick look at the gender split tells a more interesting story. Among young women, the poll shows Harris leads 70% to 23%, while she only holds a 17-point lead among young men. Now it's true that every Democratic candidate has won young people as a whole in recent elections, but the gap has been narrowing. Biden won voters under 30 by only 24 points in 2020, according to Pew Research.

The Harvard poll numbers come as former President Donald Trump has made a concerted effort to tap into the youth ""bro"" vote.

Over the last few years, there have been countless outlets that have popped up designed to stoke the misogyny and racism of young white men, and a whole movement was born to appeal to young male gamers who are sick of ""woke"" content. Trump's campaign has sought to ride on the coattails of this movement, with the candidate making appearances with popular young conservative streamers like Adin Ross and Félix (xQc) Lengyel. It's significant that Trump still hasn't won a majority of them despite making in-roads, despite the exponential growth of conservative media designed to appeal to the demographic.

Harris's appearance on ""Call Her Daddy"" can, in a way, be seen as the gendered opposite of Trump's stream appearances. But the two gender-focused media ecosystems aren't nearly the same. While conservative commentary outlets like The Daily Wire and streamers like Ross have ridden the anti-woke, white male-oriented zeitgeist to prominence, women's media has largely fallen apart over the last decades.

Feminist giants like Bitch Media and The Toast have long since disappeared. Jezebel is a shell of its former self and under new ownership. We are now a long way away from the dramatic heights of the feminist blog era, which found its peak in the late aughts and early 2010s. Corporate greed, advertiser squeamishness and the tech bros controlling today's algorithms have simply killed the feminist voice, or twisted it into a tool to spread transphobic hate.

That has left a void in women's media to be filled with podcasts like ""Call Her Daddy,"" which got its start as the property of the consistently misogynist outlet Barstool Sports, run by sports bro turned conservative provocateur Dave Portnoy. Cooper and her podcast left Barstool in 2021, and she signed a $60 million deal with Spotify, making her the highest-paid female podcaster in the U.S. In August, she signed a $125 million deal with SirusXM.

Cooper identifies as a feminist, though some critics have questioned her girlboss, masculine-behavior-coded version of the term. But ""feminist"" has also become a pejorative to many people. Being a feminist is often seen as uncool, or not sexy. Even worse, many women (and some men) believe in the core tenets of feminism: bodily autonomy, equal rights under the law, etc., but still eschew the label.

And who can blame them when there's no real feminist media counterbalance to the growing ""bro-verse"" that freaks out whenever a woman or a person of color appears in a popular piece of media.

That's partly why I and a group of nine other experienced creatives are launching The Flytrap, a new feminist newsletter blog project that seeks to bring back the halcyon days of feminist media at a time when we need it most.

Trump winning this election will be disastrous for the bodily autonomy of women and trans people. Women across the globe continue to suffer under oppressive regimes, especially in Gaza and Afghanistan, and a Trump win will likely make those situations worse.

Like Trump has with young men, Harris should have more media options to reach young women. Her appearance on ""Call Her Daddy,"" then, shouldn't be seen as something negative. It should be seen as proof of the important conversations we'd be having, and the more informed young women voters would be, if there were a more robust women's media sphere."
Opinion | Harris' tough talk is allowing Trump to claim the 'antiwar' mantle,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/harris-trump-antiwar-ukraine-israel-peace-rcna174077,2024-10-09T10:31:30Z,"By Mark Hannah, research fellow at the Eurasia Group Foundation

When Israel killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah with a U.S.-made bomb, Vice President Kamala Harris hailed the act as ""a measure of justice."" Now Harris' team struggles to defend Israel's devastating air strikes on Lebanon, which have displaced hundreds of thousands. Former President Donald Trump has called the war ""unacceptable."" Meanwhile, Harris labels those who, like Trump, want Ukraine to be willing to make concessions as part of a diplomatic settlement as proponents of ""surrender.""

If Harris aims to be the only presidential candidate defending Israel and Ukraine, she should stop. It allows Trump to position himself as the peace candidate -- something many Americans, especially swing voters, crave. A survey conducted by my colleagues at the Institute for Global Affairs provides some examples.

Fully two-thirds of Americans want the U.S. to push for a negotiated settlement to end Ukraine's war, and in six battleground states, independent voters were the most inclined to do so. And a plurality of independents in these battleground states believe any military aid to Israel must be conditioned on first reaching a cease-fire. (The margin of error for both national and battleground state samples in the survey was 3.9%.)

Instead of continuing the current open-ended ""as long as it takes"" approaches, which have failed to distinguish between American interests and those of Ukraine and Israel, Harris would be wise to prioritize ending the conflicts. She should say she wants the wars to end.

Nationally, when asked what goals the U.S. should pursue, independents joined Republicans in being 20% more likely than Democrats to prioritize de-escalation over other goals like restoring Ukraine's borders or deterring autocrats. Even among Democrats, the avoidance of escalation outweighs the pursuit of total victory or deterrence.

In the presidential debate, Harris conjured an image of Vladimir Putin ""sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe -- starting with Poland."" This scenario, however, seems far-fetched to both low-information undecided voters and high-information national security experts alike.

Her swift pivot to addressing ""the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania"" revealed more about political math than geopolitical reality. I'm not above data-based politics; this whole piece is based on poll numbers. But there's a difference between understanding voter sentiment and treating American voters of Polish descent like they're living in Warsaw rather than West Chester.

Our poll found that independents join Republicans in their skepticism of America's support for Ukraine's maximalist war goals -- but they join Democrats in their skepticism of unconditional support for Israel's war effort. Most want to either end American support outright or tie military aid to a cease-fire.

Unfortunately for Harris, while she and Trump are seen nationally as equally likely to end these wars, our battleground state polling tells a different story. In these states, Trump leads Harris 58% to 42% on the issue, with a 3.9% margin of error.

This gap extends to broader foreign policy perceptions, too. More voters nationally -- but fewer in these swing states -- see Harris as someone who advances America's interests abroad or pursues a foreign policy ""which benefits people like you.""

Some might say, ""So what? Elections hinge on issues that hit closer to home -- jobs, inflation, cultural flashpoints."" That's usually true. Five years ago, James Lindsay of the Council on Foreign Relations told me, ""Most Americans don't spend a lot of their time thinking about the ways foreign policy affects them, even though it affects them in profound ways.""

But 2024 is proving different. Foreign policy has muscled its way into the forefront of voter concerns. A recent Pew survey ranks it fourth among issues driving voters' decisions, and Trump has the edge over Harris.

Even if U.S. presidential campaigns aren't always interested in geopolitics, geopolitics is interested in presidential campaigns. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a shrewd observer of American politics, has most likely made the calculation that President Joe Biden has little willingness to publicly rebuke Israel's dangerous escalation mere weeks before a presidential election.

Harris now has a decision to make. She could continue to let Netanyahu dictate the direction of this war, or she could use the leverage with Israel the U.S. has long neglected. She would do well to heed the counsel of her advisers, such as Rebecca Lissner and Philip Gordon, who offer a sober and strategic alternative to the threat-inflation and simplistic good guys-vs.-bad guys narratives that are all too common in Washington. Harris' selection of Tim Walz as her running mate hints at a willingness to buck foreign policy orthodoxies. This is a start, but she needs to go further.

Harris has an opportunity to articulate a new vision of foreign policy that's both principled and pragmatic. One that recognizes the limits of American power without abandoning its ideals and sees the risks as well as the rewards of its security partnerships and alliances. Historically, successful presidential candidates often run against wars. George W. Bush campaigned against nation-building before embracing it. Barack Obama's opposition to the Iraq War was instrumental to his rise. Trump's ""America First"" rhetoric resonated deeply in 2016.

For Harris, calling for the end to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine wouldn't be just smart policy -- it would be smart politics."
"Trump says Gaza 'could be better than Monaco,' but 'they never took advantage of it'",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-gaza-better-than-monaco-israel-hugh-hewitt-rcna174475,2024-10-08T20:25:45Z,"Trump also claimed he has been to Gaza. An aide later suggested that visiting Israel counted because ""Gaza is in Israel.""

Donald Trump said that Gaza ""could be one of the best places in the world"" -- better even, he said, ""than Monaco"" and lamented that people ""never took advantage of it.""

In an interview with conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt on Monday, Trump said: ""It could be better than Monaco. It has the best location in the Middle East, the best water, the best everything,"" referring to the Palestinian territory, which has been bombarded relentlessly by the Israeli military for the past 12 months, creating a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.

""They never took advantage of it. You know, as a developer, it could be the most beautiful place -- the weather, the water, the whole thing, the climate,"" he said.

Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Jewish Democrats and denigrated Palestinians while claiming to be Israel's staunchest ally, said that Gaza was ""a rough place ... before all of the attacks and before the back-and-forth of what's happened over the last couple of years."" The Republican presidential nominee also claimed that he had visited Gaza, despite there being no record of him doing so, as president or otherwise.

Afterward, a Trump campaign official given anonymity by The New York Times said that Trump has been to Israel, stating incorrectly that ""Gaza is in Israel.""

Trump's estimation of the real estate potential of the Gaza Strip echoes that of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who said in an interview with the faculty chair of Harvard's Middle East Initiative in February that ""Gaza's waterfront property could be very valuable."" Kushner also suggested that, if he were in charge, he would ""try to move people"" from Rafah, in the south of Gaza, into the Negev desert, ""so you can go in and finish the job"" of eliminating Hamas.

Trump's comments speak to how he might approach the fraught and widening tensions in the Middle East if he wins the election. They are also deeply disconnected from the realities of life in Gaza under Israel's extensive blockade and what human rights experts have called the illegal Israeli occupation of the West Bank. After Hamas assumed governance of Gaza in 2007, Israel removed its military presence and swiftly imposed an air, sea and land blockade. Israel has largely controlled who enters and leaves the Strip; severely limited the import and export of food, medical supplies, infrastructure materials and commercial goods; violently restricted access along the coast of Gaza; and cut off access to farmland. Before the current war, two-thirds of the population in Gaza was supported by food assistance.

Multiple conflicts between Hamas and Israel over the years have exacerbated those issues. Israel's current war in Gaza, launched after Hamas' attack killed 1,200 people in October 2023, has displaced more than 90% of the population in the Strip, according to the United Nations. Gaza health officials say at least 41,000 people have been killed."
"Opinion | Biden pledged to restore order as president. In the Middle East, he's failing.",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-iran-war-biden-hezbollah-election-rcna174262,2024-10-08T10:47:49Z,"The president's poor leadership has brought us closer to a regional war that could cause enormous suffering and hurt his own party.

One of Joe Biden's promises in his 2020 presidential campaign was that he would restore strong U.S. leadership abroad and rein in the chaos that Donald Trump had unleashed in the international order.

But if you take a look at the Middle East right now, Biden hasn't done a very good job of fulfilling that pledge.

Under Biden's watch, the Middle East is growing less stable. In the past few weeks, Israel has begun a new war with its invasion of Lebanon, against the public wishes of the Biden administration. Iran has fired around 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, the second time it has ever launched such a direct assault on Israel from its own land. Israel has since promised it will retaliate against Iran -- and that if the tit-for-tat continues for an additional round, strikes on Iran's nuclear sites are on the table. Meanwhile Israel's war in Gaza in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks continues to rage with no end in sight. As a result of the instability, the price of oil is rising, and attacks on oil production in the region could cause it to surge more.

In other words, the Middle East is slowly inching toward breaking out into a full-scale regional war that could shake up the global economy, create a gigantic crisis in U.S. foreign policy and result in the deaths of countless civilians.

This is not good news for the Democrats as Election Day approaches: Just the rumblings of an imminent crisis or potentially surging gas prices could hurt the electoral appeal of Democrats, who are already suffering from their association with inflation.

The growing specter of wide-scale war in the Middle East is not some kind of approaching weather event or natural disaster. It is the product of choices. And our president has made some terrible ones that helped us get to this point. After Hamas killed around 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023, it was inevitable that Israel was going to retaliate. What was not inevitable was that the Biden administration would give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a far-right leader with neocolonial extremists in his Cabinet, carte blanche to retaliate against the entire population of the Gaza Strip however he wished to.

The Biden administration has appeared to use leaks and statements to suggest that it believes Netanyahu has gone too far in his brutality toward the civilians of Gaza, but in practice it has greenlighted all of Israel's actions. The Biden administration has been a staunch defender of Israel at the United Nations, shielding it from legally binding Security Council resolutions. It has given Israel billions in military aid. Aside from a brief, temporary and ultimately symbolic pause in arms transfers, Biden has not threatened to cut off aid, or even condition aid on Israel's compliance with international or U.S. law. The Biden administration, to keep weapons shipments intact under U.S. law, has reportedly ignored findings from the State Department and USAID that Israel had blocked U.S. humanitarian aid to Gaza.

Netanyahu's takeaway from Biden's support is that he can take U.S. backing as unconditional and do whatever he wants not only toward Palestinian civilians, but in the region more broadly. Netanyahu has embraced a ""shoot first, notify Biden later"" attitude toward many high-stakes and escalatory actions against adversaries in the Middle East, such as when Israel struck the Syrian headquarters of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, or when Israel leveled several buildings in Beirut in a bombing that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Israel's operations in Lebanon -- against Biden's public wishes -- have already displaced close to a quarter of Lebanon's population and killed hundreds of civilians, according to PBS' NewsHour. And Netanyahu has demonstrated he feels no obligation to listen to U.S. calls to wind down the bloody military operation in Gaza, which is why Israel and Hezbollah have locked horns in the last year.

As Atlantic Council fellow Nicholas Blanford explained to me, Israel's escalation with its adversaries in the region increases the likelihood of a regional war. If, for example, Israel decides to entrench itself in a more wide-scale war in Lebanon, it could nudge Hezbollah to unleash its most destructive firepower, such as its precision-guided missiles that it has so far refrained from using. And if Iran were to fear that Israel is about to wipe out Hezbollah at some point, it could ""activate all [its] proxies across the region"" against Israel, dragging several other countries directly into the conflict.

We don't know exactly how Netanyahu would act if Biden were to condition or cut off aid to Israel. But given that U.S. military support is vital to Israel's national security and military operations, Netanyahu would be far more likely to behave conservatively in his military campaigns and targeted strikes across the region.

Netanyahu is aware that the timing of his more aggressive maneuvering comes at an acutely sensitive time for Biden politically. Biden is likely in the weeks before Election Day to be particularly hesitant to initiate an upheaval in U.S.-Israeli relations by cutting off weapons shipments or demanding that Netanyahu act like more of a cooperative U.S. ally. But at the same time Biden looks rudderless and weak by not doing anything.

When asked at a press conference Friday if he believed Netanyahu was trying to influence the U.S. election, Biden said, ""I don't know."" And when asked by another reporter, ""How long are you OK with Israel bombing Lebanon? What is acceptable to you?"" he smiled and walked away from the podium.

Biden has gotten himself into this bind through his record of unconditional support for Israel, no matter how badly it deviates from basic morality in warfare, international law or U.S. interests. One can't help but wonder if Biden's poor leadership in the Middle East might just mark a historic first: a president inadvertently springing an October surprise on his own party."
"Opinion | Here's how Israel, Iran and Hezbollah can avoid an all-out war",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/how-israel-iran-hezbollah-can-avoid-war-rcna174123,2024-10-07T19:40:18Z,"By Hussein Ibish, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute

The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, as well as its sponsors in Tehran, appears to be spiraling completely out of control. An all-out war is looming with Israel, whose government is flush with victory and triumphalism and in little mood to suspend its attacks as Iran and Hezbollah vow to fight on.

The Biden administration sought to limit the post-Oct. 7 crisis to a war in the Gaza Strip, and especially prevent it from spreading into Lebanon. The policy has fallen apart, with Israel having invaded Lebanon, continuing to batter Hezbollah with air attacks and, most dangerously of all, tit-for-tat missile attacks between Iran and Israel. At the time of writing, the region is bracing for Israel's inevitable retaliation against Iran.

Yet, an all-out war on multiple fronts could still be avoided since there is an off-ramp for the warring parties.

A mutual drawdown could center on the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolution 1701, adopted in the aftermath of the last major Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006. The resolution holds that Hezbollah should withdraw its fighters and heavy equipment from the south of Lebanon up to the Litani River, about 25 km (roughly 15.5 miles) into the country.

The resolution was accepted by Israel and the Lebanese government, but not formally by Hezbollah. Israel and Hezbollah settled into a ""new normal"" of routine clashes on both sides of the border limited to about a mile on either side, aimed at military targets and producing limited casualties.

This understanding persisted until last Oct. 7, when both sides' attitudes changed. While it didn't want a war with Israel, Hezbollah couldn't remain completely passive and preserve its reputation as a ""resistance"" organization. So it increased rocket fire, initially within the accepted understanding. But for Israel, that was no longer acceptable. Oct. 7 prompted a new border security doctrine, rendering the presence of an Iranian-backed militia to its north strategically and, especially, politically intolerable.

Israeli leaders needed to inflict strategic costs on Iran and its network, which had benefited while paying almost no price from the Oct. 7 attack and its aftermath. They also sought to recuperate the legitimacy of Israeli security institutions through a clear-cut victory over a major enemy, which was not available in Gaza. Hezbollah was a more strategically significant and conventional target, offering credible metrics of victory.

Discussion about an invasion of Lebanon began as early as Oct. 12, 2023, pushed by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. It was prevented by the Biden administration and the need to focus on Hamas. But as Israel began to run out of targets in Gaza, and Hezbollah's cross-border attacks had intensified over time, attention began to turn north.

While Hezbollah and Iran definitely did not want a war to defend Hamas (an unreliable ally) or Gaza (a place of no strategic significance), even ambivalent Israelis could see potential advantages to expanding the conflict. This gave them near-absolute escalation dominance, and the ability to control the scope and pace of the conflict.

As the U.S. election loomed, with Israel enjoying maximum freedom of action and impunity from U.S. pushback, it began a series of major attacks designed to cripple Hezbollah. Targets included the assassination of many of its key leaders, including Hassan Nasrallah, battlefield commanders, fighters and operatives, and heavy equipment including missiles and rocket launchers. Ignoring a week of U.S. efforts to organize a cease-fire, Israel suggested it would accept, it launched a major invasion of Lebanon's south.

Throughout this process, Hezbollah pulled its punches, never unleashing its most powerful precision-guided missiles at the most sensitive and strategic Israeli targets, avoiding the Dimona nuclear reactor and population centers such as Haifa. Iran remained passive, with the exception of a failed drone response to an Israeli strike on the Iranian Embassy annex in Damascus that killed several high-ranking Iranian generals. That all changed Oct. 1 -- when Iran unleashed its second significant missile barrage against Israel.

The ball is now firmly in Israel's court, as heavy fighting continues in southern Lebanon and the air campaign against Hezbollah proceeds apace. Israel will certainly respond militarily to Iran's attack, but much will depend on whether it attacks redline Iranian targets such as oil installations or nuclear facilities.

Many fear that Israel will seize the opportunity to launch a protracted air war against Iran that is intended to draw the U.S. into conducting a bombing campaign sufficient to knock Iran's nuclear program back by a decade or more.

Virtually no one in the United States wants to be drawn into a major war with Iran, even on behalf of Israel, but the Israelis probably lack the conventional firepower to do the job for themselves.

Fortunately, there is an offramp.

The Lebanese government, obviously acting pursuant to consultations with Hezbollah, is offering to implement 1701, with the militia pulling back and being replaced in the south by the Lebanese armed forces and U.N. observers.

Riding a wave of wins, Israel's ruling coalition may be in no mood to compromise. But sensible Israelis must realize that they are on the brink of being drawn into another prolonged occupation in southern Lebanon which would be the ideal context for Hezbollah to eventually rebuild its organization, power and legitimacy. Hezbollah would like nothing more than a return to the fight against Israel that began in 1982 when the organization was founded to combat Israeli occupation and culminated with Israel's retreat in May 2000.

In his final speech, Nasrallah said he would welcome an Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Many dismissed it as bluster but Nasrallah was almost certainly serious, given Hezbollah's urgent need to recover and rebuild. Israel may be unwittingly handing them the opportunity to do that on their own terms.

Moreover, a war with Iran carries enormous risks, including the development of potentially serious resentment against Israel in the United States. It could sentence Washington to a prolonged pattern of routine bombing runs against Iran, just as occurred in the 1990s against Iraq. And Iran and Hezbollah both retain options, including more powerful missiles and the use of other proxies and even terrorists around the world to strike back. The danger of Israeli overreach, especially pursuing open-ended insurgencies to the north and south -- and potentially one that appears to be brewing to the east in the occupied West Bank -- is considerable.

The deal would look like this: Hezbollah agrees to pull back fighters and heavy equipment to beyond the Litani River, to be replaced by Lebanese and U.N. troops. Hezbollah also ceases rocket fire against Israel, with both parties agreeing to decouple the Lebanon conflict from the Gaza war. This agreement would also allow Israel and Iran to stop their extraordinarily dangerous tit-for-tat exchanges and spare the region, and the U.S., from a multifront regional war and a direct U.S. military confrontation with Iran.

Lebanon and Hezbollah seem willing to take this deal, and Washington is pushing it enthusiastically. Iran would surely welcome it to, as Hezbollah would not have greenlighted the Lebanese acting prime minister to make the offer without approval from Tehran. The main question is whether Israel's government, with the wind at its sails, is in any mood to compromise.

The Biden administration needs to remind Israel of the dangers of overreach, and potential for serious damage to bilateral relations if Israel is viewed as dragging the U.S. into another catastrophic ""forever war"" in the Middle East. Biden has already warned Israel not to make ""the mistakes we made"" after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The parallels are unnerving. A national trauma followed by deceptively easy early victories, as the U.S. experienced in Afghanistan and Israel thinks it has accomplished in Gaza, is the perfect setup for catastrophic overreach.

Given the existence of an off-ramp, Iran and Hezbollah's apparent willingness to take it, and the urgent need for Washington to avoid getting dragged into another madcap Middle East adventure, one of Biden's most important final missions is to convince Israel to take a deep breath, and the deal, before it's too late."
Opinion | Our son is still being held by Hamas. Bring him home now.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-hamas-hostages-october-7-anniversary-itay-chen-rcna173383,2024-10-07T10:15:04Z,"As the anniversary of the worst day of our lives approaches, we ask everyone to think of their own families.

We often think about the days before Oct. 7, 2023. Looking back now, we realize our lives were so simple and our problems were trivial. Our son Itay was just starting his adult life. While our lives have greatly changed over the past year, the tragedy we wake up to every morning has not. There are still 101 hostages, including our son, who remain captive in Gaza. Now, we spend each day in government meetings, protesting in the streets and running to the ends of the Earth to bring Itay and the rest of the hostages home.

Itay is an American citizen and Israel Defense Forces soldier who was stationed on the Israeli border with Gaza on Oct. 7. He bravely fought to protect Israeli civilians and was abducted and kidnapped into Gaza.

On March 12, we heard a knock on our front door that still rings loud in our ears. Our stomachs dropped as we opened the door and were told our precious son had been murdered by Hamas terrorists. With so much misinformation swirling around this conflict, we still don't know what to believe. We question whether or not he survived. We are holding out hope that Itay is still alive.

A year after Oct. 7, we wonder how much longer we have to beg world leaders to do their jobs and secure a hostage release deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government have failed our son and all the hostages. Each day a deal is delayed -- and our children, parents, brothers and sisters remain in the hands of ruthless terrorists -- is another second they are closer to death.

Prime Minister Netanyahu promised a deal was imminent when he addressed Congress back in July. His lies erode our sense of hope. Qatar and Egypt have failed to effectively pressure Hamas to accept a deal, and each time we are close, Hamas pushes the goalpost.

Will one year turn into two? Or three? Will this unimaginable nightmare continue forever?

Our family is deeply appreciative of the Biden administration's tireless efforts to secure an immediate and total release. But it is not enough.

Last week in Washington, we met with national security adviser Jake Sullivan for our 13th in-person meeting. We met with CIA Director William Burns and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Although our meetings have been productive, we ask that key assumptions be challenged, methods be re-evaluated and new tactics be considered.

Itay and the 100 other hostages are depending on us. This administration is running out of time before the election and a changing of the guard. Nothing should hold them back from securing a deal to release the hostages -- who include seven U.S. citizens.

We just observed Rosh Hashanah -- the Jewish New Year. This holiday is a moment for serious introspection and anticipation for what is to come. We traditionally eat apples and honey to signify a ""sweet"" start. What could possibly be ""sweet"" about this new year? How many more holidays will there be an empty chair at our table? Our Rosh Hashanah wishes were simple: Do everything to bring the hostages home now. Before it is too late.

Our family forever broke on Oct. 7. Since then, we wear tape on our clothes reminding the world of how many days we have endured life without Itay.

As we prepare to write ""365"" days and tape that number to our chests, we ask: How much longer? The remaining hostages are being executed, and we are on borrowed time. As the anniversary of the worst day of our lives approaches, we ask everyone to think of their own families.

What would you do to bring your loved one home? Imagine the ends of the Earth to which you'd run to see them maybe just once more. Enough is enough. Our world leaders must get the deal done now."
"Opinion | On a grim Oct. 7 anniversary, the potential for wider war has never felt greater",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-october-7-anniversary-biden-netanyahus-iran-rcna174175,2024-10-07T10:14:59Z,"By Andrea Mitchell, NBC Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent; Host, 'Andrea Mitchell Reports'

A year ago, Israel and Saudi Arabia were talking with the U.S. at the United Nations meetings in New York about an agreement that could end hostilities between Israel and its Arab neighbors, reshaping the Middle East. Then Hamas terrorists attacked Israel, taking hostages and slaughtering around 1,200 Israelis. A year after the Oct. 7 massacre, most of the surviving hostages have not been released, more than 40,000 Gazans have died according to according to local health authorities, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's popularity at home is soaring because of his military successes against Hezbollah, and the Biden administration has less influence than ever over Israel's decision-making.

With Israel and Iran now teetering on the verge of all-out war, administration officials fear these escalating retaliatory exchanges could explode into a regional conflict -- exactly what President Joe Biden has been trying to prevent since the day after Hamas' surprise attack, when Hezbollah joined in and started sending rockets toward Israel.

Asked why the U.S. -- Israel's largest provider of weapons -- has so little leverage over its closest ally, a senior official told me, ""We have leverage, we haven't always used it."" And administration officials say Netanyahu now sees a brief window before the U.S. election to try to eliminate what he says is an existential threat to Israel's survival: Iran and its terrorist proxies' determination to eliminate Israel as an independent state.

So how did Netanyahu resurrect his political support at home, which had all but collapsed after his military and intelligence agencies failed to detect the Hamas attack? It's been a long and dangerous 12 months.

In the immediate aftermath of the massacre, there was worldwide horror and sympathy. But a few weeks later, when Israel bombed the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza in an effort to kill a Hamas commander, the videos went viral. Analysis from satellite images suggested Israel had used 2,000-pound ""bunker buster"" bombs, capable of causing massive damage to anyone within hundreds of feet of impact.

The Arab world, the European public and protesters in the U.S. were outraged. Leading Democratic senators and lifelong supporters of Israel told me privately they were horrified at what they saw as a disproportionate use of force. Foreign service officers at the State Department complained about the use of an American-made bomb in the strike, a potential violation of congressionally mandated restrictions on the use of U.S. weapons. Meanwhile Israel's initial siege of Gaza, which had cut off food, water and fuel, was creating a desperate humanitarian crisis.

For 11 months, CIA Director William Burns and Secretary of State Tony Blinken shuttled around the Middle East, negotiating with Israel, Egypt and Qatar -- which represents Hamas -- for a cease-fire and hostage release. There was one brief cease-fire in November, and more than 100 hostages from all over the world returned home. But every time Blinken anticipated or announced another imminent breakthrough, Netanyahu or Hamas -- or both -- would raise the stakes. On his 10th mission to the region, Blinken didn't even stop in Israel. There was no deal to be had.

And then Hamas executed American Hersh Goldberg-Polin and five other hostages, a devastating blow to their courageous families.

The dominos continued to fall. In April, Iran retaliated for Israel's bombing of an Iranian consulate in Damascus. Israel intercepted all but one of the drones and missiles with the help of the U.S. and other allies. Then, a rocket believed to have been fired by Hezbollah hit a soccer field in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, killing 12 youngsters. Israel again upped the ante, assassinating the Hamas political director in Iran's capital -- a dramatic display of Israel's ability to penetrate Iranian defenses.

Arguably Israel's most stunning demonstration of its reach was a coordinated operation that resulted in thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah members exploding, often in public. Dozens died and thousands were injured, according to Lebanese health officials. This was followed by the targeted assassination of the veteran Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, a killing Netanyahu approved from New York, just after addressing the United Nations General Assembly. Briefing reporters a few hours later, a senior Israeli official told us Israel would continue trying to eliminate Hezbollah, saying when your enemy is down, you don't let him up.

But today, as Israel commemorates the grim anniversary of Oct. 7, hostage families live in dread of their loved ones being killed. Meanwhile, Biden seems paralyzed. As one U.S. official told me, Netanyahu knows Biden is in a political straightjacket. An emboldened Netanyahu will yet again likely ignore the president's calls for a proportionate response; the Israeli leader may even take this moment to deal a decisive blow to Iran. A Saudi deal with Israel seems dead, for now. And the potential for a wider war involving the U.S. has never been greater."
Opinion | How Israel's invasion of Lebanon could spiral into a massive regional war,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-lebanon-war-iran-hezbollah-biden-rcna173364,2024-10-04T16:30:43Z,"An expert explains why Israel's intensifying war on Hezbollah is risky for the region.

Israel moved military forces into southern Lebanese territory Monday, an invasion that marks a major new level of intensity in about a year of conflict with Hezbollah. The paramilitary organization fired rockets at Israeli positions in the Shebaa Farms the day after Oct. 7 ""in solidarity"" with the Palestinian people after Hamas' attacks on Israel. (That area is a disputed territory which Lebanon and Syria say belongs to Lebanon, and Israel controls and says belongs to Syria.) Hezbollah, sometimes called a state within a state, is backed by Iran and does not have widespread support in Lebanon.

Then Tuesday, Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, citing last week's assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and, this summer, the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.

The Biden administration has long opposed an Israeli incursion into Lebanon. But in the past year, the administration has also been unwilling to take any meaningful steps to rein in Israel's behavior, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is acting boldly to assert more dominance in the region and degrade Israel's adversaries -- with a continued disregard for civilian lives. Israeli airstrikes have struck medical facilities and already killed hundreds of civilians in Lebanon. The probability of a regional war seems to be growing by the day.

To better understand the unfolding conflict, I called Nick Blanford, a Beirut-based fellow at the Atlantic Council and the author of ""Warriors of God: Inside Hezbollah's Thirty-Year Struggle Against Israel.""

Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows.

Zeeshan Aleem: What is happening right now and how do we know when to say whether this is a new war?

Nicholas Blanford: I think you have to put the developments of the last few weeks into some context. One day after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Hezbollah staged a pro forma attack against Israeli positions along the Lebanon-Israel border, and it dedicated this attack to its allies -- Hamas in Gaza. But very quickly it turned into a kind of a tit-for-tat, daily attacks. The Hezbollah guys would attack Israeli military positions along the border; the Israelis would retaliate with artillery fire airstrikes into south Lebanon. And this really continued from October almost uninterrupted.

There was a clear moment in September when Israel's patience ran out. And they escalated in a very dramatic fashion, by detonating thousands of pagers which they'd been able, apparently, to booby trap. The following day, they detonated hundreds of walkie-talkies. That was followed up by intense airstrikes across areas of Lebanon where Hezbollah has a presence. And those attacks have intensified over the past two weeks, climaxing on Sept. 27 with the massive airstrike on Hezbollah's underground headquarters in south Beirut, which killed the veteran Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, who has led the group for 32 years. The latest development is the advance of some elite Israeli army units into southern Lebanon where they have reportedly already taken some casualties.

So I would say we are in a war but it is not yet full scale. Both sides are mainly hitting military targets, not infrastructure as well, although hundreds of civilians have been killed in Lebanon.

Could you give us a brief primer on Hezbollah? How it emerged, what it is, what it believes in and its social function in Lebanon?

Blanford: Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim organization that follows the Iranian, theocratic system of rule. Hezbollah has a secretary general -- most recently the late Nasrallah -- but the true leader of Hezbollah is the spiritual leader of Iran, currently, Ali Khamenei. He's the ultimate authority and, in general, the Iranians will set the strategic agenda.

Hezbollah emerged after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 to kick out the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was deployed in strength in south Lebanon. The Israelis in '82 reached all the way to Beirut and then they gradually withdrew. By 1985, they were occupying a border strip along the Lebanon-Israel border and Hezbollah became the main resistance force against that Israeli occupation. Particularly during the 1990s, Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran but also supported by neighboring Syria, was able to deal blow after blow to the Israeli occupation forces, and that culminated in May 2000 with Israel pulling out of south Lebanon.

Hezbollah refused to put down its arms after the Israelis left. They said, 'We need to keep our arms, our military force, to deter Israel from coming back into south Lebanon.' But there was also another unspoken reason, which is that Hezbollah gradually became a source of deterrence for Iran -- especially after the war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 when it expanded very quickly and acquired a great deal of weaponry from Iran, Syria and elsewhere. So, for Iran, Hezbollah has now become a major force multiplier.

Hezbollah has a slightly schizophrenic character, because it is ideologically beholden to the Islamic leadership of Iran, but of course it is a Lebanese organization. It survives or falls depending on the support it gets from the Lebanese Shia community, which is why, since the beginning, Hezbollah has invested a lot in social welfare organizations.

The Shia population of Lebanon tends to be traditionally fairly downtrodden. They live in the poorer areas of the country, traditionally neglected by central governments. And Hezbollah really stepped in with schools, with hospitals, with repairing war damaged houses, even things like helping farmers with agricultural aid. It's become an indispensable organization for the Lebanese Shia community. So they've been able to maintain that support since the early 1980s.

Other communities: the Christians and Sunnis, in particular, the Druze, to an extent, [say] 'Well, hang on a minute. We do have a national army. Why do we need a Shia militia, armed to the teeth, stronger than many armies around the world, to defend Lebanon?' So there have been growing calls for Hezbollah to disarm, and this is why Hezbollah has moved deeper into Lebanese politics, particularly over the last 19 years, since the 2005 parliamentary elections.

What are the fundamental dynamics driving how Hezbollah and Israel's government see each other, both in terms of geopolitical interests and domestic political interests?

Blanford: Ideologically, Hezbollah and Iran want to see the end of Israel, and the restitution of Palestine to the Palestinians. They have in the past assisted Palestinians during the Al Aqsa Intifada. They would help the Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza fight the Israelis. But in the past, they didn't get directly involved. When they kicked the Israelis out of Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah didn't immediately rush across the border into Israel and say, ""We're going to go and liberate Jerusalem now."" There's an acknowledgment that it's up to the Palestinians to liberate themselves, but Hezbollah is definitely there to help.

When you look at it more realistically, the reason why Hezbollah is so powerful now is because the Iranians want them to be. We go back to this notion of Hezbollah forming a key role in Iran's deterrence architecture: The stronger Hezbollah becomes, the safer Iran feels.

The Institute for National Security Studies, a leading think tank in Israel, has for the past few years described Hezbollah as Israel's greatest threat, which is quite remarkable in itself, because we're not talking about a country, we're talking about an organization, albeit one that is backed by a powerful regional country.

The Israelis have watched Hezbollah grow stronger and stronger. What the Israelis are doing now is something they haven't dared to do before, and that is to really go for broke with Hezbollah. What's interesting is I think the Israelis are gambling that Hezbollah and the Iranians do not want a full-scale war with Israel right now. Why? Because if there is a full-scale war, whatever the outcome, Hezbollah will take a huge battering, as indeed we're seeing now, and there's no guarantee that Hezbollah will be able to rebuild, rearm and re-equip as quickly as it did after the 2006 war to continue serving as a deterrence for Iran. In other words, if Hezbollah gets engaged in a full-scale war now, Iran could lose its major deterrence factor in that war, and all this would be for the sake of coming to the support of Hamas in Gaza. Hamas is small fry compared to Hezbollah -- Hezbollah is much, much, much more important to Iran than Hamas. Which is why Hezbollah is still acting with a certain amount of restraint despite Israel's escalated action against it. Hezbollah still has not used its arsenal of precision-guided missiles.

It's a dangerous gamble. It could go wrong. Especially now that Israeli troops are operating on the ground in south Lebanon, Hezbollah's home turf. The current conflict could spill into a major war. We're still below that threshold moment, but if it happens, it has a potential to go regional, dragging in Iran, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

Can you walk us through the different scenarios you see unfolding here?

Blanford: The least likely one is that a cease-fire comes in. The Americans and the French had an idea for a 21-day cease-fire to calm things down along the Lebanon-Israel border. Netanyahu has rejected it. So that's not going to happen..

A second scenario is that what we're seeing now continues. The Israelis haven't started hitting Lebanese infrastructure, power stations, bridges, roads, the airports, seaports; they are focusing on Hezbollah military targets by using air power and now ground forces, albeit in a limited manner. Hezbollah, by the same token, is striking back at Israeli military targets. They haven't been hitting Israeli infrastructure. Now this could go on even at this heightened rate. But under current circumstances, I suspect that Hezbollah will continue doing what it's doing -- in other words, absorb these blows that the Israelis have inflicted, and keep firing rockets into Israel.

In some respects, the Israeli ground maneuver could play right into Hezbollah's hands, as the Israelis are entering terrain that Hezbollah has had for 18 years [and Hezbollah has been able] to prepare for exactly this eventuality. When the Israelis did move into Lebanon in 2006 after two weeks of aerial bombing, they came in for a big surprise. They didn't understand Hezbollah's underground bunker networks, its ambush positions, firing positions.

You could have a similar scenario this time round, albeit on a larger scale, where the Israelis, who have a better understanding of what Hezbollah is about these days, could come in in force for what they would describe perhaps as a limited incursion to basically rubble-ize and depopulate this broad strip of south Lebanon. But they risk losing a lot of troops because they're going to be operating in Hezbollah's environment. And at the end of it, if the mission is successful, what do you do then? Do you reoccupy south Lebanon? If so, you've gone back to the situation between 1978 and 2000 and that didn't end too well for the Israelis. But if you pull back to the border, then what is to stop Hezbollah basically moving back into the border district and beginning to rebuild?

There could come a point when the Israelis say, 'We've hit all the targets from the air and our soldiers are fighting on the ground but Hezbollah is still firing rockets across the border.' And this is where perhaps a third scenario can kick in: The Israelis conclude that, well, we're going to have to escalate this even further by deploying a larger number of troops into Lebanon to expand the target set to include Lebanese infrastructure as well. It could be at that point that Hezbollah, with Iranian blessing, feels it has no choice but to launch its precision-guided systems at Israeli military and infrastructure targets. This is where the conflict could go regional.

What role does the U.S. have in all this, and what advice would you give to the Biden administration on how to prevent a full-scale regional war from breaking out?

Blanford: Yes, a regional war potentially could happen. If the Iranians assess that Hezbollah is about to get bludgeoned by Israel, they may conclude, 'We've got nothing left to lose. We're about to lose Hezbollah. Let's go large. We'll activate all our proxies across the region, and we'll give it a go and see what happens to Israel.'

I think the Biden administration is in a difficult position. President Biden is enormously frustrated with Netanyahu, partly because of the Gaza conflict going on for so long. But he has been urging Netanyahu since the get-go to not open a second front with Hezbollah. Now you could argue that a second front was open anyway, because of these simmering tit-for-tat attacks that have been going on across the Lebanon-Israel border since October. But these attacks were containable. Hezbollah has said, 'Look, this is a support front that we're doing. Once the war in Gaza ends, we're going to stop.' So the emphasis has been very much on trying to conclude a cease-fire deal in Gaza, which will then have a trickle-down effect and should stabilize the Lebanon-Israel border. But of course, we haven't had a Gaza cease-fire. The conflict continues, and now the Israelis clearly have lost patience with Hezbollah and have gone large.

There's very little that the Biden administration feels it can do, particularly when you've got a very close election coming up in just over a month now. So the Biden administration could do what it's done before, and then suspend arms shipments to Israel, but this time do it properly. Cut off all military support to Israel. That would put a lot of pressure on Netanyahu to start picking up the phone and listening when Biden calls. But I don't think they're going to do that because there'll be a political backlash in the United States, and that could affect Kamala Harris' chances against Donald Trump. I think Netanyahu is taking advantage of this and is going for it."
"Trump, who has insulted Jewish voters who don't support him, to attend Oct. 7 memorial event",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-october-7-memorial-event-golf-club-rcna173678,2024-10-02T21:46:48Z,"The Republican presidential nominee intends to speak at the event, which is scheduled to be held at the Trump National Doral Miami, one of his golf courses. (It's unclear if the Trump campaign is also organizing the event; the campaign did not respond immediately to a request for comment.)

""President Trump has always condemned antisemitism and will continue to do so once he is back in the Oval Office,"" his campaign said in a statement. ""He will hold accountable those who perpetuate violence against the Jewish people, and as such, America will be safe and patriotic again.""

Trump has long claimed to be the most pro-Israel U.S. president in history. He has accused the Biden administration of not being supportive enough of Israel, even as the White House has provided unconditional military and financial support to its ally despite the soaring death toll in Gaza. (Trump's anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian beliefs are also well documented.)

Yet Trump himself also has a history of invoking antisemitic tropes and has rubbed shoulders with white nationalists and Holocaust deniers. He singled out Jewish Democratic lawmakers, like Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, for attacks. In a radio interview in July, Trump claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris ""doesn't like Jewish people"" and appeared to agree when the host called Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, a ""crappy Jew.""

Trump has also repeatedly denigrated Jewish Democrats in remarks about the election, even at events focused on combating antisemitism. He said that any Jewish person who votes for a Democrat ""hates their religion"" and that ""they should be ashamed of themselves."" He claimed that Jewish and Black people vote for Democrats out of ""habit"" and said that if he loses the 2024 election, Jewish voters ""would have a lot to do"" with it -- a line that drew outrage from Jewish groups."
Opinion | Israel bombed my home as a result of my journalism. This can't become our new normal.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israels-closure-al-jazeeras-ramallah-office-sends-chilling-message-rcna172845,2024-09-29T14:11:31Z,"This isn't the first time Israel has taken aim at media workers in Palestine, where it attempts to control the narrative in tandem with efforts to control territory.

On Sept. 22, Israeli forces stormed Al Jazeera's Ramallah office and shut down its operations, effectively barring one of the few remaining windows into the realities of life under occupation in the West Bank. The incident, as alarming as it is, extends far beyond the closure of a newsroom and marks an escalation in Israel's broader crackdown on press freedoms in Palestine. For those of us journalists who have reported from the ground, our work has never been just about reporting the news; it's about making visible to the world a reality that shapes every aspect of our daily lives as Palestinians.

This isn't the first time Israel has taken aim at media workers in Palestine, where it attempts to control the narrative in tandem with efforts to control territory. We've seen similar tactics since October of last year, and long before, when tens of Palestinian journalists were killed along with their family members, media offices bombed, and entire news organizations targeted. I've lost colleagues who reported side by side with me from northern Gaza, like Ismail Al Ghoul. Together Ismail and I endured months of cold and hunger, and terrifying nights during Israel's ground offensives. He and so many other dedicated colleagues were killed for speaking out, for doing their job.

I know this because I survived it. As a writer and reporter for Al Jazeera in Gaza during the war from October 2023 until last May, I experienced firsthand the dangers of reporting on the ground, and the scrutiny I was subjected to for being affiliated with Al Jazeera. The press badge on my chest, meant to ensure my safety, functioned as a target. In December 2023, my home was bombed with me and my family inside, as a direct result of my work, after I received multiple threats via phone calls and text messages from the Israeli military ordering me to stop reporting and cease writing.

My own experience in Gaza bears this out. The bombing of my home didn't just shake my personal life by burying me under the rubble for hours -- it disrupted my sense of purpose as a writer and journalist. For days, I questioned whether I could continue reporting. Knowing the cost, my family lived in constant fear every time I went on assignment, while colleagues around me grew increasingly afraid to speak out, knowing that anyone could be a target at any moment.

What we witnessed daily, from drone surveillance and press tents being bombed to the direct shooting at journalists and targeting of their vehicles as they traveled for coverage, was not just an attack on the ones trying to report, but on the very idea of journalism. It is an attack on the notion that the world has a right to know what happens in places like Gaza and the West Bank. Still, we continued to report because we knew the world needed to see what was happening, and we knew that to stop reporting would mean to surrender to the very forces that sought to silence us.

Al Jazeera has been a crucial voice documenting not only the devastation in Gaza, especially as it produces exclusive access and footage to its viewers from the ground, but also the civil unrest and protests within Israel, the political discontent in Tel Aviv, and the deadly raids on refugee camps in the West Bank. Now, with its Ramallah bureau shut down, that voice is fraying. But this is only one episode in Israel's ongoing campaign against the media in the occupied territories.

What's striking is that it comes nearly one year into Israel's war on Gaza, dimming any hope of renewed global attention as people near an anniversary of death and destruction. What concerns me most is that this is more than just about Al Jazeera. It's about the future of a young generation of journalists aspiring to speak out during times of terror and oppression. As someone who reported from right in front of Israeli tanks, I can say that journalists in Palestine are heartbreakingly treated as a threat.

Israel's efforts to silence the free press represent a tragedy that cuts deep into the ongoing struggle for liberation and peace. It's a tragedy for anyone who values the role of the press in democratic societies. When journalists are attacked, the public is denied the information necessary to truly understand reality.

When the press is silenced, it's not just a building that closes or stories that disappear. It's accountability itself that is lost. It cuts off a vital flow of information to the public. And the consequences ripple far beyond the journalists themselves. The world loses access to the ground truth -- the kind of truth that challenges ""official"" government narratives, the kind that holds the powerful to account.

By attacking journalists, whether through the bombing of their homes, as in my case, or shutting down newsrooms, as we saw in Ramallah, Israel is sending a chilling message: Telling the truth is dangerous work with a steep price.

That's why the closure of the Ramallah office isn't merely an Al Jazeera or local concern -- it's a global one. The erosion of press freedoms in Palestine reflects a disturbing trend, a concerted effort to undermine the institutions that safeguard truth and transparency. It's a pattern of slow, deliberate attempts to dismantle the free press entirely. Because if we allow press freedoms to be eroded in Palestine, what's to stop it from happening elsewhere?

In this critical moment, the world can't afford to look away. In defending journalism, we defend the truth. It's the means by which we fight against injustice. I know what happens when the press is attacked, and I fear we've reached a point where these attacks have become the norm, accepted even. The closure of the Ramallah office is an upsetting move, yes. But it's also an urgent call to action, because it won't stop with Al Jazeera."
Opinion | Trump's remarkable endorsement from this Muslim leader ought to alarm Harris,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/muslim-mayor-endorses-donald-trump-rcna172310,2024-09-25T10:40:39Z,"Amer Ghalib, a Muslim immigrant from Yemen and the mayor of Hamtramck, Mich., called Trump ""a man of principles"" and said Harris hasn't addressed his community's concerns.

Amer Ghalib, a Muslim immigrant from Yemen who serves as the mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan -- made headlines this week by endorsing Donald Trump for president. In a Facebook post, Ghalib wrote, ""President Trump and I may not agree on everything, but I know he is a man of principles."" He also called him ""the right choice for this critical time.""

If Ghalib -- a self-described conservative Democrat -- had endorsed Trump in 2020, then he likely would have been subjected to a swift backlash. As a candidate and as a president, Trump had weaponized hate against Muslim and Arab Americans and targeted us with his ""Muslim travel ban"" that in many cases separated families. And Ghalib seems to have braced for a backlash in his endorsement. He wrote, ""I'll not regret my decision no matter what the outcome would be, and I'm ready to face the consequences.""

But even though 81% of voters in Hamtramck, a majority-Muslim city, cast their ballots for Biden in 2020, there appears to have been no notable outrage to Ghalib throwing his support to Trump. That should concern Vice President Kamala Harris and her campaign. There are large Muslim and Arab populations in Michigan, obviously, but also in Pennsylvania, Georgia and Virginia.

Ghalib said Trump recently met with him for 20 minutes when he was holding a rally in Michigan. Ghalib, a vocal critic of the Biden administration's seemingly blind support of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's devastating war in Gaza, cited that as a main driver of his decision. ""We asked multiple times that they should change course, but nothing happened,"" he told reporters. ""Kamala Harris is still going in the same path and nothing was addressed."" Ghalib claims Trump, without providing details, promised to end the war. But even if Trump did, given his anti-Palestinian record as president, we know that it would be consistent with the goals of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, not the Palestinian people.

According to a recent poll of Muslim voters by Council of American-Islamic Relations, only 11% of Muslim voters nationwide said they planned to support Trump in November. Ghalib's endorsement notwithstanding, the news isn't that Muslims are supporting Trump; it's that they're not supporting Harris. Winning about 30% of Muslim's votes, she was , according to that poll, statistically tied with Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Contrast Harris polling at 30% among Muslim voters with the estimated 69% of Arab or Muslim voters across the country who voted for Biden in 2020.

As a Muslim voter who is clear about the harm Trump will cause, this is worrisome -- but not unexpected. Harris began her campaign inheriting a palpable anger directed at Biden within the Muslim and Arab community for his bear hug of Netanyahu and his continuing refusal to slow down the supply of weapons to Israel's military despite the deaths of tens of thousands of innocent people. But when Biden dropped out and Harris became the Democratic nominee, there was a fresh start. Many in these communities wanted to support Harris -- and many are.

But the Uncommitted Movement leaders told NBC News last week that Harris had given them the ""cold shoulder"" and ""fumbled"" by refusing even the ""small gesture"" of allowing a Palestinian American speaker at August's Democratic National Convention.

That said, unlike Ghalib, ""Uncommitted Movement"" leaders in Michigan announced that while they were not endorsing Harris, their top priority was defeating Trump. They said Trump's agenda includes ""plans to accelerate the killing in Gaza while intensifying the suppression of anti-war organizing."" As a result, they explained point blank, ""We must block Donald Trump, which is why we urge Uncommitted voters to vote against him and avoid third-party candidates that could inadvertently boost his chances.""

Georgia state Rep. Ruwa Romaan, a Palestinian American, was one of the people on the short list to speak at the DNC but was effectively blocked by Harris and the Democratic Party. Romaan told me in an email that Ghalib's endorsement of Trump ""does not represent the overwhelming majority of Muslim voters."" But she added that the Harris campaign is missing an opportunity to animate ""a multifaith, multiracial, multigenerational coalition whose ask is simple: stop the bombs and uphold international humanitarian law"" when it comes to Netanyahu and his military.

Romaan, a first-term Democratic lawmaker in the battleground state of Georgia, said there is still time for Harris to address this issue. If she does, Romaan added, it will lead to a ""decisive edge come November.""

While the suffering in Gaza doesn't get the same headlines it got earlier this year, that suffering is still top of mind for many in the Arab and Muslim communities and our allies. Because the suffering is ongoing. Saturday, the Israeli military launched missiles at a school they claim was being utilized by Hamas and, according to CNN, killed at least 22 people, mostly women and children. ""There was no warning. We were sitting in the schools, and suddenly missiles started raining down on us,"" a witness told a CNN reporter. ""Where is the conscience?""

Beyond Gaza, we are now seeing an alarming and deadly escalation of Israeli military action in Lebanon that has killed more than 500 people and displaced thousands. Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah have been bombarding each other since the Oct. 7 terrorist attack by Hamas sparked Israel's invasion of Gaza. This could get far worse. UNICEF warned Tuesday that ""any further escalation in this conflict would be catastrophic"" for children and families in Lebanon. If the media is again filled with images of dead women and children caused by Netanyahu's use of U.S. weaponry, Harris will have to denounce this or risk losing even more support from communities that Democrats have depended on for victory.

During her acceptance speech at the DNC, Harris spoke about Palestinians in a way that no Democratic presidential nominee ever has. She described the ""the scale of suffering"" in Gaza as ""heartbreaking."" She not only committed to not only to working toward a ceasefire -- which she first called for in March, well before Biden -- but she also vowed to ensure the ""Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.""

In contrast, Trump has repeatedly used the word ""Palestinian"" as a slur to attack Democrats who express concern for the brutal suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. As President, he cut millions of dollars in vital aid to Palestinians as Netanyahu urged him. And during the Gaza war, Trump vocally criticized Harris's calls for a ceasefire--with his primary concern not being the slaughter of Palestinians but that Israel was ""absolutely losing the PR war.""

Trump is as pro-Netanyahu and anti-Palestinian as they come. He may have locked up the endorsement of the Mayor of Hamtramck, but thankfully the bigoted Trump will not win a majority of Muslim and Arab American voters in 2024. Yet in a close race, even peeling away a few percentages from these two communities could hand Trump a victory. That is why Harris needs to step up to address the policy concerns of these two communities now. Not just for the good of the Arab and Muslim communities, but for the benefit of all Americans who want to see Trump defeated."
Opinion | Kamala Harris' latest poll numbers are good in all the right ways,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-trump-polls-debate-rcna171827,2024-09-20T10:15:35Z,"The vice president is surging in postdebate polls, including in key ""Blue Wall"" swing states like Michigan and Wisconsin.

Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign must be feeling pretty good about a new wave of polls since the recent presidential debate. In just the last few days, we've seen Harris up in both national polls and surveys of swing states against former President Donald Trump. It's an encouraging sign in what is still shaping up to be a close race with just over six weeks until Election Day.

We don't have time to walk through every single survey here, but here's a snapshot. Morning Consult had Harris up 6 points nationally in its survey released Tuesday, 1 point higher than in the snap poll it conducted the day after last week's debate. Another poll from Reuters/Ipsos that dropped last Friday showed Harris leading Trump 47% to 42% among registered voters. And the latest New York Times/Siena College poll sees a tie nationally among likely voters, with each candidate pulling 47% of those surveyed.

Things look even better for Harris in the battleground state polls, in which she had been comparatively weaker than in national surveys prior to the debate. The NYT's poll of Pennsylvania has Harris up 4 percentage points over Trump among likely voters, roughly the same as in August. Tuesday had a poll from Suffolk University/USA Today showing a 3-point lead for Harris in the Keystone State. And almost all of the polls from Marist College and Quinnipiac University of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin show Harris leading, except for Quinnipiac's Wisconsin poll, which joins a new AARP survey in showing a tie.

While most headlines tend to focus on ""who's winning,"" I want to remind readers that polls are also important for helping answer ""but why?"" The Suffolk/USA Today survey, for example, included 21 voters who supported former President Joe Biden in 2020 but aren't backing Harris. When asked why, five said it was because of the economy/inflation, five said it was because they don't know Harris' policies, and five said it was because they're still undecided. Another two each said it was because of the administration's Gaza policy and the border/immigration.

That's a very small sample size, but it speaks to how small a group those potential swing voters are. It also, though, shows there's still room for the Harris campaign to win over some of those former Biden supporters who aren't fully on board yet. If the problem that five of them had is that they don't know her policies, that means there's still time to educate them. The same is true for the five voters in the sample who said they're still undecided. And those 10 potential voters are more than all nine who backed Trump in 2020 and don't anymore, only one of whom said they're still undecided.

A few words of caution though before anyone gets too ebullient. First, most of these polls' results are still within their margins of error. Pollsters are very up-front about these gaps in the math that could throw off their results. For example, the Times/Siena national poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3%, so the reality could be Harris is up as high as 50% to 44% or Trump leads by the same amount.

Further, while Morning Consult on Thursday said that state-level polling shows Harris surging post-debate, that's not a guaranteed trend through November. As Axios' Hans Nichols noted in June after Biden's less-than-stellar performance, historically these kinds of bumps have varying durations.

But it's still very much a welcome boost of momentum for Harris as the campaign begins to hit the homestretch. Furthermore, this is the exact thing that you want to see when there are key races up for grabs that will determine Senate control. Likewise, that upward trend line is all the more important when Democrats most likely have the advantage on mobilizing people to the polls, as the GOP suffers from Trump's counterproductive orders to divert resources from the party's ground game. There's still a lot that can happen between now and Nov. 5, but for now it's Harris with the wind at her back as Trump struggles to keep up."
Opinion |  The Uncommitted Movement just made a smart move that will please nobody.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/uncommitted-movement-harris-endorsement-trump-israel-gaza-rcna171833,2024-09-19T22:54:07Z,"The Uncommitted Movement just made a smart move that will please nobody.

The Uncommitted Movement, the group that helped organize the casting of hundreds of thousands of uncommitted ballots in the Democratic presidential primaries to pressure the party to change its position on supporting Israel, announced Thursday that it will not be endorsing Kamala Harris' presidential campaign. In the same announcement, however, the group also called for the movement to vote against former President Donald Trump and to avoid third parties.

In other words, Uncommitted effectively criticized Harris as fundamentally problematic on Israel policy while simultaneously encouraging people to vote for her.

The seemingly contradictory recommendations are bound to anger plenty of progressives upset by the Biden administration's policies on Israel. But it adds up to a largely coherent strategic position, based on an assessment of the limited power of the pro-Palestinian movement at this juncture and the correct appraisal that Trump would make the situation in Gaza even worse. I'd say the announcement marks a concession that the group is weak -- but also that it wants to stay in the game in the long run in the hope to one day shape the Democratic Party's policies on the issue.

In its announcement of its non-endorsement, the Uncommitted Movement cited its dissatisfaction over Harris' declining its request to meet with Palestinian Americans in Michigan who have lost loved ones in the Gaza Strip and discuss their demands for an arms embargo on Israel and how to pursue a cease-fire deal. This came after the Democrats refused to invite any Palestinian Americans to speak at the main stage at the Democratic National Convention about the war in Gaza, despite the presence of dozens of Democratic delegates affiliated with the Uncommitted Movement and their vigorous lobbying for a speaker on the issue. (By contrast, the DNC gave a speaking slot to the parents of an Israeli American hostage, who was tragically killed after the convention.) Harris did briefly meet with two members of the Uncommitted Movement in early August but reportedly declined to commit to a longer meeting about arms restrictions on Israel. Alongside all of this, Harris has deployed rhetoric about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that signals a continuation of the policy status quo and sternly reprimanded pro-Palestinian protesters who disrupted one of her events.

""Vice President Harris's unwillingness to shift on unconditional weapons policy or to even make a clear campaign statement in support of upholding existing U.S. and international human rights law has made it impossible for us to endorse her,"" the group said in a new statement.

At the same time, the statement argued, Trump would be worse for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip because he would ""accelerate the killing in Gaza while intensifying the suppression of anti-war organizing."" For this reason, the group states, Uncommitted supporters should vote against Republicans ""up and down the ballot"" and avoid third-party candidates who could ""inadvertently boost"" Trump's chances.

The Uncommitted Movement's attempt to thread a needle here is awkward. Its statement is, all in the same breath, a complaint about Democrats and also a de facto soft endorsement of them. Some activists will object to the Uncommitted Movement voluntarily giving up its leverage over the Democratic Party, out of the belief that holding out on an endorsement announcement might've resulted in some concessions from Harris with another month and a half to go until Election Day. Still others -- some of them likely out of the belief that Harris probably won't signal any policy changes on a hot button issue unless she wins office -- will say the Uncommitted Movement's mealy-mouthed quasi-endorsement is riskier than articulating a clear position that Trump is the biggest imminent threat to Palestinian life.

But the Uncommitted Movement's overall posture should be familiar to anyone on the left who thinks about the hard reality of voting in America: Even on issues on which Democrats are not good, or are even downright terrible, Republicans are often worse. That's certainly true in this case. The Biden administration's effectively unconditional aid to Israel has been morally indefensible and catastrophic for Palestinian civilian life. But Trump would in all likelihood embolden Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu even more than President Joe Biden, intensify Israel's brutal domination of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and revel in brutal repression of protesters at home.

I do think the Uncommitted Movement could have waited longer to issue a statement -- perhaps until some time in October, to test Harris more and capitalize on a potential upswing in protests over the issue. But ultimately I'm sympathetic to its attempt to balance values with strategic efficacy. The non-endorsement allows the group to credibly identify potential positive policy changes in the future, since an endorsement would've squandered that claim to specific judgment of politicians' policy positions. At the same time, the voting guidance correctly counsels the movement to think about minimizing harm for Palestinians, seeking the best possible activist terrain in the medium- to long-term future, and choosing to organize against politicians who could conceivably be influenced. It also marks a recognition that the Democratic Party has made it clear that its strategy is to ignore the pro-Palestinian movement, knowing that the movement has lost significant momentum with Harris' nomination and data indicating the war in Gaza is not a top tier issue even for most young voters.

In its statement, the Uncommitted Movement argues that the antiwar movement must try make inroads into the Democratic Party and develop coalitions that contest the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's significant influence on the party on Israel policy. That's an important long-term goal. For the time being, the best hope the antiwar movement has is to keep up the pressure on the party through a fierce protest movement that demands that Democrats put and end to their abominable disregard for life in the Gaza Strip."
Opinion | How exploding pagers in Lebanon boost the risk of Israel fighting two full wars,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/hezbollah-israel-wider-war-pagers-lebanon-rcna171708,2024-09-18T22:54:05Z,"To say that Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia in Lebanon, has gone through a rough couple of days would be a massive understatement. The group -- which runs Southern Lebanon as its own personal fiefdom, boasts tens of thousands of hardened fighters and possesses as many as 150,000 rockets in its inventory -- is confronting a degree of internal chaos that its leadership isn't habituated to experiencing.

On Sept. 17, thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah members across Lebanon exploded simultaneously in what is very likely an operation conducted by the Mossad, Israel's foreign intelligence agency. More than 2,700 people were injured, including Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, and at least 12 people were killed in the explosions. The next day, a second wave of attacks occurred, this time targeting the handheld radios Hezbollah uses in the field. The attacks caused panic in Lebanon; the country's Ministry of Public Health told hospitals to remain on maximum alert status to cope with the injuries. U.N. personnel in Lebanon were advised to remove the batteries from their phones as a precautionary measure.

By Hezbollah's own admission, the presumed Israeli operation was the ""biggest security breach"" the group has ever witnessed.

While information is still fluid, reports suggest Israeli intelligence agents intercepted a shipment of pagers to Hezbollah and tinkered with the devices (possibly by hiding explosive material into the pagers' batteries) before allowing the shipment to continue on to Lebanon. When the pagers received a message disguised as coming from Hezbollah's leadership, the phones exploded. It's the kind of well-planned, highly orchestrated, technologically sophisticated covert action for which the Mossad is well known. And if anybody has any doubts, just ask the Iranians, who in 2020 watched as one of their top nuclear scientists, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was assassinated by a remote-controlled machine gun as he was traveling down a highway. The entire thing feels like an old episode of ""24,"" the action-packed show starring Kiefer Sutherland from the early ""war on terror"" of the 2000s.

There's little doubt that Israel has scored a big tactical success. Hezbollah, one of Israel's fiercest adversaries since the group was established in the early 1980s, will spend the next days, weeks and even months cracking down within its ranks, preoccupied with internal security and investigating how two similar, devastating strikes could happen within 24 hours of each other.

But as fascinating as the nuts-and-bolts of the operation are, there are deeper and more consequential questions at stake.

First, how will Hezbollah react?

The fact that Israel hasn't officially claimed credit for the explosions doesn't mean Hezbollah will hold off on attribution. Indeed, the group already blames Israel and is vowing to exact a price.

Presumably, Hezbollah means what it says; as one of the Middle East's most powerful anti-Israel resistance movements, it can't afford not to respond in some way, shape or form, even if it's only through some kind of symbolic strike on Israeli military infrastructure near the Israel-Lebanon border.

Recall that last month, after Israel conducted preemptive airstrikes against thousands of Hezbollah rocket launchers, Hezbollah retaliated by sending its biggest fusillade of rockets and missiles against targets in northern and central Israel -- 320, to be exact. Fortunately, both sides chose to de-escalate after the daylong exchange of fire and return to the pre-August status quo, in which tit-for-tat fighting was largely confined to the Israeli-Lebanese border area. The latest Israeli attacks, however, risk unraveling that arrangement.

At the same time, Hezbollah isn't a rash, illogical actor. Although Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah won't admit it openly, he understands that Israel has escalation dominance in this nearly yearlong struggle and could bring Lebanon into the Stone Age if it so desires. Hezbollah is therefore in a very tricky position -- refusing to retaliate makes the organization look weak, impotent and compromised, encouraging even more daring Israeli attacks; but going too far on retaliation is liable to give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the excuse he needs to conduct the full-scale military operation that many within his government are clamoring for.

This is the last thing Hezbollah wants, if only because such a war -- which would likely include an Israeli ground invasion to carve out a buffer zone in Southern Lebanon -- would produce an economic and humanitarian catastrophe that would make the monthlong Israel-Hezbollah conflict in 2006 look like child's play. Another war doesn't serve Hezbollah's interests.

Second, what is Israel trying to accomplish with these operations, exactly? It's difficult to know. Some accounts suggest that the altered pagers and radios were meant to be used during a war with Hezbollah, but that the trigger had to be pulled early because Hezbollah became suspicious that something was wrong with the devices. Viewed in this way, the Israelis decided to speed up the plot's execution, lest all the time and planning they put into the operation proved to be wasted.

Regardless of the explanation, one wonders what Israel's end-goal is with these operations.

Despite what some foreign policy heavyweights assert, tactical success doesn't automatically equate to a strategic accomplishment. Hezbollah, for instance, will evolve its own tactics, policies and procedures by battening down the hatches and ensuring its communications infrastructure -- or what's left of it -- is better prepared to withstand similar technological feats. As a consequence of being utterly embarrassed on the international stage, Hezbollah will now be far more careful with how it communicates and enforce more discipline within its ranks, limiting the amount of information that Israel's intelligence services will pick up.

Finally, what does this entire episode tell us about the U.S.-Israel relationship today?

Bluntly put, this week's covert action underscores that Israel is going to do what it's going to do, notwithstanding U.S. reservations about a particular course of action or whether it undermines U.S. diplomatic initiatives in the process.

This is particularly the case if Washington continues to refuse any conditionality on the relationship. One day before pagers exploded in Beirut, U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein was in Israel, trying to maintain some degree of calm between Israel and Hezbollah and trying to convince Netanyahu's government that a wider war in Lebanon -- particularly when Israeli troops are still fighting in Gaza -- wasn't in anybody's interest. Despite the low odds, Washington hopes to strike a diplomatic arrangement that would avert conflict and allow hundreds of thousands of people in both Northern Israel and Southern Lebanon to return to their homes. Needless to say, that already difficult job has gotten a lot more difficult this week. Netanyahu knows this but doesn't care -- ultimately, he has concluded that the U.S. will offer unconditional support regardless of what he does.

Which leads to one more question that should at the very least be debated: Is it time for the U.S. to disabuse Netanyahu of that notion?"
Opinion | Who won the debate? Why Trump never even came close,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/who-won-debate-tonight-harris-trump-taylor-swift-rcna170550,2024-09-11T04:19:38Z,"Kamala Harris. Throughout Tuesday's debate, the vice president looked poised, qualified and presidential -- and that's without comparing herself to the clearly frustrated former president with whom she shared a stage. Harris baited Donald Trump repeatedly, and mostly easily. She needled and poked him on crowd size, his rallies, his racist and easily debunked lies about Haitian immigrants and his flip-flops on abortion.

In the process, she exposed both moments of incompetence and the reality that her opponent is concerningly easy to manipulate. If she can do that in front of the entire country -- and, indeed, people around the world -- it's not a stretch to imagine how he might get rolled by the world's autocrats and dictators.

She pushed hard to lay out her policy highlights and pushed back on Trump's various anti-immigrant rants and obfuscations. She humanized issues like abortion and spoke clearly and calmly about the ongoing war in Ukraine, the American withdrawal from Afghanistan and the need for a cease-fire in Gaza.

Harris' performance, with its forceful eloquence and emotional resonance, spotlighted the stark difference between the candidates. And it also contrasted dramatically with the first presidential debate, just a few months ago in June, when Trump was able to overpower a seemingly tired and confused President Joe Biden.

Donald Trump. Let's put it this way: When you find yourself onstage ranting about people ""eating"" dogs and cats, you're not winning this debate. That's a literal quote, by the way: ""They're eating the pets of the people that live there!"" As moderator David Muir noted, there is no evidence that any migrants are eating pets. Obviously. But that didn't stop Trump.

Even in today's ""unconventional"" political environment, the man insisting that migrants are eating domesticated animals in middle America isn't winning over those key undecided voters.

And that's what Trump was supposed to be doing tonight: making the case that he is presidential. That his cognitive health isn't an issue. That he has a plan to improve the economy and make the lives of individual Americans demonstrably better. This performance, with its grumpy asides and meandering monologues, won't quiet the growing criticism of his age -- at 78, he's now the oldest presidential nominee in history. And it won't make him seem presidential. When asked about his plans to replace Obamacare, he said he has ""a concept of a plan."" Whatever that means.

It's easy to mock Trump's embrace of the conspiracy theory that Haitian immigrants are eating pets, but it's also critical to point out this well-documented lie is intended to demonize a subset of the population for political gain. Trump clearly hopes that promoting racist myths about Black and brown people will appeal to the Republican base. It's disingenuous, disgusting and completely baseless.

And to be fair to these ABC moderators, they did a very good job pushing back on Trump in real time, including a strong debunking of the pet-eating myth. ""We checked with the city manager"" of Springfield, Ohio, Muir told the candidate, even as Trump doubled down with an odd point about seeing ""people on television talking about it.""

This will most likely be one of the most viral moments of the debate -- Taylor Swift's endorsement notwithstanding. And that's not going to make Trump's night much better."
Funcionario de la ONU pide proteger puertos y aeropuertos del Líbano en medio de ofensiva israelí,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-206cfe87a774c5b2ed38a42c9a4a283b,2024-10-12T17:52:39Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Un funcionario de alto rango de Naciones Unidas dijo durante una visita a Beirut el sábado que está preocupado por la posibilidad de que los puertos y el aeropuerto del Líbano queden fuera de servicio, lo que provocaría graves consecuencias para el suministro de alimentos al país, mientras Israel prosigue su ofensiva contra el grupo político-paramilitar libanés Hezbollah.

""Lo que he visto y escuchado hoy es devastador, pero la sensación es que esto puede ponerse mucho peor, y eso necesita evitarse"", dijo Carl Skau, subdirector ejecutivo del Programa Mundial de Alimentos de la ONU, durante una entrevista con The Associated Press.

Hizo un llamamiento para que se lleven a cabo ""todos los esfuerzos diplomáticos posibles para tratar de encontrar una solución política"" a la guerra y para que las líneas de suministro sigan abiertas.

""Tenemos grandes preocupaciones y son muchas, pero una de ellas es, en efecto, que necesitamos los puertos y necesitamos las rutas de suministro para poder seguir operando"", señaló Skau.

En la Franja de Gaza, donde Israel está librando una guerra con Hamás desde que el grupo militante palestino lanzó una incursión mortal en el sur de Israel hace un año, el hambre se ha disparado mientras las organizaciones humanitarias se quejan de los grandes obstáculos para hacer llegar alimentos y otros suministros al enclave bloqueado.

Skau cree que las autoridades israelíes se han ""comprometido"" a no dejar fuera de servicio los puertos y el aeropuerto del Líbano.

""Pero, por supuesto, éste es un entorno muy cambiante. Así que no damos nada por sentado"", afirmó.

En las últimas semanas, Israel ha intensificado sus bombardeos aéreos y ha lanzado una invasión terrestre en Líbano.

Alrededor de 1,2 millones de personas están desplazadas en Líbano, según estimaciones del gobierno, de las cuales unas 200.000 se alojan en refugios colectivos, donde el PMA les suministra comidas.

Skau señaló que los precios de los alimentos ya han aumentado como consecuencia del conflicto, aunque el único aeropuerto internacional del Líbano y sus principales puertos marítimos siguen funcionando. El PMA había almacenado alimentos suficientes para abastecer a un millón de personas -- -aproximadamente una quinta parte de la población libanesa -- durante un mes, pero ahora está tratando de acumular suministros que puedan alimentar a esa cantidad de personas hasta finales de año.

""Por supuesto, tendremos que reabastecernos, y para ello serán fundamentales los puertos y otras líneas de suministro"", comentó."
UN official appeals for Lebanon's ports and airport to be spared as Israel presses its offensive,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-food-port-airport-beirut-wfp-48a39c5d76372857b5ba8711174ecd83,2024-10-12T17:16:18Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- A top United Nations official said during a visit to Beirut Saturday that he is concerned that Lebanon's ports and airport might be taken out of service, with serious implications for getting food supplies into the county, as Israel continues its offensive against the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.

""What I have seen and heard today is devastating, but the sense is that this can get much worse still, and that needs to be avoided,"" said Carl Skau, deputy executive director of the U.N. World Food Program, in an interview with The Associated Press.

He appealed for ""all diplomatic efforts possible to try to find a political solution"" to the war and for supply lines to remain open.

""We have huge concerns and there are many, but one of them is indeed that we need the ports and we need the supply routes to continue to be able to operate,"" Skau said.

In Gaza, where Israel has been at war with Hamas since the Palestinian militant group launched a deadly incursion into southern Israel a year ago, hunger has skyrocketed as humanitarian organizations have complained of major obstacles to getting food and other supplies into the blockaded enclave.

Skau said he believes that Israeli authorities had given ""commitments"" that in Lebanon, the ports and airport would not be taken out of commission.

""But of course, this is a very changing environment. So we don't take anything for granted,"" he said.

In recent weeks, Israel has escalated its aerial bombardment and launched a ground invasion in Lebanon.

About 1.2 million people are displaced in Lebanon, according to government estimates, of whom some 200,000 are staying in collective shelters, where the WFP is supplying them with meals.

Skau noted that food prices have already increased as a result of the conflict, although Lebanon's sole international airport and its main sea ports are still functioning. The WFP had stocked up enough food to supply 1 million people -- about one-fifth of Lebanon's population -- for up to a month, he said, but now is trying to build up supplies that could feed that number through the end of the year.

""We will, of course, be having to restock, and for that, the ports will be critical and other supply lines,"" he said.

For instance, the agency has been bringing food in from Jordan through Syria into Lebanon by land, he said. Earlier this month, an Israeli strike on the road to the main border crossing between Lebanon and Syria cut off access to that crossing.

Since the Masnaa crossing was struck, people fleeing Lebanon have continued to cross on foot, while vehicles -- including those bringing supplies for the WFP -- have had to use another crossing in the far north of the country, making the journey more arduous and expensive.

Skau appealed for the Masnaa crossing to be reopened.

Lebanese General Security, which oversees border crossings, has recorded 320,184 Syrians and 117,727 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syria since Sept. 23, when the major escalation in Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon started.

The influx comes at a time when the WFP has reduced its food assistance in Syria as a result of funding shortages.

""We've gone over the past two years from assisting some 6 million people to around 1.5 (million),"" Skau said. ""And with that, of course, our capacity has been tightened and now we need to scale up again."""
Israel bombardea el norte de Gaza mientras fuerzas de paz de la ONU son atacadas en Líbano,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-9761b381a40760ed8bd2f12ad3fbf441,2024-10-12T15:53:42Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Palestinos del norte de Gaza describieron un intenso bombardeo israelí el sábado, horas después de que varios ataques aéreos provocaran la muerte de al menos 22 personas, mientras Israel seguía ordenando a las personas de esa región y del sur de Líbano que se apartaran de sus ofensivas contra milicianos de Hamás y Hezbollah.

En Líbano, la misión de paz de Naciones Unidas en Líbano, conocida como UNIFIL, señaló que sus cuarteles en Naqoura habían sido atacados de nuevo, que uno de sus elementos fue herido de bala la noche del viernes y se encontraba estable. El ataque ocurrió un día después de que el ejército israelí azotó los cuarteles por segundo día consecutivo. Hasta el momento, Israel, que advirtió a las fuerzas de paz que dejaran sus puestos, no ha respondido a cuestionamientos.

Han vuelto a surgir advertencias de hambruna debido a que los residentes del norte de la Franja de Gaza afirman que no han recibido ayuda desde principios del mes. El Programa Mundial de Alimentos de la ONU señaló que no ha entrado ayuda alimentaria al norte desde el 1 de octubre. Se calcula que 400.000 personas permanecen ahí.

Las fuerzas militares israelíes reanudaron su ofensiva en el norte de Gaza hace casi una semana, al tiempo que intensificaron su campaña por aire y tierra en Líbano contra Hezbollah, que cuenta con el respaldo de Irán. La Agencia Nacional de Noticias del Líbano dijo que un ataque israelí alcanzó un edificio de apartamentos en el área costera de Zarout, en el sur de Beirut. El Ministerio de Salud señaló que cuatro personas murieron en el ataque. Añadió que otro ataque aéreo en la localidad de Maisra, en el noreste de Beirut, causó la muerte de otras cinco.

Por su parte, Hezbollah continúa atacando a Israel.

""Seguiremos al lado del pueblo libanés en estas difíciles circunstancias, y también con el pueblo palestino"", dijo el sábado Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, vocero del parlamento iraní, mientras recorría el sitio de un ataque aéreo israelí en Beirut.

En el norte de Gaza, varios residentes dijeron a The Associated Press que muchas personas estaban atrapadas en sus viviendas y en refugios, cada vez con menos suministros, mientras veían cuerpos sin recoger en las calles debido a que el bombardeo ha obstaculizado a los rescatistas.

Quienes acudieron al lugar de los más recientes ataques aéreos en el campo de refugiados urbano de Jabaliya hallaron un foso de 20 metros (65 pies) de profundidad donde alguna vez hubo una vivienda.

Se recuperaron al menos 20 cuerpos la mañana del sábado, mientras que otros probablemente quedaron atrapados bajo los escombros, dijeron autoridades de los servicios de emergencia. En otra parte de Jabaliya, el ataque contra una vivienda provocó la muerte de dos hermanos e hirió a una mujer y a un recién nacido, señalaron las autoridades.

Middle East latest: Israeli military renews orders for Palestinians to leave northern Gaza,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-12-october-2024-a6cb533eb39d69bd2bea60c46b7dcb0b,2024-10-12T09:33:36Z,"The Israeli military on Saturday renewed its orders for Palestinian in the northern Gaza Strip to leave their homes and shelters as troops press on a weeklong offensive against militants.

Military spokesman Avichay Adraee told people to leave parts of Gaza City's Sheikh Radwan neighborhood and other areas in and around Jabaliya, the urban refugee camp where Israeli forces carried out several major operations over the course of the war and then returned as militants regroup.

In a post on X, Adraee asked people to head south to Muwasi, a packed area in southern Gaza designed by the military as a humanitarian zone.

Most of the fighting in the past week was centered in and around Jabaliya that was pounded by Israeli war jets and artillery. Residents said they have been trapped inside their homes and shelters. The military also ordered the three main hospitals in northern Gaza to evacuate patients and medical staff.

In Lebanon, authorities said Friday that 60 people were killed and 168 wounded in the past 24 hours, raising the total toll over the past year of conflict between Israel and the militant group Hezbollah to 2,229 dead and 10,380 wounded.

Israel has been escalating its campaign against Hezbollah with waves of heavy airstrikes across Lebanon and a ground invasion at the border, after a year of exchanges of fire. Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and Hamas' ally Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Israel's offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times.

It's been a full year since Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel's security fence and stormed into army bases and farming communities, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding about 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead.

Here is the latest:

CAIRO -- The Israeli military on Saturday renewed orders for Palestinian in the northern Gaza Strip to leave their homes and shelters amid a week of intense fighting with militants there.

Avichay Adraee, a spokesman for the Israeli military, told people that the area includes parts of Gaza City's Sheikh Radwan neighborhood and other parts in and around Jabaliya, the urban refugee camp.

In a post on X, Adraee asked people living there to head south to Muwasi, a packed area in southern Gaza designed by the military as a humanitarian zone.

Most of past week fighting centered in and around Jabaliya with Israeli war jets and artillery pounding the area. People there said they have been trapped inside their homes and shelters. The military also ordered the three main hospitals in northern Gaza to evacuate patients and medical staff."
"As Hezbollah and Israel battle on the border, Lebanon's army watches from the sidelines",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lebanese-army-laf-israel-hezbollah-78f6ad2da82d64d1ae266aa5394e6d4e,2024-10-12T04:53:30Z,"It's not the first time the national army has found itself watching war at home from the discomfiting position of bystander.

Lebanon's widely beloved army is one of the few institutions that bridge the country's sectarian and political divides. Several army commanders have become president, and the current commander, Gen. Joseph Aoun, is widely regarded as one of the front-runners to step in when the deadlocked parliament fills a two-year vacuum and names a president.

But with an aging arsenal and no air defenses, and battered by five years of economic crisis, the national army is ill-prepared to defend Lebanon against either aerial bombardment or a ground offensive by a well-equipped modern army like Israel's.

The army is militarily overshadowed by Hezbollah. The Lebanese army has about 80,000 troops, with around 5,000 of them deployed in the south. Hezbollah has more than 100,000 fighters, according to the militant group's late leader, Hassan Nasrallah. Its arsenal -- built with support from Iran -- is also more advanced.

Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters have been clashing since Oct. 8, 2023, when the Lebanese militant group began firing rockets over the border in support of its ally Hamas in Gaza.

In recent weeks, Israel has conducted a major aerial bombardment of Lebanon and a ground invasion that it says aims to push Hezbollah back from the border and allow displaced residents of northern Israel to return.

As Israeli troops made their first forays across the border and Hezbollah responded with rocket fire, Lebanese soldiers withdrew from observation posts along the frontier and repositioned about 5 kilometers (3 miles) back.

So far, Israeli forces have not advanced that far. The only direct clashes between the two national armies were on Oct. 3, when Israeli tank fire hit a Lebanese army position in the area of Bint Jbeil, killing a soldier, and on Friday, when two soldiers were killed in an airstrike in the same area. The Lebanese army said it returned fire both times.

Lebanon's army declined to comment on how it will react if Israeli ground forces advance farther.

Analysts familiar with the army's workings said that, should the Israeli incursion reach the current army positions, Lebanese troops would put up a fight -- but a limited one.

The army's ""natural and automatic mission is to defend Lebanon against any army that may enter Lebanese territory,"" said former Lebanese Army Gen. Hassan Jouni. ""Of course, if the Israeli enemy enters, it will defend, but within the available capabilities ... without going to the point of recklessness or suicide.""

The current Israeli invasion of Lebanon is its fourth into the neighboring country in the past 50 years. In most of the previous invasions, the Lebanese army played a similarly peripheral role.

The one exception, said Aram Nerguizian, a senior associate with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, was in 1972, when Israel attempted to create a 20-kilometer (12-mile) buffer zone to push back Palestinian Liberation Organization fighters.

At that time, Nerguizian said, the Lebanese army successfully slowed the pace of the Israeli advance and ""bought time for political leadership in Beirut to seek the intervention of the international community to pressure Israel for a cease-fire.""

But the internal situation in Lebanon -- and the army's capabilities -- deteriorated with the outbreak of a 15-year civil war in 1975, during which both Israeli and Syrian forces occupied parts of the country.

Hezbollah was the only faction that was allowed to keep its weapons after the civil war, for the stated goal of resisting Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon -- which ended in 2000.

By 2006, when Hezbollah and Israel fought a bruising monthlong war, the Lebanese army ""had not been able to invest in any real-world post-war modernization, had no ability to deter Israeli air power"" and ""was left completely exposed,"" Nerguizian said. ""The few times that the (Lebanese army) and Israeli forces did engage militarily, there was total overmatch.""

After the 2011 outbreak of civil war in neighboring Syria and the rise of the Islamic State militant group there, the Lebanese army saw a new influx of military aid. It successfully battled against IS on Lebanon's border in 2017, although not alone -- Hezbollah was simultaneously attacking the group on the other side of the border.

When Lebanon's financial system and currency collapsed in 2019, the army took a hit. It had no budget to buy weapons and maintain its existing supplies, vehicles and aircraft. An average soldier's salary is now worth around $220 per month, and many resorted to working second jobs. At one point, the United States and Qatar both gave a monthly subsidy for soldiers' salaries.

The U.S. had been a primary funder of the Lebanese army before the crisis. It has given some $3 billion in military aid since 2006, according to the State Department, which said in a statement that it aims ""to enable the Lebanese military to be a stabilizing force against regional threats"" and ""strengthen Lebanon's sovereignty, secure its borders, counter internal threats, and disrupt terrorist facilitation.""

President Joe Biden's administration has also touted the Lebanese army as a key part of any diplomatic solution to the current war, with hopes that an increased deployment of its forces would supplant Hezbollah in the border area.

But that support has limits. Aid to the Lebanese army has sometimes been politically controversial within the U.S., with some legislators arguing that it could fall into the hands of Hezbollah, although there is no evidence that has happened.

In Lebanon, many believe that the U.S. has blocked the army from obtaining more advanced weaponry that might allow it to defend against Israel -- America's strongest ally in the region and the recipient of at least $17.9 billion in U.S. military aid in the year since the war in Gaza began.

""It is my personal opinion that the United States does not allow the (Lebanese) military to have advanced air defense equipment, and this matter is related to Israel,"" said Walid Aoun, a retired Lebanese army general and military analyst.

Nerguizian said the perception is ""not some conspiracy or half-truth,"" noting that the U.S. has enacted a legal requirement to support Israel's qualitative military edge relative to all other militaries in the region.

ONU afirma que la ayuda que ingresa a Gaza ha caído a su nivel más bajo en meses,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-26500a6d9add43e40d5b545286a28e16,2024-10-11T22:43:27Z,"NACIONES UNIDAS (AP) -- Funcionarios de la ONU afirman que la ayuda que ingresa a Gaza se encuentra en su nivel más bajo en meses y advierten que se han cortado vías de acceso para el ingreso de la ayuda humanitaria en el norte del territorio, donde Israel ha reanudado su ofensiva militar.

El vocero adjunto de la ONU Farhan Haq dijo el viernes que los principales pasos fronterizos en el norte de Gaza están cerrados y no han ingresado alimentos ni otros suministros esenciales desde el 1 de octubre. Las más de 400.000 personas que permanecen en el norte están siendo sometidas a una presión cada vez mayor para que se trasladen al sur, afirmó.

""La situación es terrible"" en el norte de Gaza, señaló Haq.

Durante meses, la ONU ha afirmado que las condiciones de inseguridad en Gaza son uno de los principales obstáculos para la entrega de ayuda, junto con las operaciones militares israelíes, los escasos pasos fronterizos, y los retrasos y denegaciones de autorizaciones para los convoyes por parte de Israel.

El investigador independiente de la ONU sobre el derecho a la alimentación, Michael Fakhri, acusó el mes pasado a Israel de llevar a cabo una ""campaña de hambruna"" contra los palestinos durante la guerra de Gaza, una acusación que Israel refuta.

La misión israelí ante la ONU aún no había respondido el viernes a una solicitud de comentarios sobre los reportes de la Oficina de Naciones Unidas para la Coordinación de Asuntos Humanitarios (OCHA, por sus siglas en inglés). Pero Israel ha insistido en otras ocasiones que ha permitido el ingreso de cantidades significativas de alimentos y otros insumos a Gaza.

""Israel no ha detenido el ingreso ni la coordinación de la ayuda humanitaria desde su territorio hacia el norte de la Franja de Gaza"", declaró el miércoles la COGAT, el organismo militar israelí que supervisa la distribución de ayuda en Gaza. ""Como prueba de ello, la ayuda humanitaria coordinada por la COGAT y las organizaciones internacionales también seguirá ingresando en el norte de la Franja de Gaza mañana"".

La organización humanitaria MedGlobal, que trabaja en Gaza desde 2018, dijo el viernes que la ofensiva militar del ejército israelí ha dejado ""al borde del colapso"" a las instalaciones médicas que quedan en el norte.

Las autoridades israelíes han ordenado el desalojo de tres hospitales con cientos de pacientes, incluidos niños en cuidados intensivos: Kamal Adwan, Al-Awda y el Hospital Indonesio. También están a punto de quedarse sin combustible."
U.S. expands sanctions on Iran in response to its ballistic attack on Israel,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/treasury-sanctions-iran-gaza-israel-hezbollah-lebanon-5c3d798a1916e4ee197b13d000a776c1,2024-10-11T21:04:33Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. on Friday announced new sanctions on Iran's energy sector in response to its Oct. 1 attack on Israel when it fired roughly 180 missiles into the country.

Iran said the barrage was retaliation for a series of devastating blows Israel has landed in recent weeks against the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon, which has been firing rockets into Israel since the war in Gaza began.

Included in Friday's sanctions are blocks on Iran's so-called ""ghost fleet"" of ships and associated firms that span the United Arab Emirates, Liberia, Hong Kong and other jurisdictions that allegedly obfuscate and transport Iranian oil for sale to buyers in Asia.

Additionally, the U.S. State Department designated a network of companies based in Suriname, India, Malaysia and Hong Kong for allegedly arranging for the sale and transport of petroleum and petroleum products from Iran.

Current U.S. law authorizes sanctions targeting Iran's energy sector as well as foreign firms that buy sell and transport Iranian oil. But energy sanctions are often a delicate issue as restricting supplies could push up prices for global commodities that the U.S. and its allies need.

Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security advise, said the new sanctions ""will help further deny Iran financial resources used to support its missile programs and provide support for terrorist groups that threaten the United States, its allies, and partners.""

The penalties aim to block them from using the U.S. financial system and bar American citizens from dealing with them.

Israel and Iran have fought a shadow war for years, but rarely have they come into direct conflict. Increasingly, however, escalating attacks between Israel and Iran and its Arab allies threaten to push the Middle East closer to a regional war.

Iran launched another direct attack on Israel in April, but few of its projectiles reached their targets. Many were shot down by a U.S.-led coalition while others apparently failed at launch or crashed in flight.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Friday that the United States ""will not hesitate to take further action to hold Iran accountable."""
The UN says that aid entering Gaza is at its lowest level in months,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/gaza-humanitarian-aid-israel-war-united-nations-f5555baecb05d9451cca430b422844c9,2024-10-11T20:48:06Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. humanitarian officials say aid entering Gaza is at its lowest level in months and warn that critical lifelines in the territory's north, where Israel has renewed its military offensive, have been cut off.

U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq delivered the grim news Friday, saying the main crossings into northern Gaza have been closed and no food or other essential supplies have entered since Oct. 1. More than 400,000 people who remain in the north are under increasing pressure to move south, he said.

""The situation is terrible"" across northern Gaza, Haq said, adding that the entire territory faces insecurity.

For months, the United Nations has said lawlessness in Gaza, which has led to supplies being taken from aid trucks and attacks on humanitarian workers and drivers, are major obstacles to relief deliveries -- along with military operations, few border crossings and delayed and denied Israeli clearances for convoys.

The U.N. independent investigator on the right to food, Michael Fakhri, accused Israel last month of carrying out a ""starvation campaign"" against Palestinians during the war in Gaza, an allegation that Israel vehemently denies.

Israel's U.N. mission did not immediately reply Friday to a request for comment on the aid reports by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, known as OCHA. But Israel has repeatedly insisted that it has allowed food and other aid into Gaza in significant quantities.

""Israel has not halted the entry or coordination of humanitarian aid entering from its territory into the northern Gaza Strip,"" COGAT, the Israeli military body that oversees aid distribution in Gaza, said Wednesday. ""As evidence, humanitarian aid coordinated by COGAT and international organizations will continue to enter the northern Gaza Strip in the coming day as well.""

The war in Gaza started after Hamas militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted around 250 others during Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel.

Israel's offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times.

The humanitarian organization MedGlobal, which has worked in Gaza since 2018, said Friday that the Israeli army's renewed military action has driven the remaining health care facilities in the north ""to the brink of collapse.""

Three hospitals with hundreds of patients, including children in intensive care -- Kamal Adwan, Al-Awda and the Indonesian Hospital -- have been ordered to evacuate by Israeli authorities. They also are on the verge of running out of fuel.

Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan and MedGlobal's lead physician in Gaza, said it received ""numerous injuries and fatalities due to the targeting of Al Naji area.""

The hospital's intensive care unit is overcrowded and the ""catastrophic situation ... will worsen in the coming hours if there is no fuel for emergency services,"" he said in a statement.

Throughout Gaza, Haq said the U.N. World Food Program reports that it has been unable to deliver food parcels to the more than 1 million Palestinians who receive them so far this month ""due to constrained access of aid supplies.""

In the north, WFP said kitchens, distribution points and bakeries have either been forced to shut down or are at risk of shutting down if the conflict continues, Haq said, adding that the bakeries are also running out of wheat flour.

Despite the challenges, Haq said the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, and its partners are distributing bread, meals and flour to designated shelters and beyond."
UN peacekeepers in south Lebanon in crosshairs of Israel's war on Hezbollah,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/unifil-peacekeeping-lebanon-israel-peacekeeping-b03091462dbb2e025a6fcad1acdba08f,2024-10-11T17:56:16Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Israeli airstrikes hit the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force and other positions in south Lebanon in recent days, drawing widespread condemnation from around the world.

The force, known as UNIFIL, said new explosions hit its headquarters on Friday morning, injuring two peacekeepers, a day after Israeli forces struck the same position, injuring two others.

As Israel escalates its campaign against Hezbollah in the south, the 10,000-strong peacekeeping force is increasingly in the crosshairs, highlighting the fragility of its personnel amid an expanding ground invasion by Israel.

The attacks are taking place in the backdrop of worsening relations between Israel and the United Nations over the way Israel has conducted its war in Gaza. In an unprecedented move, Israel earlier this month said the U.N. chief was persona non grata in Israel, signaling a new low in relations.

Here's a look at the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon and the latest developments:

The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon was created in 1978 to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops after Israel invaded and occupied south Lebanon. Israel invaded again in 1982, and it was not until 2000 that it withdrew from the country.

In the absence of an agreed-upon border, the U.N. drew up a boundary between Lebanon and Israel known as the Blue Line, which UNIFIL monitors and patrols.

The United Nations expanded UNIFIL's original mission following the monthlong 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, allowing peacekeepers to deploy along the Israeli border to monitor the cessation of hostilities between the two sides and patrol a buffer zone set up along the border.

The force currently has some 10,000 peacekeepers stationed in south Lebanon drawn from around 50 countries. The troops patrol, monitor and report violations of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 which ended the 2006 fighting. The force also provides support to local communities.

On Thursday, UNIFIL said an Israeli tank ""directly"" fired on its headquarters in the town of Naqoura, knocking down an observation tower and injuring two Indonesian peacekeepers, who were hospitalized.

It said its headquarters and nearby positions ""have been repeatedly hit"" and that Israel ""deliberately"" fired on and disabled the headquarters' monitoring cameras. It also said the Israeli army fired on a nearby bunker where peacekeepers were sheltering.

On Friday, UNIFIL said new explosions hit its headquarters, injuring two more peacekeepers, although it did not directly blame Israel. It also said an Israeli army bulldozer hit the perimeter of another of its positions in southern Lebanon while Israeli tanks moved nearby.

The attacks drew global condemnation. Italy, which has about 1,000 soldiers deployed in south Lebanon, and France summoned the Israeli ambassadors in protest. Italy's defense minister said the attacks were possible ""war crimes."" Human Rights Watch, in a statement, used similar language.

Tensions between the two sides had been mounting for days. Earlier this month, Israel asked UNIFIL to move its personnel further north, which the peacekeeping force refused to do.

""We won't accept the justification that Israeli military forces had previously alerted UNIFIL that some of its bases had to be abandoned,"" Defense Minister Guido Crosetto said Thursday at a press conference in Rome, calling the attacks ""not an accident nor a mistake.""

The Israeli army has expressed deep concern over Thursday's incident and says it is conducting a thorough review at the highest levels of command to determine the details.

On Friday, it said its soldiers were responding with fire to an immediate threat against them, adding that the army had instructed UNIFIL personnel to enter into protected spaces and remain there, hours before the incident.

It also accused Hezbollah of deliberately operating near U.N. posts, thereby endangering their personnel.

There have been several incidents during the current war where UNIFIL said that Israel had shot at patrol vehicles or shelled their positions.

The United Nations peacekeeping force has had a troubled history with Israel. In 1996, during a 17-day Israeli offensive against Hezbollah, Israel shelled a United Nations compound near the village of Qana where hundreds of displaced civilians were sheltering. The attack killed 106 civilians, including at least 37 children. Four Fijian soldiers assigned to UNIFIL were seriously injured.

The Israeli military is asking that the peacekeeping force move 5 kilometers (3 miles) north to avoid being caught in the fighting between its troops and Hezbollah militants.

That effectively would impede the peacekeeping force from doing its mission.

The U.N. peacekeeping chief, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council Thursday that UNIFIL would not evacuate its personnel, but because of air and ground attacks they cannot conduct patrols.

He said UNIFIL operations have virtually come to a halt since late September, when Israel expanded its campaign against Hezbollah in the south.

""Peacekeepers have been confined to their bases with significant periods of time in shelter,"" he said, adding that the security environment has also presented challenges for the resupply of fuel, food and water for U.N. positions.

Later Thursday, Lacroix said 300 peacekeepers in frontline positions had been temporarily moved to larger bases, and that plans to move another 200 will depend on security conditions as the conflict escalates. He said UNIFIL had decided to reduce its footprint ""at the most affected U.N. positions by 25%.""

On Oct. 3, he told reporters that in some places in southern Lebanon, the number of peacekeepers had been reduced by about 20%.

Nick Birnback, U.N. peacekeeping's chief of strategic communications, said: ""UNIFIL has remained in its positions along the Blue Line without interruption since its establishment.""

The Italian minister also reiterated that a final decision on whether to stop the UNIFIL mission in southern Lebanon for security reasons is up to the U.N."
Turkish citizens fleeing Lebanon mourn the homes and family left behind,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/turkey-lebanon-evacuation-ships-1b85e0eb33890873f0d1d56b9ff6a50e,2024-10-11T13:48:06Z,"ON BOARD THE TCG SANCAKTAR (AP) -- Eyup Sabri Kirgiz gathered up his loved ones -- both family and pets -- and with a heavy heart left his beloved city of Beirut behind, after two weeks of deadly airstrikes that had traumatized his family.

The 50-year old Turkish engineer who moved to the Lebanese capital 21 years ago, was living in the Ein Rummaneh neighborhood, close to Beirut's southern suburbs, an area known as Dahiyeh that has been the target of heavy Israeli airstrikes amid an escalation of the war in the Middle East, this time between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.

""For the last two weeks or so, we had been feeling all those bombs as if they were exploding in the house,"" said Kirgiz, who along with his Lebanese wife, two children and his mother-in-law was among hundreds of people who were evacuated from Lebanon on Thursday aboard two Turkish navy ships.

""There was no sleep or anything. We would just sit until the morning. You can only sleep when the drones go away. It is impossible to sleep with that drone sound anyway,"" Kirgiz told The Associated Press on board the TCG Sancaktar. The AP was the only nongovernment media that was invited aboard the vessels to cover the evacuation operation.

It's been a year of war. Hezbollah launched rockets into Israel from Lebanon on Oct. 8, 2023, one day after the Hamas-led attack in southern Israel that led to the Israeli offensive in Gaza, and Israel and Hezbollah have been trading attacks since then. But since the fighting escalated in mid-September, more than 1,400 people have been killed in Lebanon and over a million displaced.

The almost 1,000 evacuees -- mostly Turkish citizens and their foreign-born spouses -- on board the TCG Sancaktar, and its sister landing vessel, the TCG Bayraktar, napped or sat on camp beds surrounded by the few belongings they could bring. Aid workers on board the vessels distributed sandwiches and refreshments during the 12-hour crossing to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Mersin.

Previous Turkish government figures put the number of people to be evacuated at close to 2,000. A security official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with government rules, said some people who had expressed interest in leaving did not show up.

Kirgiz spent much of the journey tending to his dogs, Bella and Ammun -- as well as their pet turtle, Coco, which he kept in a shoe-box -- to ensure that they did not disturb slumbering fellow passengers.

The air was stuffy, making the journey uncomfortable at times.

A 75-year-old passenger on board the ship was evacuated by helicopter to northern Cyprus after he suffered a heart attack during the voyage. He later died in the hospital, the security official said.

Kirgiz, who describes himself as ""the lover of Beirut"" said he hopes to return there soon.

""I'll see what the situation is like in a week or 10 days. I'll wait for things to calm down a bit. After that, if I think it's no longer dangerous, I'll go back. Because I love this place so much. And after, (the plan) is to bring back the family and children,"" Kirgiz said.

Turkish-born Dilber Taleb and her Lebanese-born husband Ahmad, who live in Australia, were on holiday in Lebanon when the conflict escalated. They were spending time with Ahmad's parents so that they could get to know their infant grandson, Khaldun.

Although their neighborhood was not targeted by the Israeli strikes, the couple grabbed the opportunity to leave Lebanon.

""You're anxious every day. When you are under stress, you worry whether something will happen, whether they will block the road or bomb something. That's why he wanted to leave Lebanon as soon as possible,"" said Dilber Taleb.

Her husband sounded tormented at having to leave his parents behind.

""My parents, they are only Lebanese (nationals), they're not Turkish citizens or Australian citizens like us,"" he said. ""But I wish in the future I can take them with us, maybe to Turkey or to Australia. Because we can't stay living under this stress.""

Among other passengers on board the vessel was Goncagul Udigwe, her Nigerian husband Callistos and their 7-month-old daughter, Hilda. They had moved to Lebanon, where he ran his own business, just five months ago.

The family decided to leave Lebanon because they feared it would turn into ""another Gaza,"" she said as the family waited to board the ship in Beirut. Speaking again to AP journalists as she disembarked in Mersin, she felt a rush of relief.

""Right now I am extremely happy that we are reunited (with Turkey) safe and sound. I am in my own land, I feel safe, I feel at peace.""

Udigwe continued: ""But of course, I feel very sorry for those who have to stay there (in Lebanon) because they are not in a good situation at all. They sleep on the sidewalks, in cars. So it's very difficult. I've never seen anything like this before. I've never experienced anything like this in my own country.""

The ships arrived back in Turkey late Thursday and early Friday. The exhausted passengers were bused to another area of the port to pass through immigration checks.

The two ships were part of a convoy of six-vessels that departed Mersin on Wednesday, carrying some 300 tons of humanitarian aid to Lebanon, including food, tents and blankets. AP journalists on board the Sancaktar could hear the sound of drones flying above the ships, while the aid was being unloaded and the evacuees were boarding.

Israel's deadliest strike in central Beirut leaves Lebanese stunned as they dig through the rubble,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/srael-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-11-10-2024-9dd58a9fea9c2de963edbc31ba90bb1a,2024-10-11T10:42:02Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Rescue workers searched through the rubble of a collapsed building in central Beirut on Friday morning, hours after two Israeli strikes hit the Lebanese capital, killing at least 22 people and wounding dozens.

The air raid was the deadliest attack on central Beirut in over a year of war, hitting two residential buildings in neighborhoods that have swelled with displaced people fleeing Israeli bombardment elsewhere in the country.

Hezbollah's Al-Manar television and Israeli media said the strikes aimed to kill Wafiq Safa, a top security official with the group. Al-Manar said Safa was not in either building at the time. The Israeli military had no comment on the reports.

Thursday night's strikes came as Israel escalates its campaign against Hezbollah with waves of heavy airstrikes across Lebanon and a ground invasion at the border, after a year of exchanges of fire between the two rivals. The same day as the Beirut explosions, Israeli forces fired on United Nations peacekeepers in southern Lebanon and wounded two peacekeepers from Indonesia, drawing widespread condemnation.

Hezbollah has expanded its rocket fire to more populated areas deeper inside Israel. While disrupting life for Israelis, most of Hezbollah's barrages have not caused casualties. But early Friday, an anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon killed a man from Thailand working on a farm in northern Israel.

In Beirut's Burj Abi Haidar neighborhood, civil defense members and municipal workers dug through the pile of concrete and twisted metal from a three-story building knocked down by Thursday night's strike.

In an adjacent building that was badly damaged, Ahmad al-Khatib stood in the apartment of his in-laws where he, his wife, Marwa Hamdan, and their 2 ½-year-old daughter, Ayla, suffered injuries. He had just picked up his wife from work and she was performing the evening Muslim prayers at home when the blast hit.

""The world suddenly turned upside down and darkness prevailed,"" said the 42-year-old, tears running down his cheeks. He pulled his daughter out from under the debris of a wall that collapsed in a bedroom. Al-Khatib, who works for the postal service. said he found the force of the explosion had thrown his wife against a wall and a piece of metal had hit her in the head.

""I looked in her face and shouted, 'Say something!'"" he said, but she only responded with sounds of pain. His wife remains in the ICU at a Beirut hospital. His daughter suffered only minor injuries.

Mohammed Tarhani said he had moved in with his brother nearby in the neighborhood after fleeing around southern Lebanon to escape airstrikes the past weeks. His children were out on the veranda, and he was in the living room when the strike hit.

""We rushed out to look for the children,"" he said. ""Where is one supposed to go now?""

Civil defense official Walid Hashash said they don't expect more bodies under the rubble as no people are missing. He added that once operations are over they will issue a final death toll.

Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in support of Hamas and the Palestinians, drawing Israeli airstrikes in retaliation. Israel says its stepped-up campaign since late September aims to push Hezbollah away from the border to allow tens of thousands of its citizens evacuated from the area to return home.

More than 2,100 Lebanese -- including Hezbollah fighters, civilians and medical personnel -- have been killed the past year by Israeli strikes, more than two thirds of them in the past few weeks. Hezbollah attacks have killed 29 civilians as well as 39 Israeli soldiers in northern Israel since October 2023 and in southern Lebanon since Israel launched its ground invasion on Sept. 30. So far, Israeli troops have been operating in a narrow strip of a few kilometers (miles) along the border.

The war threatens to spiral even further, with Israel aiming to strike a crippling blow to its longtime adversary Hezbollah. Netanyahu this week warned Lebanese they would suffer the same destruction that Israel's campaign against Hamas has inflicted in Gaza unless they take action against Hezbollah.

Israel has also vowed to strike back against the Lebanese group's supporter, Iran, after it launched some 180 ballistic missiles at Israel last week. Iran's barrage was in retaliation for previous Israeli strikes that killed Hamas' leader in Tehran and senior Iranian Revolutionary Guard figures in Lebanon.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday reiterated U.S. support for Israel's escalated campaign against Hezbollah. He said Israel had a ""clear and very legitimate"" interest to try to ensure the return of tens of thousands of its citizens who were evacuated from their homes near the border because of Hezbollah fire since last October.

He told a news conference after attending an annual meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Laos that the U.S. is ""extremely focused"" on reaching a diplomatic solution to the war.

Meanwhile the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, was rearranging some of its personnel after its positions were repeated hit by Israeli forces Thursday.

UNIFIL said an Israeli tank directly fired on an observation tower at the force's headquarters in the town of Naqoura, Lebanon, and that soldiers attacked a bunker near where peacekeepers were sheltering, damaging vehicles and a communication system. It said an Israeli drone was seen flying to the bunker's entrance.

The Israeli military acknowledged opening fire at a U.N. base in southern Lebanon on Thursday and said it had ordered the peacekeepers to ""remain in protected spaces.""

Afterward, the U.N. peacekeeping chief said 300 peacekeepers in frontline positions on southern Lebanon's border have been temporarily moved to larger bases. Plans to move another 200 will depend on security conditions as the conflict escalates. Jean-Pierre Lacroix told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council that peacekeepers with UNIFIL are staying in their positions, but because of air and ground attacks they cannot conduct patrols.

UNIFIL, which has more than 10,000 peacekeepers from dozens of countries, was created to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon after Israel's 1978 invasion. The United Nations expanded its mission following the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, allowing peacekeepers to patrol a buffer zone set up along the border.

Israel accuses Hezbollah of establishing militant infrastructure along the border in violation of the U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the 2006 war."
Leaders of Jordan and southern Europe meet in a bid to help de-escalate Middle East crisis,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/med9-lebanon-ceasefire-hebollah-israel-gaza-hamas-8c64aab28fb1f5942fa839a39144f3fb,2024-10-11T09:54:12Z,"PAPHOS, Cyprus (AP) -- The leaders of nine southern European Union countries and Jordan are meeting in Cyprus on Friday to come up with ways to de-escalate the crisis in the Middle East that is threatening to engulf Lebanon and trigger a wider humanitarian crisis.

Jordan's King Abdullah will join the leaders of the so-called MED9 -- including Italy, Spain, France, Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Slovenia, Portugal and Croatia -- as well as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to brainstorm initiatives aimed at protecting Lebanese civilians caught in the crossfire between Israel and Hezbollah.

The leaders will also focus on helping clinch a ceasefire deal between Israeli forces and Hamas in the Gaza strip in line with a U.N. Security Council resolution adopted unanimously in June.

Cyprus' government spokesman Konstantinos Letymbiotis said Thursday the Jordanian monarch's presence at the meeting lends additional weight to the proceedings given his country's role in helping peace efforts in the region.

The meeting comes amid reports of an international diplomatic effort to degrade Hezbollah's political hold in Lebanon.

""We want the Lebanese people to decide who their leaders ought to be, bottom line, and that has been our position,"" U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Wednesday. ""We certainly don't want to dictate to the people of Lebanon who their leader is, and we're not going to ... we want them to be able to do it absent a terrorist organization putting a gun to their head, which is the situation that Lebanon has been in for decades now.""

""Ultimately, we hope that Hezbollah is degraded enough that they are less of a force in Lebanese politics,"" he added.

According to Letymbiotis, King Abdullah will also discuss with the leaders way of further bolstering his country's relations with the EU. The Jordanian monarch and Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides will put forward a joint proposal to create a regional firefighting hub in Cyprus through the permanent deployment of fire-fighting aircraft on the island nation to respond to regional emergencies.

Christodoulides will also raise EU efforts to deal with migration flows through the adoption a new asylum policy that would more evenly share the distribution of asylum seekers through all EU members. Cyprus is considered a front-line country that receives a significantly high numbers of asylum seekers relative to its population.

Climate change is also on the agenda as the east Mediterranean and the Middle East are considered particularly vulnerable areas to temperatures changes.

Christodoulides will also highlight Cyprus' role in helping deliver humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza via a maritime corridor as well as a waystation for the repatriation of third-country nationals evacuated from Lebanon.

According to Letymbiotis, more than 2,400 third-country nationals from 20 countries have so far used Cyprus as a transfer point to their homeland."
The Nobel Peace Prize is being announced against a backdrop of conflicts around the world,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/nobel-peace-prize-40c351ed629bd515675a8283c811bc38,2024-10-11T08:51:22Z,"The Nobel Peace Prize is being awarded Friday against a backdrop of devastating conflicts raging in the world, notably in the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan.

Alfred Nobel stated in his will that the prize should be awarded for ""the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses."" Since 1901, 104 Nobel Peace Prizes have been awarded, mostly to individuals but also to organizations that have been seen to advance peace efforts.

Last year's prize went to jailed Iranian activist Narges Mohammadi for her advocacy of women's rights and democracy, and against the death penalty. The Nobel committee said it also was a recognition of ""the hundreds of thousands of people"" who demonstrated against ""Iran's theocratic regime's policies of discrimination and oppression targeting women.""

But in a year of such conflict, the Norwegian Nobel Committee that decides on the winner could opt not to award a prize. The last time that happened was in 1972.

In the Middle East, persistently spiraling levels of violence over the past year have killed tens of thousands of people, including thousands of children and women. The war, sparked by a bloody raid into Israel by Hamas-led militants on Oct. 7, 2023 that left about 1,200 people dead, mostly civilians, has spilled out into the wider region.

The war in Gaza has killed more than 42,000 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants in its count but says more than half are women and children. In Lebanon, more than 1,400 people have been killed, with thousands more injured and around 1 million displaced since mid-September, when the Israeli military dramatically expanded its offensive against Hezbollah.

The war in Ukraine, sparked by Russia's invasion, is heading toward its third winter with a staggering loss of human life on both sides.

The U.N. has confirmed more than 11,000 Ukrainian civilian dead, but that doesn't take into account as many as 25,000 Ukrainians believed to have died during the Russian capture of the city of Mariupol or unreported deaths in the occupied territories.

Western officials have estimated Russian military casualties around 600,000, with perhaps 150,000 dead, and public reports put Russian civilian dead around 150, mostly in the border region of Belgorod.

Ukrainian military deaths were last announced in February at 31,000 and the president has said there are six wounded for every soldier killed.

On the African continent, Sudan has been devastated by a 17-month war that that has so far killed more than 20,000 peopleand forced more than 8 million people from their homes, while roughly another 2 million were already displaced within the country before hostilities broke out.

The Nobel prizes carry a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor ($1 million). Unlike the other Nobel prizes that are selected and announced in Stockholm, founder Alfred Nobel decreed the peace prize be decided and awarded in Oslo by the five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee.

The Nobel season ends Monday with the announcement of the winner of the economics prize, formally known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.

Middle East latest: Thai worker killed by missile in northern Israel,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-11-october-2024-114541998d0f165b05884e19fa161d34,2024-10-11T08:28:09Z,"An anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon killed a young man from Thailand in the north of Israel early Friday, a day after Israeli strikes in Lebanon left dozens of people dead in Beirut and wounded two U.N. peacekeepers.

At least 22 people were killed and 117 wounded in Israeli airstrikes that hit two areas in central Beirut, Lebanon's health ministry said.

In southern Lebanon, meanwhile, the U.N. peacekeeping force said an Israeli tank fired on its headquarters in the town of Naqoura, hitting an observation tower and wounding two peacekeepers, who were hospitalized.

Israel's offensive in Gaza has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times.

A year ago, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel's security fence and stormed into army bases and farming communities, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding about 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead.

Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, which began firing rockets at Israel on Oct. 8, 2023.

Here is the latest:

JERUSALEM -- An anti-tank missile fired from Lebanon killed a young man from Thailand in the north of Israel early Friday, Israel's paramedic service said.

Magen David Adom, the paramedic service, said that the 27-year-old was killed by a missile that hit agricultural land.

Israeli media reported that the man killed was a foreign worker on a kibbutz, a communal farm, in the north. Israel employs many foreign nationals, particularly from Thailand, on farms.

The Israeli military said that anti-tank fire from Lebanon injured two other civilians Friday. Hezbollah claimed one missile attack on a military position in the north Friday morning.

Hezbollah and other militants in Lebanon have been exchanging fire with Israel for the past year. Israel recently escalated bombardment in Lebanon and invaded a strip inside the Lebanese border, vowing to push out Hezbollah fighters.

Friday's strike was one of the first civilian deaths in Israel since the escalation began in late September. Two Israelis were killed by rocket debris Wednesday. On the Lebanese side, Israeli strikes have killed more than 1,400 people in the past three weeks, including fighters, civilians and medical personnel.

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey condemned Israel's attack on United Nations peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, characterizing it as ""a manifestation of its perception that its crimes go unpunished.""

The U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, said in a statement Thursday that its headquarters and positions ""have been repeatedly hit"" by Israeli forces. Two UNIFIL troops were wounded in the attacks.

The Israeli military acknowledged opening fire at a U.N. base in southern Lebanon on Thursday and said it had ordered the peacekeepers to ""remain in protected spaces.""

""The international community is obliged to ensure that Israel abides by international law,"" Turkey's Foreign Ministry said in a statement released late Thursday. ""We will continue to support all initiatives within the framework of international law to promote peace in the region.

Turkey contributes to UNIFIL Maritime Task Force with a corvette and five personnel, the ministry said."
Israel's airstrike warnings terrify and confuse Lebanese civilians,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-evacuation-warnings-war-d131e6f7043623bc109eab768decc2a1,2024-10-11T05:11:39Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- As the war between Israel and Hezbollah intensifies, Lebanese civilians are increasingly paying the price - and this dangerous reality often becomes clear in the middle of the night: That's when the Israeli military typically warns people to evacuate buildings or neighborhoods to avoid airstrikes.

Moein Shreif was recently awakened at 3 a.m. by a neighbor calling to alert him that Israel planned to strike a nearby building in his middle-class suburb south of Beirut where Hezbollah has a strong presence.

Shreif, his wife and their three children quickly fled their multi-story apartment building and drove away. Within minutes, explosions rang out, he said later that day upon returning to see the smoldering ruins of his building and the one next door.

""I didn't even have time to dress properly, as you can see,"" said Shreif, a well-known Lebanese folk and pop singer who was still wearing his pajamas from the night before. ""I didn't take anything out of the house.""

Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging strikes nearly every day since the start of the war in Gaza. Hezbollah says it will fire rockets into Israel until there's a cease-fire in Gaza; Israel says its fighting to stop those attacks, which have forced tens of thousands of Israelis from their homes.

But it wasn't until late last month, when Israel dramatically expanded its aerial campaign against Hezbollah, that Lebanese people began receiving regular warnings about upcoming airstrikes. Human rights groups say Israel's warnings -- which aren't issued before many airstrikes -- are inadequate and sometimes misleading.

On Sept. 23, Israel made 80,000 calls into Lebanon, according to Imad Kreidieh, head of the country's telecommunications company - presumably recorded warnings about upcoming airstrikes.

The calls caused panic. Schools shut down. People rushed home early from work. It ended up being the deadliest day of airstrikes in Lebanon in decades, with over 500 people killed -- roughly one quarter of all those killed in Lebanon the past year, according to the country's Health Ministry. Women and children make up one quarter of all the deaths, the ministry says.

Israel has issued warnings on social media nearly every day since then.

On Oct. 1, 27 villages in southern Lebanon were told to evacuate to the north of the Awali River, dozens of kilometers (miles) away. ""Save your lives,"" the instructions said.

That is when Salam, a 42-year-old mother of two, fled the village of Ain Ebel. She and her family are now staying with relatives in Beirut. Salam refused to give her full name for fear of reprisals.

So far, Ain Ebel - a mostly Christian village - hasn't been bombarded, although surrounding villages whose residents are predominantly Shiite Muslims have been. Salam's teenage children are terrified of going home, especially since Israel launched a ground invasion.

Salam is still baffled and angry that her village was evacuated.

So far, evacuation notices in Lebanon have been far more limited than in Gaza, but the messages in both places have a common theme. In Gaza, Israel says it is targeting Hamas militants embedded among Gaza's civilians. In Lebanon, it warns of similar behavior by Hezbollah, a Hamas ally.

Most of the Israeli military's warnings first appear on the social media accounts of its Arabic spokesperson. They are then amplified by the Lebanese media.

The warnings instruct people to vacate homes ""immediately,"" and they are usually followed by a series of overnight strikes that often cause damage in areas beyond those that were warned. Israel says it is targeting Hezbollah fighters, weapons or other assets belonging to the group. Warnings are rarely issued before daytime strikes.

The Lebanese government says at least 1.2 million people have been displaced by the war, the vast majority since Israel ramped up airstrikes across the country last month. Over 800 of some 1,000 shelters are over capacity.

One quarter of Lebanese territory is now under Israeli military displacement orders, according to the U.N.'s human rights division.

""Calling on residents of nearly 30 villages to leave 'immediately' is not effective and unlawfully suggests that civilians who do not leave an area will be deemed to be combatants,"" said Ramzi Kaiss, a researcher for Human Rights Watch in Beirut.

Kaiss said Israel -- which usually issues warnings 30 to 90 minutes ahead of airstrikes -- is obligated to protect civilians who refuse to evacuate, or who are physically unable to.

Amnesty International is also critical of Israel's practice of warning entire towns and villages to evacuate. It ""raises questions around whether this is intended to create the conditions for mass displacement,"" Agnes Callamard, the group's secretary general said in a statement on Thursday.

The Israeli military didn't respond to a request for comment. It has previously said it makes a significant effort to save civilian lives with its warnings.

For almost a year, Israel's strikes were mostly concentrated in communities along the border, far from the capital and its populous suburbs. But now people who once felt relatively safe in the outskirts of Beirut are increasingly at risk, and their neighborhoods are receiving a small but growing share of airstrike warnings.

In Shreif's case, he said his neighbor called about five minutes after the Israeli military issued a warning on the social media platform X.

Shreif considers himself lucky: If it wasn't for that wake-up call, his family might not be alive. The AP could not determine whether any people were killed or injured in the strike that destroyed Shreif's building or the one next door.

To the northeast of Beirut, in the Bekaa Valley, Israel recently issued a warning to people to stay at least 1,000 meters (yards) away from their town or village if they are in or a near a home that has weapons belonging to Hezbollah.

Some of the warnings have come in the form of animated videos. One shows an elderly woman in a kitchen, suggesting she is unaware of hidden rooms and compartments in her own house that contain weapons for Hezbollah.

""Didn't you know?"" the narrator says in Arabic, as the elderly woman discovers rockets under the couch, behind the shower curtains and elsewhere. The video warns viewers to leave their homes immediately if they - or their neighbors - discover weapons.

But in many cases there are no warnings at all.

Last month, in Ain el-Delb near the southern city of Sidon, an Israeli airstrike hit a residential building, burying about 70 people under the rubble.

Achraf Ramadan, 34, and his father were among the lucky one who rescue workers were able to pull out alive. His mother was taken to the hospital alive, but she later died from her wounds. His younger sister Julia, a public relations professional in her late 20s, was found dead. Achraf and Julia together had been leading initiatives to support displaced Lebanese families in and around Sidon.

""This is a nice and peaceful neighborhood,"" Ramadan said, sounding dejected. ""The international community is asleep and not taking initiative. On the contrary, I think it's giving Israel an excuse for its barbarity on the pretext of self-defense.""

"The drownings of 2 Navy SEALs were preventable, military investigation finds",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/navy-seal-deaths-investigation-training-failures-78e138486050c9748fc3724347ed230f,2024-10-11T04:06:52Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two U.S. Navy SEALs drowned as they tried to climb aboard a ship carrying illicit Iranian-made weapons to Yemen because of glaring training failures and a lack of understanding about what to do after falling into deep, turbulent waters, according to a military investigation into the January deaths.

The review concluded that the drownings of Chief Special Warfare Operator Christopher J. Chambers and Navy Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Nathan Gage Ingram could have been prevented. But both sank quickly in the high seas off the coast of Somalia, weighed down by heavy equipment they were carrying and not knowing or disregarding concerns that their flotation devices could not compensate for the additional weight. Both were lost at sea.

The highly critical and heavily redacted report -- written by a Navy officer from outside Naval Special Warfare Command, which oversees the SEALs -- concluded there were ""deficiencies, gaps and inconsistencies"" in training, policies, tactics and procedures as well as ""conflicting guidance"" on when and how to use emergency flotation devices and extra buoyancy material that could have kept them alive.

The Associated Press obtained the report upon request before its public release.

The mission's goal was to intercept weapons headed to the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen, who have been launching missile and drone attacks against commercial and U.S. Navy ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza began a year ago. U.S. retaliatory strikes have so far not deterred their assaults.

Chambers and Ingram, members of SEAL Team 3, died during a nighttime mission to board an unflagged ship in the Arabian Sea. Their names were redacted in the report, but officials have confirmed Chambers slipped and fell as he was climbing onto the ship's deck and Ingram jumped in to try to save him.

""Encumbered by the weight of each individual's gear, neither their physical capability nor emergency supplemental flotations devices, if activated, were sufficient to keep them at the surface,"" Rear Adm. Michael DeVore wrote in the report.

The report said Chambers was ""intermittently"" at the surface for 26 seconds after his fall and Ingram was at the surface for about 32 seconds.

""The entire tragic event elapsed in just 47 seconds and two NSW warriors were lost to the sea,"" DeVore wrote, referring to Naval Special Warfare Command.

Flotation equipment that was properly maintained, working well and used correctly would have been able to keep them afloat until they were rescued, the report said. Other team members told investigators that while they knew the importance of their tactical flotation system -- which includes two inflatable floats that attach to a belt and foam inserts that can be added -- few had ever operated one in training and there is little instruction on how to wear it.

The report said the team was operating in 6- to 8-foot seas, and while the vessel they were boarding was rolling in the waves, the conditions were well within their abilities.

As time went on, however, the rolling increased, and Chambers tried to board by jumping from his combat craft's engine compartment to the top rail of the ship they were boarding, the report said. Some of the commandos used an attachable ladder, but because of the waves, others jumped to the top rail, which they said was within reach but slippery.

Chambers' hands slipped off the rail, and he fell 9 feet into the water. Based on video of the mission, he was able to grab the lower rung of the ladder, but when he turned to try to get back to the combat craft, he was swept under by a wave.

Eleven seconds after he fell, Ingram jumped in. For at least 10 seconds, video shows they were above water intermittently and at times were able to grab a ladder extension that was submerged. But both were knocked about by waves. The last sighting of Chambers was about 26 seconds after he fell.

At one point, Ingram tried to climb back on the ladder but was overcome by a wave. He appeared to try to deploy his flotation device, but within two seconds, an unattached water wing was seen about a foot away from him. He also seemed to try to remove some of his equipment, but he slipped underwater and was not seen again. The sea depth was about 12,000 feet.

Both were wearing body armor, and Ingram also was carrying radio equipment that added as much as 40 more pounds. Each of the inflatable floats can lift a minimum of 40 pounds in seawater, the report said.

It said members of the SEAL team expressed ""shock and disbelief"" that Chambers, their strongest swimmer, could not stay at the surface. The report concluded that the conflicting and meager guidance on the flotation devices may have left it to individuals to configure their buoyancy needs, potentially leading to mistakes.

While SEALs routinely conduct pre-mission ""buddy checks"" to review each other's gear, it said Ingram's flotation equipment may have been incorrectly attached and a more thorough buddy exam could have discovered that.

SEAL team members also told investigators that adding the foam inserts makes the flotation device more bulky and it becomes more difficult to climb or crawl.

The report said SEAL Team 3 members began prompt and appropriate man-overboard procedures ""within seconds,"" and there were two helicopters and two drones overhead providing surveillance, light and video for the mission.

After 10 days, the search was called off because of the water depth and low probability of finding the two.

""The Navy respects the sanctity of human remains and recognized the sea as a fit and final resting place,"" the report said.

Chambers, 37, of Maryland, enlisted in the Navy in 2012 and graduated from SEAL training in 2014. Ingram, 27, of Texas, enlisted in 2019 and graduated from SEAL training in 2021.

In response to the investigation, Naval Special Warfare Command said changes are already being made to training and guidance. It said the command is considering developing a force-wide policy to address water safety during maritime operations and is setting standard procedures for buoyancy requirements.

Other changes would refine man-overboard procedures, pre-mission checks and maintenance of flotation devices. It also said it's looking into ""fail safe"" buoyancy equipment and plans to review safety processes.

Rear Adm. Keith Davids, who headed the command at the time of the mission, said it would learn from the tragic deaths and ""doggedly pursue"" recommended changes. Davids left the job in August in a routine change of command and is in the process of retiring.

The report recommends that Ingram receive a commendation for heroism for giving his life while trying to save his teammate. That recommendation is under review. Both were posthumously promoted one rank.

According to a separate Defense Intelligence Agency report, the Jan. 11 mission seized Iranian ""propulsion, guidance systems and warheads"" for medium-range ballistic missiles and antiship cruise missiles destined for the Houthis."
Turkey's Erdogan inaugurates a Turkish-funded mosque in Albania's capital,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/albania-turkey-erdogan-new-mosque-ties-ff1fb947b8769e3b2223f1c300684c46,2024-10-10T14:58:16Z,"TIRANA, Albania (AP) -- Turkey's president traveled Thursday to Albania's capital to inaugurate a Turkish-funded mosque with 50-meter-high (160-foot-high) minarets as part of a trip to boost ties and discuss regional issues.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also said that his country would give an unspecified number of drones to boost military capabilities in Albania, whose population is slightly more than 50% Muslim.

The new Namazgah mosque in Tirana is one of the largest in the Balkans.

Erdogan met with Albanian President Bajram Begaj and later with Prime Minister Edi Rama, with whom he has close ties. Following a meeting of top officials from both countries, the two sides signed agreements to boost cooperation in agriculture and education.

Turkey is a strategic partner of Albania and one of its largest investors, contributing to infrastructure and other sectors. Erdogan said the two countries should aim to double their annual trade to 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion).

At a briefing after the meetings, Rama said Turkey's gift of military drones sends a ""very clear message"" that ""Albania cannot be attacked.""

In comments touching on regional issues, Erdogan denounced Israel's war on Hamas in Gaza as a ""genocide"" and a ""threat to the global order."" He said Israel must pressured into an urgently needed ceasefire to facilitate humanitarian aid.

Rama also pushed for a ceasefire, but took a different tone on the Palestinian group, saying that ""Hamas and any other source of terror have no place in a peaceful future of two sovereign states, Israel and Palestine.""

Construction of the new mosque was started in 2015 with some 30 million euros ($34 million) from the state-run Turkish Muslim organization Diyanet.

The construction already had been completed for more than a year, but the inauguration was delayed because of Erdogan's concerns that a group that Turkey calls the Fetullah Terrorist Organization, or FETO, would have influence over the mosque.

Under agreements reached with the local Albanian Muslim community, Turkey's Diyanet organization will have representation on the mosque's governing board.

Turkey says that FETO and its U.S.-based leader Fetullah Gulen orchestrated a failed coup in Turkey on July 15, 2016, which left 251 people dead and nearly 2,200 wounded. Gulen has denied any involvement.

In addition to the four minarets, the Namazgah mosque has a central dome of 30 meters and the capacity to hold 8,000 people. It sits on a 10,000-square-meter parcel of land near Albania's parliament, and the first floor includes a cultural center.

The site is near landmark Catholic and Orthodox cathedrals.

Sunni Muslims make up nearly 46% of Albania's population, and Bektashi Muslims another 5%. Catholics are 8% and Orthodox Christians 7%, according to a 2023 census. The various religious groups live together peacefully without tensions."
UN-backed experts say Israel is destroying Gaza's health sector and both sides have tortured people,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-human-rights-un-c75b4db37aa5ade8466e0daa446ad596,2024-10-10T14:24:57Z,"A U.N. commission on Thursday accused Israel of destroying Gaza's health care system through ""relentless and deliberate attacks"" in its yearlong war with Hamas and said that Palestinian prisoners and Israeli hostages have been tortured and sexually abused.

The expert panel was commissioned in 2021 by the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council to look into rights violations and abuses in Israel and the Palestinian areas it controls. Led by Navi Pillay, a former U.N. human rights chief, the panel members are independent experts and do not speak for the world body.

There was no immediate comment from Israel, which has long accused the U.N. of being biased against it and has not cooperated with the commission.

Israeli forces have raided hospitals in Gaza on several occasions, accusing militants of sheltering there. Palestinian medical officials have denied such allegations and accused Israel of recklessly endangering civilians. Hospitals can lose their protection under international law if they are used for military purposes.

The report accused Israel of deliberately killing, detaining and torturing Palestinian medical staff, of targeting their vehicles and of restricting permits for medical evacuations from Gaza. It said those amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.

""Israel must immediately stop its unprecedented wanton destruction of health care facilities in Gaza,"" Pillay said in a statement. ""By targeting health care facilities, Israel is targeting the right to health itself with significant long-term detrimental effects on the civilian population.""

The commission said children have borne much of the cost of such actions, pointing to attacks on medical facilities offering pediatric and neonatal care.

The panel also said it found that thousands of adults and children detained in Gaza had been subjected to ""widespread and systematic abuse, physical and psychological violence, and sexual and gender-based violence.""

It said Israeli security forces had raped male detainees, attacked their genitals and forced them to perform humiliating or strenuous acts while stripped naked. It said children who had been detained had returned to Gaza unaccompanied and deeply traumatized.

The commission further said the abuse had been institutionalized by Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir. He has boasted of making conditions in the country's prisons as harsh as possible under Israeli law in what he says is an attempt to deter militant attacks.

Israel detained nine soldiers in July over what their defense lawyer said were allegations of sexual abuse of a detainee being held at a shadowy facility where detainees from Gaza have been taken since the start of the war. The lawyer denied the allegations, and their arrest sparked protests by Israeli hard-liners.

The commission also said that hostages held by Palestinian militants in Gaza were subjected to physical and sexual violence, forced isolation and threats, and given limited access to water, food and hygiene facilities. It said Palestinian armed groups were also guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and called on them to immediately release all the hostages.

Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250 others. They are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead.

Israel's offensive has killed over 42,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were fighters but say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities. The war has destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of 2.3 million people.

The International Court of Justice is investigating allegations that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, and the International Criminal Court is considering arrest warrants against Israeli and Hamas leaders. Israel has adamantly denied the accusations and says it abides by international law."

Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, which began firing rockets at Israel on Oct. 8, 2023.

Here is the latest:

Italy's Defence Minister Guido Crosetto has urgently summoned the Israeli Ambassador to Italy to discuss the strike on a U.N. peacekeeping base in southern Lebanon where Italian personnel operate.

Italy has about 1,000 soldiers deployed in Lebanon, participating in the UN peacekeeping mission.

A UNIFIL spokesperson said Thursday that two peacekeepers were hospitalized after its headquarters in Naqoura was directly hit by Israeli tank fire. Israeli forces have ""deliberately"" fired at the UN position in recent days, the spokesperson said.

The U.N. peacekeeping chief, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, said last week that U.N. peacekeepers were staying in their positions on Lebanon's southern border despite Israel's request to vacate some areas before it launched its ground operation against Hezbollah militants. UNIFIL was created to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon after Israel's 1978 invasion. The U.N. expanded its mission following the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, allowing peacekeepers to deploy along the Israeli border. The force has more than 10,000 peacekeepers from around 50 countries.

The U.N. peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon said Thursday an Israeli tank fired on its headquarters in the town of Naqoura, hitting an observation tower and wounding two peacekeepers, who were hospitalized.

UNIFIL said in a statement that its headquarters and nearby positions ""have been repeatedly hit."" It said the army also fired on a nearby bunker where peacekeepers were sheltering, damaging vehicles and a communication system. It said an Israeli drone was seen flying to the bunker's entrance.

A strike on a school sheltering displaced people in the central Gaza city of Deir al-Balah killed 27 people, including a child and seven women, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where the bodies were brought. It said several other people were wounded.

An Associated Press reporter saw ambulances streaming into the hospital and counted the bodies, many of which arrived in pieces.

""We appeal to the world. We are dying!"" one man screamed.

The Israeli military said it carried out a precise strike targeting a militant command and control center inside the school. Israel has repeatedly attacked schools that were turned into shelters in Gaza, accusing militants of hiding out in them.

Witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons said the strike occurred while school managers were meeting with representatives of an aid group in a room normally used by Hamas-run police who provide security. They said there were no police in the room at the time.

Over 2,000 Turkish citizens and some foreign nationals started boarding a Turkish military ship late Wednesday that brought in aid and will take them out of a country being hit by Israeli airstrikes targeting Hezbollah.

It's part of a six-ship convoy including escorts that set sail from the southern Turkish port of Mersin early Wednesday, transporting 300 tons of humanitarian supplies, including food, hygiene kits, kitchenware, tents, beds and blankets.

Besides the Turkish citizens, people from Bulgaria, Romania and Kazakhstan were among those who applied to evacuate on the ships. Officials did not provide numbers.

Turkey's government plans to organize more sea evacuations if necessary and is contemplating charter flights to repatriate citizens.

UNITED NATIONS - The top U.N. official in Lebanon repeated her call for an immediate cease-fire, saying the 21-day cease-fire proposal launched by the U.S. and France is still on the table ""and very relevant.""

Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert said Wednesday that a halt to fighting is the only way to ease ""the colossal human suffering that is happening right now,"" address Lebanon's ""humanitarian crisis of catastrophic proportions"" and provide a window ""for diplomatic efforts to take hold and succeed.""

The U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon expressed hope during a video press conference from Beirut ""that Israel will now, or soon, be ready to add its support to the many calls and appeals out there for a cease-fire or a pause.""

""I'm not saying that it's going to be an easy ride or walk in a park,"" she said. ""It will be difficult, but I am convinced that it's doable, and it's in the interest of Lebanon, in the interest of Israel to find sustainable solutions.""

Hennis-Plasschaert said there must also be a realistic roadmap to implement the 2006 U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the Israeli-Hezbollah war. Its key provisions include disarming all armed groups including Hezbollah and deploying the Lebanese army throughout the country's south, which borders Israel and is mainly controlled by the militant group.

""At the end of the day, it is the lack or non-implementation of resolution 1701 over the past 18 years that led to today's harsh reality,"" Hennis-Plasschaert said."
Palestinian officials say Israeli strike on Gaza shelter kills 13,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-hezbollah-10-10-2024-a5e53cdd4fca30be1909506b5c777922,2024-10-10T09:15:54Z,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Palestinian medical officials said an Israeli strike on a school sheltering displaced people in Gaza on Thursday killed at least 13 people, with the toll likely to rise.

The Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital confirmed the toll from the strike in the central town of Deir al-Balah. An Associated Press reporter saw ambulances arriving at the hospital.

Residents said the strike targeted a makeshift post of the Hamas-run police inside the shelter."
Rebeldes hutíes de Yemen lanzan presuntos ataques contra un buque en el mar Rojo,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-f0560b0018ca71b130c7212189353b4f,2024-10-10T06:52:53Z,"DUBÁI, Emiratos Árabes Unidos (AP) -- Los rebeldes hutíes de Yemen lanzaron el jueves una serie de presuntos ataques contra una embarcación en el mar Rojo, dijeron las autoridades.

El incidente se produce en un momento en que los rebeldes siguen amenazando a los buques que navegan por el mar Rojo -- una vía por la que en su día circulaban bienes por importe de un billón de dólares al año -- debido a los conflictos activos en Oriente Medio derivados de la guerra que libran Israel y Hamás en la Franja de Gaza.

Una embarcación que navegaba bordeando la costa oriental de África fue alcanzada primero por un proyectil que causó daños en la estructura, pero no provocó ningún incendio ni heridos, dijo la agencia de Operaciones de Comercio Marítimo (UKMTO, por sus siglas en inglés), que depende del ejército de Reino Unido.

Más tarde, al menos dos proyectiles más cayeron en aguas próximas al mercante, que estaba lejos de Hodeida, la ciudad portuaria controlada por los hutíes desde la que se han lanzado muchos de sus ataques.

Los rebeldes no se atribuyeron de inmediato los ataques. Pero a veces pueden tardar horas, o incluso días, en hacerlo.

Los hutíes han atacado más de 80 mercantes con misiles y aviones no tripulados desde el inicio de la guerra en Gaza en octubre del año pasado. Capturaron un buque y hundieron otros dos en una campaña en la que han muerto cuatro marineros. Otros misiles y drones fueron interceptados por una coalición liderada por Estados Unidos con presencia en el Mar Rojo o no han alcanzado sus objetivos, entre los que hay embarcaciones militares occidentales.

Los rebeldes afirman que atacan buques vinculados a Israel, Estados Unidos o Reino Unido para forzar el fin de la guerra de Israel contra Hamás en Gaza. Pero muchos de sus objetivos tienen poca o ninguna relación con el conflicto, y algunos incluso se dirigían a Irán, un aliado del grupo."
Suspected attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels target ship in Red Sea,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/red-sea-attacks-yemen-houthi-rebels-israel-hamas-war-961fbf91e97e071011ad3bea9077511a,2024-10-10T05:33:04Z,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- A series of suspected attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels targeted a ship on Thursday in the Red Sea, authorities said.

The attack comes as the rebels continue to threaten ships moving through the Red Sea, a waterway that once saw $1 trillion in goods move through it a year, over the ongoing conflicts in the Mideast stemming from the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.

A ship in the Red Sea skirting the coast of the East Africa found itself struck first by a projectile that damaged the vessel, but sparked no fire and caused no injuries, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said.

At least two more projectiles later fell in the waters around the vessel, which was a distance away from Hodeida, the Houthi-controlled port from which many of the rebels' attacks have been launched.

The rebels did not immediately claim the attack. However, it can take them hours or even days to acknowledge their assaults.

The Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well.

The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran."
Whether to publicly say Trump's name becomes issue in Connecticut congressional debate,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/connecticut-house-hayes-logan-072869a6d179939b3bbbd08d23116a74,2024-10-10T02:06:58Z,"WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's name was mentioned multiple times during a debate held Wednesday night in Connecticut's closely watched 5th Congressional District race.

But it was only the Democrat, U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, who uttered it.

Her Republican opponent, former state Sen. George Logan, who has tried to portray himself as a moderate, independent candidate in this rematch election from 2022, would only say he supported the top of the GOP ticket and was focused more on helping the residents of what is considered the most politically diverse district in blue Connecticut.

""I've said over and over again, I'm going to work with whomever is going to win the White House after Nov. 5th, and I stand by that,"" he told reporters after the televised matchup. ""They're playing games, I think. They want to do this whole gotcha political thing, and I'm just not giving it to them. I made it clear who I'm voting for.""

But Hayes accused Logan, who she defeated by 2,000 votes two years ago, of trying to thread the needle in a purple district and not tell voters how he really feels on issues.

""I think the non-answer says more than the answer,"" Hayes said during the debate.

""When he's in a room with MAGA supporters, he tells them to turn off your phones. This is who I'm going to vote for. I support Donald Trump. When he's in a more moderate part of the district or a Democratic part of the district, he refuses to say it,"" she told reporters afterward. ""So, I guess the Logan that you get is dependent on the room that he's in.""

If Logan wins, he would be the first Republican member of Connecticut's current all-Democratic congressional delegation since former GOP Rep. Chris Shays, a moderate Republican who lost the state's 4th Congressional District seat in 2008 to Democratic Rep. Jim Himes, who is now running for a ninth term.

The 5th District race is considered the most competitive of the state's five congressional contests.

Hayes, a former national teacher of the year, first assumed office in 2019.

During the debate, she touted her efforts to help everyone from farmers to people struggling to find affordable housing and noted her votes to increase the minimum wage and lower prescription drug prices.

While she acknowledged that pocketbook issues are still important to voters in this year's election, Hayes noted the nation's low unemployment rate and how the U.S. has rebounded from the pandemic better than other countries.

Logan blamed Hayes for not doing enough to help people struggling to pay for groceries, gas and rent, and he repeatedly accused Hayes of being a rubber stamp for the White House.

He said she votes with the national Democrats nearly all the time -- a claim she later denied -- while he promised to support legislation that is best for the district, no matter which party proposed it.

""My opponent cannot fathom an independent voice in Washington,"" Logan said.

This year's race for the 5th District, which includes a large swath of northwestern Connecticut, is reminiscent of 2022, when Logan repeatedly linked Hayes with President Joe Biden and then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and accused her for being tone deaf about the impact of inflation on voters.

The race attracted millions of dollars in outside money, with national Republicans seeing an opportunity to crack Democrats' lock on the state's congressional delegation.

This year, both campaign committees for the national parties have focused on the race once again, running ads on statewide television.

Like in 2022, Hayes has accused Logan as someone who can't be trusted when it comes to abortion, despite Logan's claims that he supports abortion rights.

The war in the Gaza Strip, however, was not an issue two years ago. During Wednesday's debate, which was televised live on statewide TV, a pro-Palestinian protester suddenly bound on stage midway through and shouted ""Free Palestine"" before being taken away by security."
Turkey's navy starts to evacuate its citizens from Beirut as Israel battles Hezbollah,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-turkey-lebanon-israel-evacuations-cea598e62da5a649095d98e13f84a34a,2024-10-10T01:16:33Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Over 2,000 Turkish citizens and some foreign started boarding a Turkish military ship late Wednesday that brought in aid and will take them out of a country being hit by Israeli airstrikes targeting Hezbollah.

Zehra Cibbin, an ethnic Arab from the southeastern Turkish city of Mardin who lives in Beirut with her Lebanese husband, got off a bus packed with the other evacuees, her two children in tow and luggage in hand.

""It's indescribable. They bombed the street below our house. From that moment on, it was over for me, I said I didn't want to stay in Beirut anymore,"" said Cibbin, 46.

Cibbin said they decided to leave Beirut out of fear for their lives, putting no thought into what will happen when they arrive in Turkey.

She spoke to The Associated Press before getting in line to board the TCG Bayraktar amphibious landing vessel, which along with the TCG Sancaktar will take on evacuees.

They are part of a six-ship convoy including escorts that set sail from the southern Turkish port of Mersin early Wednesday, transported 300 tons of humanitarian supplies, including food, hygiene kits, kitchenware, tents, beds and blankets.

Besides the Turkish citizens, people from Bulgaria, Romania and Kazakhstan were among those who applied to evacuate on the ships. Officials did not provide numbers.

The Associated Press was the only non-government media invited aboard the ships to cover the evacuation operation.

""Israel's aggression has severely impacted Lebanon and our brothers here,"" said Turkish Ambassador to Lebanon Ali Baris Ulusoy, standing in front of the Bayraktar.

""We are carrying out an operation today with two aims: to provide humanitarian aid to our Lebanese brothers and to ensure the safe return of our citizens who are in a difficult situation."" Ulusoy said.

Hundreds lined up before the Bayraktar as Turkish soldiers and sailors checked the evacuees' passports and their luggage was examined by metal detectors and drug-sniffing dogs before they were allowed to board

Another Turkish citizen waiting with her family was Abir Gokcimen, who said she left her extended family and husband in Beirut and hopes the war that spread to Lebanon will end soon. She hopes to come back to Lebanon as soon as the danger passes.

The journey back to Mersin is expected to take about 10 hours.

Turkey's government plans to organize more sea evacuations if necessary and is contemplating charter flights to repatriate citizens.

Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, the day after Hamas' surprise attack into Israel ignited the war in Gaza. Hezbollah and Hamas are both allied with Iran, and Hezbollah says its attacks are aimed at aiding the Palestinians. Israel has carried out airstrikes in response and the conflict steadily escalated, erupting into a full-fledged war last month.

Israel has inflicted a punishing wave of blows against Hezbollah in recent weeks and says it will keep fighting until tens of thousands of displaced Israeli citizens can return to their homes in the north.

More than 1,300 people have been killed in Lebanon and over a million displaced since the fighting escalated in mid-September.

Earlier on Wednesday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ramped up his rhetoric against Israel during his party's first meeting of the new legislative year, declaring that Turkey ""has more than enough power to thwart expansionist ambitions"" of Israel and doubling down on his claims that Israel would target Turkey after Gaza and Lebanon.

Brown rejects calls to divest from companies in connection with pro-Palestinian protests on campus,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/campus-protest-brown-university-divestment-1bc45dfc0183ef008338678d09374529,2024-10-09T22:18:18Z,"BOSTON (AP) -- Brown University has rejected a proposal to divest from 10 companies that protesters say were facilitating the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory.

The vote Tuesday by the Corporation of Brown follows a committee report recommending against divesting partly because the university has little investment in them and the amount it does would not cause social harm. The report estimated the school had no direct investment into the companies, which included Airbus, Boeing, General Dynamics Corp and and General Electric Co., and that about 1% of its endowment was indirectly invested in the companies..

""If the Corporation were to divest, it would signal to our students and scholars that there are 'approved' points of view to which members of the community are expected to conform,"" University Chancellor Brian Moynihan and President Christina Paxson said in a joint statement. ""This would be wholly inconsistent with the principles of academic freedom and free inquiry, and would undermine our mission of serving the community, the nation and the world.""

Last spring, the university committed to an October vote by its governing board on a divestment proposal, after an advisory committee weighed in on the issue. In exchange, student protesters agreed to dismantle their encampment on campus.

Ahead of the vote, Niyanta Nepal, the student body president who was voted in on a pro-divestment platform, were spending their energy on applying pressure for a vote in favor of divestment. They rallied fellow students to attend a series of forums and encouraged incoming students to join the movement.

The defeat left the students, led by the Brown Divest Coalition, charting their next move.

""This is a moral stain on Brown University, a clear affront to democratic values of the institution, and an egregious erasure of the insurmountable violence enacted by the Israeli regime in Gaza and now Lebanon,"" the group said in statement. ""This decision makes one thing clear: our university has at least $66 million dollars invested in companies that facilitate Israel's genocide, apartheid and military occupation and still refuses to dissociate from these funds.""

Colleges have long rebuffed calls to divest from Israel, which opponents say veers into antisemitism. Brown already is facing heat for even considering the vote, including a blistering letter from two dozen state attorneys general, all Republicans."
Biden is set to speak with Netanyahu in the leaders' first conversation since August,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/biden-netanyahu-hamas-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-iran-0a8d6d73d17e4b19fa68ec60ed99bc43,2024-10-09T13:35:32Z,"The leaders' call, previewed by a person familiar with the matter, is coming two days after the anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel that led to the war in Gaza that has spread into a wider regional conflict. It will be the first conversation between Biden and Netanyahu since Aug. 21.

The person was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Israel has been discussing how to respond to the Iranian missile barrage from Oct. 1, which the United States helped to fend off. Biden last week said he would not support a retaliatory Israeli strike on sites related to Tehran's nuclear program.

Israel's other choices range from a largely symbolic strike -- similar to how Israel responded after Iran launched missiles and attack drones in April -- to hitting oil facilities and other infrastructure.

Since the leaders' last call seven weeks ago, Israel has carried out a brazen sabotage and assassination campaign against Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon, where the militant group has continued to fire missiles, rockets and drones at Israel.

Israel is now undertaking what it has described as limited ground operations across its northern border with Lebanon to dig out Hezbollah. Airstrikes killed the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and decimated its leadership.

Last month, thousands of explosives hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah detonated, killing dozens of people and maiming thousands, including many civilians. Israel is widely believed to be behind the attack

The U.S. has maintained a stepped-up troop presence in the region, to defend Israel and American interests in the Middle East. Washington has grown increasingly vocal with Israeli officials about the need to be kept in the loop on their decision-making to ensure the protection of U.S. forces."
Israeli offensive in hard-hit northern Gaza kills and wounds dozens and threatens hospitals,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-lezbollah-war-news-10-09-2024-31a2dff9a2bb49bc3b76f32b1ddee128,2024-10-09T09:25:29Z,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- A large-scale Israeli operation in northern Gaza has killed and wounded dozens of people and threatens to shut down three hospitals over a year into the war with Hamas, Palestinian officials and residents said Wednesday.

Heavy fighting is underway in Jabaliya, where Israeli forces carried out several major operations over the course of the war and then returned as militants regroup. The entire north, including Gaza City, has suffered heavy destruction and has been largely isolated by Israeli forces since late last year.

The continuing cycle of destruction and death in Gaza, unleashed by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel, offers a cautionary tale as Israel expands a week-old ground offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon and considers a major retaliatory strike on Iran.

Residents of Jabaliya, a refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation, say heavy airstrikes and evacuation warnings have driven hundreds of people from their homes. An airstrike early Wednesday killed at least nine people, including two women and two children, according to the Al-Ahly Hospital, which received the bodies.

Strikes in central Gaza killed another nine people, including three children, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies.

The Gaza Health Ministry said Wednesday that the overall Palestinian death toll in Gaza since the start of the war has surpassed 42,000, with more than 97,000 others wounded.

Fadel Naeem, director of the Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City, said it has received dozens of dead and wounded people from across the northern half of the Palestinian enclave since Israel launched its air and ground operation there earlier this month.

Israel's offensive has gutted Gaza's health sector, forcing most of its hospitals to shut down and leaving the rest only partially functioning.

""The situation is tense,"" Naeem told The Associated Press in text message. ""We declared a state of emergency, suspended scheduled surgeries, and discharged patients whose conditions are stable to receive the growing numbers of wounded arriving from the north.""

He said three hospitals further north -- Kamal Adwan, Awda and the Indonesian Hospital - have become almost inaccessible because of the fighting. The Gaza Health Ministry says the Israeli army has ordered all three to evacuate staff and patients. Meanwhile, no humanitarian aid has entered the north since Oct. 1, according to U.N. data.

The Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the hospitals or the apparent suspension of aid delivery in the north.

Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the military spokesperson, said late Tuesday that Israeli forces were operating in Jabaliya ""to prevent Hamas' regrouping efforts,"" saying they had killed around 100 militants, without providing evidence. Israel says it only targets militants and blames civilian deaths on Hamas because it fights in residential areas.

Israel ordered the wholesale evacuation of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, in the opening weeks of the war, but hundreds of thousands of people are believed to have remained there. Israel reiterated those instructions earlier this month, telling people to flee south to an expanded humanitarian zone along the coast where hundreds of thousands are already crammed into squalid tent camps.

The war began just over a year ago, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. They are still holding around 100 hostages, a third of whom are believed to be dead.

Israel's offensive has killed 42,010 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters. It has said women and children make up over half of the dead. The offensive has also caused staggering destruction across the territory and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to keep fighting until ""total victory"" over Hamas and the return of all the captives.

On Tuesday, he warned that Lebanon would meet a similar fate if its people did not rise up against Hezbollah, which began firing rockets into Israel after the initial Hamas attack in support of the Palestinians. That set in motion a cycle of escalation that ignited a full-scale war last month.

""You have an opportunity to save Lebanon before it falls into the abyss of a long war that will lead to destruction and suffering like we see in Gaza,"" Netanyahu said, addressing the Lebanese people.

In recent weeks Israel has waged a punishing air campaign across large parts of Lebanon, targeting what it says are Hezbollah rocket launchers and other militant sites. In a matter of days, strikes killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his top commanders.

So far, ground operations appear to be focused on a narrow strip along the border, but Israel has warned people to evacuate dozens of cities and towns across southern Lebanon, many of them north of a buffer zone declared by the United Nations after the last war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006.

Hezbollah's acting leader, Sheikh Naim Kassem, said in a televised statement Tuesday that the group has replaced its slain commanders and was preventing Israeli ground forces from advancing. The militants have extended their rocket fire deeper into Israel, disrupting life but causing few casualties.

Israel is meanwhile considering options for a strike on Iran that could potentially escalate the war on yet another front. Iran, which supports Hezbollah and Hamas, launched a wave of some 180 ballistic missiles at Israel last week in retaliation for the killing of top militants from both groups.

On Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that Israel has killed the successor to the head of Hezbollah, while the militant group's acting leader promised more fighting in southern Lebanon.

Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, which began firing rockets at Israel on Oct. 8, 2023.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Palestinian officials say Israeli strikes in central and northern Gaza killed at least 18 people, including five children and two women.

Two strikes hit tents for displaced people in the urban Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps in central Gaza early Wednesday. The bodies of nine people, including three children, were brought to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah. An Associated Press journalist saw the bodies at the morgue.

In northern Gaza, an Israeli strike hit a family home in the Jabaliya refugee camp, killing at least nine people, according to the Civil Defense, a rescue agency operating under the Hamas-run government. The dead were taken to the Al-Ahly Hospital, which said two women and two children were among those killed.

Footage shared by the Civil Defense showed first responders recovering dead bodies and body parts from under the rubble.

Israel launched an air and ground operation earlier this week in Jabaliya, a densely populated urban refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. Israel has carried out several previous operations in Jabaliya, and its forces have repeatedly returned to other areas of Gaza after militants have regrouped."
Israel planea ataque contra Irán. Sus opciones van de lo simbólico a lo severo,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-24680e15510f4ebb6844c4443efb6c90,2024-10-09T00:34:55Z,"JERUSALÉN (AP) -- Israel ha prometido responder al intenso ataque con misiles que lanzó Irán la semana pasada. La manera en que lo haga conlleva un enorme riesgo y podría tener inmensas repercusiones para ambas naciones, Oriente Medio y el resto del mundo.

Las opciones de Israel van desde ataques simbólicos contra objetivos militares hasta una campaña devastadora contra la vital industria petrolera de Irán o su secreto y fuertemente resguardado programa nuclear.

Se tenía previsto que la intensidad y el momento de cualquier ataque de represalia fuera el tema central de una reunión programada para esta semana en el Pentágono entre el ministro de Defensa de Israel y su homólogo estadounidense. Pero el Pentágono informó la tarde del martes que el encuentro había sido pospuesto de forma repentina.

En una muestra de posibles desacuerdos en torno a cómo abordar el asunto, el presidente estadounidense Joe Biden ya hizo un llamado a Israel a no atacar el programa nuclear iraní, y lo desalentó de lanzar una campaña contra la industria petrolera.

The Associated Press habló con dos ex primeros ministros israelíes y otros expertos sobre las opciones de Israel. Existe un amplio consenso en que Israel debe responder, pero un profundo desacuerdo respecto a la mejor forma de hacerlo.

""La cuestión no es si Israel responderá"", dijo el ex primer ministro Ehud Olmert a la AP. ""La cuestión es de qué forma"".

Israel e Irán han estado involucrados en una guerra indirecta durante varios años, principalmente mediante los conflictos israelíes contra milicias patrocinadas por Teherán en toda la región. Israel también es el principal sospechoso en el asesinato de científicos nucleares iraníes y de atacar las instalaciones nucleares de Irán, aunque rara vez admite su participación.

Los enfrentamientos directos han sido inusuales. Pero la situación cambió después de que combatientes de Hamás incursionaron en el sur de Israel desde la Franja de Gaza el 7 de octubre de 2023, y de que Hezbollah empezó a lanzar cohetes hacia territorio israelí al día siguiente. Ambos grupos reciben apoyo de Irán.

En abril, Irán lanzó más de 300 drones y misiles hacia Israel después de acusar al país del asesinato de dos generales iraníes dentro de un complejo diplomático en Siria. Casi todos los proyectiles sufrieron fallas o fueron interceptados, e Israel respondió con un ataque limitado con el que indicaba que no buscaba una mayor escalada.

Tras el ataque iraní de la semana pasada, Israel indicó que su siguiente respuesta sería distinta.

Irán declaró que la oleada de por lo menos 180 misiles balísticos fue para vengar una serie de ataques israelíes contra sus aliados cercanos -- Hamás y Hezbollah -- , incluido el asesinato del líder de esta última organización. Aunque los misiles causaron daños limitados y pocas víctimas, el primer ministro Benjamin Netanyahu afirmó que Teherán cometió un ""grave error y pagará por ello"". Integrantes de su gobierno de línea dura han exigido una respuesta contundente.

Israel tiene una amplia gama de opciones para atacar: Desde edificios del gobierno iraní y bases militares, hasta cruciales plantas petroleras e instalaciones nucleares fuertemente resguardadas, las cuales están ocultas bajo suelo. Israel acusa a Irán de desarrollar armamento nuclear, señalamientos que han sido rechazados por Teherán.

Atacar cualquier punto del territorio iraní es un desafío logístico para Israel. Sus aviones de combate tendrían que desplazarse más de 1.500 kilómetros (1.000 millas) hasta su objetivo, lo que requiere complicadas operaciones de repostamiento de combustible en pleno de vuelo sobre cielos potencialmente hostiles. Cualquier ataque también significa hacer frente a los sistemas antiaéreos iraníes de fabricación rusa.

""Recuerden que Irán está a 1.500, 1.600 kilómetros (unas 1.000 millas) de distancia de Israel, y tendrían que atravesar varios países: Jordania, Irak, Arabia Saudí. Algunos son amigos. Otros son enemigos"", comentó Yoel Guzansky, investigador en el Instituto para Estudios de Seguridad Nacional en Tel Aviv y exasesor de asuntos iraníes para el Consejo de Seguridad Nacional de Israel.

""No quieres dejar en vergüenza a tus amigos. No quieres ser blanco de fuego hostil de otros países"", puntualizó.

Olmert, quien fue primer ministro entre 2006 y 2009, dijo que Israel tiene capacidad de sobra para lidiar con esos desafíos.

""Contamos con las capacidades"", afirmó. ""No estoy seguro de que sea prudente o responsable exponerlas"".

Incluso si Israel cuenta con los medios, existen cuestiones diplomáticas a tomar en cuenta. Un ataque contra el sector petrolero, la columna vertebral de la economía iraní, o contra su programa nuclear, prácticamente garantizaría una respuesta iraní y elevaría el riesgo de una mayor escalada.

Este tipo de ataques podrían estremecer los mercados petroleros a nivel global y sacudir a la economía de Estados Unidos en la víspera de una elección presidencial. También conllevan el riesgo de una represalia iraní, no sólo contra Israel, sino contra soldados estadounidenses apostados en la región o contra países cercanos que sean aliados de Occidente.

""A diferencia de Líbano y Gaza, cualquier ataque israelí sobre Irán tiene repercusiones internacionales y globales"", explicó Menahem Merhavy, experto en temas de Irán en la Universidad Hebrea de Jerusalén.

Algunos exgobernantes difieren cobre cuál sería la mejor opción de Israel.

Olmert dijo que un ataque contra varios objetivos militares, dispersos en el extenso territorio de Irán, sería más que suficiente para enviar un mensaje. El objetivo, señaló, es demostrar que Israel puede atacar en cualquier momento y en cualquier lugar.

""Esto es exactamente lo que es un disuasivo"", comentó.

Olmert dijo que atacar al sector petrolero iraní sería una escalada innecesaria que deja abierta la puerta a una respuesta, y el riesgo de una campaña contra el programa nuclear de Teherán simplemente no vale la pena. No sólo detonaría una represalia de Teherán, sino que las posibilidades de éxito son inciertas, añadió.

""Tratar de atacar su programa nuclear será un error"", indicó.

Otro ex primer ministro, Yair Lapid, cree que Israel debería atacar la infraestructura petrolera de Irán.

""Ese es el objetivo que más le duele al régimen iraní"", señaló Lapid, quien fue primer ministro en 2022, en una respuesta por escrito a la pregunta de la AP.

""El ataque iraní con misiles balísticos contra Israel debe recibir una respuesta contundente"", puntualizó. Añadió que Irán debe entender ""que su agresión regional tiene un precio muy alto"".

En una entrevista con el portal noticioso israelí Ynet, Lapid dijo que únicamente se debe lanzar un ataque contra las instalaciones nucleares iraníes como parte de una coalición internacional en coordinación con Estados Unidos.

El predecesor de Lapid como primer ministro y exaliado de su coalición de gobierno, Naftali Bennet, asumió una postura incluso más rígida, asegurando que este es el momento para que Israel bombardee el proyecto nuclear de Irán.

Bennett publicó el martes un video en redes sociales en el que afirmó que se debe debilitar a Irán y a sus aliados, y que Israel tiene la rara oportunidad de asestar un golpe contundente al gobierno, la economía y el programa nuclear de Irán.

""No debemos conformarnos con bases militares o acciones escandalosas pero carentes de significado con el único fin de enviar un mensaje"", comentó Bennett. ""Ya pasó el momento de enviar mensajes"".

Olmert, sin embargo, dijo que espera que prevalezca la prudencia.

""¿Qué queremos alcanzar, qué tan lejos estamos dispuestos a ir y qué tan arrogantes queremos ser?"", preguntó.

Su recomendación. ""Ser inteligentes"".

"As Israel plots to strike Iran, its choices range from symbolic to severe",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-nuclear-hezbollah-hamas-missile-retaliation-0184e79d4ee5ec012960e0b24ddae102,2024-10-08T19:54:06Z,"JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel has promised to retaliate for Iran's massive missile attack last week. How it does so involves great risk, and could have major repercussions for the archenemies, the Middle East and the world.

Israel's options range from symbolic strikes on military targets to crippling attacks on Iran's vital oil industry or its secretive and heavily fortified nuclear program.

The intensity and timing of any retaliatory strike was expected to top the agenda of a planned meeting this week at the Pentagon between Israel's defense minister and his U.S. counterpart. But late Tuesday, the Pentagon said the meeting was abruptly postponed.

In a sign of possible disagreement over the right approach, President Joe Biden has already urged Israel not to hit Iran's nuclear program and discouraged it from hitting the oil industry.

The Associated Press spoke to two former Israeli prime ministers and other experts to explore Israel's options. There is broad consensus that Israel must strike back, but deep disagreement over the best way to do so.

""The question is not whether Israel will retaliate or respond,"" former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told AP. ""The question is which way.""

Israel and Iran have been involved in a bitter shadow war for years -- primarily through Israel's battles against Iranian-backed militant groups across the region. Israel also has been suspected of killing Iranian nuclear scientists and carrying out attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, but it rarely acknowledges involvement.

Direct clashes have been rare. But things changed after Hamas attacked Israel from the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7, 2023, and Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel the following day. Both groups receive support from Iran.

In April, Iran fired over 300 drones and missiles toward Israel after accusing it of killing two Iranian generals in a diplomatic compound in Syria. Nearly all of the missiles malfunctioned or were intercepted, and Israel responded with a limited strike that signaled it did not want any further escalation.

After last week's Iranian attack, Israel signaled its next response would be different.

Iran said the barrage of at least 180 ballistic missiles was to avenge a series of Israeli strikes against its close allies, Hamas and Hezbollah, including the assassination of the group's longtime leader. Although the missiles caused little damage or casualties, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran had made a ""big mistake and it will pay for it."" Members of his hard-line coalition have called for a harsh response.

Israel has a broad range of choices of targets - from Iranian government buildings and military bases to sensitive oil installations to heavily fortified nuclear facilities hidden deep below ground. Israel accuses Iran of developing nuclear weapons -- a charge Iran denies.

Striking anywhere in Iran is a logistical challenge for Israel. Warplanes would need to fly over 1,500 kilometers (about 1,000 miles) to their target, requiring a complicated midair refueling operation, potentially over hostile skies. Any strike would also mean confronting Iran's Russian-made air-defense systems.

""Remember that Iran is 1,500, 1,600 kilometers (about 1,000 miles) away from Israel, and you have countries in between -- Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia. Some are friends. Some are foes,"" said Yoel Guzansky, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv and a former adviser on Iranian affairs on Israel's National Security Council.

""You don't want to embarrass your friends. You don't want to get hostile fire from other countries,"" he said.

Olmert, who served as prime minister from 2006 to 2009, said Israel is more than capable of coping with these challenges.

""We have the capabilities,"" he said. ""I'm not certain it would be wise and responsible to expose them.""

Even if Israel has the means, there are diplomatic considerations. A strike on the oil sector, Iran's economic backbone, or on the nuclear program would almost certainly guarantee an Iranian response and raise the risk of further escalation.

Such strikes could rattle global oil markets and shake the U.S. economy on the eve of a presidential election. They also could risk Iranian retaliation not only against Israel, but against American troops stationed in the region or Gulf Arab countries aligned with the West.

""Unlike Lebanon and Gaza, every Israeli attack on Iran has international and global repercussions,"" said Menahem Merhavy, an Iran expert at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

Former leaders are divided on what path Israel should choose.

Olmert said a strike on multiple military targets, spread across Iran's vast territory, would be more than enough to send a message. The goal, he said, is to show that Israel can strike anywhere and anytime.

""That's precisely what deterrence is all about,"" he said.

Olmert said hitting Iran's oil sector would be an unnecessary escalation that invites a response, and that striking the nuclear program is not worth the risk. Not only would it trigger Iranian retaliation, but the odds of success are uncertain, he said.

""Trying to attack the nuclear program will be a mistake,"" he said.

Another former prime minister, Yair Lapid, believes Israel should strike Iran's oil industry infrastructure.

""That is the most painful target for the Iranian regime,"" Lapid, who served as premier in 2022, said in a written response to a question from The Associated Press.

""Iran's ballistic missile attack against Israel must be met with a forceful response,"" he said, adding that Iran must understand ""there is a high cost to its regional aggression.""

In an interview with the Israeli news site Ynet, Lapid said a strike on Iran's nuclear facilities should only be done as part of an international coalition in coordination with the United States.

Lapid's predecessor as prime minister and former governing partner, Naftali Bennett, takes an even tougher line, saying now is the time for Israel to bomb the Iranian nuclear project.

Bennett said in a video posted on social media Tuesday that Iran and its allies have been weakened, and that Israel has a rare chance to deliver a decisive blow to Iran's leadership, economy and nuclear program.

""We must not settle for Iranian military bases or noisy-yet-meaningless actions that are meant only to deliver a message,"" Bennett said. ""The time for messages is over.""

Olmert, however, said he hopes cooler heads will prevail.

""What do we want to achieve and how far do we want to go and how arrogant do we want to be?"" he said. His advice: ""Try to be smart."""
Ataques israelíes están trastocando el equilibrio de poder en Oriente Medio,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-b4a473447c9923bc9d7e5db222346f7b,2024-10-08T14:36:27Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Israel está atacando a milicias respaldadas por Irán en una franja de casi 3.200 kilómetros (2.000 millas) y ha amenazado al mismo Irán, una gestión que podría poner fin a dos décadas de ascendencia iraní en la región inadvertidamente provocada por la invasión estadounidense de Irak en el 2003.

En Washington, Tel Aviv, Jerusalén y en las capitales árabes, los opositores y partidarios de la ofensiva israelí están ofreciendo ideas encontradas sobre qué debería hacer Estados Unidos a medida que su aliado se anota éxitos tácticos contra Hezbollah en el Lïbano y contra los hutíes en Yemen, y avanza en su campaña por aplastar al grupo Hamás en la Franja de Gaza.

Israel debe recibir todo el apoyo que necesita de Estados Unidos hasta que el gobierno iraní ""caiga en el basural de la historia como lo han hecho tantas dictaduras del pasado"", estimó Richard Goldberg, asesor sénior de la Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, una institución de inclinación conservadora en Washington. Es una postura que comparten algunos políticos israelíes.

Yendo aun más lejos, Yoel Guzansky, ex integrante del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional israelí, se manifestó a favor de que Estados Unidos se suma a Israel en un ataque conjunto contra Irán. Ello ""le enviaría un mensaje bien claro a los iraníes: no se metan con nosotros"", dijo Guzansky.

Sin embargo, hay quienes apuntan a lecciones de la campaña norteamericana en Irak y el derrocamiento de Saddam Hussein, cuando el entonces presidente George W. Bush ignoró advertencias árabes de que el dictador iraquí era un contrapeso indispensable contra la influencia iraní. Advierten que Estados Unidos no debe depender en victorias militares sin considerar los riesgos, objetivos y planes para siguientes etapas, y sobre la posibilidad de consecuencias indeseadas.

Al final Israel ""podría terminar en una situación en que sólo se puede proteger mediante una guerra perpetua"", dice Vali Nasr, quien fue asesor a la administración de Barack Obama y quien es hoy profesor en la Escuela de Estudios Internacionales Avanzados Johns Hopkins (SAIS) y ha sido uno de los principales estudiosos del ascenso de la influencia iraní desde la invasión estadounidense de Irak.

En momentos en que el primer ministro israelí Benjamin Netanyahu le presta limitada atención a los llamados de mesura que le hace el gobierno estadounidense, Washington y sus aliados en el Medio Oriente ""están a merced de cuán lejos quiere Netanyahu llevar las cosas"", dice Nasr.

""Es como si no hemos aprendido las lecciones del error de ese experimento ... en Irak en el 2003, sobre la idea de reestructurar el orden político del Medio Oriente"", sostiene Randa Slim, profesora en SAIS e investigadora del Middle East Institute, una institución en Washington.

Los partidarios de Israel están a favor de debilitar a Irán y las milicias que controla, las cuales atacan a Estados Unidos, Israel y sus aliados, reprimen a la sociedad civil y se ponen del lado de Rusia y otros adversarios de Occidente.

Los opositores advierten que acciones militares sin resolver los agravios de los palestinos y otros grupos podrían dejar al Medio Oriente en un espiral de guerra, insurgencias, violencia y la represión de regímenes que tratan de controlar la situación.

Está además la posibilidad de que Irán desarrolle armas nucleares en un intento por asegurar su supervivencia. Antes de los ataques israelíes contra Hezbollah, los líderes iraníes habían mostrado interés en regresar a la mesa de negociaciones sobre su programa nuclear y en general, en mejorar relaciones con Occidente.

En apenas semanas, los ataques y operaciones encubiertas israelíes han devastado la conducción, las filas y los arsenales de Hezbollah -- milicia libanesa que se había erguido como una de las fuerzas más potentes del Medio Oriente y una herramienta de Irán para defenderse de ataques contra su territorio -- y han golpeado instalaciones petroleras de los hutíes yemeníes.

Un año de ataques aéreos israelíes en Gaza parecen haber reducido la cúpula del grupo proiraní Hamás a unos pocos sobrevivientes escondidos en túneles. Sin embargo, las fuerzas israelíes nuevamente se vieron enfrascadas en combates allí esta semana y Hamás logró disparar cohetes contra Tel Aviv en el aniversario de los ataques que ese grupo perpetró contra Israel el 7 de octubre, hecho que desencadenó la actual guerra.

La anticipada represalia israelí contra Irán podría acelerar el cambio en el equilibrio de poder regional, luego que Irán lanzó misiles balísticos contra Israel la semana pasada en respuesta a los asesinatos de líderes de Hezbollah y Hamás. Podría también aumentar el riesgo de una conflagración regional más amplia, algo que el presidente Joe Biden y muchos gobiernos anteriores han tratado de evitar desde hace décadas.

El aumento de los ataques israelíes desde fines del mes pasado ha frustrado los intentos de Estados Unidos, Egipto y Qatar por lograr un cese al fuego y una liberación de rehenes en Gaza. Líderes estadounidenses dicen que Israel no les avisó antes de atacar a los líderes del Hezbollah en el Líbano, pero han defendido los asaltos israelíes aunque perseveran en sus intentos por lograr una tregua.

La vicepresidenta y candidata presidencial demócrata Kamala Harris dijo en una entrevista el lunes con el programa ""60 Minutes"" de CBS que Estados Unidos está decidido a darle a Israel las armas que necesite para su defensa, pero que al mismo tiempo seguirá con sus esfuerzos por poner fin al conflicto.

""No vamos a dejar de ejercer presión sobre Israel y sobre otros en la región, incluyendo los líderes árabes"", manifestó Harris.

Los ataques israelíes, para algunos, asoman la tentadora posibilidad de debilitar la alianza antioccidental y antiisraelí entre Irán y grupos afines en el Líbano, Irak, Siria y Yemen, y gobiernos como el de Rusia y Corea del Norte.

Las alianzas militares iraníes - apodadas ""El eje de la resistencia"" - crecieron primero a nivel regional y luego a nivel global luego que la invasión estadounidense de Irak derrocó a Saddam, quien había librado una guerra de ocho años contra el ambicioso régimen teocrático iraní.

Los partidarios de la invasión estadounidense de Irak y del derrocamiento de Saddam acertaron en cuanto a que la democracia iraquí se afianzaría, pero las consecuencias indeseadas fueron aun mayores, como el surgimiento del ""Eje de la resistencia"" y de nuevos grupos extremistas, como el Estado Islámico.

""Un Irán envalentonado y expansionista parece ser el único ganador"" de la guerra del 2003, dice una evaluación del ejército norteamericano sobre las lecciones derivadas de ese conflicto.

""Hace dos décadas, ¿quién se hubiera imaginado que Irán le estaría dando armas a Rusia? La explicación está en el aumento de su influencia tras el derrocamiento de Saddam"", dijo Ihsan Alshimary, profesor de ciencias políticas de la Universidad de Bagdad.

Aun más que en el 2003, los líderes globales están ofreciendo pocos vaticinios de cómo terminarán los cambios que están generando las acciones militares israelíes, ya sea para Irán, Israel, el Medio Oriente en general y Estados Unidos.

Irán y sus aliados están siendo debilitados, dijo Goldberg, de la Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. Pero también está disminuyendo la influencia estadounidense, al ser arrastrada por Israel, sostuvo Nasr.

El conflicto podría terminar perjudicando a Israel si se estanca, por ejemplo, en una guerra terrestre en el Líbano, dijo Mehran Kamrava, profesor y experto en temas del Medio Oriente en la Universidad de Georgetown en Qatar.

Tras cuatro décadas de intensa animosidad entre Israel y los líderes iraníes, ""la guerra fría entre ellos se ha convertido una guerra caliente. Y ello está cambiando, y sin duda cambiará, el panorama estratégico en el Medio Oriente"", afirmó Kamrava.

""Estamos sin duda en el precipicio de un cambio"", dijo Kamrava, pero ""la dirección y la naturaleza de ese cambio es muy difícil de predecir en estos momentos"".

MI5 spy chief says Russia and Iran are behind a 'staggering' rise in deadly plots,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/uk-intelligence-mi5-threats-russia-iran-936d7c24d303ffea41f6b1cef7c7b814,2024-10-08T12:46:14Z,"LONDON (AP) -- Britain is facing a ""staggering rise"" in assassination attempts on U.K. soil by Russia and Iran, as the hostile states recruit criminals to ""do their dirty work"" for them, the head of the U.K.'s domestic intelligence agency said Tuesday.

MI5 director Ken McCallum said his agents and police have tackled 20 Tehran-backed plots since 2022 and warned that Iran could expand its targets in the U.K. if Israel attacks in response to Iran's missile barrage. The spy chief said the widening conflicts in the Middle East raise the risk ""of an increase in - or broadening of - Iranian state aggression in the U.K.""

In a rare public speech setting out the major threats to the U.K. from both hostile states and terror groups, McCallum said there also is a risk that Israel's conflicts with Iran-backed militant groups -- Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen - could trigger terror attacks in the U.K.

The Middle East crisis has not translated ""at scale into terrorist violence"" in Britain, he said, but hostile states, individual attackers and a revived Islamic State group combine to create ""the most complex and interconnected threat environment we've ever seen.""

The number of state-threat investigations undertaken by MI5 has risen by 48% in the past year, with Iran, Russia and, China the main perpetrators, McCallum told journalists at the U.K.'s counterterrorism command center in London

McCallum said that since the death of Mahsa Amini, who died in Iranian police custody in September 2022 after being detained for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's mandatory headscarf law, ""we've seen plot after plot here in the U.K., at an unprecedented pace and scale.""

He said MI5 and the police have responded to 20 potentially lethal Iran-backed plots since January 2022, an increase of a third on the figure of 15 the government gave at the end of January.

McCallum said Russia's military intelligence agency was trying to use ""arson, sabotage and more"" to create ""mayhem"" on the streets of Britain and other European countries.

Both Russia and Iran often turn to criminals, ""from international drug traffickers to low-level crooks,"" to carry out attacks, he said,

The U.K.'s official terror threat level stands at ""substantial,"" the middle of a five-point scale, meaning an attack is likely, and since 2017 MI5 and the police have disrupted 43 late-stage terror plots.

While about three-quarters of terror plots stem from Islamic extremist ideology and a quarter from the extreme right, he said those labels ""don't fully reflect the dizzying range of beliefs and ideologies we see,"" drawn from a soup of ""online hatred, conspiracy theories and disinformation,"" McCallum said.

He also said there was worrying signs that the Islamic State group is back, despite the collapse of its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria.

McCallum said that ""after a few years of being pinned well back, they've resumed efforts to export terrorism.""

""The first 20 years of my career here were crammed full of terrorist threats,"" McCallum said. ""We now face those alongside state-backed assassination and sabotage plots, against the backdrop of a major European land war."""
Middle East latest: Israeli military says it killed a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut strike,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-8-october-2024-3169a0d6d77b4a195705b0c4ccbe99dd,2024-10-08T06:04:30Z,"The Israeli military said Tuesday it had killed a senior Hezbollah commander in a strike on Beirut, a day after the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack was marked by mourning and demonstrations around the globe.

The military said the strike killed Suhail Husseini, who it said was responsible for overseeing logistics, budget and management of the militant group.

Palestinian militants in Gaza fired a barrage of rockets into Israel on Monday, underscoring militants' resilience in the face of a devastating Israeli offensive in Gaza that has killed about 42,000 Palestinians, according to local medical officials, destroyed large areas and displaced around 90% of its population.

A year ago, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel's security fence and stormed into army bases and farming communities, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding about 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead.

Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, which began firing rockets at Israel on Oct. 8, 2023. On Monday, Lebanon's Health Ministry said an Israeli strike in the country's south, part of a wider bombardment, killed at least 10 firefighters. Hezbollah fired new barrages despite its recent losses.

Here is the latest:

JERUSALEM -- The Israeli military says it killed a senior Hezbollah commander in a strike on Beirut.

The military said Tuesday that it killed Suhail Husseini, who it said was responsible for overseeing logistics, budget and management of the militant group.

There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah.

The military said Husseini was involved in the transfer of advanced weapons from Iran and their distribution to different Hezbollah units, and that he was a member of the group's military council.

Israeli strikes have killed Hezbollah's overall leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and several of his top commanders in recent weeks. Last week, Israel launched what it says is a limited ground incursion into southern Lebanon.

Hezbollah says it has already replaced its slain commanders. It has vowed to keep firing rockets, missiles and drones into Israel until there is a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, where its ally Hamas has been at war with Israel for a year."
"Israel's strikes are shifting the power balance in the Middle East, with US support",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-middle-east-war-united-states-36d7c0bbc35964ed6ac9d21de17c632a,2024-10-08T04:13:11Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Israeli military strikes are targeting Iran's armed allies across a nearly 2,000-mile stretch of the Middle East and threatening Iran itself. The efforts raise the possibility of an end to two decades of Iranian ascendancy in the region, to which the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq inadvertently gave rise.

In Washington, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and Arab capitals, opponents and supporters of Israel's offensive are offering clashing ideas about what the U.S. should do next, as its ally racks up tactical successes against Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen and presses its yearlong campaign to crush Hamas in Gaza.

Israel should get all the support it needs from the United States until Iran's government ""follows other dictatorships of the past into the dustbin of history,"" said Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at Washington's conservative-leaning Foundation for the Defense of Democracies -- calls echoed by some Israeli political figures.

Going further, Yoel Guzansky, a former senior staffer at Israel's National Security Council, called for the Biden administration to join Israel in direct attacks in Iran. That would send ""the right message to the Iranians -- 'Don't mess with us,''' Guzansky said.

Critics, however, highlight lessons from the U.S. military campaign in Iraq and toppling of Saddam Hussein, when President George W. Bush ignored Arab warnings that the Iraqi dictator was the region's indispensable counterbalance to Iranian influence. They caution against racking up military victories without adequately considering the risks, end goals or plans for what comes next, and warn of unintended consequences.

Ultimately, Israel ""will be in a situation where it can only protect itself by perpetual war,"" said Vali Nasr, who was an adviser to the Obama administration. Now a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, or SAIS, he has been one of the leading documenters of the rise of Iranian regional influence since the U.S. invasion of Iraq.

With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu giving limited weight to Biden administration calls for restraint, the United States and its partners in the Middle East are ""at the mercy of how far Bibi Netanyahu will push it,"" Nasr said, referring to the Israeli leader by his nickname.

""It's as if we hadn't learned the lessons, or the folly, of that experiment ... in Iraq in 2003 about reshaping the Middle East order,"" said Randa Slim, a fellow at SAIS and researcher at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.

Advocates of Israel's campaign hope for the weakening of Iran and its armed proxies that attack the U.S., Israel and their partners, oppress civil society and increasingly are teaming up with Russia and other Western adversaries.

Opponents warn that military action without resolving the grievances of Palestinians and others risks endless and destabilizing cycles of war, insurgency and extremist violence, and Middle East governments growing more repressive to try to control the situation.

And there's the threat that Iran develops nuclear weapons to try to ensure its survival. Before the Israeli strikes on Hezbollah, Iranian leaders concerned about Israel's offensives had made clear that they were interested in returning to negotiations with the U.S. on their nuclear program and claimed interest in improved relations overall.

In just weeks, Israeli airstrikes and intelligence operations have devastated the leadership, ranks and arsenals of Lebanon-based Hezbollah -- which had been one of the Middle East's most powerful fighting forces and Iran's overseas bulwark against attacks on Iranian territory -- and hit oil infrastructure of Yemen's Iran-allied Houthis.

A year of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza appears to have reduced the leadership of Iranian-allied Hamas to a few survivors hiding in underground tunnels. However, Israeli forces again engaged in heavy fighting there this week, and Hamas was able to fire rockets at Tel Aviv in a surprising show of enduring strength on the Oct. 7 anniversary of the militant group's attack on Israel, which started the war.

Anticipated Israeli counterstrikes on Iran could accelerate regional shifts in power. The response would follow Iran launching ballistic missiles at Israel last week in retaliation for killings of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.

It also could escalate the risk of all-out regional war that U.S. President Joe Biden -- and decades of previous administrations -- worked to avert.

The expansion of Israeli attacks since late last month has sidelined mediation by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar for a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza. U.S. leaders say Israel did not warn them before striking Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon but have defended the surge in attacks, while still pressing for peace.

Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, said in an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" aired Monday that the U.S. was dedicated to supplying Israel with the military aid needed to protect itself but would keep pushing to end the conflict.

""We're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders,"" she said.

Israel's expanded strikes raise for many what is the tempting prospect of weakening Iran's anti-Western, anti-Israel alliance with like-minded armed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen to governments in Russia and North Korea.

Called the ""Axis of Resistance,"" Iran's military alliances grew -- regionally, then globally -- after the U.S. invasion of Iraq removed Saddam, who had fought an eight-year war against Iran's ambitious clerical regime.

Advocates of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, and overthrow of Saddam, said correctly that an Iraqi democracy would take hold.

But the unintended effects of the U.S. intervention were even bigger, including the rise of Iran's Axis of Resistance and new extremist groups, including the Islamic State.

""An emboldened and expansionist Iran appears to be the only victor"" of the 2003 Iraq war, notes a U.S. Army review of lessons learned.

""Two decades ago, who could have seen a day when Iran was supporting Russia with arms? The reason is because of its increased influence"" after the U.S. overthrow of Saddam, said Ihsan Alshimary, professor of political science at Baghdad University.

Even more than in 2003, global leaders are offering little clear idea on how the shifts in power that Israel's military is putting in motion will end -- for Iran, Israel, the Middle East at large, and the United States.

Iran and its allies are being weakened, said Goldberg, at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. So is U.S. influence as it appears to be dragged along by Israel, Nasr said.

The conflict could end up hurting Israel if it bogs down in a ground war in Lebanon, for example, said Mehran Kamrava, a professor and Middle East expert at Georgetown University in Qatar.

After four decades of deep animosity between Israeli and Iranian leaders, ""the cold war between them has turned into a hot war. And this is significantly changing -- is bound to change -- the strategic landscape in the Middle East,"" he said.

""We are certainly at the precipice of change,"" Kamrava said. But ""the direction and nature of that change is very hard to predict at this stage.""

Gaza está en ruinas tras un año de ofensiva israelí. La reconstrucción podría tomar décadas,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-domestic-news-b79a673b1fc3b067d91af0455a4ad182,2024-10-07T18:24:31Z,"Hay montañas de escombros donde antes había bloques de apartamentos y charcos de agua contaminada con aguas residuales que propagan enfermedades. Las calles de las ciudades se han convertido en cañones de tierra y, en muchos lugares, el aire está impregnado del hedor de cadáveres no recuperados.

La ofensiva israelí contra Hamás, una de las más mortíferas y destructivas en la historia reciente, ha matado a más de 41.000 personas, un poco más de la mitad de ellas mujeres y niños, según los funcionarios de salud locales. Sin un final a la vista para la guerra, y sin un plan para el día después, es imposible decir cuándo -- o hasta si -- algo será reconstruido.

Incluso después de que cesen los combates, cientos de miles de personas podrían quedar atrapadas y vivir en campamentos de tiendas de campaña durante años. Los expertos dicen que la reconstrucción podría tomar décadas.

""Esta guerra es destrucción y miseria. Haría que las piedras clamaran"", dijo Shifaa Hejjo, un ama de casa de 60 años, quien vive en una tienda de campaña instalada en el terreno donde antes estuvo su casa. ""Quienquiera que vea Gaza ... lo hará llorar"".

Israel culpa a Hamás por la destrucción. El ataque de ese grupo palestino contra Israel el 7 de octubredel año pasado -- en el que murieron unas 1.200 personas y unas 250 fueron tomadas como rehenes -- provocó la guerra. Israel dice que Hamás incrustó gran parte de su infraestructura militar, incluidos cientos de kilómetros (millas) de túneles, en áreas densamente pobladas donde se libraron algunas de las batallas más duras.

Los combates dejaron aproximadamente una cuarta parte de todas las estructuras en Gaza destruidas o gravemente dañadas, según una evaluación de la ONU en septiembre con base en videos satelitales. Dijo que alrededor del 66% de las estructuras, incluidas más de 227.000 unidades de vivienda, habían sufrido al menos algún daño.

Si hay un alto al fuego, alrededor de la mitad de las familias ""no tendrán a dónde regresar"", dijo Alison Ely, coordinadora en Gaza del Shelter Cluster, una coalición internacional de proveedores de ayuda liderada por el Consejo Noruego para los Refugiados.

Casi tantos edificios han sido destruidos o dañados en Gaza como en toda Ucrania después de sus primeros dos años de guerra con Rusia, según Corey Scher y Jamon Van Den Hoek, investigadores con sede en Estados Unidos que utilizan radares satelitales para documentar la devastación de las guerras.

Para poner eso en perspectiva: Gaza tiene menos de la mitad del tamaño de Kiev, la capital de Ucrania.

La cantidad de destrucción solo en el centro y sur de Gaza, dijo Scher, es aproximadamente equivalente a lo que se perdió en la ciudad de primera línea de Bajmut, escenario de una de las batallas más mortíferas en la guerra de Ucrania y donde las fuerzas rusas destruyeron casi todos los edificios a su paso para obligar a las tropas ucranianas a retirarse. La destrucción en el norte de Gaza es aún peor, agregó.

El sistema de agua y saneamiento de Gaza ha colapsado. Más del 80% de sus instalaciones sanitarias -- y un porcentaje mayor de sus carreteras -- están dañadas o destruidas.

""No puedo pensar en ningún paralelo, en términos de la severidad de los daños, para un enclave, un país o un pueblo"", manifestó Scher.

A finales de enero, el Banco Mundial estimó que los daños ascendían a 18.500 millones de dólares: casi la producción económica combinada de Cisjordania y Gaza en 2022. Eso fue antes de algunas operaciones terrestres israelíes intensamente destructivas, incluso en la ciudad sureña fronteriza de Rafah.

En enero, cuando las fuerzas terrestres israelíes avanzaron hacia la ciudad de Jan Yunis, en el sur, Shifaa Hejjo y su familia huyeron de su casa de cuatro pisos con solo la ropa que vestían.

Pasaron meses en varios campamentos de tiendas de campaña antes de que ella decidiera regresar. Y lo que vio la hizo llorar.

Todo su vecindario había sido destruido: su antigua casa y los caminos que conducían a ella estaban hundidos en un mar de escombros.

""No la reconocí"", dijo. ""No sabía dónde estaban las casas de la gente"".

Alrededor del 90% de los 2,3 millones de habitantes de Gaza han sido desplazados por la guerra, a menudo varias veces, según estimaciones de la ONU. Cientos de miles se han apiñado en campamentos de tiendas de campaña en expansión cerca de la costa sin electricidad, agua corriente ni baños. El hambre está extendida.

Hejjo vivió en una tienda de campaña en el patio de un hospital. Antes de eso, estuvo en Muwasi, el principal campamento de tiendas de campaña en el sur de Gaza.

""Olía mal"", reportó. ""Había enfermedades que se propagaban"".

Agregó que su esposo, quien sufría una enfermedad hepática, se sintió destrozado cuando escuchó que su casa había sido destruida y murió poco después.

Ella fue una de las primeras en regresar después de que las fuerzas israelíes se retiraran en abril. Sus vecinos se mantuvieron alejados, temerosos de encontrar cuerpos o bombas sin explotar.

Pero para ella, ese todavía era su hogar.

""Es mejor vivir en mi casa, donde viví durante 37 años, aunque esté destruida"", dijo.

Hejjo y sus hijos cavaron entre los escombros con palas y con las manos, ladrillo por ladrillo, para rescatar todo lo que se pudiera reutilizar. Usaron ropa rasgada para alimentar el fuego de la cocina.

Las ratas se habían colado y enjambres de mosquitos revoloteaban sobre las ruinas. Había vidrios rotos por todas partes. Montaron una tienda de campaña fortificada con láminas de metal corrugado y algunos ladrillos rescatados de su casa destruida. Una ligera llovizna mojó sus ropas mientras dormían.

Las agencias de la ONU dicen que el desempleo se ha disparado a alrededor del 80%, en comparación con casi el 50% antes de la guerra y que casi toda la población vive en la pobreza. Incluso a quienes tienen medios les resultaría casi imposible importar materiales de construcción debido a las restricciones israelíes, los combates en curso y el colapso de la ley y el orden.

El primer obstáculo para cualquier reconstrucción significativa son los escombros: montañas de ellos.

Donde antes había casas, tiendas y edificios de oficinas, ahora hay enormes montones de escombros con restos humanos, sustancias peligrosas y municiones sin explotar.

La ONU estima que la guerra ha dejado unas 40 millones de toneladas de escombros en Gaza, suficientes para llenar el Central Park de Nueva York a una profundidad de ocho metros (unos 25 pies). Podría tomar hasta 15 años y casi 650 millones de dólares limpiarlo todo, dijo.

También está la cuestión de dónde deshacerse de ellos: la ONU calcula que se necesitarían unos cinco kilómetros cuadrados (unas dos millas cuadradas) de terreno, que será difícil de conseguir en el territorio pequeño y densamente poblado.

No sólo se destruyeron viviendas, sino también infraestructura crítica.

La ONU estima que casi el 70% de las plantas de agua y saneamiento de Gaza han sido destruidas o dañadas. Eso incluye las cinco instalaciones de tratamiento de aguas residuales del territorio, además de plantas de desalinización, estaciones de bombeo de aguas residuales, pozos y embalses.

Los empleados que antes gestionaban los sistemas municipales de agua y de residuos han sido desplazados y algunos han muerto. Y la escasez de combustible ha dificultado el mantenimiento de instalaciones que siguen intactas.

La organización benéfica internacional Oxfam dijo que solicitó un permiso para traer unidades de desalinización y tuberías para reparar la infraestructura hídrica en diciembre. Israel tardó tres meses en aprobar el envío, que aún no entra en Gaza, agregó Oxfam.

La destrucción de las redes de alcantarillado ha dejado las calles inundadas de agua pútrida, lo que acelera la propagación de enfermedades.

No ha habido energía central en Gaza desde los primeros días de la guerra, cuando su única planta eléctrica se vio obligada a cerrar por falta de combustible, y más de la mitad de la red eléctrica del territorio ha sido destruida, según el Banco Mundial.

Los países árabes ricos, como Arabia Saudí y Emiratos Árabes Unidos, han dicho que están dispuestos a contribuir a la reconstrucción de Gaza sólo como parte de un acuerdo de posguerra que cree una ruta hacia un estado palestino.

Benjamin Netanyahu, el primer ministro israelí, ha descartado esa posibilidad y ha dicho que no permitirá que Hamás o incluso la Autoridad Palestina, apoyada por Occidente, gobiernen Gaza. Ha informado que Israel mantendrá un control de seguridad ilimitado y delegará los asuntos civiles a los palestinos locales. Pero hasta donde se sabe, nadie se ha ofrecido como voluntario y Hamás ha amenazado con matar a cualquiera que ayude a la ocupación.

La reconstrucción de Gaza también requeriría la importación de cantidades masivas de materiales de construcción y equipo pesado, algo que es poco probable que Israel permita mientras exista la posibilidad de que Hamás reconstruya su infraestructura bélica. En cualquier caso, Gaza sólo tiene un pequeño número de cruces con capacidad limitada.

El organismo militar israelí que coordina los asuntos civiles en Gaza dice que no restringe la entrada de suministros civiles y permite los llamados artículos de doble uso que también podrían utilizarse con fines militares. Israel autorizó la entrada de algunos materiales de construcción antes de la guerra bajo lo que se conocía como el Mecanismo de Reconstrucción de Gaza, pero estaban sujeto a fuertes restricciones y retrasos.

La coalición Shelter Cluster estima que se necesitarían 40 años para reconstruir todas las casas destruidas en Gaza bajo esas condiciones.

Por ahora, los proveedores de asistencia tienen dificultades para traer suficientes tiendas de campaña básicas debido al número limitado de camiones que entran en Gaza y a las dificultades para entregar la ayuda. Los esfuerzos para traer viviendas temporales más sólidas todavía están en las primeras etapas, y nadie ha intentado traer materiales de construcción, según Ely.

En septiembre, Shelter Cluster estimó que 900.000 personas todavía necesitaban tiendas de campaña, ropa de cama y otros artículos para prepararse para los inviernos típicamente fríos y lluviosos de la región.

Anti-Israel protesters pitch encampment outside Jewish Democrat's Ohio home,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mideast-war-gaza-hamas-anniversary-ohio-greg-landsman-protest-israel-biden-c89db986dbfdb82e22205375dbec3778,2024-10-07T16:26:29Z,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Masked anti-Israel demonstrators escalated their harassment of a Jewish congressman on the eve of Monday's anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack, pitching an encampment outside Ohio Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman 's Cincinnati residence.

Landsman said Monday that the protesters arrived outside his home early Sunday. By evening, they set up tents, cots and sleeping bags in the road and spent the night harassing him and his family members, forcing them to secure a police escort in order to enter and exit safely, the congressman said.

""On the eve of the one-year anniversary of the October 7th terror attacks, when Jews were brutally murdered and kidnapped, these people came to the home of a Jewish family at night, dressed in all black and fully masked,"" Landsman said in a statement. He said that he and his daughter would be forced to navigate the encampment in order to attend an Oct. 7 service later Monday.

The group, Midwest Direct Action 4 Pali!, shared a video of the demonstration on Instagram. The video showed masked participants in black marching down the street in front of Landsman's home. Their faces were obscured as they carried white bundles that resembled shrouded bodies and brandished banners representing the numbers in the death toll. The group remained on site Monday, Landman's office said.

""On the eve of the one year mark since the beginning of the genocide in Palestine, local activists in Cincinnati have gathered outside Congressman Greg Landsman's house to denounce his votes to conceal the death toll and continue funding mass murder in Gaza,"" the group said in its post. ""We mark in solemn vigil that we will not rest until the genocide is over and Palestine is free.""

It's not the first time Landsman and his district have been targeted since the conflict began. Just a month into the conflict, protestors placed a poster outside a building near Landsman's district office with his photo and the phrase ""This Ken supports genocide,"" alongside other inflammatory language.

In July, Landsman toured the Covedale Cemetery Complex in Cincinnati, where 176 Jewish gravestones had been toppled."
"Traumatizados y con varios frentes abiertos, los israelíes enfrentan el aniversario del 7 de octubre",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-186845afb2973da28c3c4c70cf2d6ee6,2024-10-07T14:18:08Z,"RE'IM, Israel (AP) -- Los israelíes celebraban el lunes ceremonias solemnes para conmemorar el primer aniversario del ataque más letal en la historia del país, un asalto liderado por Hamás que hizo añicos su sensación de seguridad y abrió guerras en dos frentes que no dan visos de terminar.

Por su parte, Hamás dedicó el aniversario de su ataque del 7 de octubre de 2023 lanzando un aluvión de cohetes a Tel Aviv, lo que subrayaba su resiliencia tras un año de guerra y devastación en Gaza. El grupo político y militar libanés Hezbollah, que comenzó a lanzar cohetes a Israel el 8 de octubre en apoyo de su aliado Hamás, prometió mantener los ataques pese a sus recientes pérdidas.

El inesperado ataque transfronterizo, que tomó desprevenidos a los israelíes en un importante feriado judío, remeció su fe en sus líderes y su ejército, y sus consecuencias aún continúan un año más tarde. Unos 100 rehenes capturados ese día -- de lo que se cree que un tercio ha muerto -- siguen sin regresar, y los esfuerzos de buscar un cese el fuego están paralizados.

La guerra en Gaza sigue en marcha, Israel libra una nueva guerra contra Hezbollah, que comenzó a atacar Israel el 8 de octubre, y un conflicto creciente con Irán -- que respalda tanto a Hamás como a Hezbollah -- amenaza con hundir la región en una conflagración mucho más peligrosa.

No había actos conmemorativos programados en la Franja de Gaza, donde continúan los combates, hay enormes zonas destruidas por completo y la mayor parte de la población ha sido expulsada de sus hogares.

En Líbano, mientras tanto, al menos 10 bomberos murieron en un ataque israelí, dentro de una serie de bombardeos que han matado a docenas de trabajadores de emergencias, según el Ministerio libanés de Salud. Los bomberos estaban en un edificio municipal en la localidad sureña de Baraachit que fue alcanzado cuando se preparaban para salir en una misión de rescate.

El Ejército israelí no hizo comentarios en un primer momento.

Los israelíes acudieron a ceremonias, cementerios y monumentos en todo el país en recuerdo de los cientos de víctimas, las docenas de rehenes que siguen cautivos y los soldados heridos o caídos cuando intentaban salvarlos. También había actos conmemorativos planificados en Europa y otros lugares.

Los milicianos liderados por Hamás mataron a unas 1.200 personas, en su mayoría civiles, en el ataque del 7 de octubre y secuestraron a otras 250.

Antes del amanecer, cientos de familiares de los fallecidos en el festival de música Nova, junto con el presidente de Israel, Isaac Herzog, se reunieron en el lugar donde al menos 364 asistentes murieron baleados y muchos otros fueron capturados. Al salir el sol, los organizadores reprodujeron la misma pieza de música trance que se interrumpió de pronto cuando comenzó la andanada de cohetes.

A las 6:29 de la mañana, justo cuando comenzó el ataque de Hamás, los asistentes se pusieron en pie y guardaron un momento de silencio. El llanto de una mujer rompió el silencio mientras se oían explosiones de los combates en Gaza, apenas a unos kilómetros de distancia.

""Cuando estamos aquí, estamos cerca de nuestros seres queridos, este es el momento en el que bailaban y huían"", dijo Sigal Bar-On, cuya sobrina, Yuval Bar-On, de 25 años, y su prometido, Moshe Shuva, de 34, planeaban casarse en diciembre de 2023.

""No podemos entender cómo ha pasado un año"", dijo Shimon Busika, padre de Yarden Busika, de 25 años y que fue asesinado en el festival. ""Es el lugar más natural donde estar, estar aquí para este momento de silencio"".

A las 6:31 de la mañana, cuatro proyectiles se lanzaron desde Gaza hacia las mismas poblaciones israelíes que sufrieron el duro asalto el año pasado, según el ejército israelí. La ceremonia no se vio interrumpida.

El Ejército dijo que otros cinco cohetes salieron de la ciudad sureña gazatí de Jan Yunis hacia el centro de Israel e hicieron sonar las sirenas antiaéreas en Tel Aviv. Dos mujeres sufrieron heridas leves, según personal de emergencia, y se reportaron daños menores. El Ejército dijo que había alcanzado los lugares desde donde se habían lanzado los proyectiles.

Familiares de rehenes que siguen en Gaza se congregaron por la mañana cerca de la residencia en Jerusalén del primer ministro, Benjamin Netanyahu, y se mantuvieron en pie durante dos minutos mientras sonaba una sirena, una costumbre de los días más solemnes en el calendario israelí: el Recuerdo del Holocausto y el Día de los Caídos.

""Estamos aquí para recordar (a los rehenes), que no nos hemos olvidado de ellos"", dijo Shiri Albag, cuya hija, Liri, está entre los cautivos. Albag tenía un mensaje para Netanyahu, que ""no le dejaremos descansar hasta que todos ellos estén de vuelta, hasta el último"", dijo a la multitud, que mostraba carteles con los rostros de los rehenes.

Netanyahu emitió un comunicado que rendía homenaje a los muertos o capturados y dijo que ""hace un año pasamos por una masacre terrible y nos levantamos como nación como leones"".

Las banderas en el parlamento israelí, la Knéset, ondeaban a media asta. Estaba previsto que el lunes por la tarde se emitiera una ceremonia oficial de Estado centrada en actos de valor y esperanza. La ceremonia se grabó con antelación sin público, al parecer para evitar posibles interrupciones, en la ciudad sureña de Ofakim, donde fueron asesinados unas dos docenas de israelíes.

Pero la ira contra el gobierno por no evitar el ataque y la frustración persistente porque no ha recuperado a los rehenes que quedan hizo que las familias de varios de los fallecidos y capturados organizaran un acto separado en Tel Aviv.

Estaba previsto que el evento congregara a decenas de miles de personas, pero se vio reducido de forma drástica por las restricciones a las grandes aglomeraciones debido a la amenaza de ataques de misiles de Irán y Hezbollah.

La guerra en Gaza ha matado a más de 41.000 palestinos, desplazado a la mayoría de los 2,3 millones de habitantes del territorio e iniciado una crisis humanitaria que ha llevado a un hambre generalizada.

Pero Hamás sigue controlando el territorio y sus fuerzas se han reagrupado de forma reiterada en zonas donde Israel ha realizado grandes operaciones. Tropas israelíes rodearon el domingo la localidad norteña de Jabaliya y comenzaron otra gran operación allí que según el Ejército pretende expulsar a los milicianos.

En Líbano, Hezbollah ha seguido disparando cohetes, misiles y drones a Israel incluso después de una sucesión de ataques israelíes en las últimas semanas que mataron a la mayoría de su cúpula, incluido su veterano líder Hassan Nasrallah, y castigaron amplias zonas de Líbano. Israel emprendió la semana pasada lo que por ahora es una operación terrestre limitada al otro lado de la frontera.

Al menos 1.400 libaneses, incluidos civiles, médicos y combatientes de Hezbollah, han muerto y 1,2 millones han sido expulsados de sus hogares. Israel dice que intenta expulsar al grupo armado y político de su frontera para que decenas de miles de ciudadanos israelíes puedan regresar a casa.

Israel también ha prometido responder a un ataque de misiles balísticos de Irán la semana pasada que según Teherán respondía a los asesinatos de Nasrallah, el líder de Hamás Ismail Haniyeh y uno de los generales de su Guardia Revolucionaria.

En un comunicado el lunes, Hezbollah prometió seguir luchando hasta que haya un cese el fuego en Gaza y dijo que Israel ""era y seguirá siendo una glándula mortal, agresiva, cancerosa, que debe ser eliminada, sin importar cuánto tiempo tome"".

Trump and Harris mark somber anniversary of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-oct-7-hamas-israel-78ba85f87ea89fa93c6537f77ca81b25,2024-10-07T14:07:35Z,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are marking the first anniversary of the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust as the presidential candidates approach the final weeks of the campaign during a widening conflict in the Middle East.

Trump will speak before Jewish community leaders at one of his Florida resorts in the Miami suburb of Doral. Harris will briefly speak to journalists and plant a pomegranate tree with her husband on the grounds of the Vice President's residence in honor of the 1,200 people, including 46 U.S. citizens, who were killed by Hamas-led militants in the Oct. 7 attack last year.

Harris' husband Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, will recite a prayer at an event to commemorate the anniversary with the American Jewish Committee.

Trump has blamed both Harris and President Joe Biden for the war, arguing their administration empowered Iran, and tried to take advantage of some of the divisions within the Democratic Party with progressives protesting Israel's military campaign, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians.

Some of his statements on Israel overlook his association with people who spew antisemitic rhetoric such as far-right activist Nick Fuentes and rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West.

Trump has also repeatedly said that Jewish voters who vote for Democrats ""should have their head examined"" and recently said that if he loses the presidential election to Harris on Nov. 5 ""the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that.""

In an excerpt released from an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that will air Monday night, Harris appeared to avoid answering a question about whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considered ""a real close ally,"" and said that ""The better question is: Do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? And the answer to that question is yes.""

Trump's own relations with Netanyahu have been rocky. They soured after the Israeli prime minister became one of the first world leaders to congratulate President Joe Biden for his 2020 victory, which Trump continues to deny. A few days after the Oct. 7 attack last year, Trump publicly criticized Netanyahu and said he ""was not prepared"" for the deadly incursion from Gaza on Oct. 7. Trump said Netanyahu had let the U.S. down just before the U.S. killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in 2020.

Since then, the two have met to talk about a cease-fire deal for Gaza.

Halie Soifer, head of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said the conflict in the Middle East -- including fighting with Hezbollah and Iran -- has left Jewish voters ""with a sense of vulnerability and concern for Israel's future."" Soifer previously advised Harris on national security issues.

But she says Harris has been consistent with the message of commitment to Israel's defense for the last year, and said Harris and Biden have directed U.S. forces to shoot down Iranian missiles targeting Israel on multiple occasions."
Countries around the world commemorate the anniversary of Hamas attack on Israel,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hamas-attack-israel-anniversary-protests-b8f7428b707f2cf4300405feca0b570e,2024-10-07T11:25:07Z,"BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- Vigils, commemorations and acts of remembrance were planned across the world on Monday to mark one year since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel as world leaders called for an end to antisemitism and the release of Israeli hostages.

Last year's surprise cross-border attack, which killed about 1,200 people, caught Israel unprepared on a major Jewish holiday, shattering Israelis' sense of security and putting many countries, already on edge over Russia's war in Ukraine, facing the prospect of another major conflict in the Middle East.

The nations of Europe, home to many Jewish and Muslim communities, have sought to tamp down both antisemitic and anti-Muslim sentiment in the wake of the Hamas attack and Israel's subsequent war against the militants in Gaza, which has killed over 41,000 people and displaced around 1.9 million in the embattled coastal territory.

The German chancellery in Berlin was adorned with a yellow ribbon commemorating the Israeli hostages taken by Hamas, around 100 of which remain in captivity, with many of them feared dead.

The names of the people killed and kidnapped in the attack on Israel were read out in front of the Brandenburg Gate starting at 5:29 a.m. local time in Germany, when Hamas' onslaught began a year ago.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a video message on Sunday that ""with its abhorrent attack on Israel, Hamas at the same time caused a catastrophe for the Palestinian people."" He stressed the need for a cease-fire in Gaza and international efforts to avoid an even wider Mideast conflagration.

""We will never accept antisemitism and blind hatred of Israel,"" he said. ""The full solidarity of our state goes to Jews here in Germany -- and the solidarity of all decent people in our country.""

An inter-religious service at a Berlin church, addressed by German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, was planned for later Monday. Scholz was to attend a memorial event at a synagogue in Hamburg.

Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, who has voiced strong support for Israel, commemorated the Oct. 7 anniversary by visiting the main synagogue in Rome and reaffirming Israel's right to defend itself.

She denounced the ""latent and rampant antisemitism"" she said has arisen since the Hamas attack, citing in particular pro-Palestinian protests in Italy this past weekend, some of which turned violent.

While asserting Israel's lights to live safely within its borders, Meloni insisted it respect international law and lamented the devastation unleashed by Israeli forces in Gaza. She said Palestinians in Gaza had been ""victims twice over: first of Hamas' cynicism, which uses them as human shields, and then of Israeli military operations.""

As the current president of the Group of Seven, Italy will continue to work for an immediate cease-fire, ""the release of Israeli hostages and the stabilization of the Israeli-Lebanese border through the full implementation of U.N. resolutions,"" she said.

French President Emmanuel Macron took to social media Monday to mark the first anniversary of the Hamas attacks. ""The pain remains, as vivid as it was a year ago. The pain of the Israeli people. Ours. The pain of wounded humanity,"" he said.

""We do not forget the victims, the hostages, or the families with broken hearts from absence or waiting. I send them our fraternal thoughts,"" Macron wrote on X.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot attended a memorial service at the site of the Nova music festival, in Re'im, Israel, where hundreds were killed. Speaking to the families of victims, he expressed France's support in the face of ""the worst antisemitic massacre in our history since the Holocaust.""

""The joyful dawn of what should have been a day of celebration was suddenly torn apart by unspeakable horror,"" he said. ""France mourns alongside Israel for our 48 compatriot victims of barbarism.""

Barrot, who will meet with his counterpart Israel Katz later Monday, said Macron will receive in Paris some of the family members of hostages held by Hamas.

Commemorations were planned in France, Belgium, Spain, Austria and Hungary, while leading European politicians were also expected to take part in remembering those killed and kidnapped.

The European Parliament is holding a plenary session in Strasbourg, France, marking the anniversary, with the parliament's president, Roberta Metsola, to address lawmakers. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is also expected to attend a ceremony at a synagogue in Brussels.

In Australia, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese attended a vigil in Melbourne, where he walked with members of the Jewish community and lawmakers from across party lines. Thousands attended the vigil.

Earlier in the morning, Albanese said the day carried ""terrible pain,"" and that his government ""unequivocally"" condemned Hamas' actions.

""Since the atrocities of October 7, Jewish Australians have felt the cold shadows of antisemitism reaching into the present day, and as a nation we say never again,"" he said. ""We unequivocally condemn all prejudice and hatred.""

In Sydney, opposition leader Peter Dutton -- who has vehemently decried Australia's acceptance of Palestinian refugees -- arrived to cheers at a vigil also attended by thousands at which he reiterated his party's support for Israel.

Dutton's remarks to the crowd echoed those he made earlier Monday, in which he said the Oct. 7 attack ""awoke and exposed an antisemitic rot afflicting Western democracies.""

""Israel has every right to defend its territory and its people from existential threats,"" he said.

Hundreds of people gathered amid a heavy police presence Monday night at Sydney town hall for a vigil for Palestinian lives lost in the conflict. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters had rallied across Australia's cities on Sunday.

Associated Press writers Geir Moulson in Berlin, Diane Jeantet in Paris, Nicole Winfield in Rome and Charlotte Graham-McLay in Wellington, New Zealand, contributed to this report."
Middle East latest: Palestinian militants in Gaza fire 4 rockets into Israel as mourners mark Oct 7,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-7-october-2024-d3d272d83e70d420ba547dbd7e09ef52,2024-10-07T05:58:18Z,"Palestinian militants in Gaza fired four rockets into Israel on Monday as mourners marked the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack, without disrupting a nearby ceremony.

Hamas also said it attacked Israeli forces in different parts of Gaza.

The Israeli military said three rockets were intercepted and a fourth fell in an open area. There were no reports of casualties or damage.

The military said it launched a wave of artillery and airstrikes overnight and into Monday to thwart what it said was an imminent attack. It said it targeted Hamas launch posts and underground militant infrastructure.

The fighting on the anniversary underscored the militants' resilience in the face of a devastating Israeli offensive that has killed around 42,000 Palestinians, according to local medical officials. It has also destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population.

Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel's security fence and stormed into nearby army bases and farming communities in a surprise attack one year ago, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding around 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead.

Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. It has also vowed to strike Iran in response to a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week.

Here is The Latest:

RE'IM, Israel -- Hundreds of families and friends of people killed at the Nova music festival gathered Monday at the site of the attack, where nearly 400 were gunned down during Hamas' Oct. 7 assault.

Families gathered around photos of their loved ones, which were arranged in a semicircle around what was the DJ stage. Many lit candles and added mementos or photos, crying and embracing. Overhead, army helicopters circled and constant booms echoed across the area, causing many to flinch.

""We can't understand how a year has passed,"" said Shimon Busika, whose son, Yarden, 25, was killed at the festival. ""It's the most natural place to be, to be here for this moment of silence,"" he said.

Busika said it took them a long time, piecing together testimony from other survivors, to understand what happened in Yarden's last moments. They now know he was killed around 9:20 near a yellow container at the festival where many others were killed, and they will hold a second minute of silence there at the moment he was killed.

The last sounds of the trance track that was playing at the Nova site on Oct. 7 one year ago stopped abruptly, as hundreds of family members and friends of the more than 300 victims stood in a moment of silence. One woman's piercing wail broke the silence as booms echoed from the fighting in Gaza, just a few kilometers (miles) away.

JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Twenty Indonesian nationals and a Lebanese evacuated from Lebanon arrived in Jakarta on a commercial flight early Monday and will likely be followed by 20 more in the afternoon, officials said.

President Joko Widodo has called to prioritize the evacuation of Indonesians in Lebanon as hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah escalate and fears of a wider regional war in the Middle East grow.

""I have directed the foreign affairs minister to take immediate action to ensure the safety and protection of our citizens and expedite their evacuation,"" Widodo said last week.

Indonesia's Embassy in Beirut had prepared evacuation procedures for citizens as part of its contingency planning since August. The Embassy evacuated 25 Indonesian citizens who returned safely to Indonesia last month, said Judha Nugraha, Director of Indonesian Citizen Protection at the Foreign Affairs Ministry.

There are 116 registered Indonesian citizens in Lebanon, most of them students, migrant workers and people married to Lebanese nationals. Many of them have chosen to remain there for various reasons, Nugraha said.

CANBERRA, Australia -- Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement Monday that the day carried ""terrible pain"" and his government ""unequivocally"" condemned Hamas' attack on Israel a year ago.

Hamas militants stormed from the blockaded Gaza Strip into nearby Israeli towns on Oct. 7 a year ago, killing dozens and abducting others in an unprecedented surprise attack.

Albanese said that since the attack, Jewish Australians have ""felt the cold shadows of antisemitism reaching into the present day -- and as a nation we say never again.""

""We unequivocally condemn all prejudice and hatred. There is no place in Australia for discrimination against people of any faith,"" Albanese said.

He added that ""every innocent life matters"" and the number of civilians killed in the conflict was ""a devastating tragedy.""

""Today we reflect on the truth of our shared humanity, of the hope that peace is possible, and the belief that it belongs to all people,"" Albanese said.

BEIRUT -- A new round of airstrikes hit Beirut suburbs late Sunday as Israel intensified its bombardment of northern Gaza and southern Lebanon. Palestinian officials said a strike on a mosque in Gaza killed at least 19 people.

Rocket sirens and blasts were heard in Haifa in northern Israel late Sunday, and Hezbollah claimed the attack. Israel's military said at least five projectiles were identified coming from Lebanon and ""fallen projectiles"" were found in the area. The military showed what appeared to be rubble along a street. The Magen David Adom ambulance service said it was treating a teen with shrapnel injuries to the head and a man who fell from a window due to a blast.

A year after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, Israel has opened a new front in Lebanon against Hezbollah, which has traded fire with Israel along the border since the war in Gaza began. Israel also has vowed to strike Iran after a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week."
Takeaways from AP's report on the Gaza war's destruction,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-anniversary-destruction-takeaways-a1ae8d316633fd7d1f3fe24cc527a2ee,2024-10-07T05:06:25Z,"Israel's yearlong offensive against Hamas, launched in response to the militant group's Oct. 7 attack into Israel, has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused staggering destruction across the Gaza Strip that could take decades to rebuild.

Hundreds of thousands of people are crammed into squalid tent camps with no homes to return to, even if there is a cease-fire. The mountains of rubble alone, laced with human remains, unexploded ordnance and other hazardous materials, could take years to remove.

Israel blames the destruction on Hamas. Its Oct. 7 attack on Israel -- in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage -- ignited the war. Hamas embedded much of its military infrastructure, including hundreds of kilometers (miles) of tunnels, in densely populated areas where some of the heaviest battles were fought.

The fighting left roughly a quarter of all structures in Gaza destroyed or severely damaged, according to a U.N. assessment in September based on satellite footage. It said around 66% of structures, including more than 227,000 housing units, had sustained at least some damage.

Here's a look at the main takeaways from an AP interactive report looking at the scope of the devastation.

Israel's offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza and wounded more than 96,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It does not say how many were fighters, but says women and children make up more than half of those killed.

It also says the toll may be higher as thousands of bodies remain buried under rubble or in areas that are inaccessible to medical teams.

Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, but has not provided evidence. Over 720 Israeli soldiers have been killed since Oct. 7, including in the attack itself, the war in Gaza and the conflict with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.

The U.N. estimates that around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times. Israeli evacuation orders now cover around 90% of the territory.

Schools have been turned into shelters, and hundreds of thousands have crammed into sprawling tent camps along the coast.

The Shelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council, says it has struggled to bring in basic supplies because of Israeli restrictions, the ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order in Gaza.

It estimates that some 900.000 people are in need of tents and bedding.

The war has gutted Gaza's infrastructure, which was already in bad shape after a 16-year blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt when Hamas seized power in 2007.

The U.N. says the war has damaged or destroyed over 92% of Gaza's main roads and more than 84% of its health facilities.

It estimates nearly 70% of Gaza's water and sanitation plants have been destroyed or damaged. That includes all five of the territory's wastewater treatment facilities, plus desalination plants, sewage pumping stations, wells and reservoirs.

The breakdown of water infrastructure has flooded the streets with sewage in many areas, contributing to the spread of disease among a population weakened by widespread hunger.

Where houses, shops and office buildings once stood, there are now giant drifts of rubble laced with human remains, hazardous substances and unexploded munitions.

The U.N. estimates the war has left some 40 million tons of debris and rubble in Gaza, enough to fill New York's Central Park to a depth of eight meters (about 25 feet). It could take up to 15 years and nearly $650 million to clear it all away, it said.

The World Bank estimated $18.5 billion in damage in Gaza from just the first three months of the war, before several major Israeli operations. That figure is nearly equivalent to the combined economic output of the West Bank and Gaza in 2022.

Wealthy Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have said they are only willing to contribute to Gaza's reconstruction as part of a postwar settlement that creates a path to a Palestinian state.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled that out, saying he won't allow Hamas or even the Western-backed Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza. He has said Israel will maintain open-ended security control and delegate civilian affairs to local Palestinians. But none are known to have volunteered, and Hamas has threatened to kill anyone who aids the occupation.

Israel allowed construction materials in before the war, but the system was subject to heavy restrictions and delays.

The Shelter Cluster estimates that it would take 40 years to rebuild all of Gaza's destroyed homes under that system."
Mideast violence is spiraling a year since the Gaza war began,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-hezbollah-lebanon-anniversary-73916b17394f093f01ca5554cf26b528,2024-10-07T05:00:00Z,"JERUSALEM (AP) -- A year after Hamas' fateful attack on southern Israel, the Middle East is embroiled in a war that shows no signs of ending and seems to be getting worse.

Israel's retaliatory offensive was initially centered on the Gaza Strip. But the focus has shifted in recent weeks to Lebanon, where airstrikes have given way to a fast-expanding ground incursion against Hezbollah militants who have fired rockets into Israel since the Gaza war began.

Next in Israel's crosshairs is archenemy Iran, which supports Hamas, Hezbollah and other anti-Israel militants in the region. After withstanding a massive barrage of missiles from Iran last week, Israel has promised to respond. The escalating conflict risks drawing deeper involvement by the U.S., as well as Iran-backed militants in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

When Hamas launched its attack on Oct. 7, 2023, it called on the Arab world to join it in a concerted campaign against Israel. While the fighting has indeed spread, Hamas and its allies have paid a heavy price.

The group's army has been decimated, its Gaza stronghold has been reduced to a cauldron of death, destruction and misery and the top leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah have been killed in audacious attacks.

Although Israel appears to be gaining the edge militarily, the war has been problematic for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, too.

Dozens of Israeli hostages are languishing in Hamas captivity, and a year after Netanyahu pledged to crush the group in ""total victory,"" remnants of the militant group are still battling in pockets of Gaza. The offensive in Lebanon, initially described as ""limited,"" grows by the day. A full-on collision with Iran is a possibility.

At home, Netanyahu faces mass protests over his inability to bring home the hostages, and to many, he will be remembered as the man who led Israel into its darkest moment. Relations with the U.S. and other allies are strained. The economy is deteriorating.

Here are five takeaways from a yearlong war that has upended longstanding assumptions and turned conventional wisdom on its head.

A long list of previously unthinkable events have occurred in mind-boggling fashion.

The Oct. 7 attack was the bloodiest in Israel's history. Young partygoers were gunned down. Cowering families were killed in their homes. In all, about 1,200 people died and 250 were taken hostage. Some Israelis were raped or sexually assaulted.

The ensuing war in Gaza has been the longest, deadliest and most destructive in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Gaza health authorities say nearly 42,000 people have been killed -- roughly 2% of the territory's entire population. Although they do not give a breakdown between civilians and combatants, more than half of the dead have been women and children. Numerous top Hamas officials have been killed.

The damage and displacement in Gaza have reached unseen levels. Hospitals, schools and mosques - once thought to be insulated from violence - have repeatedly been targeted by Israel or caught in the crossfire. Scores of journalists and health workers have been killed, many of them while working in the line of duty.

Months of simmering tensions along Israel's northern border recently boiled over into war.

A growing list of Hezbollah officials - including the group's longtime leader -- have been killed by Israel. Hundreds of Hezbollah members were killed or maimed in explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies. Israel's ground offensive is its first in Lebanon since a monthlong war in 2006.

Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has displaced tens of thousands of Israelis and over 1 million Lebanese. Israel promises to keep pounding Hezbollah until its residents can return to homes near the Lebanese border; Hezbollah says it will keep firing rockets into Israel until there is a cease-fire in Gaza.

When the war erupted, the days appeared to be numbered for both Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.

Netanyahu's public standing plummeted as he faced calls to step aside. Sinwar fled into Gaza's labyrinth of tunnels as Israel declared him a ""dead man walking.""

Yet both men -- facing war crimes charges in international courts -- remain firmly in charge, and neither appears to be in a rush for a cease-fire.

The end of the war could mean the end of Netanyahu's government, which is dominated by hard-line partners opposed to a cease-fire. That would mean early elections, potentially pushing him into the opposition while he stands trial on corruption charges. Also looming is the prospect of an unflattering official inquiry into his government's failures before and during the Oct. 7 attack.

Fearing that, his coalition has hung together even through mass protests and repeated disagreements with top security officials pushing for a deal to bring home the hostages. After a brief period of post-Oct. 7 national unity, Israel has returned to its divided self -- torn between Netanyahu's religious, conservative, nationalist right-wing base and his more secular, middle-class opposition.

Sinwar, believed to be hiding in Gaza's tunnels, continues to drive a hard bargain in hopes of declaring some sort of victory. His demands for a full Israeli withdrawal, a lasting cease-fire and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for scores of hostages have been rejected by Israel -- even as much of the international community has embraced them.

With cease-fire efforts deadlocked and Netanyahu's far-right coalition firmly intact, the war could go on for some time. An estimated 1.9 million Palestinians remain displaced in Gaza while an estimated 68 hostages remain captive in Gaza, in addition to the bodies of 33 others held by Hamas.

Early in the war, Netanyahu promised to destroy Hamas' military and governing abilities.

Those goals have been achieved in many ways. Israel says it has dismantled Hamas' military structure, and its rocket barrages have been diminished to a trickle. With Israeli troops stationed indefinitely in Gaza, it is difficult to see how the group could return to governing the territory or pose a serious threat.

But in other ways, total victory is impossible. Despite Israel's overwhelming force, Hamas units have repeatedly regrouped to stage guerrilla-style ambushes from areas where Israel has withdrawn.

Across the Middle East, bitter enemies are witnessing the limits of force and deterrence.

Israel's deepening invasion of Lebanon and repeated strikes on Hezbollah have failed to halt the rockets and missiles. Missile and drone attacks by Iran and its allies have only deepened Israel's resolve. Israel is vowing to strike Iran hard after its latest missile barrage, raising the likelihood of a broader, regionwide war.

Without diplomatic solutions, the fighting is likely to persist.

Israel is still deeply traumatized as people try to come to terms with the worst day in its history.

The Oct. 7 killings and kidnappings had an outsized impact on a tiny country founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Israelis' sense of security was shattered, and their faith in the military was tested like never before.

Photos of Israeli hostages are everywhere, and mass demonstrations are held each week calling on the government to reach a deal to bring them home. The prospect of ongoing war looms over families and workplaces as reserve soldiers brace for repeated tours of duty.

The trauma is far more acute in Gaza - where an estimated 90% of the population remains displaced, many of them living in squalid tent camps.

The scenes have drawn comparisons to what the Palestinian call the Nakba, or catastrophe - the mass displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians during the war surrounding Israel's creation in 1948. The Palestinians now find themselves looking at a tragedy of even greater scale.

It remains unclear when displaced Palestinians in Gaza will be able to return home and whether there will be anything to return to. The territory has suffered immense destruction and is littered with unexploded bombs. Children are missing a second consecutive school year, virtually every family has lost a relative in the fighting and basic needs like food and health care are lacking.

After a hellish year, the Palestinians of Gaza have no clear path forward, and it could take generations to recover.

The international community's response to this bloodiest of wars has been tepid and ineffective.

Repeated cease-fire calls have been ignored, and a U.S.-led plan to reinstate the Palestinian Authority in postwar Gaza has been rejected by Israel. It remains unclear who will run the territory in the future or who will pay for a cleanup and reconstruction effort that could take decades.

One thing that seems clear is that old formulas will no longer work. The international community's preferred peace formula - the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel - seems hopelessly unrealistic.

Israel's hard-line government opposes Palestinian statehood, says its troops will remain in Gaza for years to come and has further cemented its undeclared annexation of the West Bank. The internationally recognized Palestinian Authority has been pushed to the brink of irrelevance.

For decades, the United States has acted as the key mediator and power broker in the region - calling for a two-state solution but showing little political will to promote that vision. Instead, it has often turned to conflict management, preventing any side from doing anything too extreme to destabilize the region.

This approach went up in smoke on Oct. 7. Since then, the U.S. has responded with a muddled message of criticizing Israel's wartime tactics as too harsh while arming the Israeli military and protecting Israel against diplomatic criticism. The result: The Biden administration has managed to antagonize both Israel and the Arab world while cease-fire efforts repeatedly sputter.

This approach has also alienated the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, complicating Kamala Harris' presidential aspirations. The warring sides appear to have given up on the Biden administration and are waiting for the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election before deciding their next moves.

Whoever wins the race will almost certainly have to find a new formula and recalibrate decades of American policy if they want to end the war."
US spends a record $17.9 billion on military aid to Israel since last Oct. 7,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-us-military-spending-8e6e5033f7a1334bf6e35f86e7040e14,2024-10-07T04:14:59Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States has spent a record of at least $17.9 billion on military aid to Israel since the war in Gaza began and led to escalating conflict around the Middle East, according to a report for Brown University's Costs of War project, released on the anniversary of Hamas' attacks on Israel.

An additional $4.86 billion has gone into stepped-up U.S. military operations in the region since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, researchers said in findings first provided to The Associated Press. That includes the costs of a Navy-led campaign to quell strikes on commercial shipping by Yemen's Houthis, who are carrying them out in solidarity with the fellow Iranian-backed group Hamas.

The report -- completed before Israel opened a second front, this one against Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, in late September -- is one of the first tallies of estimated U.S. costs as the Biden administration backs Israel in its conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon and seeks to contain hostilities by Iran-allied armed groups in the region.

The financial toll is on top of the cost in human lives: Hamas militants killed more than 1,200 people in Israel a year ago and took others hostage. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed nearly 42,000 people in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count.

At least 1,400 people in Lebanon, including Hezbollah fighters and civilians, have been killed since Israel greatly expanded its strikes in that country in late September.

The financial costs were calculated by Linda J. Bilmes, a professor at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, who has assessed the full costs of U.S. wars since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and fellow researchers William D. Hartung and Stephen Semler.

Here's a look at where some of the U.S. taxpayer money went:

Israel -- a protege of the United States since its 1948 founding -- is the biggest recipient of U.S. military aid in history, getting $251.2 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1959, the report says.

Even so, the $17.9 billion spent since Oct. 7, 2023, in inflation-adjusted dollars, is by far the most military aid sent to Israel in one year. The U.S. committed to providing billions in military assistance to Israel and Egypt each year when they signed their 1979 U.S.-brokered peace treaty, and an agreement since the Obama administration set the annual amount for Israel at $3.8 billion through 2028.

The U.S. aid since the Gaza war started includes military financing, arms sales, at least $4.4 billion in drawdowns from U.S. stockpiles and hand-me-downs of used equipment.

Much of the U.S. weapons delivered in the year were munitions, from artillery shells to 2,000-pound bunker-busters and precision-guided bombs.

Expenditures range from $4 billion to replenish Israel's Iron Dome and David's Sling missile defense systems to cash for rifles and jet fuel, the study says.

Unlike the United States' publicly documented military aid to Ukraine, it was impossible to get the full details of what the U.S. has shipped Israel since last Oct. 7, so the $17.9 billion for the year is a partial figure, the researchers said.

They cited Biden administration ""efforts to hide the full amounts of aid and types of systems through bureaucratic maneuvering.""

Funding for the key U.S. ally during a war that has exacted a heavy toll on civilians has divided Americans during the presidential campaign. But support for Israel has long carried weight in U.S. politics, and Biden said Friday that ""no administration has helped Israel more than I have.""

The Biden administration has bolstered its military strength in the region since the war in Gaza started, aiming to deter and respond to any attacks on Israeli and American forces.

Those additional operations cost at least $4.86 billion, the report said, not including beefed-up U.S. military aid to Egypt and other partners in the region.

The U.S. had 34,000 forces in the Middle East the day that Hamas broke through Israeli barricades around Gaza to attack. That number rose to about 50,000 in August when two aircraft carriers were in the region, aiming to discourage retaliation after a strike attributed to Israel killed Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran. The total is now around 43,000.

The number of U.S. vessels and aircraft deployed -- aircraft carrier strike groups, an amphibious ready group, fighter squadrons, and air defense batteries -- in the Mediterranean, Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has varied during the year.

The Pentagon has said another aircraft carrier strike group is headed to Europe very soon and that could increase the troop total again if two carriers are again in the region at the same time.

The U.S. military has deployed since the start of the war to try to counter escalated strikes by the Houthis, an armed faction that controls Yemen's capital and northern areas, and has been firing on merchant ships in the Red Sea in solidarity with Gaza. The researchers called the $4.86 billion cost to the U.S. an ""unexpectedly complicated and asymmetrically expensive challenge.""

Houthis have kept launching attacks on ships traversing the critical trade route, drawing U.S. strikes on launch sites and other targets. The campaign has become the most intense running sea battle the Navy has faced since World War II.

""The U.S. has deployed multiple aircraft carriers, destroyers, cruisers and expensive multimillion-dollar missiles against cheap Iranian-made Houthi drones that cost $2,000,"" the authors said.

Just Friday, the U.S. military struck more than a dozen Houthi targets in Yemen, going after weapons systems, bases and other equipment, officials said.

The researchers' calculations included at least $55 million in additional combat pay from the intensified operations in the region."
Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli crowds rally across the world on the eve of Oct. 7 anniversary,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mideast-israel-gaza-war-protests-memorial-hostages-d1e8c03e14c28c64afa3fffe086c3e8f,2024-10-06T14:09:42Z,"PARIS (AP) -- Crowds were participating in pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protests and memorial events across the world on Sunday on the eve of the first anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel.

Sunday's events follow massive rallies that took place Saturday in several European cities, including London, Berlin, Paris and Rome. Other events are scheduled through the week, with an expected peak on Monday, the date of the anniversary.

In Australia, thousands of people on Sunday protested in support of Palestinians and Lebanon in various cities, while a pro-Israeli rally also took place in Melbourne.

Samantha Gazal, who came to the rally in Sydnay, said she was there ""because I can't believe our government is giving impunity to a violent extremist nation and has done nothing. ... We're watching the violence play out on livestream, and they're doing nothing.""

In Melbourne, supporters of Israel held up posters showing Israeli hostages who are still missing.

""We feel like we didn't do anything to deserve this,"" said Jeremy Wenstein, one of the participants. ""We're just supporting our brothers and sisters who are fighting a war that they didn't invite.""

At a rally in Berlin, near the Brandenburg Gate, hundreds of pro-Israeli demonstrators set off up the famed Unter den Linden behind a banner that read ""Against all antisemitism,"" accompanied by a police escort.

With many Israel flags waving over head, some Jewish leaders led a song about ""shalom"" -- peace -- while marchers chanted ""Free Gaza from Hamas!"" and ""Bring them home,"" referring to hostages still held in the Gaza strip.

Some in the crowd held up photos of hostages still held by Hamas. Photos of several women featured the word ""Kidnapped"" in German.

Memorial events organized by the Jewish community for those killed in the Oct. 7 attack and prayers for those still in captivity were also to be held in Paris and London on Sunday afternoon.

Security forces in several countries warned of heightened levels of alert in major cities, amid concerns that the escalating conflict in the Middle East could inspire new terror attacks in Europe or that some of the protests could turn violent.

On Sunday, Italy's Premier Giorgia Meloni expressed her ""full solidarity"" with police, the day after after security forces used tear gas and water cannons to disperse violent demonstrators in Rome.

Meloni firmly condemned clashes between a few pro-Palestinian demonstrators and law enforcement officers, saying it was ""intolerable that dozens of officers are injured during a demonstration.""

Thirty police officers and four protesters were hurt in clashes at the pro-Palestinian march in Rome Saturday, local media said. In Rome's central Piazzale Ostiense, hooded protesters threw stones, bottles and even a street sign at the police, who responded using water cannons and tear gas.

Pope Francis, celebrating his Sunday Angelus prayer from the Vatican, issued a new appeal for peace ""on every front."" Francis also urged his audience not to forget the many hostages still held in Gaza, asking for ""their immediate liberation.""

The pope called for a day of prayer and fasting on Monday, the first anniversary of the attack.

On Oct. 7 last year, Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel, killing 1,200 Israelis, taking 250 people hostage and setting off a war with Israel that has shattered much of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip.

More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since then in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians. It says more than half were women and children.

Nearly 100 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, with fewer than 70 believed to be alive. Israelis have experienced attacks -- missiles from Iran and Hezbollah, explosive drones from Yemen, fatal shootings and stabbings -- as the region braces for further escalation.

In late September, Israel shifted some of its focus to Hezbollah, which holds much of the power in parts of southern Lebanon and some other areas of the country, attacking the militants with exploding pagers, airstrikes and, eventually, incursions into Lebanon."
Middle East latest: Israel strikes Gaza and southern Beirut as attacks intensify,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-6-october-2024-19e665a4546e92d006d63a3073219513,2024-10-06T09:51:06Z,"An Israeli airstrike hit a mosque in central Gaza and Palestinian officials said at least 19 people were killed early Sunday. Israeli planes also lit up the skyline across the southern suburbs of Beirut, striking what the military said were Hezbollah targets.

The strike in Gaza hit a mosque where displaced people were sheltering near the main hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah. Another four people were killed in a strike on a school sheltering displaced people near the town.

The Israeli military said both strikes targeted militants, without providing evidence.

An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital morgue. Hospital records showed that the dead from the strike on the mosque were all men, while another man was wounded.

In Beirut, the strikes reportedly targeted a building near a road leading to Lebanon's only international airport and another formerly used by the Hezbollah-run broadcaster Al-Manar.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas' cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel declared war on the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. As the Israel-Hamas war reaches the one-year mark, nearly 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials.

Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in the latest conflict, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.

Here is the latest:

BEIRUT -- The southern suburbs of Beirut were hit by more than 30 strikes overnight, the heaviest bombardment since Sept. 23, when Israel began a significant escalation in its air campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported Sunday.

The targets included a gas station on the main highway leading to the Beirut airport and a warehouse for medical supplies, the agency said.

Some of the overnight strikes set off a long series of explosions, suggesting that ammunition stores may have been hit.

PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron called for ""a halt to arms exports for use in Gaza,"" saying it's urgent to avoid escalating tensions in the region, his office said.

Macron drew strong criticism from Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by saying ""the priority is ... that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza."" He made the comments in an interview with France Inter radio, which was recorded on Tuesday and aired Saturday.

France doesn't deliver any weapons to Israel, Macron said.

Netanyahu released a video statement in which he called out the French president by name and referred to such calls as a ""disgrace.""

In a statement, Macron's office said ""France is Israel's unfailing friend. Mr. Netanyahu's words are excessive and irrelevant to the friendship between France and Israel.""

""We must return to diplomatic solutions,"" it added.

The statement also said that Macron had demonstrated his commitment to Israel's security when France mobilized its military resources in response to the Iranian attack. French authorities did not provided details about France's role.

Macron has called for an immediate cease-fire in both Gaza and Lebanon.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An apparent Israeli airstrike early Sunday killed at least 18 people in central Gaza, Palestinian medical officials said.

The strike hit a mosque sheltering displaced people near the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah, the hospital said in a statement.

An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital morgue. Hospital records showed that the dead were all men. Another two men were critically wounded, the hospital said.

The Israeli military did not immediately comment about the strike on the mosque.

The latest strikes add to the mounting Palestinian death toll in Gaza, which is now nearing 42,000 according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths, but many of the dead were women and children.

BEIRUT -- Powerful new explosions rocked Beirut's southern suburbs late Saturday as Israel expanded its bombardment in Lebanon, also striking a Palestinian refugee camp deep in the north for the first time as it targeted both Hezbollah and Hamas fighters.

Thousands of people in Lebanon, including Palestinian refugees, continued to flee the widening conflict in the region, while rallies were held around the world marking the approaching anniversary of the start of the war in Gaza.

The strong explosions began near midnight after Israel's military urged residents to evacuate areas in Beirut's Haret Hreik and Choueifat neighborhoods. AP video showed the blasts illuminating the densely populated southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. They followed a day of sporadic strikes and the nearly continuous buzz of reconnaissance drones.

Israel's military confirmed it was striking targets near Beirut and said about 30 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory."
A year of fleeing across Gaza,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/a-year-of-fleeing-across-gaza-000001925701d383a5925f8f807f0000,2024-10-06T08:00:35Z,"Ne'man Abu Jarad sat on a tarp on the ground. Around him, canvas sheets hung from cords, forming the walls of his tent. For the past year, Ne'man; his wife, Majida; and their six daughters have trekked the length of the Gaza Strip, trying to survive as Israeli forces wreaked destruction around them.

It's a far cry from their house in northern Gaza -- a place of comforting routine, of love, affection and safety. A place where loved ones gathered around the kitchen table or on the roof on summer evenings amid the scent of roses and jasmine flowers.

""Your house is your homeland. Everything good in our life was the home,"" Ne'man said. ""Everything in it, whether physical or intangible -- family, neighbors, my siblings who were all around me.

They did exactly as the Israelis ordered in the devastating weeks and months of war that followed. They obeyed evacuation calls. They moved where the military told them to move. Seven times they fled, and each time, their lives became more unrecognizable to them, crowding with strangers in a school classroom, searching for water in a vast tent camp or sleeping on the street.

The Associated Press traced the family's journey as they were driven from their home. Israel's campaign has displaced nearly the entire population of Gaza - 1.9 million of its 2.3 million Palestinians -- and killed more than 41,600 people. Like the Abu Jarads, most families have been uprooted multiple times.

For this family, the journey has taken them from a comfortable middle-class life to ruin.

Living at the northernmost end of Gaza, most days before the war in Beit Hanoun were simple. Ne'man headed out each morning to work as a taxi driver. Majida got their daughters off to school. Their youngest, Lana, had started first grade. Hoda, the 18-year-old, was in her first year at university. The eldest, Balsam, just had her first baby.

Majida spent much of her day doing housework -- her face lights up when she talks about her kitchen, the center of family life.

Ne'man had planted the garden with a grapevine and covered the roof with potted flowers. Watering them in the evenings was a soothing ritual. Then, the family and neighbors would sit on the front stoop or the roof to chat.

""The area would always smell nice,"" he said. ""People would say we have perfume because of how beautiful the flowers are.""

On the morning of Oct. 7, the family heard Hamas rockets firing and news of the militants' attack into southern Israel, in which some 1,200 people were killed and 250 kidnapped. The Abu Jarads knew that the Israeli response would be swift and that their house, only about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from the border fence with Israel, would be on the front line.

By 9 a.m., Ne'man and Majida, their six daughters, and Ne'man's sister packed up what they could and fled, as the Israeli military issued one of its first evacuation orders.

""It makes no sense to be stubborn and stay,"" Majida said. ""It is not about one person. I am part of a family and have girls.""

Like many, the family tried, at first, to stay close to home. They went to stay with Majida's parents, nearby in the town of Beit Lahiya.

""The place was very comfortable, to be honest. I felt like I was at home,"" Majida said. ""But we were living in fear and terror.""

Already, Beit Lahiya was being heavily bombarded. Over the six days they were there, at least nine Israeli strikes hit the town, killing dozens, according to the conflict monitor Airwars. Entire families were killed or wounded under the rubble of their homes.

As the explosions got closer, shrapnel pierced water tanks at Majida's parents' home. Windows shattered as the family huddled inside.

The building and its grounds were packed with thousands of people. All around northern Gaza, families took refuge in hospitals, hoping they'd be safe.

The family found a small space on the floor, barely enough room to spread their blanket amid the frantic medical staff struggling with the wounded.

It was a black night and there were strikes, Majida remembers.

The day after they arrived, a strike smashed into a house a few hundred meters away, killing a prominent doctor and some two dozen members of his family, many of them children.

The Israeli military ordered all civilians to leave northern Gaza, setting in motion a wave of hundreds of thousands of people heading south across Wadi Gaza, the stream and wetlands that divide the north from the rest of the strip.

The family joined the exodus.

The family walked 10 kilometers (6 miles) until they reached the U.N.-run Girls' Preparatory School in the Nuseirat refugee camp.

Every classroom and corridor was packed with families from the north. Majida, the daughters and Ne'man's sister found a tiny space in a classroom already housing more than 100 women and children. For privacy in the cramped conditions, Ne'man moved in with the men in tents outside, in the schoolyard.

This was their home for more than 10 weeks. Majida and the girls slept curled up on the floor, without enough space even to extend their legs. As winter set in, there weren't enough blankets.

The bathrooms were the worst part, Majida said. Only a few toilets served thousands of people. Getting a shower was a miracle, she said. People went weeks unable to bathe. Skin diseases ran rampant.

Every day, the daughters went at dawn to wait in line at the few bakeries still working and came back in the afternoon, sometimes with only one flatbread. One day, Ne'man and his daughters walked 5 kilometers (3 miles) to the town of Deir al-Balah, looking for drinkable water.

""If it wasn't for the kind people in Deir al-Balah who took pity on us and gave us half a gallon, we could have returned with nothing,"" Ne'man said.

As strikes continued, the family decided to go as far as possible, trekking 20 kilometers (12 miles) to Rafah, at Gaza's southernmost end.

The Abu Jarads weren't the only ones: As Israeli evacuation orders ate away at more and more of Gaza, nearly half of the population crammed into Rafah.

Here, the family had their first taste of living in a tent.

They set up amid the massive sprawl of tens of thousands of tents on Rafah's outskirts, near U.N. aid warehouses known as ""the barracks.""

""In the winter, it was hell, water drenched us,"" Majida said. ""We slept on the ground, nothing under us, and no covers.""

They had no money to buy food in the markets, where prices soared. The youngest girls got sick with colds and diarrhea, and there was no nearby pharmacy to buy medicine. The family survived completely off U.N. handouts of flour and other basics.

""To buy one tomato or cucumber and find it in the tent was like a dream,"" Ne'man said.

Like so many others, they'd believed Rafah was the last safe place in Gaza.

It was not.

In the first week of May, Israel ordered the evacuation of all of Rafah. Then its troops pushed into the city. Bombardment intensified.

Ne'man and Majida tried to stay as long as possible. But an airstrike hit nearby, he said, killing four of Ne'man's cousins and a young girl.

Palestinians who'd packed into Rafah -- more than 1 million -- all streamed out again, fleeing the Israeli offensive.

They scattered across southern and central Gaza. New tent cities filled beaches, fields, empty lots, schoolyards, cemeteries, even dumpsites - any open space.

The Abu Jarads moved by foot and donkey cart until they reached a former amusement park known as Asdaa City. Now its Ferris wheel stood above a landscape of tents stretching as far as the eye could see.

Here, in Muwasi, a barren area of dunes and fields along the coast, Israel had declared a ""humanitarian zone"" - though there was little aid, food or water.

Every amenity once taken for granted was a distant memory. Now the kitchen was a pile of sticks for kindling and two rocks for setting a pot over the fire. No shower, only the occasional bucket of water. Soap was too expensive. Only a draped sheet separated them from their neighbors. Everything was filthy and sandy. Large spiders, cockroaches and other insects crept into the tent.

A raid by Israeli troops less than a kilometer (half-mile) away forced Majida and Ne'man to uproot their family once more. They headed toward the Mediterranean coast, not knowing where they'd stay.

Fortunately, they said, they found some acquaintances.

""God bless them, they opened their tent for us and let us live with them for 10 days,"" Ne'man said.

When they returned to Muwasi, the Abu Jarads found their tent had been robbed - their food and clothes, all gone.

Since then, the weeks blur together. The family finds survival itself loses meaning in a conflict that seems to have no end.

Food has become even harder to find as supplies entering Gaza drop to their lowest levels of the war.

Israeli drones buzz overhead constantly. The mental strain wears on everyone.

One day, Ne'man said, his youngest daughter, Lana, told him, ""You stopped loving me. Because now when I come near you, you say you are fed up and tell me to stay away.""

He kept telling her, ""No, darling, I love you. I just can't bear it all.""

They all dream of home. Ne'man said he learned that his brother's house next door was destroyed in a strike, and his own home was damaged. He wonders about his flowers. He hopes they survived -- even if the house is gone.

The difference between then and now, Majida said, is ""the difference between heaven and earth.""

Far from the warmth and affection of home, the Abu Jarads feel themselves surrendering to despair.

""We are jealous,"" Majida said. ""Jealous of who? Of the people who were killed. Because they found relief while we are still suffering, living horrors, torture and heartbreak.""

Lebanese worldwide fear for their homeland and loved ones as violence escalates,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-global-diaspora-violence-israel-hezbollah-12b4de400efafed84f665a0ea3045c9f,2024-10-06T05:36:19Z,"It was a year ago when Jomana Siddiqui visited Lebanon, where her father was born -- and is now buried. She planned to return there soon; this time, she thought, she would take her two teenage daughters.

Instead, Siddiqui, who lives in California, now worries about relatives there. As she watches from afar the violence and the recent escalation in Israel's military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon, Siddiqui thinks about the people she met during her visit, the kindness and generosity she encountered.

She thinks about her father's grave -- when, or if, she will get to visit it again. Her voice cracks with emotions. It's been gut-wrenching, she said.

""It's like the universal story of the Lebanese people,"" she said. ""They have to keep leaving and not knowing when they can come back.""

From the United States to South Africa, Cyprus, Brazil and beyond, many members of Lebanon's far-flung and large diaspora are contending with the ripples of the violence -- grieving, gripped by fear for loved ones and for their homeland, trying to find ways to help.

Some 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians and fighters of the militant group Hezbollah, have been killed and some 1.2 million driven from their homes since Israel escalated its strikes in late September, saying it aims to push Hezbollah away from the countries' shared border.

For Lina Kayat, who moved to South Africa almost 36 years ago but still has a big family in Lebanon, the violence and tensions there have echoes of earlier turbulent chapters.

""We lived through a civil war for a long time; I was like seven years old,"" she said. ""It feels like history repeating itself. ... It's the unknown of who is going to get killed next.""

Kayat, who lives in South Africa's coastal city of Durban, speaks daily to her family, including her mother and her sister.

""They are very scared and very worried about what is going to happen,"" she said.

Generations of Lebanese have grappled with whether to leave to seek better opportunities or escape various times of tumult -- from a 15-year-old civil war to military occupations, bombings and political assassinations -- or stay in a Lebanon that despite its numerous scars retains its allure for many. Lebanon -- home to multiple religious groups, including Christians and Sunni and Shiite Muslims -- takes pride in its large emigrant communities, which include successful businessmen and celebrities of Lebanese heritage.

The current military escalation unfolds amid fears that fighting could spread in the region and comes as the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza nears the grim one-year mark.

""It happening on top of Gaza is almost too much to bear,"" said James Zogby, president of the Washington D.C.-based Arab American Institute.

""It almost makes you physically ill just trying to fathom the extent of the trauma,"" added Zogby, whose father was born in Lebanon.

Already, Lebanon had been on edge and struggling under the weight of an economic meltdown, the fallout from a massive 2020 port explosion and other crises. It's been without a president for two years.

Against such a somber backdrop, Zogby wonders what will become of the displaced.

""Who's going to care for them? Where do the health services come from ... when the country is already as overstretched as it is and on the verge of collapse?"" he said. ""At what point does it finally collapse? And who will care?""

Fueling the pain, he said, is his anger at the U.S. response to the devastation in Gaza and now the escalation in Lebanon.

""There's a sense of powerlessness, a sense of almost despair that, you know, it can get out of control. And as long as nothing here happens to restrain it, it will get worse.""

Akram Khater, director of the Khayrallah Center for Lebanese Diaspora Studies at North Carolina State University, said that since the earliest diaspora, Lebanese who left have been contributing heavily to the economic well-being of Lebanon, sending large amounts of remittances.

Watching the escalation in Lebanon, where he was born and raised, has been re-traumatizing, he said.

""I find myself amidst a swirl of emotions that are unresolved and that derive from this recurring nightmare,"" he said. ""Yet, even amidst this our community comes together to create solidarity and provide solace and comfort for each other.""

Recently, hundreds of Lebanese flags filled the night sky in Dearborn, Michigan, as some attended a rally to support Lebanon and protest the Israeli offensive there.

At Sao Paulo's international airport, two Lebanese brothers who've been living in Brazil, recently had a solemn reunion. They said eight of their loved ones -- their sister, brother-in-law, four of their nephews and two of their nephews' children -- were killed in Lebanon in one of the attacks.

Hussein Zeineddine, one of the brothers, had been on vacation with his family in southern Lebanon when the area was hit by Israeli attacks, he told The Associated Press. He and his family moved to a safer location until they could book flights back to Brazil. ""My wife was crying and asking us to leave. We left just with basic items. And then, shortly after, my sister's house was bombed,"" he said after his arrival.

""It will be tough here. But it will be tougher for people there,"" he said.

In Cyprus, Rosaline Ghoukassian said the overwhelming majority of Lebanese don't want this war. She relocated to Cyprus with her husband Raffi Garabedian and their daughter Maria after the 2020 ammonium nitrate explosion in Beirut's port that killed more than 200 people. She said she'd been disenchanted with Lebanon's political leadership and also lamented Hezbollah's influence.

""We knew this was coming,"" she said. ""The problem is in Lebanon. ... Because we don't have a good government.""

Their decision to leave Lebanon was never about money but safety, as their daughter explained in a letter she wrote in class in Cyprus: ""I don't want to go there because I was saved in the explosion, and I don't want to go live there because I don't want to die.""

The family chose to stay.

""I'm not here to make thousands of euros. No. I'm here just to live. To be happy, to be safe. This is what I want. To live,"" Garabedian said.

Hezbollah began firing into Israel the day after Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which the militants killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 others hostage. Since then, Israel's military response in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials.

Back in California, Siddiqui said coping with it all has been challenging.

""You grab the phone; you hesitate to open it because you're afraid of what you're going to see, but you kind of have to.""

She talks to friends and others in her circle who can relate.

""We all feel kind of sad, depressed, helpless, rundown,"" she said. ""We can do things like fundraise and donate and protest or anything like that, but at the end of the day, it still weighs on you.""

Apparent Israeli airstrike on mosque in central Gaza kills at least 18 people,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-6-october-2024-0210e9d539a899e21ee89b52807b6af7,2024-10-06T04:48:41Z,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- An apparent Israeli airstrike early Sunday killed at least 18 people in central Gaza, Palestinian medical officials said.

The strike hit a mosque sheltering displaced people near the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah, the hospital said in a statement.

An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital morgue. Hospital records showed that the dead were all men. Another two men were critically wounded, the hospital said.

The Israeli military did not immediately comment about the strike on the mosque.

The latest strikes add to the mounting Palestinian death toll in Gaza, which is now nearing 42,000 according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths, but many of the dead were women and children."
"A year into the Israel-Hamas war, students say a chill on free speech has reached college classrooms",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/gaza-israel-palestinians-campus-protest-anniversary-46faa669edb6b8bf1da6f670f6186bbc,2024-10-06T04:41:05Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a junior at George Washington University, Ty Lindia meets new students every day. But with the shadow of the Israel-Hamas war hanging over the Washington, D.C., campus, where everyone has a political opinion, each new encounter is fraught.

""This idea that I might say the wrong thing kind of scares me,"" said Lindia, who studies political science. ""You have to tiptoe around politics until one person says something that signifies they lean a certain way on the issue.""

He has seen friendships -- including some of his own -- end over views about the war. In public, he keeps his stance to himself for fear that future employers could hold it against him.

""Before Oct. 7, there wasn't really a big fear,"" said Lindia, of Morristown, New Jersey.

A year after Hamas' attack in southern Israel, some students say they are reluctant to speak out because it could pit them against their peers, professors or even potential employers. Social bubbles have cemented along the divisions of the war. New protest rules on many campuses raise the risk of suspension or expulsion.

Tensions over the conflict burst wide open last year amid emotional demonstrations in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. In the spring, a wave of pro-Palestinian tent encampments led to some 3,200 arrests.

The atmosphere on U.S. campuses has calmed since those protests, yet lingering unease remains.

In a recent class discussion on gender and the military at Indiana University, sophomore Mikayla Kaplan said she thought about mentioning her female friends who serve in the Israeli military. But in a room full of politically progressive classmates, she decided to stay quiet.

""In the back of my head, I'm always thinking about things that I should or shouldn't say,"" Kaplan said.

Kaplan, who proudly wears a Star of David necklace, said that before college she had many friends of different faiths, but after Oct. 7, almost all of her friends are Jewish.

The war began when Hamas-led fighters killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. They abducted another 250 people and are still holding about 100 hostages. Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed at least 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

At the University of Connecticut, some students said the conflict doesn't come up as much in classes. Ahmad Zoghol, an engineering student, said it remains a tense issue and he has heard of potential employers scrutinizing political statements students make in college.

""There's definitely that concern for a lot of people, including myself, that if we speak about it there's going to be some sort of repercussion,"" he said.

Compared with the much larger campus protests of the Vietnam War era, when few students openly supported the war, campuses today appear more divided, said Mark Yudof, a former president of the University of California system. For many, the issues are more personal.

""The faculty are at odds with each other. The student body is at odds with each other. There's a war of ideologies going on,"" he said.

Some universities are trying to bridge the divide with campus events on civil discourse, sometimes inviting Palestinian and Jewish speakers to share the stage. At Harvard University in Massachusetts, a recent survey found that many students and professors are reluctant to share views in the classroom. A panel suggested solutions including ""classroom confidentiality"" and teaching on constructive disagreement.

Meanwhile, many campuses are adding policies that clamp down on protests, often banning encampments and limiting demonstrations to certain hours or locations.

At Indiana University, a new policy forbids ""expressive activity"" after 11 p.m, among other restrictions. Doctoral student Bryce Greene, who helped lead a pro-Palestinian encampment last semester, said he was threatened with suspension after organizing an 11:30 p.m. vigil.

That's a startling contrast to past protests on campus, including a 2019 climate demonstration that drew hundreds of students without university interference, he said.

""There's definitely a chilling effect that occurs when speech is being restricted in this manner,"" said Greene, who is part of a lawsuit challenging the new policy. ""This is just one way for them to restrict people from speaking out for Palestine.""

The tense atmosphere has led some faculty members to rethink teaching certain subjects or entering certain debates, said Risa Lieberwitz, general counsel for the American Association of University Professors.

Lieberwitz, who teaches labor law at Cornell University, has been alarmed by the growing number of colleges requiring students to register demonstrations days in advance.

""It's so contradictory to the notion of how protests and demonstrations take place,"" she said. ""They're oftentimes spontaneous. They're not planned in the way that events are generally planned.""

Protests have continued on many campuses, but on a smaller scale and often under the confines of new rules.

At Wesleyan University in Connecticut, police removed a group of pro-Palestinian students from a campus building where they held a sit-in in September. Wesleyan President Michael Roth said he supports students' free speech rights, but they ""don't have a right to take over part of a building.""

Wesleyan is offering new courses on civil disagreement this year, and faculty are working to help foster discussion among students.

""It's challenging for students, as it is for adults -- most adults don't have conversations with people who disagree with them,"" Roth said. ""We're so segregated into our bubbles.""

American universities pride themselves as being places of open discourse where students can engage across their differences. Since Oct. 7, they have been under tremendous pressure to uphold free speech while also protecting students from discrimination.

The U.S. Education Department is investigating more than 70 colleges for reports of antisemitism or Islamophobia. Leaders of several prestigious colleges have been called before Congress by Republicans who accuse them of being soft on antisemitism.

Yet finding the line where protected speech ends is as hard as ever. Leaders grapple with whether to allow chants seen by some as calls of support for Palestinians and by others as a threat against Jews. It's especially complicated at public universities, which are bound by the First Amendment, while private colleges have flexibility to impose wider speech limits.

At George Washington University, Lindia said the war comes up often in his classes but sometimes after a warming-up period -- in one class, discussion loosened after the professor realized most students shared similar views. Even walking to class, there is a visible reminder of the tension. Tall fencing now surrounds University Yard, the grassy space where police broke up a tent encampment in May.

""It's a place for free expression, and now it's just completely blocked off,"" he said.

Some students say moderate voices are getting lost.

Nivriti Agaram, a junior at George Washington, said she believes Israel has a right to defend itself but questions America's spending on the war. That opinion puts her at odds with more liberal students, who have called her a ""genocide enabler"" and worse, she said.

""It's very stifling,"" she said. ""I think there's a silent majority who aren't speaking.""

A year of blood and anguish: The Mideast war in AP photos,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-photo-gallery-dc81e4fa104fa821ed74bd40fd9e56f5,2024-10-06T04:11:49Z,"A year after Hamas launched a cross-border attack into southern Israel on Oct. 7, the images of that day and its ongoing aftermath still defy belief.

No one thought they would see heavily armed Hamas gunmen going door-to-door on quiet Israeli streets or storming a crowded music festival, mowing people down for hours with no soldiers in sight.

No one thought they would see entire neighborhoods in the Gaza Strip turned into rubble-strewn wastelands, with high-rises leveled, paved roads turned to dirt and people fleeing on foot with only what they could carry. Few thought it would last this long, or claim so many lives.

Hamas' surprise attack and the war it triggered in Gaza have brought unprecedented death, destruction and anguish to both Israelis and Palestinians. Its ripples across the Middle East have raised the specter of an even larger conflict.

Associated Press photographers have tried to capture its impact on ordinary people.

They have photographed Israelis returning to the scenes of the killings, mobilizing for war and protesting their country's wartime leadership and its failure to return scores of hostages.

They have been there as Palestinians dig for survivors after airstrikes and as the wounded are treated on the floors of overwhelmed hospitals. They have photographed people huddling in tents and crowding around aid stations, reaching with empty pots for desperately needed food,

They have followed Palestinians from one end of Gaza to another as they flee airstrikes and evacuation orders, often traveling by foot or donkey cart with only what they can carry.

And they have been to funerals -- too many funerals -- on both sides.

As with all wars, civilians have paid the heaviest price. Young Israelis were killed by the hundreds at the music festival. Grandparents in their 70s and 80s were dragged into Gaza and held in tunnels, where many perished. Airstrikes killed Palestinian children in front of their parents and left thousands of orphans -- some with no living relatives.

Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, drawing retaliatory strikes in a cycle of escalation that has steadily worsened. In recent weeks, Israeli warplanes have pounded large areas of Lebanon, killing Hezbollah's leader and several of his top commanders, as well as many civilians. Ground operations commenced last week.

The bombings have brought more giant plumes of smoke, more blackened craters where buildings once stood, more screaming ambulances and more people -- by the hundreds of thousands -- taking to the roads to flee the war's widening vortex.

Through it all, there have been some moments of joy, however fleeting.

There were happy homecomings -- on both sides -- last November after more than 100 hostages were freed in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.

But a year on, everyone still seems to be trapped in the violent reality unleashed in the early hours of Oct. 7, with no end in sight."
A displaced family's year of fleeing across the devastated Gaza Strip,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-displacement-families-moving-161d9ad8d07e12b22bfd41c79d174c70,2024-10-06T04:03:24Z,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Ne'man Abu Jarad sat on a tarp on the ground. Around him, canvas sheets hung from cords, forming the walls of his tent. For the past year, Ne'man; his wife, Majida; and their six daughters have trekked the length of the Gaza Strip, trying to survive as Israeli forceswreaked destruction around them.

It's a far cry from their house in northern Gaza -- a place of comforting routine, of love, affection and safety. A place where loved ones gathered around the kitchen table or on the roof on summer evenings amid the scent of roses and jasmine flowers.

""Your house is your homeland. Everything good in our life was the home,"" Ne'man said. ""Everything in it, whether physical or intangible -- family, neighbors, my siblings who were all around me.

They did exactly as the Israelis ordered in the devastating weeks and months of war that followed. They obeyed evacuation calls. They moved where the military told them to move. Seven times they fled, and each time, their lives became more unrecognizable to them, crowding with strangers in a school classroom, searching for water in a vast tent camp or sleeping on the street.

The Associated Press traced the family's journey as they were driven from their home. Israel's campaign has displaced nearly the entire population of Gaza -- 1.9 million of its 2.3 million Palestinians -- and killed more than 41,600 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Like the Abu Jarads, most families have been uprooted multiple times.

For this family, the journey has taken them from a comfortable middle-class life to ruin.

Living at the northernmost end of Gaza, most days before the war in Beit Hanoun were simple. Ne'man headed out each morning to work as a taxi driver. Majida got their daughters off to school. Their youngest, Lana, had started first grade. Hoda, the 18-year-old, was in her first year at university. The eldest, Balsam, just had her first baby.

Majida spent much of her day doing housework -- her face lights up when she talks about her kitchen, the center of family life.

Ne'man had planted the garden with a grapevine and covered the roof with potted flowers. Watering them in the evenings was a soothing ritual. Then, the family and neighbors would sit on the front stoop or the roof to chat.

""The area would always smell nice,"" he said. ""People would say we have perfume because of how beautiful the flowers are.""

On the morning of Oct. 7, the family heard Hamas rockets firing and news of the militants' attack into southern Israel, in which some 1,200 people were killed and 250 kidnapped.

The Abu Jarads knew that the Israeli response would be swift and that their house, only about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from the border fence with Israel, would be on the front line.

By 9 a.m., Ne'man and Majida, their six daughters, and Ne'man's sister packed up what they could and fled, as the Israeli military issued one of its first evacuation orders.

""It makes no sense to be stubborn and stay,"" Majida said. ""It is not about one person. I am part of a family and have girls.""

Like many, the family tried, at first, to stay close to home. They went to stay with Majida's parents, in Beit Lahiya about a kilometer (.6 miles) away.

""The place was very comfortable, to be honest. I felt like I was at home,"" Majida said. ""But we were living in fear and terror.""

Already, Beit Lahiya was being heavily bombarded. Over the six days they were there, at least nine Israeli strikes hit the town, killing dozens, according to the conflict monitor Airwars. Entire families were killed or wounded under the rubble of their homes.

As the explosions got closer, shrapnel pierced water tanks at Majida's parents' home. Windows shattered as the family huddled inside.

The building and its grounds were packed with thousands of people. All around northern Gaza, families took refuge in hospitals, hoping they'd be safe.

The family found a small space on the floor, barely enough room to spread their blanket amid the frantic medical staff struggling with the wounded.

It was a black night and there were strikes, Majida remembers. ""The martyrs and wounded were strewn on the floor,"" she said.

The day after they arrived, a strike smashed into a house a few hundred meters away, killing a prominent doctor and some two dozen members of his family, many of them children.

The Israeli military ordered all civilians to leave northern Gaza, setting in motion a wave of hundreds of thousands of people heading south across Wadi Gaza, the stream and wetlands that divide the north from the rest of the strip.

The family joined the exodus.

The family walked 10 kilometers (6 miles) until they reached the U.N.-run Girls' Preparatory School in the Nuseirat refugee camp.

Every classroom and corridor was packed with families from the north. Majida, the daughters and Ne'man's sister found a tiny space in a classroom already housing more than 100 women and children. For privacy in the cramped conditions, Ne'man moved in with the men in tents outside, in the schoolyard.

This was their home for more than 10 weeks. Majida and the girls slept curled up on the floor, without enough space even to extend their legs. As winter set in, there weren't enough blankets.

The bathrooms were the worst part, Majida said. Only a few toilets served thousands of people. Getting a shower was a miracle, she said. People went weeks unable to bathe. Skin diseases ran rampant.

Every day, the daughters went at dawn to wait in line at the few bakeries still working and came back in the afternoon, sometimes with only one flatbread. One day, Ne'man and his daughters walked 5 kilometers (3 miles) to the town of Deir al-Balah, looking for drinkable water.

""If it wasn't for the kind people in Deir al-Balah who took pity on us and gave us half a gallon, we could have returned with nothing,"" Ne'man said.

As strikes continued, the family decided to go as far as possible, trekking 20 kilometers (12 miles) to Rafah, at Gaza's southernmost end.

The Abu Jarads weren't the only ones: As Israeli evacuation orders ate away at more and more of Gaza, nearly half of the population crammed into Rafah.

Here, the family had their first taste of living in a tent.

They set up amid the massive sprawl of tens of thousands of tents on Rafah's outskirts, near U.N. aid warehouses known as ""the barracks.""

""In the winter, it was hell, water drenched us,"" Majida said. ""We slept on the ground, nothing under us, and no covers.""

They had no money to buy food in the markets, where prices soared. The youngest girls got sick with colds and diarrhea, and there was no nearby pharmacy to buy medicine. The family survived completely off U.N. handouts of flour and other basics.

""To buy one tomato or cucumber and find it in the tent was like a dream,"" Ne'man said.

Like so many others, they'd believed Rafah was the last safe place in Gaza.

It was not.

In the first week of May, Israel ordered the evacuation of all of Rafah. Then its troops pushed into the city. Bombardment intensified.

Ne'man and Majida tried to stay as long as possible. But an airstrike hit nearby, he said, killing four of Ne'man's cousins and a young girl.

Palestinians who'd packed into Rafah -- more than 1 million -- all streamed out again, fleeing the Israeli offensive.

They scattered across southern and central Gaza. New tent cities filled beaches, fields, empty lots, schoolyards, cemeteries, even dumpsites - any open space.

The Abu Jarads moved by foot and donkey cart until they reached a former amusement park known as Asdaa City. Now its Ferris wheel stood above a landscape of tents stretching as far as the eye could see.

Here, in Muwasi, a barren area of dunes and fields along the coast, Israel had declared a ""humanitarian zone"" - though there was little aid, food or water.

Every amenity once taken for granted was a distant memory. Now the kitchen was a pile of sticks for kindling and two rocks for setting a pot over the fire. No shower, only the occasional bucket of water. Soap was too expensive. Only a draped sheet separated them from their neighbors. Everything was filthy and sandy. Large spiders, cockroaches and other insects crept into the tent.

Even the ""humanitarian zone"" was unsafe.

A raid by Israeli troops less than a kilometer (half-mile) away forced Majida and Ne'man to uproot their family once more. They headed toward the Mediterranean coast, not knowing where they'd stay.

Fortunately, they said, they found some acquaintances.

""God bless them, they opened their tent for us and let us live with them for 10 days,"" Ne'man said.

When they returned to Muwasi, the Abu Jarads found their tent had been robbed - their food and clothes, all gone.

Since then, the weeks blur together. The family finds survival itself loses meaning in a conflict that seems to have no end.

Food has become even harder to find as supplies entering Gaza drop to their lowest levels of the war.

Israeli drones buzz overhead constantly. The mental strain wears on everyone.

One day, Ne'man said, his youngest daughter, Lana, told him, ""You stopped loving me. Because now when I come near you, you say you are fed up and tell me to stay away.""

He kept telling her, ""No, darling, I love you. I just can't bear it all.""

They all dream of home. Ne'man said he learned that his brother's house next door was destroyed in a strike, and his own home was damaged. He wonders about his flowers. He hopes they survived -- even if the house is gone.

The difference between then and now, Majida said, is ""the difference between heaven and earth.""

Far from the warmth and affection of home, the Abu Jarads feel themselves surrendering to despair.

""We are jealous,"" Majida said. ""Jealous of who? Of the people who were killed. Because they found relief while we are still suffering, living horrors, torture and heartbreak.""

Health workers in Lebanon describe deadly Israeli attacks on colleagues and fear more,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-medics-hezbollah-hospitals-6c7f75c921c9deec0fa5c160ce639664,2024-10-05T20:59:45Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Israel's military struck outside the gates of a hospital in southern Lebanon without warning on Friday, killing seven paramedics and forcing the facility to close, the hospital director told The Associated Press a day after one of the most deadly attacks on health workers in the weeks since fighting escalated between Israel and Hezbollah.

The account of the Friday airstrikes that flung hospital doors off their hinges and shattered glass was the latest to detail attacks that Lebanon's health ministry says have killed dozens of health workers.

Marjayoun hospital director Mounes Kalakesh said that even before Friday's attack, ambulance crews in the area were so reluctant to operate that the facility had not received anyone wounded for days.

""We have not been able to work. There was fear and panic among the staff,"" he said.

Kalakesh said the government hospital didn't receive any warning from Israeli forces before the attack, even though nearby villages have received such warnings to evacuate.

Israel has not commented specifically on the incident. Friday's attack came hours before Israel's Arabic-language military spokesman accused the Hezbollah militant group, based in southern Lebanon, of using ambulances to transport weapons and fighters, and warned medical teams to stay clear of the group. The spokesman provided no evidence.

It is a charge that Lebanese officials and hospital directors, including Kalakesh, deny. Lebanon's health minister has accused Israel of committing ""a war crime"" by targeting medical teams and paramedics.

The health ministry on Thursday said 40 paramedics, firefighters and health care workers had been killed in Israeli attacks over three days, making it even more challenging to care for people wounded in the intense fighting.

The ministry has said more than 100 health workers have been killed in the year since the war in Gaza began and since Israel and Hezbollah stepped up exchanges of fire along the border.

The paramedics with the Islamic Health Committee are part of the coordinated health ministry response to crises in Lebanon. Other civil defense teams have expressed concern for their safety, with some saying they came under attack while clearly identified and operating in areas where they were transporting the wounded or putting out fires.

Israeli strikes have landed near the Marjayoun hospital before but never had come so close, Kalakesh said. He described the paramedics dying in their burning vehicles.

The 45-bed hospital is now shut down.

""I am responsible for this staff. I must protect them,"" Kalakesh said, explaining the decision to evacuate. At the time of the Friday attack, there were 30 staff in the hospital. His team was already exhausted after a year of working close to the front line.

Other groups have expressed concern.

A Lebanese Red Cross convoy, escorted by Lebanese troops and coordinated with the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, came under fire on Thursday. A Lebanese soldier was killed and four Red Cross volunteers were wounded.

Separately on Thursday, Israeli forces struck rescue teams with the Islamic Health Committee in Beirut's southern suburbs and the southern village of Odeissah, killing at least four.

In Odeissah, responding ambulances were hit by Israeli fire and three medics who were wounded in the initial attack were killed as rescuers tried to reach them, the health ministry said. In the Beirut suburbs, the team working to remove rubble from the initial airstrike was hit in a drone attack that killed a driver and wounded seven, said Islamic Health Committee spokesman Mahmoud Karaki.

Targeting the health sector undermines the safety net for the public, Karaki said, He said 145 of his team members have been wounded over the past year.

Lebanon's health ministry has said nine hospitals and 45 health care centers have been damaged during that time.

Hours after the Friday attack outside Marjayoun hospital, another hospital in the southern town of Bint Jbeil was shelled by Israeli forces after receiving a warning to evacuate. Nine members of the medical and nursing staff at Salah Ghandour Hospital were wounded, most of them seriously.

The hospital later shut down because of the damage."
"Born on Oct. 7, Ali's first year has played out against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/gaza-israel-war-anniversary-birthday-child-515add1ecaeefeab07429ce4eded92b1,2024-10-05T17:07:13Z,"NUSEIRAT, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Ali Al-Taweel was born as Israeli warplanes started to pound the Gaza Strip after Hamas' surprise cross-border attack on southern Israel.

Now, the Palestinian child will celebrate his first birthday as the Israeli-Hamas war reaches its one-year mark. For his family, it's been a year filled with uncertainty and anxiety as they moved place to place amid widespread destruction and limited resources.

""I had arranged another, very sweet life for him,"" Ali's mother, Amal Al-Taweel, told The Associated Press in an interview, ""The war has changed everything.""

When the war began on Oct. 7 of last year, Al-Taweel was being rushed to a hospital in central Gaza to give birth to a child she and her husband, Mustafa Al-Taweel, had sought for three years. Days after Ali's birth, his family returned to their home in the Zahrah neighborhood, just north of Wadi Gaza, but were forced to flee on Oct. 18, just a day before Israeli warplanes bombed the area, Al-Taweel said.

Since then, they have been living in relatives' homes and shelters across central and southern Gaza, including the city of Rafah before the Israeli military invaded it in May. They now shelter in the house of Al-Taweel's parents in the Nuseirat refugee camp, along with 15 other relatives.

""It was a very difficult year, bad in every way -- from a health perspective, from a psychological perspective,"" the 30-year-old said, adding that her child has been raised against the backdrop of daily bombing and killing.

The Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and took about 250 hostage, including children and a newborn. Israel responded with one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history. The war has killed about 42,000 Palestinians, many of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants.

More than 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million have been forced to flee their homes and cram into a tent camp on Gaza's shore. A quarter of the strip's population faces starvation amid an Israel-imposed blockade, allowing only limited delivery of aid, according to the United Nations.

Al-Taweel said every stage of Ali's life has been difficult ""from the time he started crawling, to when his teeth came out, to when he started his first steps, to when he started walking."" And she worried constantly about his safety, recalling that he was slightly injured when a strike hit close to her sister's house in the camp, shattering the windows.

Al-Taweel counted multiple challenges she and her husband, who lost his job as a day laborer in a seaside restaurant in Gaza City, have faced since the war began. Ali didn't receive any vaccinations in his first six months, making him vulnerable to disease, his mother said. And, with the blockade in place, she has struggled to obtain formula and diapers.

""They do not exist, and if they exist, they are very expensive and we can't afford them,"" she said.

Israel has severely restricted aid deliveries of food, water, medicine and other supplies into Gaza during the war. U.N. agencies and aid groups working in the enclave have long complained about lack of access and crippling restrictions on aid delivery.

""There is no single word that can describe the past year,"" said Sondos Alashqar, who works with the Medical Aid for Palestine group. Alashqar said that the hardships Palestinians saw during this past year exceeded what their grandparents experienced during the 1948 Nakba -- or catastrophe -- when some 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from what is now Israel.

""We witnessed numerous death-and-life situations,"" she said. ""It was one of the hardest years we've even lived -- harder than what our grandparents experienced.""

Al-Taweel said that constant bombing, displacement and destruction have made it difficult for her to raise her child as she had planned in his first year.

""It (the year) was full of tension, fear, anxiety, displacement, bombing and destruction,"" she said. ""He was not like any other child who lives in a safe, peaceful, and healthy (environment)."""
European cities brace for pro-Palestinian rallies amid high alert as Oct. 7 anniversary approaches,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mideast-israel-gaza-war-protests-rallies-propalestine-terror-alerts-b314ac9fc24ab91e3c0639405a15d5d0,2024-10-05T12:16:11Z,"ROME (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators were expected to take to the streets across Europe on Saturday calling for a cease-fire as the first anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel approached.

Security forces in several countries warned of heightened levels of alert in major cities, amid concerns that the escalating conflict in the Middle East could inspire new terror attacks in Europe or that some of the protests could turn violent.

Massive rallies are planned in several European cities, including London, Berlin, Paris and Rome through next week, with the largest gatherings expected from Saturday to Monday. Events will peak on Monday, the date of the anniversary.

By midday Saturday, thousands had gathered in central London's Russell Square amid a significant police presence. Some of the march's organizers had said they planned to target companies and institutions they claimed were ""complicit in Israel's crimes,"" including Barclays Bank and the British Museum.

Protests are also taking place in other parts of the world. In the Philippines on Saturday, dozens of left-wing activists protested near the U.S. Embassy in Manila, where police prevented them from getting closer to the seaside compound.

On Oct. 7 last year, Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel, killing 1,200 Israelis, taking 250 people hostage and setting off a war with Israel that has shattered much of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip.

More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since then in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians. It says more than half were women and children.

Nearly 100 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, with fewer than 70 believed to be alive. Israelis have experienced attacks -- missiles from Iran and Hezbollah, explosive drones from Yemen, fatal shootings and stabbings -- as the region braces for further escalation.

In late September, Israel shifted some of its focus to Hezbollah, which holds much of the power in parts of southern Lebanon and some other areas of the country, attacking the militants with exploding pagers, airstrikes and, eventually, incursions into Lebanon.

Pro-Palestinian protests calling for an immediate cease-fire have repeatedly taken place across Europe and around the globe in the past year and have often turned violent, with confrontations between demonstrators and law enforcement officers.

In Rome, a rally was planned for Saturday afternoon -- with about 30,000 demonstrators expected -- in spite of a ban by local police chiefs who refused to authorize protests in the Italian capital, citing public security concerns.

Italian authorities believed that the timing of the planned rally risked the Oct. 7 attack being ""glorified,"" local media reported.

Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi also stressed that, ahead of the key anniversary, Europe is on high alert for potential terror attacks. ""This is not a normal situation ... We are already in a condition of maximum prevention,"" he said.

A large crowd was also expected to gather in central London on Saturday afternoon. Ben Jamal, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign in Britain, said he and others will keep organizing marches until action against Israel is taken.

""We need to be out on the streets in even bigger numbers to stop this carnage and stop Britain being drawn into it,"" Jamal said.

In Berlin, a march is scheduled from the Brandenburg Gate to Bebelplatz on Sunday. Local media reported that security forces have warned of potential overload due to the scale of protests. German authorities pointed to increasing antisemitic and violent incidents in recent days.

France was also on alert for new protests on Saturday. Earlier this week, Interior minister Bruno Retailleau warned the country's regional prefects, expressing concern about possible tensions and saying that the terrorist threat was high."
"Israel strikes Lebanon, hitting Beirut suburbs and the north",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-5-october-2024-a8b70daeccc57a86fc6d939c604f2caf,2024-10-05T12:04:14Z,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Israel expanded its bombardment in Lebanon on Saturday, hitting Beirut's southern suburbs with 12 airstrikes and striking a Palestinian refugee camp deep in northern Lebanon for the first time.

The attack on the Beddawi refugee camp near the northern city of Tripoli killed an official with Hamas's military wing, along with his wife and two young daughters, the Palesitnian militant group said in a statement. Tripoli is much farther north than the majority of Israel's strikes, which have been concentrated in southern Lebanon and Beirut.

Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began in October last year, in addition to most of the top leadership of Hezbollah.

At least six people were killed in more than a dozen Israeli airstrikes overnight and into Saturday, according to National News Agency, Lebanon's official news agency.

The Israeli military said special forces were carrying out targeted ground raids against Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon, destroying missiles, launchpads, watchtowers and weapons storage facilities. The military said troops also dismantled tunnel shafts that Hezbollah used to approach the Israeli border.

Some 1,400 Lebanese, including Hezbollah fighters and civilians, have been killed and some 1.2 million driven from their homes since Israel escalated its strikes in late September aiming to cripple Hezbollah and push it away from the countries' shared border. On Tuesday, Israel launched what it called a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon. Nine Israeli troops have been killed in close fighting in the area in the past few days, the military said.

Also on Saturday, Palestinian medical officials say Israeli strikes in northern and central Gaza early Saturday have killed at least 9 people, including two children.

One strike hit a group of people in the northern town of Beit Hanoun, killing at least five people, including two children, according to the Health Ministry's Ambulance and Emergency service.

Another strike hit a house in the northern part of the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing at least four people, the Awda hospital said. The strike also left a number of people wounded, it said.

The Israeli military did not have any immediate comment on the strikes, but it has long accused Hamas of operating from within civilian areas.

The Israeli military warned Palestinians to evacuate along the strategic Netzarim corridor in central Gaza, which was at the heart of obstacles to a ceasefire deal earlier this summer. The military told people in parts of the Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps to evacuate to Muwasi, an area along Gaza's shore the military has designated a humanitarian zone.

It's unclear how many Palestinians are currently living in the areas ordered evacuated, parts of which were evacuated previously.

Almost 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the nearly year-long war, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths."
Middle East latest: A Hamas official is killed in an Israeli strike on a refugee camp,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-5-october-2024-e8c20151ce6d01f8ac697a835314e70d,2024-10-05T06:49:34Z,"An Israeli strike on a refugee camp in north Lebanon has killed Hamas official Saeed Atallah Ali and his family, the militant group said Saturday. The early morning strike came a day after another Israeli airstrike cut off a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria, leaving two huge craters on either side of the road.

Israel began a ground incursion Tuesday into Lebanon against the Hezbollah militant group. The Israeli military said nine soldiers have died in the conflict in southern Lebanon.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas' cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel declared war on the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. As the Israel-Hamas war reaches the one-year mark, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials.

Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.

Here is the latest:

BEIRUT -- An Israeli strike on a refugee camp in north Lebanon has killed a Hamas official and his family, the militant group said Saturday.

Hamas said in a statement that the early Saturday strike on the Beddawi refugee camp struck the home of Saeed Atallah Ali, an official with Hamas's military wing, the Qassam Brigades. Ali's wife, Shaymaa Azzam, and their two daughters, Zeinab and Fatima -- whom the statement described as children -- were also killed in the attack.

Beddawi camp is near the northern city of Tripoli. It was the first such strike on the camp in recent weeks that saw intensified exchanges between Israel and Hamas.

Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began in October 2023.

SEOUL, South Korea -- A military plane evacuating 97 people from Lebanon arrived in South Korea on Saturday.

South Korea's Foreign Ministry said the group on the plane includes South Korean nationals and their family members. There are about 30 South Koreans left in Lebanon besides diplomats and embassy workers who are staying.

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol instructed officials Wednesday to send military aircraft to conflict areas in the Middle East as he called a meeting to discuss the impact of the intensified fighting in the region. There are about 480 South Korean nationals living in Israel and 110 in Iran."
"One year in, war casts a shadow over every aspect of life in Israel",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-war-israelis-mood-depression-28daf7e6aa8ddab419cf76e31b111d4f,2024-10-05T04:13:18Z,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- At a busy Tel Aviv entertainment district, diners spill into outdoor seating and clink glasses as music fills the air. There's laughter, there's life. But all around the patrons, staring down from lampposts and shop windows, are pictures of hostages held in Gaza, stark reminders that Israel is at war and forever scarred by the deadliest attack in its history.

As Israel's war with Hamas reaches its one-year mark, it can seem on the surface that much of life in the country has returned to normal. But with many still reeling from Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, hostages remaining in captivity and a new front of warwith Hezbollah in the north, many Israelis feel depressed, despondent and angry as the war stretches into its second year.

Uncertainty over the future has cast a pall over virtually every part of daily life, even as people try to maintain a sense of normalcy.

""The conversation about the situation is always there,"" said activist Zeev Engelmayer, whose daily postcard project featuring illustrations of hostages or Israel's new reality has become a fixture at anti-war protests. ""Even those who are sitting in coffee shops, they're talking about it, in every single situation I see it. It's impossible to get away from it. It has entered into every vibration of our life.""

Hamas' attack in which some 1,200 people were killed and 250 kidnapped shattered Israelis' sense of security and stability in their homeland.

Many have been rattled by the war's evolution. Nearly 100 hostages remain in Gaza, with less than 70 believed to be alive. Israelis have experienced attacks -- missiles from Iran and Hezbollah, explosive drones from Yemen, fatal shootings and stabbings -- -- as the region braces for further escalation.

They've watched as Israel is accused of committing war crimes and genocide in Gaza and becomes increasingly isolated internationally.

""I'm almost 80 -- we grew up in this country with a feeling that we have short wars, and we win them quickly,"" said Israeli historian Tom Segev, who described new feelings of utter hopelessness. ""We're not used to a long war.""

Israelis have long harbored a sense that their country, born of the Holocaust's ashes and surviving a panoply of regional threats, is a success story, Segev said. They've strived, he added, for a normality akin to that of European and North American people, though their reality for decades has been anything but.

""I think that history is going backward,"" he said of the past year. ""Everything we have achieved on our way to becoming a normal state isn't happening.""

Reminders are everywhere. At a Hebrew University graduation in Jerusalem, a large yellow ribbon was placed in front of the stage. A graduate who didn't attend because his brother was killed in Gaza the previous day was honored.

Israel's longstanding internal divisions briefly eased in the aftermath of Hamas' attack, but have only intensified since. Weekly protests calling for a cease-fire deal that would free hostages are attended mostly by secular Jewish Israelis who oppose Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government.

According to a September poll by Jerusalem-based think tank Israel Democracy Institute, 61 percent of right-wing Jewish Israelis -- Netanyahu's base -- support the war continuing.

Occupied with their own trauma, most Israelis paid scant attention to the ongoing destruction in Gaza, even as the Health Ministry there put the Palestinian death toll at more than 41,000. Israeli media have reported little on the devastation. Israelis calling for a cease-fire are driven overwhelmingly by the hostages' plight.

Many Israelis are furious at leaders and the military for not preventing Hamas' attack. Tens of thousands of people are expected at an alternative ceremony marking one year since then, as a statement against the government's official commemoration. The state ceremony is being prerecorded without a live audience, in part because of fears of heckling and disruptions.

""The thing we lost on Oct. 7 -- and we haven't gotten it back -- is our feeling of security,"" Muli Segev, executive producer of ""Eretz Nehederet,"" a popular sketch comedy show. ""Despite everything, we have been able to create a life here that's pretty open and Western.

""Especially in Tel Aviv, we go about our lives, and we don't think about the fact that our lives are really just pauses between wars and between explosions of violence.""

In the war's early months, the show's sketches were gentler, focusing on what united Israeli society, such as the massive civilian volunteer response. Over time, they featured more pointed satire, including a reimagining of negotiations if the hostages were Israeli politicians' children -- released in less than two hours.

Parts of life have rebounded -- beaches full of people, bustling cafes, concerts and sports back on schedules. But residents also check for the nearest bomb shelter, deal with school cancellations when violence flares up, and avoid domestic travel hubs that are now off-limits. Heartbreaking news arrives regularly, including the deaths of six hostages in August.

""It's a nightmare; we're just getting used to it,"" said Maya Brandwine, a 33-year-old graphic designer who witnessed the Jaffa shooting that killed seven on Tuesday. ""I have so little hope. I'm sure the situation will only get worse.""

Dror Rotches, a 47-year-old graphic designer, said from a Tel Aviv coffee shop: ""We try to go out when we can, meet friends and try to forget for a few hours. Then we go home and keep slogging through the mud.""

Others simply can't return home. More than 60,000 from Israel's northern border with Lebanon are displaced. Thousands from the southern towns ransacked Oct. 7 are in temporary housing. Tens of thousands of reserve soldiers are serving their second or third tour of duty, straining their families and jobs.

""As the war goes on and on and we can't see the end, there's also a type of very large worry over the future, and, for some, if there is even a future here,"" Muli Segev said.

Cafe Otef seems like any of Tel Aviv's ubiquitous coffee shops: Patrons laugh and sip specialty coffee beside a playground; light rock music plays. But next to the sandwiches and cakes are chocolates made from the recipes of Dvir Karp, who was killed in the Oct. 7 attack, and cheeses from Kibbutz Be'eri, where more than 100 died and 30 were taken hostage. Totes and T-shirts for sale declare ""We shall thrive again.""

The cafe, named for the region next to the Gaza border, is run by residents of Re'im, one of the kibbutzes struck. It's the second shop in the new chain, each aiming to support people of a southern Israeli town where lives were upended.

""The war still continues for almost a year, and I feel that if we won't live, we will die,"" said Reut Karp, cafe owner and Dvir's ex-wife. She lives with most of her kibbutz in temporary housing nearby.

The cafe gives her purpose as her community deals with trauma and the uncertainty of returning home. While it's strange to see people flowing through the doors, going about life as normal, she and the staff have found comfort in the routine.

""We must take ourselves out of bed and continue to live and to work and to have the hope,"" Karp said. ""Because without this hope, we don't have anything."""
Virginia man charged with defacing monument during Netanyahu protests in DC,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/netanyahu-protests-washington-congress-37861883e2db60606aaf434bf9ec83ad,2024-10-04T20:55:03Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Virginia man was arrested Friday on a charge that he spray-painted graffiti on a monument in the nation's capital during protests against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress in July.

Zaid Mohammed Mahdawi, 26, of Richmond, Va., was charged in a complaint with one count of destruction of federal property. He was among thousands of protesters who gathered in Washington, D.C., on July 24 to condemn Netanyahu's visit.

Some demonstrators who gathered outside Union Station that day removed American flags and hoisted Palestinian ones in their place. Others burned flags and sprayed graffiti on structures in Columbus Circle, in front of Union Station.

Videos posted on social media showed Mahdawi climbing the statue of Christopher Columbus in the middle of Columbus Circle and using red spray paint to write ""HAMAS IS COMIN"" on the monument, according to an FBI agent's affidavit. He also spray-painted an inverted red triangle above the slogan, the affidavit says.

The FBI later received a tip from a witness who knew Mahdawi from a Richmond gym and recognized his image in a police bulletin.

A group of protesters had a permit to demonstrate in front of Union Station, but the U.S. Park Police said it revoked the permit after it couldn't reach protest organizers that afternoon. The National Park Service estimated that it cost more than $11,000 to clean up and fix damage at the site.

""Politically motivated destruction or defacing of federal property is not protected speech, it is a crime,"" Matthew Graves, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, said in a statement.

Mahdawi was expected to make his initial court appearance in Virginia on Friday.

A Maryland woman was arrested last month on a related charge. Isabella Giordano, 20, of Towson, is accused of using red spray paint to write ""Gaza"" on a fountain in front of Union Station and spray-painting the base of two of the flagpoles in Columbus Circle."
"Biden talks election, economy and Middle East in surprise news briefing",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-conference-hamas-israel-kamala-harris-lebanon-hezbollah-jd-vance-0093866898d9f9067ff0676672cba9d8,2024-10-04T20:48:51Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- After 1,080 days as president, Joe Biden on Friday decided to pop in and take questions in the White House briefing room for the first time, striding in with a grin after a strong monthly jobs report and the temporary settlement of a strike by ports workers.

The president has been less available than his recent predecessors to questions from White House press corps, making his surprise appearance welcome to the gathered reporters who waited as his press secretary's daily briefing was moved up 15 minutes, then delayed for nearly one hour.

The president stepped through the press room's blue door in a dark gray suit and red tie and proceeded to make news in response to questions about comments on the 2024 presidential election, the latest jobs numbers and the escalating conflict in the Middle East.

The 81-year old stepped aside from the Democratic nomination this summer, backing Vice President Kamala Harris instead. He acknowledged doubts about whether the November election would be peaceful, given comments by former President Donald Trump that the results could be rigged.

""I'm confident it will be free and fair. I don't know whether it will be peaceful,"" Biden said. ""The things that Trump has said, and the the things that he said last time when he didn't like the outcome of the election, were very dangerous.""

Biden has tried to rebut a political movement that has at times openly trafficked in conspiracy theories, with the latest revolving around the government reporting Friday that employers added 254,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1%.

""Another fake jobs report out from Biden-Harris government today,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., posted on social media. ""But all the fake numbers in the world aren't going to fool people dealing with the Biden-Harris.""

The jobs reports are legitimate and have capped a solid run for the U.S. economy. Growth has stayed solid even as the inflation rate has dropped from a four-decade high in 2022 to an annual rate of 2.5%.

Consumer confidence has been weak relative to overall economic growth, a sign that many people still don't feel the strength seen in the latest jobs and inflation numbers. But Biden stressed that he was operating on valid data despite unfounded claims of falsification by supporters of Trump's Make America Great Again movement.

""If you notice, anything the MAGA Republicans don't like they call 'fake,'"" Biden said. ""The job numbers are what the job numbers are. They're real. They're sincere.""

The president also highlighted the deal reached Thursday to suspend a strike by 45,000 dockworkers on East and Gulf coast ports until Jan. 15, creating time to try to hash out a new contract.

Still, challenges remain for Biden as his final months as president involve the risk of a wider war in the Middle East.

Since Hamas attacked Israel nearly a year ago, Israel has retaliated by bombarding the Gaza region in ways that have raised human rights concerns, as well as killing Hezbollah leaders and launching airstrikes in Lebanon. On Tuesday, Iran fired at least 180 missiles into Israel and there are concerns about additional retaliation that could cause the conflict to deepen.

When asked, Biden clarified his comments from a day earlier about Israel possibly striking Iranian oil facilities, which caused the price of the commodity to jump on the prospect of supplies being squeezed.

""Look, the Israelis have not concluded what they're going to do in terms of a strike,"" Biden said Friday. ""That's under discussion. I think if I were in their shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.""

The president emphasized that he and Harris are ""singing from the same song sheet"" on foreign and domestic policy, calling her a ""major player in everything we've done.""

As Biden began to leave the room, he was asked if he would reconsider his decision to exit the race. Biden cocked his head and smiled."
Biden says he doesn't know whether Israel is holding up peace deal to influence 2024 US election,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/biden-election-mideast-israel-d9f53ba8c7b3b4db953be020f676274c,2024-10-04T19:12:46Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden had terse words for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, and said he didn't know whether the Israeli leader was holding up a peace deal in order to influence the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

""No administration has helped Israel more than I have,"" Biden said. ""None. None, none. And I think Bibi should remember that. And whether he's trying to influence the election, I don't know but I'm not counting on that.""

Biden, in a rare appearance in the White House press briefing room, was responding to comments made by one of his allies, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who said on CNN this week that he was concerned Netanyahu had little interest in a peace deal in part because of U.S. politics.

Israel has pressed forward on two fronts, pursuing a ground incursion into Lebanon against Hezbollah that left eight Israeli soldiers dead and conducting strikes in Gaza that killed dozens, including children. And the nation has vowed to retaliate for Iran's ballistic missile attack this week, as the region braced for further escalation.

Biden said there had been no decision yet on what type of response there would be toward Iran.

""I'm assuming when they make a decision on how they're going to respond, we will then have a discussion,"" he said."
Former county sheriff has been appointed to lead the Los Angeles police force,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/los-angeles-police-department-chief-196f9840db961bee80d71b75ca1c3402,2024-10-04T16:07:34Z,"LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former LA county sheriff Jim McDonnell will lead the Los Angeles Police Department, taking charge of the force of nearly 9,000 officers as discontent grows among the city's residents over public safety even as violent crime numbers drop.

An official with knowledge of who was chosen confirmed it was McDonnell. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about it.

The appointment follows the surprise retirement of Chief Michel Moore in early 2024. Moore's tenure was marked by greater scrutiny into excessive force and police killings of civilians in the nation's second-largest city. Dominic Choi has led the department as interim chief -- and the first Asian American chief -- since March 2024.

The incoming chief will have to make sure the department is ready for the additional security challenges of the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Olympics.

A civilian board of Los Angeles police commissioners vetted McDonnell.

McDonnell was elected LA County Sheriff in 2014 to oversee the largest sheriff's department in the U.S. Before that, he spent 29 years in the LAPD and served as Long Beach's police chief for almost five years.

While there was debate over whether Mayor Karen Bass would choose an ""insider"" or ""outsider"" who would shake things up and challenge the way things were done within the department's insular culture, the mayor ended up with three candidates all with decades of experience at the LAPD.

Bass was expected to formally announce the appointment Friday morning at City Hall.

The other two candidates sent to Bass, who made the final selection, were Deputy Chief Emada Tingrides and former Assistant Chief Robert ""Bobby"" Arcos, both reported by the Los Angeles Times as finalists for the position.

The LAPD has faced criticism through the years over its response to the George Floyd protests and several high-profile shootings by officers. It has struggled to get rid of bad cops while also struggling to recruit as more officers leave its ranks than are coming in.

""I'm looking for a leader who will bring about significant change inside of the department,"" Bass said to the Los Angeles Times before the final pick was announced. ""I think the morale issue is really critical; my concern, of course, is law enforcement's interaction with communities, and it's pretty hard to have a positive interaction if the morale is really low.""

John Sullivan, who retired as a lieutenant in 2018 after 30 years at the county sheriff's department, called McDonnell a ""hybrid"" in the insider-outsider debate.

""He grew up in the organization, he knows the organization ... but he's also been the chief of a separate department, and he's also been sheriff,"" Sullivan said. McDonnell would bring a ""fresh set of eyes"" to the LAPD's problems while understanding the concerns of the rank-and-file.

At the LAPD, McDonnell held every rank from police officer to second-in-command under former LAPD chief Bill Bratton. During that time, he helped implement a federal consent decree imposed on the department largely as a result of the Rampart scandal, a corruption case involving rampant misconduct within the anti-gang unit.

When he was elected county sheriff, he inherited a department in the wake of a jail abuse corruption scandal that led to convictions against his predecessor, longtime Lee Baca, and more than 20 other officials. Members of a civilian watchdog commission applauded McDonnell for embracing federal mandates for jail reform, including improving de-escalation training and better documentation of force that has led to improved jail conditions, the Los Angeles Times reported.

In 2022, he joined the University of Southern California as director of the Safe Communities Institute, which conducts research on public safety solutions.

McDonnell also served on an advisory committee with McDonnell to USC's Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Threats and Emergencies, a U.S. Homeland Security department-funded institution to do research on counterterrorism, according to Sullivan. His experience with studying international security threats could be an asset as police chief.

""We have really large public events that are coming that could well be terrorist targets,"" Sullivan said, referring to the World Cup and Olympics. ""The war in Gaza, the brewing war in south Lebanon, all that's going to have echoes or ripples here in Los Angeles."""
US launches air attacks on Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/houthis-yemen-us-strikes-weapons-752dd1e5dd6c284a7909878f89c73149,2024-10-04T16:07:10Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. military struck a number of Houthi targets in Yemen on Friday, going after weapons systems, bases and other equipment belonging to the Iranian-backed rebels, a U.S. official confirmed.

U.S. aircraft and ships struck Houthi strongholds, according to the official. The exact number of targets was not yet available as the mission was just ending.

According to the Houthi media, seven strikes hit the airport in Hodeida, a major port city, and the Katheib area, which has a Houthi-controlled military base. Four more strikes hit the Seiyana area in Sanaa, the capital, and two strikes hit the Dhamar province.

The strikes come just days after the Houthis threatened ""escalating military operations"" targeting Israel after they apparently shot down a U.S. military drone flying over Yemen. And just last week, the group claimed responsibility for an attack targeting American warships.

The rebels fired more than a half dozen ballistic missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles and two drones at three U.S. ships that were traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, but all were intercepted by the Navy destroyers, according to several U.S. officials.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet publicly released.

Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza started last October. They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors.

Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels.

The group has maintained that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran."
"For Pittsburgh Jews, attack anniversary adds to an already grim October",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-antisemitism-israel-hamas-f6249df99d8a508ce2f5cfc1508656e7,2024-10-04T11:37:25Z,"PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jewish communities everywhere reacted with horror at last year's Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, but the approaching one-year commemoration of the assault hits home particularly hard in Pittsburgh's Jewish community, which already marks a grim anniversary each October.

It was here on Oct. 27, 2018, that a gunman carried out the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history, killing 11 worshippers from three congregations at the Tree of Life synagogue.

Adding to the intense feelings is the arrival of the Jewish High Holy Days -- days that bracket the Oct. 7 anniversary with rituals focused on mortality and recalling the deaths of loved ones and ancient martyrs. Many are taking consolation in the rituals as they mark an emotionally fraught milestone.

""The trauma here runs deep in our community,"" said Rabbi Seth Adelson of Congregation Beth Shalom, a Conservative synagogue near Tree of Life in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, the heart of Jewish Pittsburgh. ""You can't really separate the trauma of Jews being attacked in Pittsburgh and Jews being attacked in Israel.""

The attacks do have differences.

The Pittsburgh attack was carried out by a right-wing extremist who targeted Jews for their aid to immigrants. It was followed by widespread civic support for the Jewish community.

The Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, killed 1,200 Israelis and triggered a still-ongoing war in Gaza, whose health ministry says Israel has killed more than 41,500 Palestinians and wounded more than 96,000 others. Israel is now intensifying attacks on Hamas ally Hezbollah with deadly attacks in Lebanon, while Iran has attacked Israel with missiles.

The attacks have common threads, say local Jewish leaders. The synagogue attack violated the sanctuary of a place of worship. The Hamas attack has been followed by an upsurge of antisemitic incidents around the world.

""The similarity of what Oct. 7 and Oct. 27 hold together is a question of safety for Jews,"" said Maggie Feinstein, director of the 10.27 Healing Partnership, which aids those traumatized by the 2018 attack.

Emboldened far-right extremists have been spreading Holocaust denial and other antisemitic screeds. Some on the left have expressed antisemitism along with criticism of Israel's conduct of the war, while debate persists over the line between robust criticism and hate speech.

Nationally, nearly two-thirds of Jews feel less secure than they did a year previously, according to an American Jewish Committee survey earlier this year.

In Pittsburgh, a man was charged in September for allegedly attacking two university students wearing yarmulkes, the skullcap worn by observant Jews.

A synagogue and the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh office were targeted with graffiti. Parents of Jewish college students say their children have endured antisemitism amid protests critical of Israel.

Rabbi Daniel Yolkut of Congregation Poale Zedeck in Squirrel Hill said it's become ""unremarkable"" for his children to hear antisemitic slurs shouted by motorists.

Rabbi Adelson said that unlike in 2018, local Jews haven't felt widespread community solidarity.

""There's this feeling that Israel was attacked and then the attacks just continued here,"" he said.

Many in Pittsburgh have lived in Israel or have friends or relatives there. For Yolkut, one connection is especially poignant.

As a rabbi in Virginia years ago, his congregants included the family of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who in 2023 was taken hostage by Hamas.

""I remember him just as a small child running around my synagogue,"" Yolkut recalled. He was devastated to learn weeks ago that Goldberg-Polin was killed by Hamas at age 23, along with five other hostages.

As Oct. 7 approaches, Feinstein said Pittsburgh Jews are already familiar with the ""anniversary effect"" -- the emotional churn around a traumatic calendar date. Each year since 2019, the community has held memorial services honoring the 11 lives lost on 10/27, as the synagogue attack is known locally.

She reminds people that emotions around anniversaries are natural: ""Whatever we're feeling, we shouldn't feel shame.""

Members of all three congregations worshipping at Tree of Life were killed that Sabbath morning in 2018 -- the host congregation, Dor Hadash and New Light.

News of last year's Hamas raid arrived on another Sabbath, just weeks after the conclusion of a lengthy federal trial in which the Pittsburgh assailant was sentenced to death on 63 criminal counts.

That trial confirmed in previously unknown detail how the gunman absorbed white supremacist ideology online and spread the slander that Jews were bringing in immigrants of color to replace white Americans. He targeted Dor Hadash in particular for its support of a national Jewish agency that helps refugees.

Then came Oct. 7.

""The timing was very difficult because some people had not calmed down from their very high level of anxiety from the trial,"" said Rabbi Amy Bardack of Congregation Dor Hadash. Both attacks raised gut-level questions: ""Are Jews safe in the world?""

The war has worsened divisions on the left. Most U.S. Jews are liberal politically and vote Democratic, but many progressive Democrats have supported Palestinians and say Israel's attacks amount to war crimes and genocide -- charges that Israel and its supporters strenuously dispute.

Some Jewish groups dissent from the broad pro-Zionist consensus of established Jewish groups and oppose U.S. military aid to Israel.

Jewish community members acknowledge broad differences within their families and congregations, though most support Israel as a Jewish state and safe haven for Jews.

""Everybody wants peace,"" Adelson said, ""But there is a strong feeling that Israelis deserve to live in peace and not to be subject to the threats and rocket attacks from Hamas and Hezbollah.""

The disputes have flared locally, such as a recent failed effort by some Pittsburgh organizations to bar the city from doing business with entities linked to Israel.

Rebecca Elhassid now volunteers for the new Beacon Coalition, which researches local politicians' views on Israel and Jews.

Until now, ""we didn't think to understand what a city councilperson thought about the Jewish community they represent,"" she said.

""For many years, we were able to put our Jewish identity aside in terms of our social priorities,"" she said. ""We were able to dedicate much of our social resources toward supporting other marginalized communities and identifying other problems in societies. We are going to have to stand up for ourselves in a way we weren't aware we had to before.""

The danger from the far right was well-known, but antisemitism from parts of the progressive left has hit closer to home.

""All my old colleagues, with whom I've done many things over the years with civil rights and voting rights and gay rights and all kinds of women's rights, and I'm seeing them on the other side of an issue,"" said Tree of Life member Audrey Glickman, a survivor of the 2018 attack. ""That's been personally difficult for me, because it's hard to talk to people when they think you're choosing the wrong side.""

But she's determined to maintain dialogue and has continued to visit schools and other settings, spreading the word against antisemitism and other hatreds.

""If we don't talk to each other, we don't get anywhere,"" she said. ""I always feel more motivated to get our there and pull people together. If you don't keep your optimism going, what good is it?""

The High Holy Days add to the sober commemorations of this season.

""It's in our prayers that we need to understand the precariousness of life and our mortality,"" Bardack said. ""There's also joyful themes, but it's with the understanding that we don't know what the future holds.""

She said her congregation has had hard discussions about the war and Israeli policy. She sees her job as helping congregants navigate the complex moment.

""We can't control the Israel-Hamas war, and we can't control antisemitism,"" she said. ""There's only one thing we can control, which is how we treat each other, how we keep loving and kind connections to each other across differences of ideology.""

"Iranian supreme leader praises missile attack on Israel, says Iran will do it again if necessary",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-missile-strike-khamenei-2bce5479abfdac5fd953d5547d04941c,2024-10-04T10:57:48Z,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's supreme leader on Friday praised the country's recent missile strike on Israel and said it was ready to do it again if necessary, state TV reported.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in his first appearance as leader at Friday prayers in about five years, called the missile strike a ""shining"" job by Iran's armed forces.

On Tuesday, Iran launched at least 180 missiles at Israel, the latest in a series of rapidly escalating attacks between Israel and Iran and its allies that threaten to push the Middle East closer to a regionwide war. Israel said it intercepted many of the missiles, and officials in Washington said U.S. destroyers assisted in Israel's defense. Iran said most of its missiles hit their targets. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

Khamenei, 80, said in a 40-minute speech to thousands of people at the Mosalla mosque, the main prayer site in Tehran, that the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel nearly a year ago on Oct. 7, 2023, was a legitimate action by the Palestinian people.

He said Tuesday's missile barrage was based on international law, the country's law and Islamic beliefs.

He urged nations from ""Afghanistan to Yemen and from Iran to Gaza and Yemen"" to be ready to take action against the enemy, and praised those who had died doing so.

""Our resisting people in Lebanon and Palestine, you brave fighters, you loyal and patient people, these martyrdoms and the blood that was shed shouldn't shake your determination but make you more persistent,"" he said.

Khamenei gave half of the speech in Arabic as he addressed his comments to Arab nations.

Khamenei's last appearance at Friday prayers was after the death of Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in 2020 in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad.

A ceremony commemorating the death of Lebanese Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was held before Khamenei's speech. Most high-ranking Iranian officials, including President Masoud Pezeshkian and top Revolutionary Guard generals, attended the ceremony.

Iran is Hezbollah's main backer and has sent weapons and billions of dollars to the group.

Also on Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi arrived in Beirut, Lebanon, where he was expected to discuss ongoing fighting between Israel and Hezbollah with Lebanese officials.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei, said Iran sent a shipment of aid to Lebanon, including 10 tons of food and medicine."
Middle East latest: An Israeli airstrike cuts a major highway linking Lebanon with Syria,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-4-october-2024-22ce0cdc4813e1f0d657d67868a2da61,2024-10-04T07:02:41Z,"An Israeli airstrike has cut a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said Friday. The airstrike led to the closure of a road near the Masnaa Border Crossing, from where tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks.

On Tuesday, Israel began a ground incursion into Lebanon against the Hezbollah militant group while also conducting strikes in Gaza that killed dozens, including children. The Israeli military said nine soldiers have died in the conflict in southern Lebanon.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas' cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel declared war on the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.

Here is the latest:

BEIRUT -- Lebanon's state-run National News Agency says an Israeli airstrike has cut a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria.

The agency gave no further details about Friday's airstrike that led to the closure of a road near the Masnaa Border Crossing, from where tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. It's the first time this major border crossing has been cut off since the beginning of the war.

Lebanese General Security recorded more than 250,000 Syrian citizens and over 80,000 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory during the last week of September, after Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon.

Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles and damaged the road between Masnaa Border Crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous.

There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanon's minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state.

Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weapons from Iran via Syria. The Lebanese group has a presence on both sides of the border where it fights alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces.

SYDNEY -- Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Friday condemned the Iranian ambassador's comments praising a recently slain Hezbollah leader, but rejected opposition advice to expel the envoy.

Ambassador Ahmad Sadeghi described Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by an Israeli missile strike in September in Lebanon, as a ""remarkable leader"" on social media.

""The government condemns any support for terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah. We condemn the ambassador's comments,"" Albanese told reporters in Sydney.

""Australia has maintained a relationship with Iran since 1968 that has been continuous. Not because we agree with the regime, but because it's in Australia's national interest,"" Albanese added.

Opposition leader Peter Dutton, who could become prime minister at elections due by May, called for Sadeghi to be expelled over his post. Dutton described Sadeghi's words as ""completely and utterly at odds with what is in our country's best interests.""

Sadeghi did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.

Australia officially rebuked Sadeghi in August for endorsing Hamas spiritual leader Ahmed Yassin's hope that ""wiping out the Zionist plague out of the holy lands of Palestine happens no later than 2027."""
Israeli airstrikes rock southern suburbs of Beirut and cut off a key crossing into Syria,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-4-october-2024-5f2e512d5334b6f7fd7f5a46400e6979,2024-10-04T06:57:13Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Israel carried out a series of massive airstrikes overnight in southern suburbs of Beirut and another that cut off the main border crossing between Lebanon and Syria.

The new wave of strikes came after Israel warned people to evacuate communities in southern Lebanon that are outside a United Nations-declared buffer zone, as the yearlong conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah escalates.

Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon on Tuesday and its forces have been clashing with Hezbollah militants in a narrow strip along the border. A series of attacks before the incursion killed some of the group's key members, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah.

The blasts overnight rocked Beirut's southern suburbs, sending huge plumes of smoke and flames into the night sky and shaking buildings kilometers (miles) away in the Lebanese capital. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on what the intended target was, and there was no information immediately available on casualties.

Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that there were more than 10 consecutive airstrikes in the area late Thursday.

The agency also reported that an Israeli airstrike led to the closure of the road near the busy Masnaa Border Crossing, from which tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. It gave no other details.

The airstrike that cut the busiest border crossing between the two countries came a day after an Israeli military spokesperson said Lebanon's Hezbollah has been trying to transport military equipment through the border crossing.

Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weaponry from Iran via Syria. The group has a presence on both sides of the border, a region where it has been fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces.

Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles, damaging the road between Masnaa Border Crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous.

It was the first time this major border crossing has been cut off since the beginning of the war. Lebanese General Security recorded 256,614 Syrian citizens and 82,264 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory between Sept. 23 -- when the Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon -- and Sept. 30.

There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanon's minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across Lebanon's southern border almost daily since the day after Hamas' cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, in which the militants killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage.

Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it carried out a strike Thursday in Tulkarem, a militant stronghold in the West Bank, in coordination with the Shin Bet internal security service.

The Palestinian Health Ministry said 18 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a refugee camp there.

Violence has flared across the Israeli-occupied territory since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October 2023. Tulkarem and other northern cities have seen some of the worst violence.

Israel declared war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip in response to their Oct. 7 attack. More than 41,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in that time, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry."
"A year later, Israeli survivors reflect on the lingering toll of Oct. 7",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-war-anniversary-survivors-fb65aa677e344a873566dc948d6bf52a,2024-10-04T04:38:08Z,"Lilach Almog walks past the remains of a police station seized by Hamas militants and buildings pockmarked by bullets in her southern Israeli town multiple times a day.

""Every corner has become a memorial,"" she said. ""Even if you want to forget for a bit, you can't. You look outside at the wall and it reminds you of everything all over again.""

Almog joined the roughly 120,000 Israelis displaced by the Israel-Hamas war but has returned home to constant reminders of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack.

A year later, survivors reflect on that day that changed everything. They hid in bedrooms, bomb shelters, safe rooms and beneath trees as Hamas militants poured across the border. In the aftermath, they've mourned loved ones, struggled with anxiety, suffered survivor's guilt and questioned whether they will ever return home to places that still bear the scars of their ordeal.

The force of a blast at the police station across from her apartment building knocked Almog off her feet on Oct. 7.

She had scrambled to her home's fortified room after air raid sirens sounded in Sderot and watched from the window in disbelief as dozens of gunmen walked down her street with rocket-propelled grenades on their shoulders.

They seized the police station, and a dayslong battle raged before the Israeli military bulldozed the building with militants still inside. More than 30 civilians and police officers were killed in the area around the station.

Almog fled Sderot with her children and mother, living in a hotel in Tel Aviv for eight months, but government assistance ran out in August, forcing her to return to Sderot and memories of that day, when Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 250 hostage.

The resulting war has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians but says more than half were women and children.

The anxiety of the past year has overwhelmed her, forcing her to leave her work as an architect and interior designer and go on disability leave. Her 9-year-old son began wetting the bed. Her 11-year-old daughter refuses to go anywhere without her.

""As long as the war is still continuing, there's no way to feel calm, to return to our lives,"" she said. ""We still have the hostages there. We still have nightmares. There's no end.""

When Ziv Abud spotted the bomb shelter on the side of the road as she was trying to escape the attack on the Nova music festival, she breathed a sigh of relief, thinking it would be a safe place to wait out the rockets.

""We know now that the shelter we went into was basically going into a death trap,"" she said.

Nearly 30 people had crammed into the concrete shelter meant to hold about 10. When Hamas militants arrived, they started tossing grenades inside.

A former soldier was able to toss out eight grenades, but the ninth exploded inside the shelter, instantly killing about half the people, Abud said. In the smoke and chaos, militants grabbed people to take as hostages and sprayed the shelter with bullets.

Abud survived, protected by the crush of bodies above her. When she opened her eyes, she saw the bodies of her nephew and his girlfriend but no trace of her boyfriend, Eliya Cohen. Four people, including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, were kidnapped, and six others survived.

Over the past year, Abud has campaigned tirelessly for the hostages and flown around the world to press for Cohen's return.

""I think less about my own trauma, just how to bring Eliyah home,"" she said.

Shlomo and Hanna'le Margalit still struggle to comprehend how they survived.

All of the residents on both sides of their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz were killed or kidnapped on Oct. 7. Hamas militants entered their home three times but did not go into the safe room where they were hiding.

Of Nir Oz's nearly 400 residents, 42 were killed and 75 were kidnapped that day. But the couple, part of the founding generation on the kibbutz, was spared.

The Margalits have been married for 64 years and lived in Nir Oz nearly all that time, working to transform the barren desert into a village filled with towering trees and green lawns. The kibbutz was devastated by the attack and will take years to rebuild, though questions remain about how -- or even if -- it should be.

Like most of the residents of Nir Oz, the couple is living in temporary housing, a development of new apartment buildings about an hour northeast.

""I still can't think about what was lost. I think for me that will happen much later,"" Hanna'le Margalit said. ""Right now, all the energy and our work is for survival, to get used to a new place, to hope the hostages will come home.""

Shlomo Margalit returns to the kibbutz about once a week to care for the cemetery, a job he held before Oct. 7. But now many graves have been added. Each time he is there, he chooses one person and goes to their ruined house to properly bid them farewell.

""It's too many to do all at once,"" he said. ""It's too sad and too hard. It's impossible.""

Eilat Shalev remembers that the pomelos -- large citrus fruits -- were about to be harvested a few days after Oct. 7 in southern Israel.

She knows that because farmers had already set out large collection bins, which she hid behind as Hamas militants overran the road leading to the Nova music festival, where she had been dancing with her husband, Shai.

The two got separated as militants began shooting at their car. Shalev ran toward nearby fields, jumping in and out of vehicles, until she found herself near a pomelo orchard.

""I grabbed the first tree I saw on the left side. I hid with my hands on my head and my face in the earth, just praying to God that God will rescue me so I will live and return to my kids,"" she said.

Minutes later, a bullet hit just centimeters from her head. She played dead for hours before making her way back to the road. Eventually, Israeli security forces brought her to a police station. As the hours passed and her husband didn't make contact, she grew increasingly worried. He was pronounced dead five days later.

Shalev said she and her four children, ages 12 to 23, have turned to Judaism for comfort. But she has trouble sleeping at night and struggles to run her household alone.

""As the days go by, one day and another day and another day, it's actually getting worse. It doesn't get better,"" Shalev said. ""Missing him gets stronger because you understand more and more that he's not coming back. He's really not coming back.""

After 54 days in captivity in Gaza, Liat Atzili was determined to return to her work as a high school history and civics teacher to wrest back control of her identity.

""I feel most comfortable and most at ease, and it's the thing that comes the most naturally for me to be in a classroom,"" she said. ""It's a real connection to what I used to be like and what my life was before.""

She counts herself lucky to have been held in an apartment in conditions much better than the hostages kept in underground tunnels. Still, during her captivity, Atzili had no idea whether her family had survived.

The day after her release as part of a November cease-fire deal, the Israeli military announced that her husband, Aviv, had been killed and his body was being held in Gaza. Two of her three children were on the kibbutz, and both survived.

The upcoming anniversary is more difficult than Atzili anticipated, a milestone for how much she has lost over the past year. On Oct. 7, she plans for at least part of the day to stay in bed and watch ""Dirty Dancing.""

Next month, Atzili hopes to return to one of her passions, giving tours at Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust Museum. She understands the parallels people want to draw between the Holocaust and what happened to her, but the reality in the Middle East is different, she said.

""The Israeli Jews sort of wish that the Palestinians disappeared, and the Palestinians sort of wish that the Jews disappeared, but that's not going to happen,"" she said. ""Nobody's going anywhere. We don't have to love each other, but we have to get along, and we have to find a way that everybody can live here in safety."""
UN peacekeepers stay on Lebanon's border despite Israeli ground incursion,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/un-peacekeepers-lebanon-israel-unifil-5e2e4a7c8ba5d28eb8556e38536c44a1,2024-10-04T01:07:41Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. peacekeepers are staying in their positions on Lebanon's southern border despite Israel's request to vacate some areas before it launched its ground operation against Hezbollah militants, the U.N. peacekeeping chief said Thursday.

Jean-Pierre Lacroix said the commander and liaison officers from the U.N. force, known as UNIFIL, also are in constant contact with their counterparts in the Israeli and Lebanese militaries. He called that key to protecting the U.N.'s more than 10,000 peacekeepers.

The U.N. force is ""the only channel of communications between the parties,"" he told reporters. ""The peacekeepers are also working with partners to do what they can to protect the population.""

UNIFIL was created to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon after Israel's 1978 invasion. The U.N. expanded its mission following the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, allowing peacekeepers to deploy along the Israeli border.

A U.N. Security Council resolution ending that war demanded that all armed groups -- including Hezbollah -- be disarmed and that the Lebanese army deploy throughout the country to the Israeli border. After 17 years, neither has happened.

Lacroix, who is undersecretary-general for peace operations, said UNIFIL had anticipated ""a limited, targeted ground operation"" and had thoroughly discussed whether U.N. peacekeepers should stay or not, deciding they should stay for now.

""We're constantly reviewing the situation"" on the ground in terms of the safety and security of the peacekeepers, he said. He added that contingency plans are ready but refused to discuss them.

Lacroix also stressed that Israel and Hezbollah have an obligation to protect the U.N. peacekeepers.

Israeli ground forces crossed into southern Lebanon early Tuesday, which along with stepped-up airstrikes marked a significant escalation against Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants and of the war in the Middle East. The fighting comes as the region braces for Israel's response to Iran's ballistic missile attack.

Hezbollah began firing across the border after Iranian-backed Hamas militants carried out attacks on Israel on Oct. 7 and then Israel retaliated with its military offensive in Gaza.

Lacroix said that there were a few ""issues"" after Israel's ground operation in Lebanon began, which he wouldn't go into, but that the U.N. liaison mechanism with its Israeli and Lebanese counterparts was ""effective in addressing those issues.""

Lacroix said UNIFIL at the moment is not carrying out patrols, which it would normally do, but its positions are manned. In some places, the number of peacekeepers has been reduced by about 20%, he said.

When Lacroix was asked whether Israeli fire was coming too close to its bases or positions, he replied that one of the added values of the liaison operation is ""to prevent and deal with possible incidents that would have the potential of affecting the safety, the security of our peacekeepers.""

The liaison officers also are dealing with other activities, including military movements, he said.

Lacroix said UNIFIL had been supporting civilian efforts to supply humanitarian assistance to people in southern Lebanon. The peacekeepers are still trying to help and ""are playing a role as much as possible,"" he said."
US arranges flights to bring Americans out of Lebanon as others seek escape,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-flights-war-ddfa44888c713be095a75f710beed6b2,2024-10-04T00:47:05Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S.-arranged flights have brought about 250 Americans and their relatives out of Lebanon this week during escalated fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, while thousands of others still there face airstrikes and diminishing commercial flights.

In Washington, senior State Department and White House officials met Thursday with two top Arab American officials to discuss U.S. efforts to help American citizens leave Lebanon. The two leaders also separately met with officials from the Department of Homeland Security.

Michigan state Rep. Alabas Farhat and Abed Ayoub, executive director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, used the White House meeting to ""really drive home a lot of important points about the issues our community members are facing on the ground and a lot of the logistical problems that they're encountering with it when it comes to this evacuation,"" Ayoub said.

Some officials and community leaders in Michigan, home to the nation's largest concentration of Arab Americans, are calling on the U.S. to start an evacuation. Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said that was not being considered right now.

""The U.S. military is, of course, on the ready and has a whole wide range of plans. Should we need to evacuate American citizens out of Lebanon, we absolutely can,"" Singh told reporters. She added, ""We haven't been called to do that.""

Israel has stepped up airstrikes and launched a ground incursion into southern Lebanon targeting Iranian-backed Hezbollah militant leaders. Iran on Tuesday fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles toward Israel, stoking fears that the escalating attacks, including an Israeli response, will explode into an all-out regional war.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas, another Iranian-backed militant group, attacked Israel on Oct. 7, triggering the war in Gaza.

Other countries, from Greece to the United Kingdom, Japan and Colombia, have arranged flights or sent military planes to ferry out their citizens.

A U.S. family was mourning Kamel Ahmad Jawad, a resident of metro Detroit's Dearborn area, who was killed in southern Lebanon on Tuesday after they say he stayed to help civilians too old, infirm or poor to flee.

He had been on the phone with his daughter Tuesday when the impact of a strike knocked him off his feet, his daughter, Nadine Kamel Jawad, said in a statement.

""He simply got up, found his phone, and told me he needed to finish praying in case another strike hit him,"" she said.

The State Department has been telling Americans for almost a year not to travel to Lebanon and advising Americans to leave the country on commercial flights for months. It also has made clear that government-run evacuations are rare, while offering emergency loans to aid travel out of Lebanon.

Some Americans said their relatives who are U.S. citizens or green-card holders have been struggling for days or weeks to get seats on flights out of Lebanon. They say limits on withdrawing money from banks due to Lebanon's longstanding economic collapse and intermittent electricity and internet have made it difficult.

Rebecca Abou-Chedid, a lawyer based in Washington, said she paid $5,000 to get a female relative on the last seat of a flight out of Beirut on Saturday.

""She was on her way to the airport"" when Israeli began one of its first days of intensified bombing, Abou-Chedid said Thursday.

Jenna Shami, a Lebanese American in Dearborn, Michigan, described American citizens and green-card holders in her family struggling to contact the U.S. Embassy after airstrikes forced some from their lodgings in Lebanon.

The family had tried for weeks to get seats on commercial flights out, facing increasing ticket prices and cancellations, she said.

The U.S. Embassy offered loans for charter flights, but Americans on their own could find no planes to hire, she said.

Shami and another family, of a Lebanese American military veteran from Texas, said their loved ones had just gotten tickets for upcoming flights and that they were hopeful.

State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the U.S. would continue to organize flights as long the security situation in Lebanon is dire and there is demand.

Miller said Lebanon's flag carrier, Middle East Airlines, also had set aside about 1,400 seats on flights for Americans over the past week. Several hundred had taken them, he said.

Miller could not speak to the cost of the airline's flights, over which the U.S. government has no regulatory oversight, but said the maximum fare that would be charged for a U.S.-organized contract flight would be $283 per person.

More than 6,000 American citizens have contacted the U.S. Embassy in Beirut seeking information about departing the country over the past week.

Not all of those have actually sought assistance in leaving, and Miller said the department understood that some Americans, many of them dual U.S.-Lebanese nationals and longtime residents of the country, may choose to stay.

Miller said the embassy is prepared to offer temporary loans to Americans who choose to remain in Lebanon but want to relocate to a potentially safer area of the country. The embassy also would provide emergency loans to Americans who wish to leave on the U.S.-contracted flights.

FIFA opts not to suspend Israel but will investigate Palestinian claims of discrimination,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/fifa-israel-palestinian-soccer-5b78239c70c568877c89695e2dcd0721,2024-10-03T16:15:19Z,"ZURICH (AP) -- FIFA stopped short of suspending the Israeli soccer federation on Thursday, but asked for a disciplinary investigation of possible discrimination alleged by Palestinian soccer officials.

A senior FIFA panel overseeing governance will separately investigate ""the participation in Israeli competitions of Israeli football teams allegedly based in the territory of Palestine,"" soccer's governing body said after a meeting of its ruling Council.

The Palestinian soccer federation has consistently asked FIFA for more than a decade to take action against the Israeli soccer body for incorporating teams from West Bank settlements in its leagues.

The compromise decisions came more than four months after Palestinian officials had urged FIFA to suspend Israel's membership at a meeting in May.

The request to FIFA's congress in May also cited ""international law violations"" in Gaza during the Israel-Hamas conflict and directed the soccer body to its statutory commitments on human rights and against discrimination.

FIFA delayed making a decision in May until after a legal review scheduled for July, then pushed back the issue two more times until the meeting Thursday.

""The FIFA Council has implemented due diligence on this very sensitive matter and, based on a thorough assessment, we have followed the advice of the independent experts,"" FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in a statement.

The latest process follows a pattern -- under Infantino and his predecessor Sepp Blatter -- of Palestinian requests for FIFA to uphold its legal statutes and the question then being steered toward ad hoc panels and other committees.

FIFA gave no timetable Thursday for the investigations it has not requested."
"In time for Oct. 7 anniversary, a new film documents Hamas' attack on Israel music festival",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-nova-film-massacre-60e0f57009f10065a5ce556e5c97feeb,2024-10-03T15:41:04Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Horror came with sunrise following an all-night rave near the Gaza border on Oct. 7, 2023, the Hamas attack presaged by rockets that some young people mistakenly thought were fireworks.

A new documentary shows the attack unfold over the next hours in stomach-churning detail: Gunmen mowing down passengers in cars that try to escape. Hiding in a garbage dumpster, or a refrigerator, to avoid detection. Live grenades tossed into a bunker, then thrown out seconds before exploding. Terrified hostages carried away to an uncertain fate.

Veteran news producer Susan Zirinsky calls ""We Will Dance Again"" the most significant project she's ever worked on, notable praise considering her ""9/11"" film is arguably the best video document of that day.

How much it is seen, however, may depend as much on context as content.

The film is now streaming on the Paramount+ service and debuted last weekend on Showtime, in advance of the attack's one-year anniversary. Distributors acknowledge, however, that it has been a hard sell in markets across the world: many potential outlets and film festivals did not want to wade into a hot-button political issue with war in the Mideast grinding on.

A message at the film's beginning acknowledges that the human cost of the Oct. 7 massacre and the war that followed in Gaza ""has been catastrophic for both Israelis and Palestinians"" and lists the death toll on both sides. ""This film cannot tell everyone's story,"" it says.

The message does not appear, however, when ""We Will Dance Again"" is screened in Israel.

""We are documenting a moment in history,"" Zirinsky said. ""This is not a political film. This happened.""

The former CBS News president is now chief of See It Now Studios and, with colleague Terence Wrong, has made a specialty of filmed recountings of major events, like the ""11 Minutes"" series about the 2017 mass shooting at a country music concert in Las Vegas. With cameras in everyone's pocket, there's a rich trove of raw material to bring these stories to life.

She was keenly interested when she learned of Israeli director Yariv Mozer, a former Israeli soldier who grabbed a camera and was one of the first non-officials given access to the scene. The haunting pictures of the hellscape he found illuminate the film's opening moments. What Mozer had already completed didn't need a lot of work, she said.

Mozer weaves an intimate story of that morning through interviews with survivors and cellphone video many had saved. One of his executive producers also acquired material taken by Hamas fighters later killed. ""She didn't tell me how and I didn't ask,"" he said.

That access enabled the scene of the grenades tossed back and forth, almost a cartoonish sequence if the explosions didn't illustrate the life-and-death consequences.

The killings that day weren't confined to the concert site. But Mozer quickly determined he wanted to concentrate his film on the people who were there.

""They were beautiful, young, young in spirit,"" he said. ""Naive in a way.""

The film is graphic and obviously not easy to watch. Zirinsky and Wrong had arguments over how much could be shown; there are a handful of spots where the picture is blurred out, in some cases to avoid showing expressions on the faces of victims. Critic Jacqueline Cutler wrote in The Daily Beast: ""There is no sugarcoating this. 'We Will Dance Again' is the most harrowing documentary I have ever seen.""

Although the film is being offered on a streaming service and premium cable network in the U.S., getting exposure in the rest of the world has not been easy. Distributors made a deal to show it on the BBC, on the condition that it not describe Hamas as a terrorist organization.

Several film festivals rejected ""We Will Dance Again,"" in part because they worried about political fallout, and the rushed effort to make it publicly available for the first anniversary meant some deadlines were missed, said Michael Schmidt, president of the Sipur, an Israel-based studio that has worked on the project.

Its only film festival appearance was in New Zealand, said Schmidt, who would not name the festivals that had rejected it.

One European buyer expressed interest but said it needed to be approved by its board. That was the last he heard from them. Some interested in showing the film wanted changes to reflect a Palestinian point of view, or required that it be aired together with a Palestinian documentary, he said.

Streaming services, which unlike many cable television networks have a direct-to-consumer subscriber relationship, were particularly reluctant to get involved, Schmidt said. Again, he would not specify who rejected the film.

The goal wasn't to create a political controversy, but to document a moment in history. ""We are in this for the long game,"" he said.

See It Now is open to projects that approach the war in Gaza from a Palestinian point of view, and has already taken some pitches. ""Our only qualification is that it's excellent,"" Wrong said.

The company has resisted outreach from Israeli groups, including one effort by the Israeli foreign ministry to show the film at the United Nations, Zirinsky said. The idea is to avoid any appearance that the work could be used as a propaganda film.

Despite the complications involved, she said, ""I am very happy that we stood up to do this.""

Toward the end of the film, one of the survivors says friends lost that day that ""I'm hoping that wherever they are, they're partying like crazy. And one day, we will, too.""

Such a day seemed in the distant future for Eitan Halley, one of the survivors interviewed who attended a recent screening of the film in New York. He said he's determined that the truth of what happened that day get out, particularly when conspiracy theories suggest it didn't happen. He admitted to his emotional struggles, including survivor's guilt. Zirinsky suggested keeping the memories alive serve an important purpose.

Israeli military says it killed a senior Hamas leader in a Gaza strike earlier this year,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-war-news-10-03-2024-5fad98f56ebcc7e1751388b608c7c8dd,2024-10-03T09:09:19Z,"JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli military said Thursday that it killed a senior Hamas leader in an airstrike in the Gaza Strip around three months ago.

It said that a strike on an underground compound in northern Gaza killed Rawhi Mushtaha and two other Hamas commanders, Sameh Siraj and Sameh Oudeh.

There was no immediate comment from Hamas.

The military said the three commanders had taken refuge in a fortified underground compound in northern Gaza that served as a command and control center.

It said Mushtaha was a close associate of Yahya Sinwar, the top leader of Hamas who helped mastermind the Oct. 7 attack into Israel that triggered the war.

Sinwar is believed to be alive and in hiding inside Gaza."
UN calls Israel's ban on its top leader a political statement in long-running rift,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-israel-secretary-general-guterres-a929dda6e7c211cf3c2c8277dd88dffe,2024-10-02T20:53:42Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations on Wednesday called Israel's ban on Secretary-General Antonio Guterres entering the country a political statement by its foreign minister and stressed that the world body's contacts with Israel will continue ""because they have to.""

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters that Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz deeming the U.N. chief ""persona non grata"" is also ""one more attack on the United Nations staff that we've seen from the government of Israel.""

Israel's accusations of U.N. bias and antisemitism date back decades, but the rift has intensified since Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks in the country's south killed about 1,200 people and launched the war in Gaza. Israel's offensive against the militant group has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters but that a little more than half were women and children.

An Israeli ground incursion in Lebanon and other attacks against Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group also backed by Iran, and an Iranian missile strike against Israel on Tuesday have threatened to plunge the Middle East into all-out war. The U.N. Security Council held an emergency meeting Wednesday on the Middle East.

Guterres didn't respond to a question about the ban as he headed to the meeting, where he demanded a halt to the escalation of ""tit-for-tat violence"" that he warned is leading people in the Middle East ""straight over the cliff.""

Earlier in the day, Katz accused Guterres of being biased against Israel and claimed the U.N. chief never condemned the Hamas attacks and sexual violence committed by its fighters.

Dujarric strongly disagreed, saying Guterres has condemned ""over and over again the terror attacks, the acts of sexual violence and other horrors that we've seen.""

But the Israeli government strongly objected to the secretary-general's phrase in his initial condemnation that said Hamas' attack didn't happen ""in a vacuum.""

Israel also has accused staff from the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees, called UNRWA -- the key provider of assistance in Gaza, of being Hamas members and participating in the Oct. 7 attacks and has curtailed their activities.

The U.N.'s internal watchdog has been investigating those Israeli allegations. UNRWA said Monday that a top Hamas commander killed in Lebanon was an employee who had been suspended since allegations of his ties to the militant group emerged in March.

UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini has accused Israel of trying to destroy its operations. The agency provides education, health care, food and other services to several million Palestinians and their families.

Guterres also has accused Israel of ""collective punishment"" of Palestinians in its nearly yearlong military response to the Hamas attacks in Gaza, saying he has not seen so much death and destruction during his seven years as secretary-general.

Dujarric said that in his 24 years at the U.N., there have been U.N. staff declared persona non grata by a country but that he didn't know of a secretary-general being banned.

He stressed that the United Nations has never recognized the concept being applied to U.N. staff.

Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the practice applies to a country declaring a diplomat persona non grata -- not an international organization.

""We continue our contacts with Israel at the operational level and other levels, because we need to,"" Dujarric said."
Javier Bardem on Gaza: 'We cannot remain indifferent' in call for hostage release and cease-fire,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/javier-bardem-gaza-israel-c9366d69afd1395c2b09c09415c187ed,2024-10-02T16:15:22Z,"Javier Bardem was no longer comfortable being silent on Gaza.

The Spanish actor spoke out about the Israeli-Hamas conflict upon accepting an award at the San Sebastian Film Festival last week. In his nuanced remarks, Bardem condemned the Hamas attacks as well as the ""massive punishment that the Palestinian population is enduring.""

He called for immediate cease-fire, Hamas' release of hostages and for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Hamas leaders -- some of whom are now dead -- who ordered the Oct. 7 attacks to be judged by the International Criminal Court.

In an interview with The Associated Press, Bardem explained why he chose to speak out.

""I believe that we can and must help bring peace. If we take a different approach, then we will get different results,"" Bardem told the AP, speaking prior to Iran's attack on Israel Tuesday. ""The security and prosperity of Israel and the health and future of a free Palestine will only be possible through a culture of peace, coexistence and respect.""

Israel's offensive has already killed over 40,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, displaced the vast majority of Gaza's 2.3 million residents and destroyed much of the impoverished territory. Palestinian militants are still holding some 110 hostages captured in the Oct. 7 attack that started the war, in which they killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Around a third of the 110 are already dead, according to Israeli authorities.

The war has drawn sharp divisions in Hollywood over the past year, where public support of Israel or Palestine has provoked backlash and bullying, with accusations of antisemitism and Islamophobia, and cost people jobs. Even silence has had its consequences. The #blockout2024 movement pressured celebrities who hadn't said anything -- or enough -- to take a stand.

""Why now?"" Bardem said. ""Because to continue to stall negotiations and return to the previous status quo, as they say, or as we are seeing now, embark on a race to further violations of international law would be to perpetuate the war and eventually lead us off a cliff.""

Bardem stressed that while antisemitism and Islamophobia are real and serious problems in the U.S., Europe and beyond, that the terms are being used to divert attention away from the ""legitimate right to criticize the actions of the Israeli government and of Hamas.

""We're witnessing crimes against human rights, crimes under international law, such as, for example, the banning of food, water, medicines, electricity, using, as UNICEF says, war against children and the trauma that's being created for generations,"" Bardem said. ""We cannot remain indifferent to that.""

The Oscar-winner, who was born in the Canary Islands and raised Catholic but no longer practices, has spoken up on global issues before, signing an open letter calling for peace during a 2014 conflict between Israel and Hamas, and a few years earlier speaking to a United Nations committee about refugees in Western Sahara, which he narrated a documentary about. He's also an environmental advocate, and spoke to the UN in 2019 about protecting the oceans.

""My mother educated me on the importance of treating all human beings equally, regardless of skin color, ethnicity, religion, nationality, socio and economic status, ability or sexuality,"" Bardem said. ""Actions inform us and that alone interests me about people. That's why I have always been concerned about discrimination of any kind. That includes antisemitism and Islamophobia.""

Bardem is married to Penélope Cruz, with whom he shares two children.

He said that beyond a fear that the framework of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is in danger, he has seen the effects of the conflict up close and the promise of a different approach. Two of his close friends, one Israeli, one Palestinian, both lost daughters to violence years ago and have bonded together in their shared pain and desire to help create positive change.

Those fathers, Bassam Aramin and Rami Elhanan, are members of a nonprofit organization called The Parents Circle Families Forum that emphasizes reconciliation. They wrote a letter that Bardem shared: ""What happened to us is like nuclear energy. You can use it for more destruction. Or you can use it to bring light. Losing your daughter is painful in both situations. But we love our life. We want to exist. So we use this pain to support change. To build bridges, not to dig graves.""

Bardem added: ""That's what it should be about: Building bridges, not digging graves. That's why it's urgent and important."""
Are LGBTQ Jews welcome in Orthodox communities? This is how they are building spaces of their own,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/jewish-orthodox-lgbtq-high-holidays-601c0782d8bb02494552823db1fb7525,2024-10-02T12:11:53Z,"It was a heart-wrenching choice. But when Daniel Gammerman decided to never set foot back in an Orthodox synagogue, he thought of it as an act of love. Not toward the Jewish community he was born into, but to himself.

""A synagogue is a spiritual place, but it's also a community place,"" said Gammerman, 47, from his home in Miami. ""If I have to basically check at the door half of my identity in order to come in, I don't feel that's welcoming enough for me.""

Dozens of LGBTQ+ Jews like him have struggled to find support and acceptance within their Orthodox communities. Most were raised with little knowledge of what being gay or queer meant. They just felt different, but found it hard to ask their rabbis: ""This is who I am, is there still room for me here?""

""The way it mostly works is invisibility,"" Gammerman said. ""There's no addressing the existence of LGBT people among us. And, whenever you hear something about it, of course it's negative.""

He can't put his finger on a specific date in which he realized he was gay. But he remembers clearly what happened to him when the news got out.

""I used to get enormous texts from different people trying to explain to me how this was wrong,"" Gammerman said. ""It was a bombardment of people trying to fix me.""

Grandson to Eastern European Jews who fled during World War II, Gammerman was born in Brazil. He moved to the U.S. after finishing high school in the 1990s and continued his studies at a Jewish Orthodox university. At age 21, he got married. He and his wife -- who he still thinks of as a friend -- raised four children together.

""We built a perfect family,"" he said. ""I checked all the boxes of what a nice Jewish Orthodox family is supposed to be.""

Afraid to destroy his future and his children's lives, he shut down his feelings for years, until he could do it no more.

He initially traveled to Brazil and met with a therapist who counseled gay men in heterosexual marriages. That helped, Gammerman said, but something was missing. What about his life within an Orthodox religious community that didn't even acknowledge that LGBTQ+ people exist?

Embracing his true identity felt easier after meeting Steven Greenberg, an openly gay rabbi who founded Eshel, a U.S.-based organization focused on connecting LGBTQ+ Orthodox Jewish communities.

According to Miryam Kabakov, Eshel's executive director, most of the people who reach out share similar concerns: I'm coming out and I've been part of this community my whole life. Can I still belong? What will happen to me now? Can you find a rabbi who can help me?

""We guide them toward religious leaders who will tell them that there's still a place for them,"" Kabakov said. ""That they still have the religious obligations and expectations that they've always had and that they should stay true to their heart and their tradition if that's what they want.""

Ely Winkler, a 37-year-old LGBTQ+ Orthodox Jew from Brooklyn, will soon be back at an Orthodox synagogue after years of distancing himself from his community.

""After the war broke out between Israel and Gaza, I felt a deeper calling,"" he said. ""I didn't feel strong enough to stand up for myself, for my beliefs, and I knew that I needed to strengthen my Judaism, to remember who I was.""

Abrielle Fuerst, 32, moved from Texas to Philadelphia six years ago. Eshel helped her to connect with a local rabbi and an inclusive synagogue.

""Here it's not: 'Oh, come because you are Jewish and gay, we'll accept you.' It's just: 'Hello, you're Jewish, thanks for being in this space and it's nice to meet you.'""

One of Eshel's projects, named the ""Welcoming Shuls,"" enlists more than 200 rabbis who work across North America to make their synagogues hospitable for LGBTQ+ people. Many of them consent to being publicly identified; others ask to keep a low profile, foreseeing hostile reactions within their Orthodox communities.

""A lot of rabbis are very afraid to be public because they'll get ostracized,"" Kabakov said. ""But we know they're there.""

The group also counsels Orthodox LGBTQ+ Jews who wish to keep a distance from their religion.

""People who don't want to be religious anymore are torn up about it,"" Kabakov said. ""But we try to help them through the struggle and let them know that they can be gay and be religious. It might be hard to find a place, but we're working on that.""

Gammerman has tried to go back to Orthodox synagogues since he came out. Until now, none in Miami have made him feel truly accepted.

""I've tried many times, but it's like wearing a costume,"" he said. ""At some point I was able to live with that. But the more you accept yourself, the more you love yourself, you just cannot do it.""

His Orthodox community did not prevent him from attending religious services after he came out, but rejection was still there. People stopped greeting him, and he was no longer allowed to officiate services at his synagogue. Once, during a speech, the rabbi looked at him and said: ""Homosexuality is destroying humanity and if this continues like this, there'll be no more children in the world.""

""I lost friendships, relationships, participation and community,"" Gammerman said. ""It was all gone really, really fast.""

Meeting Greenberg, who is married to another man and has a child, helped him realize he could still live a happy, fulfilling life. After their encounter, Gammerman decided to talk to his wife. The couple separated and found a way to break the news to their children.

""Since then, I have rebuilt my life,"" he said. ""I remarried. I have a husband. My children are part of my life and they understand.""

In time, he realized that not only his family, but his approach toward his religion would also need to change. At first he tried to attend liberal Reform synagogues, some of which fully embrace LGBTQ+ worshippers, but having been raised an Orthodox Jew, he still felt out of place.

""Being LGBT is a whole identity,"" Gammerman said. ""And I want to be embraced in a place where there are no buts or ifs.""

He'd rather not label his current religious observance, but Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur still bear huge significance for him. So, every year, during the High Holy Days, he wakes up early, dresses nicely and opens his prayer book.

""I say the prayers from beginning to end,"" Gammerman said. ""I call to all the praises as if I was in a synagogue, but I do it by myself in my house.""

He was once taught that Jewish prayer required at least 10 men to be conducted, but he has learned a few things since.

""If I was given a switch that I could press to change who I am, I would not do it,"" he said. ""God made me like this, so it's not up for me to switch. I have to love myself for who I am.""

Middle East latest: Iran and Israel swap threats following missile barrage,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-2-october-2024-9e71114e59ce259511eba59833c84426,2024-10-02T05:17:10Z,"The Middle East moved closer to a long-feared regional war the day after Iran fired a barrage of missiles at Israel and Israel said it began limited ground incursions into Lebanon targeting the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia.

Israel said it intercepted many of the missiles, and officials in Washington said U.S. destroyers assisted in Israel's defense. Iran said most of its missiles hit their targets. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed late Tuesday to retaliate against Iran, which he said ""made a big mistake tonight and it will pay for it."" An Iranian commander threatened wider strikes on infrastructure if Israel retaliates against Iran's territory.

The United Nations Security Council called an emergency meeting for Wednesday to address the spiraling conflict.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since Oct. 8, the day after Hamas sent fighters into Israel and sparked the war in Gaza. It's been almost a year since some 250 people were abducted from Israel, and friends and family are worried about their loved ones as attention turns away from hostages and north toward Lebanon.

Here is the latest:

BEIJING -- China's official Xinhua news agency said 146 Chinese nationals and five members of their families arrived in Beijing on Wednesday after being evacuated from Lebanon on a charter flight.

The report said that all Chinese citizens who wanted to evacuate have left the country, while the Chinese Embassy in Lebanon will continue its duties.

MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned Iran's missile attack on Israel and called for de-escalation.

""We're very concerned about Iran's actions, which is why we condemn them,"" Albanese told reporters in Melbourne, Australia, on Wednesday.

""It is a good thing that it would appear that the defense of Israel, supported by the United States, has ensured that there is no loss of civilian life, it would appear, at this stage. There's been too much loss of life in that region,"" Albanese added.

Albanese said Israel had a right to defend itself.

""What we have called for consistently is for a de-escalation in the region, along with our friends in the United States and others,"" Albanese said.

UNITED NATIONS -- Yemen's two main ports remain operational following Israeli airstrikes, but the strikes damaged power stations, the United Nations says.

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Tuesday that the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Yemen went to assess the situation at Yemen's main port of Hodeida and nearby port of Ras Isa following Sunday's Israeli strikes targeting sites used by Houthi rebels in the ports in western Yemen.

Israel said it was retaliating for a Houthi missile fired at central Israel on Saturday which was shot down. The Houthis said it was aimed at Ben Gurion Airport, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plane had just arrived from New York where he addressed the annual meeting of world leaders at the United Nations.

Dujarric said the U.N.'s humanitarian partners reported Tuesday that ""after conducting an initial assessment, both ports remain operational and able to receive commercial and humanitarian supplies.""

""Power stations throughout Hodeida city are, however, running at a very limited capacity,"" the U.N. spokesman said.

TEHRAN, Iran -- A top Iranian military commander has warned that his country will hit Israel's infrastructure if it takes any action against its territory.

Iran's armed forces joint chief of staff Gen. Mohammad Bagheri said Wednesday that the Revolutionary Guard was prepared both defensively and offensively to repeat its missile attack with ""multiplied intensity.""

""If the Zionist regime, that has gone insane, is not contained by America and Europe and intends to continue such crimes, or do anything against our sovereignty or territorial integrity, tonight's operation will be repeated with much higher magnitude and we will hit all their infrastructure,"" he said.

Bagheri said Iran avoided targeting Israeli civilians although it was ""completely feasible.""

UNITED NATIONS -- Israel's U.N. ambassador says his government will decide when and how to respond to Iran's barrage of close to 200 ballistic missiles that forced Israel's 10 million population into bomb shelters. ""But I can tell you one thing, it will be noticed,"" he said. ""It will be painful.""

Danny Danon reacted to a statement from Iran's U.N. Mission that any new Israeli action would be met with a ""crushing response,"" saying: ""I would not advise Iran to challenge our determination, our capabilities. In the past, we have proved it. We will prove it again.""

""We have no desire for war or escalation, but we cannot sit idly by when our civilians are being attacked in such manner,"" the Israeli ambassador said. ""Iran used to send boxes but now, when they send almost 200 ballistic missiles, that's something that I don't think any other nation in the world will ignore."""
"After pressing an Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire, the Biden administration shifts its message",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-israel-hezbollah-united-states-8bed0f7a37b5059ba4c94552ff750f34,2024-10-02T04:32:01Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden administration says there is a significant difference between Israeli actions that have expanded its war against the Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah and Iran's retaliatory missile attack against Israel, which it condemned as escalatory.

In carefully calibrated remarks, officials across the administration are defending the surge in attacks by Israel against Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon, while still pressing for peace and vowing retribution after Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday.

President Joe Biden praised the U.S. and Israel militaries for defeating the barrage and warned, ""Make no mistake, the United States is fully, fully supportive of Israel.""

Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the Iranian missile attack ""totally unacceptable, and the entire world should condemn it.""

There was little criticism that Israel may have provoked Iran's assault. ""Obviously, this is a significant escalation by Iran,"" national security adviser Jake Sullivan said.

Just a week after calling urgently for an immediate cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah to avoid the possibility of all-out war in the Middle East, the administration has shifted its message as Israel presses ahead with ground incursions in Lebanon following a massive airstrike Friday in Beirut that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iranian Revolutionary Guard Gen. Abbas Nilforushan.

U.S. officials stress that they have repeatedly come out in support of Israel's right to defend itself and that any change in their language only reflects evolving conditions on the ground. And, officials say the administration's goal -- a cease-fire -- has remained constant.

The U.S. has been quick to praise and defend Israel for a series of recent strikes killing Hezbollah leaders. In contrast to its repeated criticism of Israel's war in Gaza that has killed civilians, the U.S. has taken a different tack on strikes that targeted Nasrallah and others but also may have killed innocent people.

At the Pentagon, Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder made it clear that while the U.S. is still ""laser focused"" on preventing a wider conflict in the Middle East, he carved out broad leeway for Israel to keep going after Hezbollah to protect itself.

""We understand and support Israel's right to defend itself against Hezbollah,"" Ryder said. ""We understand that part of that is dismantling some of the attack infrastructure that Hezbollah has built along the border.""

He said the U.S. is going to consult with Israel as it conducts limited operations against Hezbollah positions along the border ""that can be used to threaten Israeli citizens."" The goal, he said, is to allow citizens on both sides of the border to return to their homes.

Part of the ongoing discussions that the U.S. will have with Israel, Ryder said, will focus on making sure there's an understanding about potential ""mission creep"" that could lead to tensions to escalate even further.

State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Tuesday that Israel's targeting of senior Hamas and Hezbollah leaders as well as its initiation of ground incursions into Lebanon are justified because they were done in self-defense.

""If you look at the actions that they have taken, they were bringing terrorists to justice, terrorists who have launched attacks on Israeli civilians,"" Miller said.

By contrast, he said that Iran's response was dangerous and escalatory because it was done in support of Hamas and Hezbollah, both of which are U.S.-designated terrorist organizations that Iran funds and supports.

""What you saw (was) Iran launching a state-on-state attack to protect and defend the terrorist groups that it built, nurtured and controlled,"" Miller said. ""So there is a difference between the actions.""

The full-throated defense of Israel, however, may come with risks. So far, there is little evidence that the Biden administration's push for a cease-fire and warnings of broadening the conflict have had much impact on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

In commentary Monday, Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that U.S. influence on Netanyahu seems to be waning and that he ""seems to have blown by U.S. cautions about starting a regional war.""

The White House must ""worry that a sustained inability to make diplomatic progress weakens U.S. influence in the Middle East and around the world,"" Alterman said, adding that ""Netanyahu's assurance that the United States will stand by Israel in any circumstance emboldens Israel to take more risks than it otherwise would.""

Republicans are more likely than Democrats to see Israel as a US ally: AP-NORC poll,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-hezbollah-iran-20b070612a8a76ee1d4d6c47864a2355,2024-10-02T04:13:57Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a year of war between Israel and Hamas, U.S. public opinion on the conflict remains polarized, a new survey by the Pearson Institute and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds, with Democrats more likely to be critical of Israel, while Republicans remain more supportive.

There are a few points of relative consensus -- about half of U.S. adults, for example, say Hamas bears ""a lot"" of responsibility for the continuation of the war, while about one quarter says it has ""some"" responsibility and about 2 in 10 say it has ""not much"" responsibility or ""none at all.""

But U.S. adults remain divided on the extent to which the Israeli government is responsible for the conflict continuing. And the findings indicate that the past year of war hasn't done much to widen or narrow the partisan gulf that existed early in the conflict.

Democrats remain more sympathetic toward the Palestinians than Republicans and more critical of Israel, while Republicans are more likely to sympathize with the Israelis and view Israel as a U.S. ally that shares the United States' values and interests.

However, it's unclear from this survey if public opinion will shift as the war in the Middle East expands beyond Gaza. It was conducted from Sept. 12 to 16, before Israel's military significantly escalated its operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon and before Iran launched missiles at Israel on Tuesday. Hamas, based in Gaza, and Hezbollah, based in Lebanon, are militant groups allied with Iran.

President Joe Biden has maintained crucial U.S. military support to Israel throughout the Gaza war, while repeatedly trying -- and failing -- to broker a cease-fire. Americans are most likely to place ""a lot"" of blame on Hamas for the continuation of the war between Israel and the militant group, followed by the Israeli government, and the Iranian government and groups backed by Iran.

They place much less responsibility on their own country. Only about 1 in 10 Americans say the U.S. government bears ""a lot"" of responsibility for the continuation of the war between Israel and Hamas, while about 4 in 10 say it bears ""some"" responsibility, and 45% say the U.S. bears ""not much"" or no responsibility at all.

Democrats are slightly more likely than Republicans to say the U.S. has ""some"" responsibility, but overall the partisan differences on this question are small.

Brian Grider, a 48-year-old Republican from Moscow, Ohio, isn't sure how the U.S. could defuse the conflict.

""I don't know if there's anything we can do,"" he said. ""It would be nice if we could and we might want to try, but is it going to work? Probably not.""

The year of fighting appears to have calcified the partisan divide on the war and the U.S. relationship with Israel.

About half of Republicans view Israel as an ally of the U.S. that shares its values and interests, while about half of Democrats think Israel is a partner that the U.S. should cooperate with but that doesn't share American values and interests.

More than half of Democrats also say the Israeli government bears ""a lot"" of responsibility for the continuation of the war, compared to about 4 in 10 Republicans.

Brian Becker, a 49-year-old Democrat in Colorado, says his views of the war shifted after hearing more on social media about Palestinians and Palestinian Americans who were harmed by the war.

""I didn't feel like that was fair for them,"" Becker said. ""So that did start to change my mind a little bit, started to give that waver of support to Palestine,"" he said. ""Where before I probably would have been just, 'Yeah, go Israel.""'

On the other hand, about half of Republicans say they sympathize more with the Israelis than the Palestinians, while Democrats are more likely to say they sympathize with both groups equally.

Grider, the Ohio Republican, thinks Israel responded appropriately to the Oct. 7 attack, comparing it to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the U.S.

""I definitely don't think Israel is doing too much in response to what happened to them,"" he said.

Views of the Israel-Hamas conflict, and the U.S. role in mediating it, haven't shifted much over the course of the year.

Support for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state rose slightly, from around 2 in 10 in August 2023 to about 3 in 10 now. (About half of Americans currently say they neither favor nor oppose an independent Palestinian state, and about 2 in 10 are opposed.) There was also a slight uptick in the share of Americans who think the U.S. is too supportive of Israel.

But about 4 in 10 U.S. adults continue to say the U.S. is spending ""too much"" on military aid to Israel in the war, while a similar share say the U.S. is spending ""the right amount."" About 1 in 10 say the U.S. is spending ""too little,"" which is in line with an AP-NORC poll conducted in early 2024.

The mix of U.S. opinions on the Gaza war reflects the complexity of a conflict where Americans may see bad actors and innocent victims on both sides, according to Paul Poast, a political scientist at the University of Chicago and a research affiliate of the Pearson Institute.

""This leads to people having very strong views on both sides, which, of course, we've seen,"" Poast said. And it doesn't, he added, make for ""a consistent narrative of, 'We've got to support Israel,' or 'We've got to support the Palestinians.'""

Hamas killed about 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7 and took hostages, some of whom are still being held in Gaza. Israel's military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians. Gaza health officials do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their death toll but say many of those killed are women and children.

Charles Jolivette, a 42-year-old Democrat in New Orleans who developed concerns about Israel's offensive through discussions with friends and colleagues who have Palestinian heritage, has observed a kind of echo-chamber effect, where people on the different sides of the issue seem to only hear views that reflect their own beliefs.

""But I would love to have some more,"" Jolivette said, referring to exchanges of view with people who see the conflict differently. And for ""not only mainstream media, but the mainstream American populace, to have that ability to have these real conversations.""

The poll of 1,111 adults was conducted using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.95 percentage points."
US 'Welcome Corps' helps resettle LGBTQ+ refugees fleeing crackdowns against gay people,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lgbtq-refugees-welcome-corps-rainbow-railroad-1c4a419125f50aa769c8416cd47312e2,2024-10-02T04:13:37Z,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Cabrel Ngounou's life in Cameroon quickly unraveled after neighbors caught the teenager with his boyfriend.

A crowd surrounded his boyfriend's house and beat him. Ngounou's family learned of the relationship and kicked him out. So Ngounou fled -- alone and with little money -- on a dangerous, four-year journey through at least five countries. He was sexually assaulted in a Libyan prison, harassed in Tunisia and tried unsuccessfully to take a boat to Europe.

""The worst thing was that they caught us. So it was not easy for my family,"" Ngounou said. ""My sisters told me I need to get out of the house because my place is not there. So that's what really pushed me to leave my country.""

Ngounou's troubles drew attention after he joined a protest outside the U.N. refugee agency's Tunisia office. Eventually, he arrived in the United States, landing in San Francisco in March.

Ngounou joined a growing number of LGBTQ+ people accepted into the Welcome Corps, which launched last year and pairs groups of Americans with newly arrived refugees. So far, the resettlement program has connected 3,500 sponsors with 1,800 refugees, and many more want to help: 100,000 people have applied to become sponsors.

President Joe Biden has sought to rebuild the refugee programs Donald Trump largely dismantled as president, working to streamline the process of screening and placing people in America. New refugee resettlement sites have opened across the country, and on Tuesday, the Biden Administration announced that it resettled 100,000 refugees in fiscal year 2024, the largest number in more than three decades.

In contrast, Trump has pledged to bar refugees from Gaza, reinstate his Muslim ban and impose ""ideological screening"" for all immigrants if he regains the presidency. He and running mate JD Vance are laying groundwork for their goal of deporting millions of illegal immigrants by amplifying false claims, such as the accusation that Haitians given temporary protected status to remain in the U.S. legally are eating pets in Ohio.

Under Biden, meanwhile, two human rights officials in the State Department were tasked last year with identifying refugees who face persecution either due to their sexual orientation or human rights advocacy.

""LGBTQ refugees are forced to flee their homes due to persecution and violence, not unlike other people,"" said Jeremy Haldeman, deputy executive director of the Community Sponsorship Hub, which implements the Welcome Corps on behalf of the State Department. But they are particularly vulnerable because they're coming from places ""where their identities are criminalized and they are at risk of imprisonment or even death.""

More than 60 countries have passed anti-LGBTQ laws and thousands of people have fled the Middle East and Africa seeking asylum in Europe. In April, Uganda's constitutional court on Wednesday upheld an anti-gay law that allows the death penalty for ""aggravated homosexuality.""

""There are just a lot of people who are really at risk and are not safe in their country, and they're usually not safe in the neighboring or regional countries either,"" Kathryn Hampton, senior adviser for U.S. Strategy at Rainbow Railroad, which helps LGBTQI+ people facing persecution.

The demand far outstrips capacity: Of more than 15,000 requests for help in 2023, the nonprofit helped resettle 23 refugees through the Welcome Corps program in cities as large as Houston and towns as small as Arlington, Vermont. It has a goal of resettling 50 this year.

""So, we have a lot of urgency as an organization to find and create new pathways that LGBTQI+ people can access to find safety,"" Hampton said.

Another refugee in the program, Julieth Luna Garcia, is a transgender woman from El Salvador who settled in Chicago.

Speaking through a translator, the 31-year-old Garcia said she suffered abuse from her family because of her trans identity and couldn't legally access gender-affirming care until she arrived in the United States.

""I lived with constant fear, even more so at night. I didn't like to go out. I was really scared that somebody would find me alone and do something,"" Garcia said. Since arriving in February, Garcia has found a place to live and a job as a home health aide and hopes to study to become a lawyer. ""Here, I'm not scared to say who I am. I'm not scared to tell anyone,"" she said.

Maybe the biggest change was starting hormone treatments, she said: ""To see yourself in the mirror and see these changes, I can't really explain it, but it's really big. It's an emotional and exciting thing and something I thought I would never experience.""

Welcome Corps sponsors are expected to help refugees adjust for at least three months after they arrive. Garcia said the five volunteers helped her ""adapt to a new life with a little less difficulty,"" by accessing benefits, getting a work permit and enrolling in English classes.

Ngounou recalled how his sponsors, a team of seven that included a lesbian couple, Anne Raeff and Lori Ostlund, hosted him and connected him with LGBTQ resources and a work training program. They also served as his tour guides to gay life, taking him to the historically gay Castro district, where Ngounou got his first glimpse of the huge rainbow Pride flag and stopped to read every plaque honoring famous gay people.

""Cabrel was just very, very moved by that. Just kind of started crying. We all did,"" Raeff recalled.

""I know that feeling like when we were young, when you'd go into a gay bar and you'd feel like this sense of kind of freedom, like this community,"" she said. ""That was the only place where you could go and actually be open. And that ... this is this community of people and we all have this in common.""

Now the 19-year-old Ngounou works in a coffee shop and takes college courses, with the goal of becoming a social worker. He hopes the boyfriend he met in Tunisia can visit him in San Francisco -- and he still finds it hard to believe that they can share their love openly.

""Here I'm really me ... I feel free,"" he said with a laugh. ""I feel free to have my boyfriend and walk with him in the street. I feel free, you know, to enjoy myself with him wherever we want to enjoy ourselves. But in Tunisia or anywhere else, in Cameroon, you have to hide such things."""
Johannesburg considers naming a street after a Palestinian woman who hijacked a plane,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-sandton-street-renaming-palestine-bec02d2b06debe710a27d3871c91d865,2024-10-01T14:34:01Z,"JOHANNESBURG (AP) -- Officials in South Africa's biggest city of Johannesburg have proposed renaming a major street after a Palestinian woman who was involved in a hijacking more than 50 years ago, sparking criticism from several political parties and the city's Jewish community.

The city council is considering naming the street in its financial district of Sandton after Leila Khaled, a Palestinian militant and member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine group.

Khaled, who is now 80 years old, gained infamy in 1969 when she was part of a group who hijacked a Trans World Airlines flight on a journey from Rome to Tel Aviv, Israel. She became known as the first woman to hijack a plane.

She was also one of two people who attempted to hijack an Israeli Airlines flight from Amsterdam to New York City the following year, which resulted in the other hijacker being fatally shot by air marshals.

Israel considers Khaled a terrorist, but she is widely seen as a hero and freedom fighter by Palestinians and by some in South Africa who support the Palestinian cause. The PFLP is part of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the internationally recognized representative of the Palestinian people. While the main PLO faction, Fatah, recognizes Israel's right to exist, the PFLP doesn't, and Israel, the United States and other Western allies of Israel consider it a terrorist group.

South Africa has historically close ties to the Palestinians and has accused Israel of committing genocide in the war in Gaza in a highly sensitive case that's being heard by the United Nations' top court. South Africa and Israel have been fiercely critical of each other over that case.

Khaled has previously visited South Africa.

The street renaming controversy dates back to 2018, when it was first proposed and reportedly sparked a brawl among Johannesburg city officials, according to local media coverage at the time. It was initially proposed by Al Jama-ah, a pro-Palestinian minority party in the Johannesburg council, and supported by the African National Congress, South Africa's largest political party.

The name change is being considered again and members of the public have until mid-October to register their objections.

The South African Zionist Federation said the proposed change was partly aimed at the fact that the U.S. consulate in Johannesburg is located on the same street, which is currently called Sandton Drive. SAZF spokesperson Rolene Marks said renaming the street ""after a failed terrorist with ties to a globally recognized terrorist organization"" would sow division in South Africa.

Marks has also previously called the proposal ""an affront to peace-loving South Africans"" and ""deliberately provocative"" toward Johannesburg's Jewish community.

Sandton Drive is a major road in the district of Sandton, which is considered to be the richest square mile in Africa. It's also been the site of several pro-Palestinian protests in recent months outside the U.S. consulate.

Fana Mkhonza, a council member for the African Christian Democratic Party, a South African political party opposed to the proposal, said Khaled did not qualify to have the street renamed after her, according to the city's policies. South Africa has renamed some streets in recent years to remove colonial references and better reflect and recognize the country's majority Black population, especially those who fought against the apartheid system of white minority rule that ended in 1994.

""As much as Ms. Khaled could be seen as a freedom fighter in a thin slice of South African society, her fight has been for the Palestinian cause, not for the development of Johannesburg,"" Mkhonza said. ""The ACDP does not see any tolerance, reconciliation and peace in this proposed person's name to replace Sandton Drive.""

Al Jama-ah said renaming the street would show solidarity with the Palestinian people and be a recognition of their struggle.

""While some argue that we should focus on South African heroes, we should not ignore international figures who have fought for justice and freedom,"" said Thapelo Ahmad, the Johannesburg chairperson of Al Jama-ah and the former mayor of the city who originally proposed the name change in 2018."
Yemen's Houthi rebels are looking to gain from continuing conflict in the Middle East,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthis-gaza-israel-defe499e9df870381f078ad3e3b667b5,2024-10-01T14:24:00Z,"CAIRO (AP) -- In the days since Israel intensified its campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon, including the strike that killed the militant group's leader Hassan Nasrallah, Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels have been quick to show they are an important player in the complex conflicts convulsing the Middle East.

In a brazen attack on Saturday, the Houthis fired a ballistic missile at Israel's main airport as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was arriving back from New York, where he had addressed the United Nations. On Monday, they threatened ""escalating military operations"" to target Israel after apparently shooting down a U.S. military drone flying over Yemen.

And on Tuesday, an explosive-loaded drone crashed into one ship in the Red Sea as a missile exploded against another, the British military and private security officials said, the latest in the Houthis' assaults on commercial shipping in the key waterway.

The salvo of Houthi attacks has again drawn attention to the Yemeni rebels and raised questions about their goals and strategies.

The rebels, armed by Iran, seized most of Yemen's north and its capital, Sanaa, a decade ago, pushing the country's internationally recognized government into exile.

A Saudi-led coalition backing Yemen's government entered the war in 2015 and the Houthis have since been fighting what has become a long-running but now largely stalemated civil war in Yemen.

However, when the Israel-Hamas war erupted in the Gaza Strip a year ago, the Houthis began targeting shipping throughout the Red Sea corridor -- part of a campaign they say aims at pressuring Israel and the West over the war.

Analysts and observers say a widening conflict could boost the Houthis militarily and expand their already outsized role across the region -- despite retaliatory strikes by Israel, the United States and the United Kingdom.

Ahmed Nagi, a senior Yemen analyst at the Crisis Group, says that before the war in Gaza, the Houthis were seen as an often-forgotten and less-prominent faction in an axis that includes Iran, Syria's government forces, Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Palestinian Hamas and other groups in the region.

That changed when the Houthis began hitting ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden making their way to the Suez Canal, suddenly posing a much wider threat.

""Over the past year, the Houthis have taken center stage,"" Nagi said.

After Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostages, Israel responded with a blistering offensive on the Gaza Strip, a coastal enclave run by the Palestinian militant group.

Israel's retaliatory invasion of Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 95,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and militants in its count but says that over half of those killed are women and children.

The toll the war has taken and the extent of Gaza's destruction have shocked the world.

Meanwhile, the Houthis see the Yemenis' prevailing solidarity with Palestinians as a useful tool for recruiting new fighters and swelling their ranks, Nagi said

In June, the Houthis unveiled a new, solid-fuel missile in their arsenal that resembles aspects of one earlier one displayed by Iran, which Tehran described as flying at hypersonic speed.

The rebels fired their new ""Palestine"" missile -- complete with a warhead painted like a Palestinian keffiyeh checkered scarf -- at the southern port of Eilat in Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no damage or injuries.

The extent of the Houthis' actions was a surprise to some, mainly because of their limited resources and Yemen's own costly civil war.

Nagi described their strategy as one of ""gradual escalation"" towards Israel. As their prominence grows, the Houthis -- who have for years relied on portable missile launchers and hit-and-run tactics -- will likely be eager to get their hands on more advanced weapons, he added.

The Houthis initially targeted vessels claimed to be linked to Israel and later expanded their campaign to include all commercial shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They used small boats, short-range missiles and drones to carry out those attacks.

Their campaign prompted a response by an international coalition, led by the U.S. and U.K., which in February launched strikes on ""sites associated with the Houthis' deeply buried weapons storage facilities, missile systems and launchers, air defense systems and radars,"" U.S. defense officials said.

In July, an Iranian-made drone launched by the Houthis struck Tel Aviv, killing one person and wounding 10. Israel responded with a wave of airstrikes on Houthi-held areas of Yemen, including the port city of Hodeida.

The Houthis have since warned they could expand their campaign beyond Mideast waters, to target ships using the longer route around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, or those in the Mediterranean Sea heading to Israel.

According to Faozi al-Goidi, a fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, the rebels are not likely to be deterred anytime soon and could also target vessels further out in the Indian Ocean.

They may also seek to ""partner with other militias to build an alliance that would threaten security in the region,"" al-Goidi said.

The New York-based Soufan Center, a think tank, said in a September report that the Houthis were increasing ""operational autonomy"" and diversifying their alliances away from Iran by cooperating with Russia, pointing to alleged plans for Russian weapons shipments to the Houthis that fell through.

The Houthis remain in control of most of Yemen's north where they enjoy popular support despite a dire economic situation and a brutal crackdown on dissent that has included humanitarian workers.

Their fight against Israel is likely to play into that. Thousands of Houthi supporters come out to Sanaa streets to rally every Friday, demanding justice for Palestinians and denouncing Israel and the U.S.

""Yemenis of all political backgrounds and ideologies support Palestinians and have a deep connection with them,"" said Yemeni political analyst Abdel-Bari Taher. That will help grow support for the Houthis, despite the rebels' ""oppressive policies against Yemenis.""

The Houthis may also seek to exploit their new-found stature following strikes against Israel in any potential negotiations with Saudi Arabia over a resolution to Yemen's civil war.

The have raised ""their ceiling for negotiations,"" said al-Goido. ""No one will ignore them anymore."""
What to know as Israel says it has launched ground incursion into Lebanon,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-what-to-know-hezbollah-incursion-c44358cb4c70db69bdab4b254cb2ed76,2024-10-01T12:20:10Z,"JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel said its ground troops crossed into Lebanon overnight, launching what the military described as ""localized"" raids to root out Hezbollah fighters and infrastructure.

Hezbollah, meanwhile, said it saw no sign of Israeli forces and its troops were ready to confront them.

Israel said the incursion would be focused on the narrow strip of land just across the border. But it also issued evacuation warnings covering a wider swath of Lebanon, raising fears that a large-scale ground invasion was soon to come.

In recent days, a wave of Israeli airstrikes has killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and several of his top commanders, while driving hundreds of thousands of Lebanese from their homes. Israel says a ground operation is now necessary to return tens of thousands of displaced Israelis to their homes in the north, pummeled by continuous rocket fire from Hezbollah since Oct. 8.

Here's what we know:

The military says that Israeli troops entered Lebanon late Monday. A military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military regulations declined to say whether troops were rotating in and out of the country or were stationed there for the foreseeable future.

The Lebanese army and UNIFIL, a U.N. peacekeeping force stationed in the zone that Israeli forces purportedly entered, have not confirmed that Israeli troops crossed the border, although UNIFIL said it was notified that they were going to.

The military official said that at this point Israeli ground troops are ""within walking distance"" of the border, targeting the small Lebanese villages hundreds of meters (yards) from Israeli territory.

The military says Hezbollah militants remain in the area, despite heavy Israeli bombardment over the past few weeks. It says they are using the areas to launch attacks on Israel and to store weapons.

There were no signs of ground combat late Monday and early Tuesday in southern Lebanon.

The military official said there have been no clashes between Hezbollah militants and Israeli troops so far.

Meanwhile, cross-border fire continued. Hezbollah announced in statements that it had targeted groups of soldiers in several Israeli border areas with artillery shelling and rockets. Israel said no soldiers were injured and the targeting was unsuccessful.

Still, Israeli artillery units pummeled targets in southern Lebanon through the night and the sounds of airstrikes were heard throughout Beirut.

Hezbollah fired a rare volley of rockets toward central Israel on Tuesday, injuring one man, Israeli paramedics said.

Israel has not given a timetable for how long the incursion will last and has declined to specify how far troops will go.

The military official said that marching to Beirut, as Israel did in its 1982 invasion of Lebanon, is ""not on the table."" At the time, the Israeli invasion was also pitched as a limited incursion to push the Palestine Liberation Organization back.

He added that the operation in its current stages does not mirror Israel's ground incursions in Gaza, where the military entered cities with heavy manpower, artillery and tanks.

That could change, depending on whether Israel's government decides to launch a more extensive ground operation. Chris Coyle, a resident of Israel's north, told AP on Monday that Israeli tanks had been positioned along the border.

Troops that entered Lebanon are from the 98th division, the military said. The division is responsible for some of the heaviest fighting inside Gaza and includes elite units specializing in attacks behind enemy lines.

Meanwhile, Israel is expanding its evacuation warnings in southern Lebanon, sending hundreds of thousands of Lebanese fleeing from the south.

On Tuesday, the Israeli military's Arabic-language spokesperson asked residents living in villages north of a U.N.-declared buffer zone to flee. Under a U.N. resolution that ended the 2006 war, the zone was supposed to be controlled by a U.N. peacekeeping force and the Lebanese military."
Suspected Yemen Houthi rebel attack targets ship in Red Sea,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-red-sea-attacks-israel-hamas-war-2faa48176d4f773003b6a4a3ad5ca73d,2024-10-01T05:12:20Z,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- A suspected attack Tuesday by Yemen's Houthi rebels targeted a ship in the Red Sea, likely marking their first assault on commercial shipping in weeks as the Israel-Hamas war threatens to become a regional conflict.

The attack comes as Israeli ground forces entered Lebanon after days of Israeli airstrikes that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and other top leaders and the earlier explosions of sabotaged electronic devices used by the Shiite militia. The Houthis had threatened ""escalating military operations"" targeting Israel on Monday after they apparently shot down a U.S. military drone flying over the country.

The attack Tuesday morning took place off the port city of Hodeida in the Red Sea, which has become a battlefield for shippers since the Houthis began their campaign targeting ships traveling through a waterway that once saw $1 trillion a year of cargo pass through it.

A captain on a ship saw four ""splashes"" near his vessel, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said in a warning. That likely would have been missiles or drones launched at the vessel.

""All crew are safe and the vessel is proceeding to (its) next port of call,"" the UKMTO said.

The Houthis did not immediately claim the attack. However, they sometimes take hours or days to acknowledge one of their assaults.

Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They have seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels.

The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.

The last attack on a merchant ship by the Houthis came on Sept. 2.

The Houthis claimed an attack targeted American warships last week. The rebels fired more than a half dozen ballistic missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles and two drones at three U.S. ships that were traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, but all were intercepted by the Navy destroyers, a U.S. official said Friday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet publicly released."
"A former hostage fought for her own life in Gaza. A year on, she fights for her husband's freedom",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hostages-gaza-tunnels-hamas-israel-war-d8ecb415268e911cea09518acdaf7ba2,2024-10-01T04:44:25Z,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- As a hostage in Gaza, Aviva Siegel found herself begging for food and water. Since her release, she has found herself begging for her husband to be set free from his own ongoing captivity.

Siegel has come to embody the disaster that befell Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Armed Hamas militants snatched her from her home and thrust her into Gaza's web of tunnels. Released during a brief cease-fire in November, she returned to find her community destroyed and became one of tens of thousands of Israelis displaced by conflict. She has emerged as a prominent voice in the struggle to free the remaining hostages, fighting tirelessly for her husband's release.

But as her ordeal reaches the one-year mark, Israel's attention is focused not on the plight of the hostages and their families, but on fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon. It's the latest diversion to chip away at Siegel's hope that she may reunite with her husband of 43 years anytime soon.

""The hostages, they are being left to die. To die slowly. How can I handle that? I just don't know how to handle it anymore,"" she said, sitting beside a poster of her husband, Keith, a 65-year-old American Israeli originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

Her torment is all the more acute because she knows firsthand what her husband is enduring.

""Hostages were chained, tortured, starved, beaten up into pieces. I saw that in front of my eyes. That's what they did to us,"" she said from a short-term rental apartment in Tel Aviv, one of the many places she has lived since her return during the November cease-fire, the first and only deal reached between Israel and Hamas during the war.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to continue the war until ""total victory"" over Hamas and pledged to bring home the hostages, but has faced widespread criticism that dozens remain captive a year after the attack. Netanyahu has also argued that the pressure on Hezbollah will, in turn, lead to pressure on its ally Hamas and help speed up the release of the hostages.

The Siegels were jolted awake on Oct. 7 at their home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, one of the hardest-hit communities that day, by a burst of air raid sirens. Like so many others, they took cover in their safe room, built to protect against rocket attacks, that turned out to be no match for the rifle- and grenade-toting Hamas militants who stormed their home.

In its attack, Hamas kidnapped roughly 250 people, including women, children and older people. It killed some 1,200 people -- most of them civilians -- according to Israeli authorities. The war the attack sparked has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, over half of them women and children, according to health officials in Gaza.

Hamas has said the hostages are treated humanely, but multiple accounts from freed hostages contradict that.

The militants led the Siegels out of their house, shoved her husband, breaking his ribs, and shot him in the hand, Siegel said. They were forced into their own car and driven into Gaza, where crowds of onlookers cheered at their capture.

Their first stop was a home with a living room that opened up into an underground tunnel.

""And there's somebody underneath the hole, in the hole underneath the ground, that's waiting with a smile, happy as can be. I'll never forget his face,"" she said.

They climbed down a steep ladder into the tunnel, one of several they were held in throughout Siegel's 51 days in captivity. All told, Siegel was moved around 13 times, held in both tunnels and militants' homes, she said.

On the first day, they were joined by other hostages and they were brought pita and cheese, which hardly anyone ate because they were all in shock. But throughout her captivity, food was scarce and Siegel said there were entire days when she wasn't brought anything to eat.

""They used to starve us while they ate in front of us and not bring us water for hours and days. I had an infection in my stomach, I was dehydrated. We had to beg -- beg -- for water. Beg and beg for food.""

The first tunnel had light -- others did not -- as well as a fan that labored to circulate the scant air. Seven hostages were held in a room Siegel described as being about the size of three yoga mats. She found comfort in having her husband by her side throughout.

She brushed her teeth four times over those weeks and washed herself the same amount, in salt water.

""It's disgusting. We were filthy. Dirty. The smell that came out of us is the worst that you can imagine,"" she said.

But worse was the treatment from the guards. Siegel, a 63-year-old grandmother of five, said she was pushed and yanked by the hair and shoved into cars.

Her captors told her that Hamas had taken over her kibbutz and that Israel didn't care about freeing her. So she was in disbelief when freedom came on Nov. 26. But it came at a price: Her husband was to remain behind.

Her parting words to him were, ""Be strong for me,"" and she promised to be strong for him.

Since their painful goodbye, she has crisscrossed Israel and the world, sharing her story and pleading for her husband's release. She has met Netanyahu, United States President Joe Biden and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, among others. She has spoken repeatedly to Israeli lawmakers and become a fixture at weekly protests in support of the hostages.

But her energetic advocacy has been beaten down by the horrific twists and turns of the war. Since her release, she has watched multiple rounds of hostage negotiations collapse. Hostages have been killed by Hamas but also mistakenly by Israeli forces, and some have been rescued.

The fighting in Israel's north, and the stunning assassination of Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, feels like another blow to her struggle, which has faded from the public consciousness.

Siegel said she can't bring herself to watch a video of her husband that Hamas released in April. Clearly filmed under duress, he says he is OK, but breaks down in tears and lays his head on his knees, sobbing.

She finds the strength to soldier on by thinking about him, a vegetarian who loves reading books to his grandchildren and studied Arabic so he could converse with workers from Gaza who were employed in the kibbutz. But a year on, her hope is wearing thin.

""I don't know why I get up,"" she said. ""But I do know that I have to get up for Keith."""
Leaders depart UN facing prospect of a wider Mideast war  --  but with a blueprint for a better future,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/un-leaders-mideast-war-multilateralism-inequality-netanyahu-a6396f79d45a67b44c97f8ece2eec619,2024-10-01T01:25:29Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- They gathered at the United Nations surrounded by unsettling warnings of an escalating conflict that could engulf the Middle East and further shatter international relations that are based on ""multilateralism"" -- nations working together and sharing power. A week later, world leaders headed home with the prospect of a broader war intensifying and global divisions front and center, not only in the Mideast but elsewhere.

There was no expectation of major breakthroughs in the public and private meetings at the annual U.N. General Assembly meeting of presidents, premiers and other leaders. There rarely is. But this year was especially grim, with no end in sight to the three major conflicts in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan, and Israeli military action in Lebanon escalating.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' warning that multilateralism needs to be brought back ""from the brink"" added to the gloom, along with speech after speech decrying failures to tackle climate change and address growing inequalities between rich and poor nations, and warning of artificial intelligence with no guardrails and the potential of killer weapons with no human control.

General Assembly President Philémon Yang concluded the weeklong, high-level meeting Monday afternoon, calling it ""particularly tumultuous"" and pointing to the ""violent conflicts"" that are raging.

""This is, unfortunately, not an exhaustive list of the crises and conflicts affecting member states of the United Nations,"" he lamented.

There was no disagreement that multilateralism is broken, that this founding principle of the United Nations - established in 1945 on the ashes of World War II -- needs urgent resuscitation to deal with the challenges the world faces today.

One example: During the very hour on Friday when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the General Assembly that his country genuinely wants peace -- a goal stressed by virtually every leader -- Israeli warplanes were bombing areas around Beirut in a lethal barrage.

In the last few days, Yang said, the world has seen ""an extremely dramatic escalation"" between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon that risks war in the entire Middle East. ""As we speak, peace in the Middle East is hanging delicately on a shoestring,"" he warned..

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said this year's meeting of leaders - with its marquee speeches known in U.N.-speak as the ""general debate"" - took place at ""a very serious and a very intense time.""

""The world doesn't stop for the general debate,"" he told reporters Monday. ""So we were focused very much on what member states said, but we continue to be very much focused on what is going on in the world outside of this building.""

There was one positive development welcomed by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and many leaders: The adoption of a ""Pact for the Future"" at a summit just before world leaders began their addresses to the General Assembly. The 42-page blueprint aims to bring the 193 U.N. member nations together to meet today's challenges, from climate change and artificial intelligence to escalating conflicts and increasing inequality and poverty.

It challenges leaders of countries large and small, rich and poor, to turn promises into actions. Whether that happens remains to be seen. Yang, the assembly president, said his office has already instituted ""an awareness-raising campaign"" to spur implementation.

In an illustration of the blend of woe and weary hope that percolated through the gathering, Burundi's foreign minister, Albert Shingiro, on Monday decried an international community where ""most of us act like we were alone in the world, like others didn't exist or didn't count.""

Still, he said, the consensus on the Pact for the Future ""shows that multilateralism is not dead and buried.""

From the vantage points where leaders of smaller or less powerful nations sit, the U.N. can't change the world without changing itself. Founded with 51 member countries, it now has 193, and many feel included only to a point.

""We must ensure that global institutions give developing countries, especially small, vulnerable ones like my own, seats at the tables of decision-making,"" said Barbados' prime minister, Mia Mottley. ""The anger and mistrust of our citizens in institutions, in leaders and in multilateralism and its processes which exclude, while yielding much talk and little action, is very real.""

Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, head of Bangladesh's interim government, said ""time demands new attitudes, new values, new compacts, across communities and countries.""

""I believe, the world needs to engage on a shared vision of 'three zeroes' that we can materialize together, targeting zero poverty, zero unemployment, and, zero net carbon emissions -- where a young person anywhere in the world will have opportunities to grow, not as a job seeker but as entrepreneur,"" he told the assembly.

During the global gathering, the assembly heard from 190 countries - all but Brunei, Myanmar and Afghanistan. The speakers included 71 heads of state, 42 heads of government, six vice-presidents and crown princes, eight deputy prime ministers, 53 ministers, three vice-ministers and seven heads of delegations. Usually, the U.N. Security Council holds one meeting during the high-level week, but this year the council met about a half-dozen times because of the global conflicts and crises.

For all the alarm, leaders here are politicians, and many made a point of appealing at least somewhat to optimism. Perhaps none stressed it as much as U.S. President Joe Biden, making his last speech at the annual meeting after more than a half-century in public life.

He noted that humanity has brought to a close some of the seemingly intractable threats, conflicts and injustices that beset the world when he was elected as a senator in 1972, from the Cold War to apartheid in South Africa.

""Things can get better,"" Biden said. ""We should never forget that.""

"On a day when isolated nations get their say at the UN, North Korea reups condemnation of US",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-north-korea-isolated-nations-bd68f4098e42c37923c9e92ba397de76,2024-09-30T20:24:15Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- North Korea condemned the United States and its allies Monday for ""stirring up military confrontations still further"" by engaging in war games in the Asia-Pacific region and ""talking unceasingly"" about regime change in the diplomatically isolated nation.

U.N. Ambassador Kim Song said North Korea was taking unspecified steps to defend itself better.

The words from Kim, while sharp, did not appear to represent any notable departure from Pyongyang's usual rhetoric. He spoke on the final day of the U.N. General Assembly's high-level meeting of world leaders -- a day when some of the world's most diplomatically isolated nations took the rostrum alongside a diverse roster of leaders from nations like Canada and the United Arab Emirates.

Kim said the United States, trying to dominate world affairs, was not acting fairly to the community of nations and was misusing the ostensibly multilateral United Nations for its own ends.

""They are stirring up military confrontations still further,"" Kim said, accusing Washington of hypocrisy -- another common charge from North Korea. ""Who has developed and used nuclear weapons for the first time in human history? ... Who is talking unceasingly about the end of a regime of a sovereign state?""

He added: ""The United Nations is misused for the political aims of an individual country. Such realities should no longer be tolerated and allowed.""

As he spoke, a lone U.S. diplomat intently scrawled notes on paper. There was no immediate response from the U.S.

U.S. and South Korean troops held a large-scale exercise last month aimed at strengthening their combined defense capabilities against nuclear-armed North Korea, which again accused the allies of practicing an invasion.

The annual summertime exercise came amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula as the pace of both North Korea's weapons demonstrations and the U.S.-South Korea combined military exercises have intensified. At the time, the North released a statement calling the exercises ""provocative war drills"" and said they justified Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions.

In a rebuttal later in the assembly hall, a South Korean diplomat called the North's claims groundless and said its pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles was the root of the tensions.

""It is our duty, like any member state, to protect the lives and safety of our people from the DPRK's military threat by maintaining a robust South Korea-U.S. combined defense and deterrence posture,"" said deputy U.N. Ambassador Sangijn Kim, using an abbreviation for the North's formal name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Kim's speech resembled his previous one at the same lectern last year, when he said the United States was trying to provoke a nuclear war. He also said that Pyongyang was bolstering its defenses to match the ""hegemony"" it says threatens it. ""We continue to increase our war deterrence capabilities,"" Kim said.

The 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice instead of a peace treaty, leaving the Korean Peninsula divided and -- technically -- still in a state of war.

Notably absent from the 190 speakers who addressed the assembly over six days: representatives from Myanmar and Afghanistan, both of which are in U.N. limbo after new regimes took over in recent years.

Afghanistan wasn't totally absent from the debate Monday. Irish Foreign Minister Seán Fleming demanded a ""non-negotiable"" commitment to gender equality there. And Canada's foreign minister criticized the ruling Taliban for their restrictive policies toward women and the impact such laws have on Afghan society. ""The Taliban,"" Melanie Joly said, ""cannot make international law disappear through simple decrees.""

On a morning peppered with denunciations of ""hegemony,"" Burkina Faso's top diplomat said the U.N.'s treasured concept of multilateralism - broad-scale decision-making that gives all countries a voice on the issues facing the planet - is ""exhausted,"" its reputation ""neutered, time and time again, by predatory actions by certain member states who have decided that they are the masters of the world.""

""The harmony and cohesion of our world is at stake,"" Foreign Minister Karamoko Jean Marie Traore said. ""We'd like to appeal to the powers of our world to prioritize an inclusive global governance which is rid of hegemonizing visions. And if we can do that, the U.N.'s glory will again be restored.""

Syrian Foreign Minister Bassam Sabbagh, who represents another relatively isolated nation, also said the U.N.'s brand of multilateralism has stopped working -- if, he said, it ever had. He cited what he called ""terrorist"" crimes of Israel since Hamas attacked Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel responded swiftly and fiercely in Gaza. Israel says it is only defending itself.

""Chaos is spreading,"" Sabbagh said. ""All that has happened has revealed the true intentions of the collective West. The United States has prevented the (Security) Council from fulfilling its responsibility to confront threats to international peace and security.""

Said the United Arab Emirates' foreign minister, Shekh Shakhboot Nahyan al-Nahyan, on the same topic: ""Even wars have rules.""

Meanwhile, the foreign minister of Nicaragua, Valdrack Ludwing Jaentschke Whitaker, said small nations like his would never back down -- even in the face of major powers.

To ""our invaders, those interventionists that are dressed in sheepskin, that have the faces of wolves,"" he said, ""we are peoples rich in culture, resources and community models. We are rich in values that have been disowned, distorted, slandered or worn down. We will not allow ourselves to be converted into needy beggars."""
Analysis: Iran reluctant so far to retaliate against Israel after airstrike kills Hezbollah leader,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-mideast-tensions-hezbollah-lebanon-analysis-5020aeed3c88790d5483fdf40c9ba392,2024-09-30T14:19:59Z,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Iran lost its most reliable ally in the Middle East when an Israeli airstrike killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. But Iran isn't leading the charge to retaliate.

""By the grace and power of God, Lebanon will make the transgressing, malicious enemy regret its actions,"" Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in the wake of Nasrallah's death Friday. But the 85-year-old paramount ruler in Iran gave no mention of his country taking action over the death of a man he once praised as ""an exceptional face in the world of Islam"" after the Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006.

That reluctance continued into Monday, as Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani told journalists that ""the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Iranian people are not after war"" but rather ""peace and stability in the region.""

Though Kananni added that, ""any adventurous move or action against our national security or interests and our hands will never be tied,"" at one point wearing a checkered Palestinian keffiyeh scarf during his remarks.

These comments highlight a reticence in responding to Nasrallah's death. Though his leadership of Hezbollah was the crown jewel in Iran's decades-long strategy of arming regional militias to counter both Israel and the United States, Iran remains cautious about when -- or if -- it will strike back.

That's not to say that it hasn't launched retaliatory strikes during the yearlong Israel-Hamas war that's riven the Middle East and threatens to erupt into a regional conflict. Iran launched an unprecedented direct attack on Israel in April. It even launched a missile strike against sites in Iraq, Syria and Pakistan in January.

But those attacks stemmed from direct attacks on Iranian targets, like the suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic post in Syria.

""Iran I think in its priorities have been very much misunderstood since Oct. 8,"" said Sanam Vakil, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the London-based international affairs think tank Chatham House. ""There was a misconception Iran would pile in.""

Instead, it hung back after Hamas -- another militant group it has armed -- launched its Oct. 7 attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw another 250 taken hostage. Even as millions of Iranians purportedly volunteered online to fight on behalf of the Palestinians, Iran didn't enter the war as an Israeli offensive devastated the Gaza Strip, killing over 41,000 people.

In the time since, an increasingly emboldened Israel has attacked Hezbollah, Yemen's Houthi rebels and other groups. In marking Nasrallah's killing, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cited a line in the Jewish Talmud fitting that strategy -- ""If someone rises up to kill you, kill him first.""

For Netanyahu, whose political career has revolved around the threat he perceives from Iran, that includes striking back at those Iranian allies Tehran refers to as the ""Axis of Resistance."" Those militias grew in prominence and power in the chaos that followed the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, the 2011 Arab Spring and the rise of Yemen's Houthi rebels.

That created what Iran's opponents feared would become a ""Shiite crescent"" of influence that Tehran would be able to wield, something Israel may be aiming to roll back.

""An increasingly emboldened Israel appears to be considering a more expansive plan to confront Iran across the Middle East with the ambition of creating a new regional order,"" said Julien Barnes-Dacey, the director of the Middle East and North Africa program at the European Council on Foreign Relations. ""This is a dangerous illusion. Despite Iran's current weakness, this will be seen as an existential threat by Tehran and its regional allies.""

Iran could encourage more asymmetric attacks, targeting Jewish tourists, synagogues or Israeli diplomatic missions as it has done in the past.

Tehran also could weaponize its nuclear program. It already enriches uranium to near-weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Hard-line voices within Iran's theocracy, like its daily Kahyan newspaper, already are calling for a response ""harsher"" than its April attack, which caused very little damage.

That, however, runs directly counter to the plans of Iran's new reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, who campaigned on a promise to get crushing economic sanctions lifted against Iran. That's grown in importance as energy prices continue to fall and Iran likely sells its oil at a discount due to being locked out of many nations.

If nuclear deal ""commitments are implemented fully and in good faith, dialogue on other issues can follow,"" Pezeshkian told the United Nations General Assembly last week.

Ending the sanctions requires a deal with the West on the nuclear program, something that will become nearly impossible if Iran enters an all-out war with Israel. Relieving that economic pressure remains crucial for Iran's domestic stability as well, as authorities remember the months of protests that followed the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini.

""For the time being it appears the president and the supreme leader, the latter who is abundantly cautious, want to keep the line open to dialogue and negotiations,"" Vakil said.

And to keep that line open, Iran needs someone else to take the lead against Israel.

""Tehran apparently is content to allow Hezbollah to respond to the Nasrallah killing on its own, and perhaps in concert with the Houthi movement in Yemen, which has recently begun firing some of their Iran-supplied missiles against Israel,"" the New York-based Soufan Center security think tank said Monday.

It's a 'very difficult time' for U.S. Jews as High Holy Days and Oct. 7 anniversary coincide,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/jewish-high-holy-days-israel-hamas-war-86e08fa096fa13df847a3f44c6f4431f,2024-09-30T12:19:39Z,"Known as ""The Days of Awe,"" Judaism's High Holy Days -- which begin on Wednesday -- annually provide an emotional mix of celebration, introspection and atonement for Jews around the world.

This year, for many, the emotions will be extraordinarily powerful, given that the midpoint of the 10 days spanning Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur is Oct. 7 -- the one-year anniversary of the Hamas attack that killed 1,200 Israelis and triggered the still-ongoing war in Gaza.

For Jews in the U.S. -- the world's second-largest Jewish community after Israel -- the past 12 months have been challenging in many ways linked to Oct. 7. There's been a surge in antisemitic incidents, and many college campuses were wracked by divisive pro-Palestinian protests. Jews grieved for Israelis killed or taken hostage by Hamas; many also are grieving for the tens of thousands of Palestinians subsequently killed during Israel's military offensive in Gaza.

""It's been a very difficult time, the most difficult time for a Jew in America that I've been alive,"" said Gayle Pomerantz, senior rabbi at Miami Beach's Temple Beth Sholom. ""I'm hoping that the holidays will help to contextualize our suffering and not let it overtake us.""

Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, said the confluence of the Holy Days and the Oct. 7 anniversary created ""an impossible moment"" for rabbis ministering to their congregations.

He noted that liturgy for Rosh Hashana - the Jewish New Year - includes posing the question, ""Who will live and who will die (in the coming year)?""

""That's going to resonate in a different way this year, for certain,"" Jacobs said, evoking Oct. 7 as ""a day of unbelievable grief in a war that is not only not ending, but maybe expanding.""

Heading into the 10-day span, Jews have reasons for both hope and apprehension.

Pomerantz and Jacobs each said they had seen signs of a resurgence of Jewish pride and solidarity. In Miami Beach, Pomerantz said, there have been higher enrollments in her synagogue's religious school and ""intro to Judaism"" classes, as well as in attendance at worship services.

""This is a moment where we need one another. We need community,"" said Jacobs, whose organization represents more than 800 Reform synagogues in North America.

At the same time, there is pervasive anxiety about a rise in antisemitic incidents over the past year.

Major Jewish groups have been tracking this trend, which was confirmed last week in the FBI's 2023 Hate Crime Report.

It found that the Jewish community was the most-targeted religious group, with 1,832 anti-Jewish incidents accounting for 67% of all religiously motivated hate crimes recorded by the FBI. That was up from up 1,124 incidents the prior year. The incidents include vandalism, harassment, assault, and false bomb threats.

One consequence: A mood of vigilance. Ahead of the High Holy Days, for example, there have been online training sessions offered by the Secure Community Network, which describes itself as the official safety and security organization of the Jewish community in North America.

Topics have included how to stop severe bleeding and how to respond to an ""active threat"" alert.

CSS, another Jewish security organization, has been offering classes in Krav Maga, a self-defense system developed for the Israel military that uses techniques derived from boxing, judo, karate and other disciplines.

The CEO and executive director of the Anti-Defamation League, Jonathan Greenblatt, provided a stark overview of the security situation in a recent interview with The Associated Press.

""I travel around the country all the time,"" he said. ""Any synagogue, any Jewish community center, any Jewish home for the elderly has armed guards in it -- people with firearms, in uniforms.""

""That is not normal,"" he said. ""You cannot find other elderly homes or YMCAs with armed guards.""

Looking ahead to the High Holy Days, Greenblatt said, ""It's kind of an existential moment.""

""In these 10 days, between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, it's going to be a lot of soul-searching in the Jewish community about where we are and where are we going,"" he said. ""If we're not safe on the campuses where we learn, in the places where we work, in the synagogues where we pray, where are we actually safe?""

Noah Farkas, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles, agreed that this is a difficult time, appropriate for asking existential questions.

""We are checking in with our higher selves to try to be better, asking, 'What do we do with our lives?'""

""The thing to do is to chose and to act,"" he said. ""To choose righteous things to do ... to be caring about others.""

Rabbi Moshe Hauer, executive vice president of the Orthodox Union, counseled anxious Jews to take a long view.

""If we're going to look at this narrow frame of what happened on Oct. 7 and subsequently, we can become very discouraged,"" he said. ""We have the ability to step back and see it in the context of a long history ... being misunderstood, being attacked, being hated, and then finding a way to be part of having justice prevail.""

On Rosh Hashana, Hauer said, Jews ""pray for a better world, where the presence of God and goodness will be clear and where evil will wither.""

""It seems right now we're actually as far away from that as we can be,"" he added. ""So there isn't a better time ... Our prayers are most powerful when they come from very deep feelings.""

In many Jewish communities across the U.S., special services are planned in conjunction with the Oct. 7 anniversary.

One distinctive example is in New York City, where Jews who oppose Zionism and support pro-Palestinian causes will convene for an evening service as Rosh Hashana begins on Wednesday.

Leading the service will be Rabbi Andy Kahn, executive director of the American Council for Judaism - an 82-year-old organization focused on Judaism as a religion as opposed to a nationality.

""I've felt a big part of my calling is creating spaces for people who want a Jewish life, but don't identify with Zionism,"" said Kahn. ""I know a lot of people - Jews, non-Jews, Palestinians -- who want Palestinian liberation and who are not antisemitic.""

In Florida, Pomerantz's Temple Beth Sholom will host a commemoration service for the Miami metro area in conjunction with other synagogues and institutions on Oct. 7.

Among the participants will be Rabbi Eliot Pearlson of Temple Menorah, a Conservative synagogue in Miami Beach, where he has lived since the 1960s. The island city, just outside Miami, became known as the Jewish Riviera because of its thriving community.

For the High Holy Days, Pearlson's message will be of unity and perseverance despite the ""tremendous trauma,"" highlighting that Jewish people repeatedly have endured and risen stronger from attacks throughout history.

""We thought we lived in a new modern world where ... we were hoping that things had changed,"" he told the AP. ""In reality, the players might have changed, but the game hasn't. And unfortunately, their motivation is to destroy the Jewish consciousness, the Jewish people, and heritage and culture.""

At Temple Beth Sholom, Pomerantz plans do something new for Yom Kippur -- the Day of Atonement. In the morning service, all six clergy at the temple will give short reflections about Israel, instead of one rabbi delivering a single message.

Pomerantz plans to focus on ""a framework of hope.""

Yemen's Houthi rebels claim shooting down another US-made drone,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-us-drone-bf72b98965b1b440f635e322971f5894,2024-09-30T10:01:06Z,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed Monday they shot down another American-made MQ-9 Reaper drone over the country, with videos purportedly showing a surface-to-air missile striking it. The U.S. military did not immediately acknowledge losing any aircraft.

The claimed attack comes as the one-year anniversary of the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip approaches. The Houthis have targeted ships traveling through the Red Sea over the war as U.S.-led airstrikes pound their positions in Yemen. That's imperiled a waterway that typically sees $1 trillion of trade pass through it, as well as crucial shipments of aid to war-torn Sudan and Yemen.

The Houthis also continue to launch missiles targeting Israel, drawing retaliatory airstrikes from the Israelis this weekend on the port city of Hodeida.

The Houthi-run broadcaster Al-Masirah claimed shooting down the MQ-9, hours after video footage circulated online showing the purported missile striking the aircraft over Yemen's Saada province. A single image online also appeared to show wreckage of the drone, with pieces resembling that of an MQ-9.

The U.S. military did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.

General Atomics Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes up to 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) and have an endurance of up to 24 hours before needing to land. The aircraft have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA over Yemen for years.

Since Houthis seized the country's north and its capital of Sanaa in 2014, the U.S. military has seen Reapers shot down in Yemen in 2017, 2019, 2023 and 2024. The U.S. military acknowledged the Houthis shot down two MQ-9s in September.

Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well.

The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.

Those attacks include a barrage that struck the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion in the Red Sea. Salvagers have towed away the burning oil tanker, hoping to avoid a catastrophic leak of its 1 million barrels of oil on board. Firefighting efforts onboard the Sounion began last week and ""the operation has proceeded with promising results as some fires are extinguished and other under control,"" the Joint Maritime Information Center reported Monday.

The center, overseen by the U.S. Navy, also acknowledged the last attack on a merchant ship by the Houthis came on Sept. 2, but the rebels remain a threat.

""Despite a drop in attacks against merchant vessels over the last two weeks, the Houthis have shown ability and willingness to target U.S. Navy assets and coalition partners,"" the center said. The Houthis claimed an attack targeted American warships last week."
Strike hits central Beirut as Hezbollah reels from Israel's elimination of much of its top command,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-news-09-30-2024-83ea5f243688f309754ec74850de4238,2024-09-30T09:19:03Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- An airstrike leveled an apartment building and killed three Palestinian militants in central Beirut early Monday, as Israel appeared to send a clear message that no part of Lebanon is out of bounds after wiping out much of the Hezbollah militant group's top command, including its leader, Hassan Nasrallah.

As recently as two weeks ago, such a strike, outside of the main areas where Hezbollah operates and next to a busy transportation hub, would have been seen as an escalation and likely followed by a long-range Hezbollah strike into Israel. But the unspoken rules of the long-running conflict, and Hezbollah's ability to respond, are no longer clear.

Israel has not claimed Monday's strike but is widely assumed to have carried it out.

Israeli strikes have killed Nasrallah and six of his top commanders in the last 10 days, and have hit what the military says are thousands of militant targets across large parts of Lebanon. Over 1,000 people have been killed in Lebanon, nearly a quarter of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry, and the government says the fighting may have displaced up to a million people.

Hezbollah has significantly increased its rocket attacks in the past week to several hundred daily, but most have been intercepted or fallen in open areas. Several people have been wounded in Israel. There have been no fatalities since two soldiers were killed near the border on Sept. 19.

It's possible that Hezbollah is holding back to avoid an even bigger escalation, including a threatened Israeli ground invasion. But the militant group might also be in disarray after Israeli intelligence apparently penetrated its highest levels.

The strike early Monday killed three members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a small, leftist faction that has not been meaningfully involved in months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.

In the past week, Israel has frequently targeted Beirut's southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence -- including the massive strike on Friday that killed Nasrallah -- but had not hit locations closer to the city center.

Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones and missiles into northern Israel after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack from Gaza into Israel sparked the war there. Hezbollah and Hamas are allies and both supported by Iran, and Hezbollah said it would continue the attacks in solidarity with the Palestinians until there was a cease-fire in Gaza.

Israel has responded to the rockets with airstrikes in Lebanon, where Hezbollah is based, and the fighting has steadily escalated over the past year, displacing tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border. Israel has vowed to keep fighting until the attacks stop and its citizens can return to their homes.

The United States and its allies have called for a cease-fire, hoping to avoid further escalation that could draw in Iran and set off a wider war. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has shown little interest, as his country racks up military achievements against a longtime foe.

Some Israelis broke into spontaneous celebrations after Nasrallah's death was announced. Videos circulated of crowds at bars singing a song in Hebrew mocking him. A news anchor on a pro-Netanyahu station sang and danced as the studio audience joined in with him while a commentator on Israel's largest TV station offered co-panelists celebratory shots.

Hezbollah, which boasts tens of thousands of battle-hardened fighters and long-range missiles capable of hitting anywhere inside Israel, has long been seen as the most powerful militant group in the region and a key partner to Iran in both threatening and deterring Israel. Hezbollah fought Israel to a monthlong stalemate in their 2006 war,

But Hezbollah has never faced an onslaught quite like this one, which began with a sophisticated attack on its pagers and walkie-talkies in mid-September that killed dozens of people and wounded around 3,000 -- including many fighters but also many civilians.

White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Israel's airstrikes in Lebanon had ""wiped out"" Hezbollah's command structure but warned that the group will work quickly to rebuild it.

""We're watching to see what they do to try to fill this leadership vacuum. It's going to be tough, he told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday."
Who were the 7 high-ranking Hezbollah officials killed over the past week?,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hezbollah-lebanon-nasrallah-israel-8b2ae56a54d641c6910a79e9e5699824,2024-09-29T20:30:38Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- In just over a week, intensified Israeli strikes in Lebanon killed seven high-ranking commanders and officials from the powerful Hezbollah militant group, including the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah.

The move left Lebanon and much of the Mideast in shock as Israeli officials celebrated major military and intelligence breakthroughs.

Hezbollah had opened a front to support its ally Hamas in the Gaza Strip a day after the Palestinian group's surprise attack into southern Israel.

The recent strikes in Lebanon and the assassination of Nasrallah are a significant escalation in the war in the Middle East, this time between Israel and Hezbollah.

Lebanon's most powerful military and political force now finds itself trying to recuperate from severe blows, having lost key members who have been part of Hezbollah since its establishment in the early 1980s.

Chief among them was Nasrallah, who was killed in a series of airstrikes that leveled several buildings in southern Beirut. Others were lesser-known in the outside world, but still key to Hezbollah's operations.

Since 1992, Nasrallah had led the group through several wars with Israel, and oversaw the party's transformation into a powerful player in Lebanon. Hezbollah entered Lebanon's political arena while also taking part in regional conflicts that made it the most powerful paramilitary force. After Syria's uprising 2011 spiraled into civil war, Hezbollah played a pivotal role in keeping Syrian President Bashar Assad in power. Under Nasrallah, Hezbollah also helped develop the capabilities of fellow Iran-backed armed groups in Iraq and Yemen.

Nasrallah is a divisive figure in Lebanon, with his supporters hailing him for ending Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon in 2000, and his opponents decrying him for the group's weapons stockpile and making unilateral decisions that they say serves an agenda for Tehran and allies.

Kaouk, who was killed in an airstrike Saturday, was the deputy head of Hezbollah's Central Council. He joined the militant group in its early days in the 1980s. Kaouk also served as Hezbollah's military commander in south Lebanon from 1995 until 2010. He made several media appearances and gave speeches to supporters, including in funerals for killed Hezbollah militants. He had been seen as a potential successor to Nasrallah.

Akil was a top commander and led Hezbollah's elite Radwan Forces, which Israel has been trying to push further away from its border with Lebanon. He was also a member of its highest military body, the Jihad Council, and for years had been on the United States' wanted list. The U.S. State Department says Akil was part of the group that carried out the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and orchestrated the taking of German and American hostages.

Wehbe was a commander of the Radwan Forces and played a crucial role in developing the group since its formation almost two decades ago. He was killed alongside Akil in an airstrike in Beirut's southern suburbs that struck and leveled a building.

Karaki led Hezbollah's southern front, playing a key role in the ongoing conflict. The U.S. described him as a significant figure in the militant group's leadership. Little is known about Karaki, who was killed alongside Nasrallah.

Surour was the head of Hezbollah's drone unit, which was used for the first time in this current conflict with Israel. Under his leadership, Hezbollah launched exploding and reconnaissance drones deep into Israel, penetrating its defense systems which had mostly focused on the group's rockets and missiles.

Kobeissi led Hezbollah's missile unit. The Israeli military says Kobeissi planned the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli soldiers at the northern border in 2000, whose bodies were returned in a prisoner swap with Hezbollah four years later.

Even in the months before the recent escalation of the war with Hezbollah, Israel's military had targeted top commanders, most notably Fuad Shukur in late July, hours before an explosion in Iran widely blamed on Israel killed the leader of the Palestinian Hamas militant group Ismail Haniyeh. The U.S. accuses Fuad Shukur of orchestrating the 1983 bombing in Beirut that killed 241 American servicemen.

Leaders of key units in the south, Jawad Tawil, Taleb Abdullah, and Mohammad Nasser, who over several decades became instrumental members of Hezbollah's military activity were all assassinated.

Nasrallah's second-in-command Naim Kassem is the most senior member of the organization. Kassem has been Hezbollah's deputy leader since 1991, and is among its founding members. On several occasions, local news networks were quick to assume that an Israeli strike in southern Beirut may have targeted Kassem.

Kassem is only top official of the militant group who has conducted interviews with local and international media in the ongoing conflict.

The deputy leader appears to be involved in various aspects of the militant group, both in top political and security matters, but also in matters related to Hezbollah's theocratic and charity initiatives to the Shia Muslim community in Lebanon.

Meanwhile, Hashim Safieddine who heads Hezbollah's central council, is tipped to be Nasrallah's successor. Safieddine is a cousin of the late Hezbollah leader, and his son is married to the daughter of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who was slain in a U.S. drone strike in 2020. Like Nasrallah, Safieddine joined Hezbollah early on and similarly wears a black turban.

Talal Hamieh and Abu Ali Reda are the two remaining top commanders from Hezbollah who are alive and apparently on the Israeli military's crosshairs."
"Behind the loudest issues, the UN is a world stage for disputes that are often out of the spotlight",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-guatemala-belize-russia-ukraine-gambia-genital-cutting-cuba-91733358c069861c18f04be4fb1f1594,2024-09-29T15:02:33Z,"The world's greatest stage is the sprawling Midtown Manhattan complex where leaders meet each year to discuss humanity's future.

The United Nations' most powerful body -- the Security Council -- is paralyzed by disputes, so this year's most varied speeches were delivered before the 193-member General Assembly.

Like the 15-nation Security Council with its five vetoes, the UNGA devoted much time to the Middle East, Russia, Ukraine and Sudan. But the more democratic institution also turned global attention to topics little-known outside individual countries and regions.

A look at some of the issues that countries brought to the world stage -- or ignored -- during their time on the global stage:

Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo spoke Tuesday and asserted that his country is moving beyond its dark past of U.S.-backed dictatorship, civil war and human-rights violations, saying that ""corruption drowns its roots in a past of authoritarianism, repression and political violence ... but we're freeing ourselves."" He turned to Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan, U.N. reform and migration before focusing on a definitively local issue, the longstanding border dispute between Guatemala and Belize.

Guatemala was a Spanish colony and Belize belonged to Great Britain until Guatemala won independence in 1821. Guatemala argues that it inherited Spain's claim to some 4,200 square miles (11,000 square kilometers) administered by Belize. Essentially the country's southern half, the area has nature reserves, farming villages, fishing towns and some Caribbean beaches. Belize rejects Guatemala's claim on the land. Diplomatic relations and even air travel have suffered and five Guatemalans have died in shootings blamed on Belize.

But before the General Assembly, Arévalo cited the relative lack of bloodshed as an example for the world. ""We've shown that the way of peace and respect for multilateral institutions is the most effective way to resolve international disputes,"" he said.

What's in a name? The archetypal local dispute. It centers on an ancient region divided by the modern national borders of Greece, Bulgaria and the country of North Macedonia.

That last name was adopted when the nation, population about 2.1 million, declared independence from the former Yugoslavia in 1991. Greece and what the U.N. cumbersomely used to call the ""Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"" went on to spar for nearly three decades. Greece said using ""Macedonia"" implied territorial claims on its own northern province of the same name and its ancient Greek heritage, not least as the birthplace of ancient warrior king Alexander the Great.

The name fight became ""infamous as a difficult and irresolvable problem,"" in the words of Zoran Zaev, the former prime minister of North Macedonia. Repeated rounds of U.N.-mediated negotiations proved fruitless until June 2018, when the government agreed to change the country's name to North Macedonia. The switch took effect but the dispute slowed North Macedonia's integration into the EU.

Bulgaria now has the main objection, a more important stumbling block than the name disagreement. President Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova told the General Assembly Thursday that ""in conditions of conflict on European soil, the stagnation of European integration not only demotivates Macedonian citizens and slows down reforms, but also destabilizes the region of Southeast Europe, leaving room for the penetration of malignant imperial and great power influences.""

For decades, one of Cuba's primary foreign-policy priorities has been ending the U.S. trade embargo on the island, and the country successfully dedicates much of its diplomacy to winning global critiques of the embargo.

According to Cuba's U.N. mission, more than 25 countries addressed the embargo at this year's UNGA and at least 11 leaders critiqued the U.S. inclusion of Cuba on the list of countries that sponsor terrorism, another sanction limiting international trade. Many of the countries that spoke have benefitted from another of Cuba's trademark programs, sending its well-trained and highly educated doctors to developing countries across the world.

Right after mentioning Ukraine and Gaza, Prime Minister Allah Maye Halina of Chad told the world that ""we can't ignore the embargo on Cuba, which hurts its people and hinders its development."" Mexico, Russia and China joined the chorus Saturday, with the Chinese foreign minister saying that ""we once again urge the United States to completely lift its blockade, sanctions and terrorism-related designation against Cuba.""

Some local issues are uncomfortable to discuss in front of the world, and nearly every leader addresses those issues delicately or ignores them.

Gambian President Adama Barrow was silent for months this year on a bill to repeal a ban on female genital cutting, the removal of external genitalia by traditional community practitioners or health workers. The practice, which still occurs in Gambia, Kenya, Tanzania, Sudan and Somalia and other nations, can cause serious bleeding, death and childbirth complications.

Barrow said in June that he supported maintaining the ban -- a declaration seen as key to Gambia's parliament keeping it. Barrow told the General Assembly this year that, ""my government places great emphasis on women's rights, and we are dedicated to protecting and empowering women.""

""As President, I will continue to ensure that women and girls are protected and given the necessary space to contribute meaningfully to our national development agenda,"" he said.

But the numbers tell a more difficult story for Gambian girls and women. The United Nations estimates that about 75% of women in Gambia have been subjected as young girls to cutting. In the past eight years some 30 million women globally have been cut, most of them in Africa but also in Asia and the Middle East, UNICEF said in March.

Some countries came to the UNGA against a backdrop of profound domestic disorder and focused some blame on external interference.

Libya plunged into chaos after a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. In the chaos that followed, the country split, with rival administrations in the east and west backed by rogue militias and foreign governments. Following years of strife, one of the country's dueling authorities unilaterally fired the country's powerful governor of the bank in August as militias mobilized in several key regions.

The presidential council in the capital of Tripoli, which is allied with the government of Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah that controls western Libya, removed Gov. Sadiq al-Kabir, who had for years distributed the country's oil revenues between the opposing sides. The spat led to a closure of one of the country's main oil fields.

The political crisis stems from the failure to hold elections on Dec. 24, 2021, and the refusal of Dbeibah -- who led a transitional government in the capital of Tripoli in the west -- to step down. In response, Libya's east-based parliament appointed a rival prime minister who was replaced, while the powerful military commander Khalifa Hifter continues to hold sway in the east.

The top U.N. official in Libya, Stephanie Khoury, said in August that the situation in Libya had deteriorated ""quite rapidly."" A series of U.N. envoys to the country have resigned after failing to make headway in moving closer to elections and unification. In April, the previous U.N. envoy for Libya, Abdoulaye Bathily, resigned, blaming the country's feuding parties and their foreign backers for the conflict's continuation.

""Challenges are huge and complex before us,"" Younis Menfi, president of Libya's presidential council, told the General Assembly on Wednesday. ""However, we're still trying to reach consensual solutions to unite our words and ranks and gather all parties around on table to find a national solution.""

Pope Francis suggests Israel's actions in Gaza and Lebanon are disproportionate and immoral,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/pope-israel-lebanon-hezbollah-72b592696627d1a671e7419e98e354b6,2024-09-29T14:37:15Z,"ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE (AP) -- Pope Francis suggested Sunday that Israel's attacks in Gaza and Lebanon have been ""immoral"" and disproportionate, saying its military domination has gone beyond the rules of war.

Francis was asked en route home from Belgium about Israel's targeted killing of one of Hezbollah's founding members, Hassan Nasrallah. Friday's strike in Beirut targeted an area greater than a city block and reduced several residential buildings to rubble, and at least six other deaths have been confirmed.

Francis didn't mention Israel by name and said he was speaking in general terms. But he said that ""the defense must always be proportionate to the attack.""

""When there is something disproportionate, there is a dominating tendency that goes beyond morality,"" he said. ""A country that does these things -- and I'm talking about any country -- in a superlative way, these are immoral actions.""

He said that even if war itself is immoral, there are rules that ""indicate some morality.""

""But when you don't do this ... you see the bad blood of these things,"" he said.

The death of Nasrallah has sent shockwaves throughout Lebanon and the Middle East, where he has been a dominant political and military figure for more than three decades.

U.S. President Joe Biden said the Israeli strike was a ""measure of justice"" for victims of Hezbollah's ""reign of terror.""

Francis has tried to strike a balance in his comments on the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel and the conflicts in Gaza and southern Lebanon that have ensued. He has called for an immediate cease-fire, for the release of hostages taken by Hamas and for humanitarian aid to get to Gaza.

Francis repeated that he calls the Catholic parish in Gaza every day to see how they are doing.

Israel-Hamas war latest: Israeli airstrike on northeast Lebanon kills 11,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-29-september-2024-688b1cfe3a405449149aa6fe5a6fcc17,2024-09-29T08:08:09Z,"An Israeli airstrike on northeast Lebanon killed 11 people Sunday morning, a day after the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah confirmed the death of multiple commanders, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah.

The Israeli army says it's carrying out attacks on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon.

Meanwhile, the number of those displaced by the conflict from southern Lebanon has more than doubled and now stands at more than 211,000, according to the United Nations.

Hezbollah and Israel have traded near-daily strikes since the Israel-Hama s war started after the Palestinian militant group stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, sparking fears of regional war.

Here is the latest:

BEIRUT -- Lebanon's state news agency says an Israeli airstrike early Sunday on a village in northeast Lebanon destroyed a home, killing 11 people.

Six of the bodies were recovered from under the rubble as the search continued for the remaining five in the village of al-Ain, reported National News Agency.

In southern Lebanon, the Islamic Risala Scout Association said five of its members were killed while performing their duties. It said four of the men killed were from the southern village of Tayr Debba while the fifth was from nearby Kabrikha.

More than 700 people have been killed in Lebanon since Sept. 23 when Israel intensified its airstrikes around the country forcing tens of thousands to flee their homes in south Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa Valley and Beirut's southern suburb known as Dahiyeh.

AMMAN, Jordan -- Jordan's military says a Grad missile fired from Lebanon fell in an open area without causing casualties or damage.

The missile was likely fired at Israel by Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group, which has intensified its rocket attacks after its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Friday.

Jordan and Israel, which share borders, signed a peace treaty in 1994. The Western-allied Arab country also helped intercept missiles fired at Israel by Iran in April.

Jordan has been fiercely critical of Israel's policies toward the Palestinians and has repeatedly called for a cease-fire in Gaza. It has also said it will not allow its territory to become a battlefield as tensions mount between Israel and Iran.

CAIRO -- Egypt's president warned that Israeli military operations in the Palestinian territories and Lebanon are pushing the region to the brink and called for international action.

Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, one of the mediators between Israel and Hamas, called for ""an immediate and comprehensive cease-fire"" in both Gaza and Lebanon amid an unprecedented escalation between Israel and Hezbollah. His remarks came after Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, was killed in an Israeli airstrike.

El-Sissi's comments came in a phone call late Saturday with Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, according to a statement from the Egyptian president's office. He also gave orders to send medical and humanitarian aid to Lebanon immediately.

Along with the United States and Qatar, Egypt has for months spearheaded negotiations between Israel and Hamas to end the war in Gaza. But negotiations have repeatedly stalled amid mounting fear of an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas. Diplomats see a cease-fire in Gaza as the best way to avert a regional war."
Hundreds of fleeing families sleep on beaches and streets after Israel's strikes shake Beirut,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-displaced-beirut-dahiyeh-children-583bbed45402d6802fa3643247924599,2024-09-28T16:17:04Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Smoke was still rising from Beirut's southern suburbs Saturday morning, visible to many of the families who had fled their homes there the night before to escape Israel's massive bombardment.

It had been a harrowing night -- getting out amid earthshaking explosions, looking in vain for space in one of the overflowing schools-turned-shelters. By the morning, hundreds of families were sleeping in public squares, on beaches or in cars around Beirut.

Lines of people trudged up to the mountains above the Lebanese capital, holding infants and a few belongings.

Overnight, Israel unleashed a series of strikes on various parts of Dahiyeh, the predominantly Shiite collection of suburbs on Beirut's southern edge where tens of thousands of residents live. The biggest blasts to hit Beirut in nearly a year of conflict killed the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah Friday.

The assault was part of a rapid escalation of Israeli strikes the past week that has killed more than 700 people in Lebanon. Israel has vowed to cripple Hezbollah and put an end to 11 months of its fire onto Israeli territory in what Nasrallah described as a ""support front"" for his ally Hamas in Gaza.

The people escaping Friday night's mayhem joined tens of thousands who have fled to Beirut and other areas of southern Lebanon the past week to escape Israel's bombardment.

For many residents of Dahiyeh, the forced evacuation was disconcertingly familiar.

Some were Lebanese who had lived through the bruising monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, when Israel leveled large parts of the Beirut suburbs. Others were Syrians who had taken refuge from the long civil war in their own country.

Fatima Chahine, a Syrian refugee, slept on the Ramlet al-Bayda public beach in Beirut with her family and hundreds of strangers. The night before she, her husband and their two children had piled onto a motorcycle and raced out of Dahiyeh, with ""bombing below us and strikes above us.""

""Thank God, no one was wounded,"" she said.

The government has opened up schools in Beirut to take in the displaced. But Syrians have reported that some sites turn them away to reserve the few spaces for Lebanese. Chahine said her family came directly to the beach.

""We only want a place where our children won't be afraid,"" she said. ""We fled from the war in Syria in 2011 because of the children and we came here, and now the same thing is happening again.""

Since Monday, some 22,331 Syrians in Lebanon have crossed back into Syria, along with 22,117 Lebanese, according to Lebanese authorities.

Chahine said returning is not an option for her family; she is from an opposition area and so could face reprisals from the Syrian government.

At the beach, the displaced were spread out over the sidewalk or in cars parked by the curb. Others were camped out in beach pagodas or on blankets in the sand.

""We spent more than three hours going in circles between schools and shelters and we didn't find one with room,"" said Talal Ahmad Jassaf, a Lebanese man who slept on the beach with his family. He said he is considering going to the relative safety of Syria. But he worries about airstrikes on the road between Beirut and Damascus.

The U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said this week's escalation had more than doubled the number of people displaced by the conflict in Lebanon. There are now over 211,000 people displaced, including some of the humanitarian workers who should be responding to the crisis, it said. Around 85,000 of them are sleeping in shelters, it said.

""Humanitarian capacities to respond have been severely overstretched,"" it added.

Displaced people sleeping outside in Beirut largely told The Associated Press that they had not received assistance from any humanitarian organization.

A stadium in the seaside neighborhood of Manara owned by the Nejmeh soccer club opened its doors to the displaced, who spent the night sleeping on bleachers.

Among them was Mariam Darwish, her husband and five children. She fled her home in Dahiyeh earlier in the week when the first Israeli strikes hit there.

Darwish said they had received water from the soccer club but that no organization had brought food, blankets or other supplies.

""People are helping each other out, family and friends are getting things for each other,"" she said.

She and her husband had fled during the 2006 war, when their oldest son was a baby, and returned to their home when the war ended. They hope their house will still be standing to return to this time, she said.

""We're worried about our children and the schools, that they'll lose out on their future,"" she said. ""What can we do? We can only say thank God.""

She added, ""May the resistance be victorious."" At the time of the interview, Hezbollah had not yet confirmed Nasrallah's death.

Despite their battered-down circumstances, others also struck a defiant tone.

Jamal Hussein fled Dahiyeh at 3 a.m. with his extended family amid ongoing bombing and spent the night sleeping on the seaside promenade in Beirut's upscale Ain Mreisseh district.

""Of course we aren't afraid for ourselves, but we have children,"" he said. ""We are steadfast and ready to sacrifice more than this."""
"China, at UN, warns against 'expansion of the battlefield' in the Ukraine war",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/china-united-nations-general-assembly-51ea58a6cd821656382f06ad0b3b93bc,2024-09-28T15:34:03Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Three days before his communist government turns 75, China's foreign minister warned fellow leaders Saturday against an ""expansion of the battlefield"" in Russia's war with Ukraine and said the Beijing government remains committed to shuttle diplomacy and efforts to push the conflict toward its end.

""The top priority is to commit to no expansion of the battlefield. ... China is committed to playing a constructive role,"" Wang Yi said. He warned against other nations ""throwing oil on the fire or exploiting the situation for selfish gains,"" a likely reference to the United States.

Wang's speech appeared to break no new ground, as is generally China's recent practice at the U.N. General Assembly's annual meeting of leaders. In fact, his boss, Chinese President Xi Jinping, has not participated in the leaders' meeting since 2021 -- and then only virtually, during the pandemic. Xi has not attended in person for several years.

On Friday, on the assembly sidelines, China and Brazil sought to build enthusiasm for their peace plan for Ukraine. They said about a dozen countries signed a communique that says they ""note"" the six-point plan. The plan calls for a peace conference with both Ukraine and Russia and no expansion of the battlefield, among other provisions.

Ukrainian officials have given the proposal a cold shoulder, but the countries that signed the communique are forming a group of ""friends for peace"" for their U.N. ambassadors to keep the conversation going among themselves. Ranging from Algeria to Zambia, the members are largely African or Latin American countries. Wang made sure to note Friday that the group doesn't decree individual countries' policies.

China has been an ally of Russia, a nation that has been accused of violating the U.N. Charter by Secretary-General António Guterres, the U.S. and many world nations. Moscow insists its so-called ""special military operation"" is in self-defense, which is allowed in the U.N. Charter.

China's continuing and vehement insistence on respect for other nations' sovereignty is not only a cornerstone of its foreign policy but a foundational ethos for the government of a nation that has traditionally struggled to maintain control at its edges -- from Xinjiang and Tibet in the far west to Hong Kong and Taiwan off its east coast.

China's current government was established on Oct. 1, 1949, when it was proclaimed by communist revolutionary-turned-leader Mao Zedong in Beijing's Tiananmen Square after a civil war with Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government. The Nationalists began ruling Taiwan as a self-governed island, and that practice continues today -- and is something that China rejects and insists is only a temporary situation for territory it considers sovereign.

""There is no such thing as two Chinas or one China-one Taiwan. On this matter there is no gray zone,"" Wang said. ""Taiwan will eventually return to the embrace of the motherland. This is the overwhelming trend of history that no one can stop.""

The Republic of China -- the government in Taiwan established by Chiang Kai-shek -- was a member of the United Nations until 1971, when the U.N. recognized the Beijing government. Since then, Beijing has worked to isolate Taiwan by rewarding nations that recognize it diplomatically and, sometimes, punishing those who do not. At every General Assembly high-level meeting, the leaders of scattered Taiwan-supporting nations -- usually small ones -- lament at the rostrum about the island's government being shunned by the international community.

Wang also weighed in with China's positions on increasing Mideast tensions and the situation on the Korean Peninsula. The latter has always been a key strategic priority for Beijing.

THE MIDEAST: Saying that ""the question of Palestine is the biggest wound in human conscience,"" Wang reiterated that China supports Palestinian statehood and full U.N. membership and insisted that a two-state solution is ""the fundamental way out."" He did not mention Israel by name or directly reference the war that began when Hamas fighters streamed across the Gaza border into Israel, killing hundreds and taking dozens hostage.

THE KOREAN PENINSULA: As is China's policy, Wang expressed support for a transition ""from the armistice to a peace mechanism."" The two Koreas technically remain in a state of war since a 1950-53 conflict separated the peninsula into north and south. China has been a longtime backer of North Korea while the United States is a close ally of the South. He offered a veiled warning about others trying to pull strings in East Asia: ""We are firmly against the meddling of countries outside the region.""

The Korean Peninsula broke into the U.S.-supported, capitalistic South Korea and the Soviet-backed, socialist North Korea after its liberation from Japan's 35-year colonial rule at the end of the World War II in 1945. The two Koreas have the world's most heavily fortified border.

HUMAN RIGHTS: Wang repeated China's usual talking points, saying that ""no country should infringe on another's internal affairs in the name of human rights"" and insisting that China had chosen its own way, which is just as legitimate as others'.

""We have found a path of human rights development that suits China's national condition,"" Wang said.

Other nations and international rights groups have long condemned Beijing's treatment of Tibetans, ethnic Uyghurs in the far-west region of Xinjiang and -- more recently -- activists in the ""special administrative region"" of Hong Kong.

"Iran Revolutionary Guard general died in Israeli strike that killed Hezbollah leader, reports say",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/iran-revolutionary-guard-general-dead-hezbollah-israel-airstrike-46d2133e594b9c4ce448a6b683802995,2024-09-28T13:43:27Z,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- A prominent general in Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard died in an Israeli airstrike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Iranian media reported Saturday.

The killing of Gen. Abbas Nilforushan marks the latest casualty suffered by Iran as the nearly yearlong Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip teeters on the edge of becoming a regional conflict. His death further ratchets up pressure on Iran to respond, even as Tehran has signaled in recent months that it wants to negotiate with the West over sanctions crushing its economy.

Nilforushan, 58, was killed Friday in the strike in Lebanon that killed Nasrallah, the state-owned Tehran Times reported. Ahmad Reza Pour Khaghan, the deputy head of Iran's judiciary, also confirmed Nilforushan's death, describing him as a ""guest to the people of Lebanon,"" the state-run IRNA news agency said.

Khaghan also reportedly said that Iran had the right to retaliate under international law.

The U.S. Treasury had identified Nilforushan as the deputy commander for operations in the Guard. It sanctioned him in 2022 and said he had led an organization ""directly in charge of protest suppression."" Those sanctions came amid the monthslong protests in Iran over the death of Mahsa Amini following her arrest for allegedly not wearing her headscarf, or hijab, to the liking of police.

Nilforushan also served in Syria, backing President Bashar Assad in his country's decades-long war that grew out of the 2011 Arab Spring. Like many of his colleagues, he began his military career in the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.

In 2020, Iranian state television called him a ""comrade"" of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of its expeditionary Quds Force who was killed in a U.S. drone attack in Baghdad that year.

"Hassan Nasrallah, longtime leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah, is killed by his archenemy Israel",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/obituary-nasrallah-lebanon-israel-2da3789a02fd4e2e88511a7f59174d19,2024-09-28T13:12:54Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who transformed the Lebanese militant group into a potent paramilitary and political force in the Middle East was killed in an Israeli airstrike, the group said. He was 64.

Nasrallah, who spearheaded Hezbollah's war against Israel in 2006 and got the group heavily involved in neighboring Syria's brutal conflict, was killed in a massive Israeli airstrike on the Beirut southern suburb of Haret Hreik Friday evening that knocked down several multi-story apartment buildings.

""His eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's secretary-general had joined his fellow great martyrs whom he had led for 30 years from one victory to another,"" Hezbollah said in a statement. It added that Nasrallah ""fell as a martyr on the road to Jerusalem.""

Nasrallah's death comes amid a dizzying escalation in the nearly yearlong conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, since the war in Gaza started, and more than three decades after he took leadership of the Iranian-backed militant group following the killing of his predecessor by an Israeli missile in 1992. Five years later, the United States designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization.

Hezbollah has been firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and Hamas, an allied Iran-backed militant group. Israel has responded with increasingly heavy airstrikes and the targeted killing of Hezbollah commanders while threatening a wider operation.

This week has been the deadliest in Lebanon since the bruising 2006 monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah.

Thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used mainly by Hezbollah members exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000, many of them civilians. Lebanon blamed Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny responsibility. Nasrallah had promised to retaliate.

Then, Israeli strikes on Lebanon killed more than 700 people in five days, including at least 150 women and children, according to Lebanese authorities.

Nasrallah had said the barrages would continue -- and Israelis wouldn't be able to return to their homes in the north -- until Israel's campaign in Gaza ended.

Seen by his supporters as a charismatic and shrewd strategist, Nasrallah had reshaped Hezbollah into an archenemy of Israel, cementing alliances with the ayatollahs in Tehran and Palestinian militant groups such as Hamas.

Idolized by his Lebanese Shiite followers and respected by millions of others across the Arab and Islamic world, Nasrallah held the title of sayyid, an honorific meant to signify the Shiite cleric's lineage dating back to the Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam.

Nasrallah's image appears on billboards in the group's strongholds across Lebanon -- especially in southern Beirut, Hezbollah's headquarters -- and on trinkets in souvenir shops not only in Lebanon but also in countries such as Syria and Iraq.

Despite the power he wielded, Nasrallah lived largely in hiding in the last years of his life for fear of an Israeli assassination, giving speeches to followers via a satellite link.

A fiery orator viewed as an extremist in the U.S. and much of the West, as well as in some oil-rich Gulf Arab countries, he was also considered a pragmatist, compared to the firebrand militants who dominated Hezbollah after its founding in 1982, during Lebanon's civil war.

Under Nasrallah, Hezbollah fought Israel to a stalemate during the 34-day war in 2006 and was credited with leading the war of attrition that led to the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon in 2000, after an 18-year occupation. Nasrallah's eldest son, Hadi, was killed in 1997, while fighting against Israeli forces.

When Syria's civil war erupted in 2011, Hezbollah fighters rushed in, siding with Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces -- even though Hezbollah's popularity took a dive as the Arab world ostracized Assad.

Along with Damascus' key allies Russia and Iran, Hezbollah played a major role in helping Assad stay in power and eventually retake territory lost in the early years of the conflict.

Hezbollah saw its popularity among Arabs surge again when it came to the defense of Hamas, opening a front with Israeli forces along the Israel-Lebanese border barely a day after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

The Hamas-led attack killed around 1,200 people in Israel and took about 250 hostage, triggering one of the most destructive military campaigns in modern history. Israel's subsequent aerial bombardment and ground invasion of the Gaza Strip killed tens of thousands of Palestinians.

In June 2024, Nasrallah warned Israel that Hezbollah had new weapons and capabilities. Nasrallah also claimed that Hezbollah now has a far higher number of fighters than the 100,000 figure he gave three year earlier.

Nasrallah, the eldest of nine siblings, was born into a poor family in Beirut's impoverished northern suburb of Sharshabouk. In 1975, the Lebanese civil war forced the family to flee south, to their ancestral home in Bazzouriyeh, a village near the ancient Phoenician port city of Tyre.

There, Nasrallah joined the Amal movement, a political and paramilitary organization representing the once-marginalized Shiites in Lebanon, and soon began his rise as a revolutionary.

At the age of 16, he went to Iraq's holy Shiite city of Najaf where the leader of Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution, the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, lived in exile at the time and taught theology. Later, Nasrallah studied in the city of Qom, the seat of Iran's religious hierarchy.

Nasrallah was among Hezbollah's founders when the party was formed by Iranian Revolutionary Guard members who came to Lebanon in the summer of 1982 to fight invading Israeli forces.

He built a power base as Hezbollah over time became part of a cluster of Iranian-backed factions and governments known as the Axis of Resistance. It was also the first group that Iran backed and used as a way to export its brand of political Islam.

Two days after its leader, 39-year-old Sayyed Abbas Musawi, was killed in an Israeli helicopter gunship raid in south Lebanon, Hezbollah chose Nasrallah as its secretary-general in February 1992.

Like Musawi, Nasrallah was committed to the struggle against Israel and Khomeini's anti-Western teachings, and famously declared: ""America will remain the dreadful enemy and Israel a cancerous growth that should be uprooted.""

Wearing spectacles and sporting a bushy grey beard like many religious Shiite men, Nasrallah's image was far from that of a militant who commanded thousands of heavily armed, well-trained and battle-hardened followers.

He often paused in his speeches to make jokes or break into local dialect and once, responding to a reporter asking about his monthly salary during a television interview, Nasrallah said it was about $1,300.

Following the end of Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war, Nasrallah gradually turned the organization into a ""state within a state,"" with an elaborate social welfare network that provided schools, clinics, and housing in the impoverished and predominantly Shiite parts of Lebanon.

After Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000, Nasrallah rose to iconic status both within Lebanon and throughout the Arab world. His messages were beamed on Hezbollah's own radio and satellite TV station.

In a famous speech marking the Israeli withdrawal, he said: ""It (Israel) has a nuclear weapon and the strongest air force in the region, but in truth, it is weaker than a spider's web.""

As Israel, and later Syria, pulled their armies out of Lebanon, Nasrallah began to steer Hezbollah increasingly into the realm of politics. In the 2005 parliamentary elections, the first after Syria ended its 29-year military presence in Lebanon, Hezbollah made substantial gains and joined the Cabinet for the first time, holding two seats.

In July 2006, after Hezbollah captured two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border attack, Israel launched a monthlong massive air, sea and ground campaign against Lebanon. Nasrallah's home and offices and much of the group's infrastructure were destroyed, as well as much of south Lebanon and Beirut's southern suburbs.

Hezbollah fired around 4,000 rockets into Israel and after 34 days of fighting, a truce took effect and Nasrallah declared a ""divine victory"" over Israel.

While he was cheered for standing up to the Israeli army, Nasrallah was criticized by many for providing the spark for that war during which more than 1,200 people died in Lebanon -- most of them civilians -- and 159 in Israel.

Nasrallah later expressed regret -- an unprecedented move for him -- and said during a televised interview that Hezbollah had not expected ""even one percent"" that the capture of the Israeli soldiers ""would lead to a war of this magnitude.""

""You ask me, if I had known ... that the operation would lead to such a war, would I do it? I say no, absolutely not,"" he said.

In May 2008, Hezbollah's reputation suffered a setback when its fighters briefly seized much of west Beirut, turning their guns on local Lebanese foes after the government took measures against the group's private telecommunications network.

In the years that followed, a U.N.-backed tribunal in the Netherlands sentenced three Hezbollah members in absentia to five concurrent life sentences over the 2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Hezbollah ignored the tribunal and repeatedly denied its members were involved in the massive suicide bombing along the Beirut corniche that killed Hariri and 21 others, an attack that deeply divided Lebanon.

During the Arab Spring uprisings against autocratic governments, Hezbollah's close alliance with Syria and Iran opened the group to accusations that it was merely a well-armed tool of Damascus and Tehran.

Hezbollah was also pulled into the regional rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia and in 2016, the Saudi-led, six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council branded Hezbollah a terrorist organization.

But Hezbollah's anti-Israel campaign remained at its forefront as the group continued to build up its arsenal of tens of thousands of missiles, including precision-guided missiles, as well as drones.

After 2006, the Lebanon-Israel border remained mostly calm until Hamas' October 2023 deadly incursion into Israel. The next day, Hezbollah began attacking Israeli military posts and drawing Israeli fire in what became near-daily exchanges. Nasrallah said the aim was to ease the tension from the Gaza Strip.

Nasrallah is survived by his wife, Fatima Yassin. He also has three sons Jawad, Mohammed-Mahdi and Mohammed Ali, and a daughter Zeinab, as well as several grandchildren."
Israel-Hamas war latest: Smoke rises from Beirut's southern suburbs after a night of Israeli attacks,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-28-september-2024-bad4f10c71b1d060a8f98fe13037da20,2024-09-28T06:40:30Z,"Smoke rose from Beirut's southern suburbs Saturday morning and the streets were empty after the area was pummeled overnight by heavy Israeli airstrikes.

Attacks on Hezbollah targets by fighter jets Friday continued into the early hours Saturday after the army said it told residents to evacuate three buildings it was targeting.

Hours before the strikes, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the United Nations, vowing that Israel's campaign against Hezbollah would continue -- further dimming hopes for an internationally backed cease-fire. Netanyahu abruptly cut his United States visit short and returned to Israel.

More than 720 people have been killed in Lebanon since the conflict escalated Monday, according to Lebanon's health ministry.

The United Nations says the number of those displaced by the conflict from southern Lebanon has more than doubled, with more than 211,000 people now displaced. At least 20 primary health care centers have shut down in hard-hit areas of Lebanon, the U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said.

Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Hamas after it stormed into Israel, sparking the Israel-Hamas war. Top Israeli officials have threatened to repeat the destruction of Gaza in Lebanon if the Hezbollah fire continues, raising fears that Israel's actions in Gaza since Oct. 7 would be repeated in Lebanon.

Here's the latest:

BEIRUT -- Patients in hospitals in Beirut's southern suburbs will be evacuated to medical centers in the capital and the nearby Mount Lebanon region, Lebanon's Health Ministry says.

In a statement carried by state news agency early Saturday, the ministry called on hospitals in Beirut and Mount Lebanon to stop receiving cases that can be delayed in order to receive patients evacuating from the hard-hit southern suburb Dahiyeh.

The ministry's decision came after a night of Israeli airstrikes on Dahiyeh, a predominantly Shiite district. The ministry also called on hospitals and medical centers to care for ill people who fled Dahiyeh overnight as a result of the airstrikes.

BEIRUT -- Smoke rose from Beirut's southern suburbs Saturday morning and the streets were empty after the area was pummeled overnight by heavy Israeli airstrikes.

Explosions rocked Beirut's southern suburbs, with flames lighting up the pre-dawn darkness. Fire raged from at least one location, and smoke and flames were seen from above Beirut early Saturday. Residents reported jets flying overhead.

In a short statement, the Israeli military described the sites it hit as belonging to Hezbollah. Authorities there did not immediately acknowledge if there were any casualties.

Shelters set up in the city center for people displaced by the onslaught were overflowing. Many families slept in public squares and beaches, or in their cars. On the roads leading to the mountains above the capital, hundreds of people could be seen making an exodus on foot, holding infants and whatever belongings they could carry.

JERUSALEM -- Israel's military said it killed a Hezbollah missile unit commander and his deputy during a strike in southern Lebanon earlier in the week.

Israel Defense Forces said in a statement that its air forces killed Muhammad Ali Ismail, who it said was responsible for directing ""numerous terror attacks"" against Israel, including the firing of rockets towards Israeli territory.

The Tuesday strike also killed the commander's deputy, Hussein Ahmad Ismail, it said.

There was no immediate confirmation from Hezbollah.

BEIRUT -- The United Nations said the escalating violence between Israel and Hezbollah has forced at least 20 primary health care centers to shut down in hard-hit areas of Lebanon.

The U.N. Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, said in the latest escalation that began earlier in the week, Israeli airstrikes impacted 25 water facilities, affecting access to clean water for nearly 300,000 in high-risk areas.

The escalation since Sept. 23 has also more than doubled the number of those displaced by the conflict from southern Lebanon. There are now over 211,000 people displaced, some 85,000 of them now living in public schools and other shelters spread around the country's north and east.

A new phase of escalation began Friday, when Israel targeted Hezbollah's leader in the southern suburb of Beirut, in one of the largest blasts to hit the Lebanese capital in years. The fate of the group's leader is still unknown. After the initial strike early Friday evening, Israeli warplanes continued to pound buildings and targets in the southern suburb for over six hours. Smoke and balls of fire covered the Beirut skyline for hours."
"Europeans, Arab and Muslim nations launch a new initiative for an independent Palestinian state",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/un-norway-palestinian-state-saudi-arabia-eu-c9116cdb5f23574e668de65f6a7aca71,2024-09-28T05:30:46Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- European, Arab and Islamic nations have launched an initiative to strengthen support for a Palestinian state and its institutions, and prepare for a future after the war in Gaza and escalating conflict in Lebanon, Norway's foreign minister said Friday.

Espen Barth Eide told The Associated Press that ""there is a growing consensus in the international community from Western countries, from Arab countries, from the Global South, that we need to establish a Palestinian Authority, a Palestinian government, a Palestinian state -- and the Palestinian state has to be recognized.""

Eide said many issues need to be addressed, including the security interests of Israel and the Palestinians, recognition and normalization of relations after decades of conflict and the demobilization of Hamas as a military group.

""These are pieces of a bigger puzzle,"" Norway's chief diplomat said. ""And you can't just come in there with one of these pieces, because it only works if all the pieces are laid in place.""

But even if the puzzle is completed, it's unlikely to gain traction with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Still, Eide believes that after decades of failed or stalled negotiations, ""we need to take a new approach"" to achieving an independent Palestinian state.

To accelerate work on these issues, Eide said almost 90 countries attended a meeting Thursday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly's current gathering of world leaders. He and Saudi Arabia's foreign minister co-chaired the session to launch ""The Global Alliance for the Implementation of a Palestinian State and a Two-State Solution.""

""We have to see how we can come out of this deadlock and try to use this deep crisis also as an opportunity to move forward,"" Eide told a U.N. Security Council meeting on Gaza later Friday.

Norway is the guarantor of the 1993 Oslo Accords, hailed as a breakthrough in the decades-long conflict between Arabs and Jews, which created the Palestinian Authority and set up self-rule areas in the Palestinian Authority. Eide said more than 30 years later, Israel's ""occupation"" is continuing, and there there are no negotiations leading to a final settlement and an independent Palestinian state -- which led to Norway's decision in May to recognize a Palestinian state.

Now, 149 of the U.N.'s 193 member nations have recognized a Palestinian state. Eide urged all countries ""to contribute to universal recognition"" and strengthen Palestinian institutions so they live up to the expectations of people in the West Bank and are prepared to return to Gaza: ""We want one Palestine, not different Palestines,"" he said.

Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud told the U.N. Security Council on Friday that his country, the joint Islamic-Arab ministerial committee, Norway and the European Union launched the alliance ""because we feel responsible to act to change the reality of the conflict without delay.""

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell urged all countries to take practical measures ""to bring about the free Palestine next to a secure Israel.""

Borrell said on X that the first meetings of the alliance would be in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Brussels.

Borrell asked rhetorically of anyone who opposes a two-state solution: What is the solution, and can it be implemented? He stressed that work on this initiative will move ahead quickly.

Eide said this new effort is built on the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, ""but updated to today's reality.""

The 2002 initiative, endorsed by the Arab League and the 57-member Organization of Islamic Cooperation, offered Israel normalized relations in exchange for a full withdrawal from territories captured in 1967.

He said efforts started long ago to build the institutions of a Palestinian state.

""It's difficult,"" Eide said. ""Their hands are tied in many ways. We're seeing an increasing amount of illegal settlements and settle violence.""

""But still, there is an embryonic institution there that we have to strengthen,"" he said.

Eide said he chaired a meeting Thursday of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee for the Building of Palestinian Institutions, with the United States, Canada, the EU and many Mideast and European countries contributing.

""None of these tools will solve the problem on their own, and we never pretended that, but we're trying to build a body of instruments that will take us forward to a peaceful settlement,"" Eide said. ""And I am convinced it will happen here."""
"What to know from the UN: Netanyahu says no cease-fire, but other countries keep asking",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-un-general-assembly-guide-357ba48d01adc6acdd80a503a4734c80,2024-09-27T22:46:45Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- After a day filled with hopes of a cease-fire between Lebanon and Israel, the U.N. General Assembly meeting Friday was a harsh reality check.

Israeli Prime Minister BENJAMIN NETANYAHU shut down the idea in a morning speech that he said he didn't initially intend to make. He said he had not planned to come to the meeting this year, because his country is at war, but ""after I heard the lies and slanders leveled at my country by many of the speakers at this podium, I decided to come here and set the record straight.""

The week has been full of speakers calling for a cease-fire in both Lebanon and Gaza, continuing into Friday. But Netanyahu wasn't swayed. He said his nation will ""continue degrading Hezbollah"" until achieving its goals along the Lebanon border, and would no longer tolerate daily rocket fire from the area. Shortly after Netanyahu wrapped up his speech, the Israeli military said it carried out a strike on Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut, which caused huge blasts in the city.

Here's your daily guide to what's going on at the United Nations this week:

MORE ANTI-WAR: Calls for Israel to stop its war in Gaza and back off from a growing conflict in Lebanon continued. The two speakers who preceded Netanyahu each made a point of calling out Israel for its actions. ""Mr. Netanyahu, stop this war now,"" Slovenian Prime Minister ROBERT GOLOB said as he closed his remarks, pounding the podium. And Pakistani Prime Minister SHEHBAZ SHARIF, speaking just before the Israeli leader, declared of Gaza: ""This is not just a conflict. This is systematic slaughter of innocent people of Palestine."" He thumped the rostrum to audible applause.

PROMISE FOR DEMOCRACY: Tanzania Prime Minister KASSIM MAJALIWA pledged that his country will uphold democracy and human rights ahead of next year's presidential election. An opposition party official was killed in early September and two main opposition leaders were arrested among a dozen other opposition politicians while planning a youth rally and during protests against recent killing and arrest of opposition officials and members. President SAMIA SULUHU has condemned the killing of the opposition official Ali Kibao and promised justice. She's serving out the term of the late President JOHN MAGUFULI, whose autocratic rule saw the ban on political rallies and detention of opposition leaders.

POETRY IN POLICY: As Pakistan tries to climb out of an economic crisis, Sharif turned Friday to poetry to convey his country's resolve. Addressing world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, he read aloud part of ""Keep Going,"" a 1921 piece by American poet Edgar A. Guest. It begins ""When things go wrong, as they sometimes will"" -- when, for example, ""the funds are low and the debts are high."" (Sharif substituted ""credits"" for ""funds."") Pakistan's debts are indeed substantial. The International Monetary Fund this week approved a $7 billion loan for the nation, which plunged into one of the worst economic crises in its history after flooding in 2022. Sharif's government raised electricity prices, saying the hike was necessary to meet conditions of the new loan. The increase spurred protests and a merchants' strike. Sharif told the assembly that his government has ""taken some very difficult but necessary decisions that have rescued our economy from collapse."" Then he brought up the poem, saying it had bucked him up. He went through a stanza that ends: ""When care is pressing you down a bit, / Rest if you must, but don't you quit."" ""This,"" Sharif told the assembly, ""is how we have learned to face our challenges and negotiate the most daunting challenges that we have faced.""

CUBA COMMENTS: For decades Cuba's primary foreign-policy priority has been ending the U.S. trade embargo on the island. The country dedicates much of its General Assembly diplomacy to getting leaders to decry the embargo. According to Cuba's U.N. mission, by 3:41 p.m. on Friday 25 countries had addressed the embargo at this year's UNGA and 11 leaders had critiqued the U.S. inclusion of Cuba on the list of countries that sponsor terrorism, another sanction limiting international trade. Many of the countries that spoke have benefitted from another of Cuba's trademark programs, sending its well-trained and highly educated doctors to developing countries across the world. Right after mentioning Ukraine and Gaza, Prime Minister ALLAH MAYE HALINA of Chad told the world that ""we can't ignore the embargo on Cuba, which hurts its people and hinders its development.""

Norwegian Foreign Minister ESPEN BARTH EIDE, who was in the General Assembly hall listening to Netanyahu, called his address ""a rather dark speech"" that was ""very defiant."" Norway recognized the State of Palestine in May. Eide said there are many countries that would like to support Israel and normalize relations, including Saudi Arabia and others in region, ""but they are not able to do that as long as the Palestinian question remains unanswered.""

FUNDRAISERS, ADVOCATES: As the meeting of world leaders unfolds at the United Nations, a crush of events unfold on the sidelines of the official high-level meetings, where nonprofits, advocates and fundraisers mingle and lobby world leaders, billionaires and funders -- and plan their next steps with each other. A few examples: On Sunday, throngs of people streamed through a ""climate science fair "" showcasing work on nature, food and the energy transition, held across Manhattan on an elevated park that runs along old rail lines. On Monday, the BILL & MELINDA GATES Foundation held a ceremony featuring Grammy-winning musician JON BATISTE performing in a gold sequin suit, and honoring Brazilian PRESIDENT LUIZ INÁCIO LULA DA SILVA for his work lifting millions out of poverty and significantly reducing malnutrition among children.

Papua New Guinea's prime minister, JAMES MARAPE, told the General Assembly that accessing money to fight climate change has been a challenge. ""It is for this reason I speak in solidarity with all forest nations, especially those in the Congo Basin and Amazon Basin, for adequate compensation if we are to preserve our forests which, in fact, are the lungs of Earth,"" Marape said.

""It is regrettable that the Republic of China, Taiwan, continues to be excluded from the United Nations system.""

-- FELETI PENITALA TEO, prime minister of Tuvalu

Ugandan Prime Minister NABBANJA ROBINAH asked the assembly why the U.N. has failed to forge stronger international cooperation in response to collective global challenges. ""Urgent action is required to address global inequalities with regard to poverty, hunger and disease which continue to affect disproportionally the poorest and most vulnerable,"" she said.

If you're following along and confused by all the strange words, take a look at our brief vocabulary of U.N. terms.

The largest number of police and troops sent by a country to U.N. peacekeeping missions this year, from Nepal: 6,119

""Even the strongest swimmer drowns if left alone in a raging sea. ""

-- Bahamas Prime Minister PHILIP DAVIS

""We believe the 'monsoon revolution' that the world witnessed in Bangladesh in the span of few weeks may inspire many across communities and countries to stand for freedom and justice. I would call upon the international community to engage with 'new Bangladesh' anew that aims to realize freedom and democracy, beyond letters, for everyone.""

-- MUHAMMAD YUNUS, chief adviser in Bangladesh and Nobel Prize laureate

The assembly is scheduled to hear from China, Mexico, Saudi Arabi, and Egypt, among others, on Saturday.

Israeli airstrikes on Friday afternoon knocked out six buildings in Beirut's southern suburb of Harek Hreik, the largest strike in the Lebanese capital in nearly a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.

The Israeli military said the strike, which killed and wounded dozens of people, hit the headquarters of Hezbollah in Beirut. Three major Israeli TV channels said Nasrallah was the target of the strikes in Beirut's southern suburbs, which has not been officially confirmed by Israel. Hezbollah officials did not comment.

Here's a look at the fiery, charismatic leader:

Under the leadership of the 64-year-old Nasrallah, Hezbollah has fought wars against Israel and taken part in the conflict in neighboring Syria, helping tip the balance of power in favor of President Bashar Assad.

A charismatic and shrewd strategist, Nasrallah reshaped Hezbollah into an archenemy of Israel, cementing alliances with Shiite religious leaders in Iran and Palestinian militant groups such as Hamas.

Idolized by his Lebanese Shiite followers and respected by millions of others across the Arab and Islamic world, Nasrallah holds the title of sayyid, an honorific meant to signify the Shiite cleric's lineage dating back to the Prophet Muhammad, the founder of Islam.

A fiery orator viewed as an extremist in the U.S. and much of the West, he is also considered a pragmatist compared to the firebrand militants who dominated Hezbollah after its founding in 1982, during Lebanon's civil war.

Despite the power he wields, Nasrallah has lived largely in hiding in the past years for fear of an Israeli assassination.

Born in 1960 into a poor Shiite family in Beirut's impoverished northern suburb of Sharshabouk, Nasrallah was later displaced to south Lebanon. He studied theology and joined the Amal movement, a Shiite political and paramilitary organization, before becoming one of Hezbollah's founders.

Hezbollah was formed by Iranian Revolutionary Guard members who came to Lebanon in the summer of 1982 to fight invading Israeli forces. It was the first group that Iran backed and used as a way to export its brand of political Islam.

Nasrallah built a power base as Hezbollah over time became part of a cluster of Iranian-backed factions and governments known as the Axis of Resistance.

Two days after its leader, 39-year-old Sayyed Abbas Musawi, was killed in an Israeli helicopter gunship raid in south Lebanon, Hezbollah chose Nasrallah as its secretary-general in February 1992.

Five years later, the United States designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization.

Under Nasrallah, Hezbollah was credited with leading the war of attrition that led to the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon in 2000, after an 18-year occupation. Nasrallah's eldest son, Hadi, was killed in 1997, fighting against Israeli forces.

After Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000, Nasrallah rose to iconic status both within Lebanon and throughout the Arab world. His messages were beamed on Hezbollah's own radio and satellite TV station.

That status was further cemented when, in 2006, Hezbollah fought Israel to a stalemate during the 34-day war.

When Syria's civil war erupted in 2011, Hezbollah fighters rushed in, siding with Assad's forces -- even though Hezbollah's popularity took a dive as the Arab world ostracized Assad.

A day after the Israel-Hamas war started on Oct. 7, Hezbollah began attacking Israeli military posts along the border calling it a ""backup front"" for Gaza.

In speeches throughout the conflict, he has argued that Hezbollah's cross-border strikes had pulled away Israeli forces that would otherwise be focused on Hamas in Gaza and insisted that Hezbollah would not halt its attacks on Israel until a cease-fire is reached in Gaza.

Over the past weeks, he continued to strike a defiant tone as tension rose dramatically, with Israel announcing a new phase in the conflict intended to push Hezbollah back from the border to allow thousands displaced from northern Israel to return.

It launched strikes killing top military commanders with the group and was blamed for the explosion of thousands of communications devices, mainly used by Hezbollah members, that killed 37 people and wounded thousands."
Five days of frantic US diplomacy on Lebanon has yielded little,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-us-diplomacy-ebd96ed549d98f2362a9ba05ea1e1199,2024-09-27T20:09:45Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- President Joe Biden's administration headed into the annual U.N. General Assembly gathering of world leaders this week with high hopes that he could cement his legacy as an international statesman during escalating conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine.

Yet five days of frantic diplomacy focused mainly on preventing the Israel-Hezbollah crisis from exploding into a full-scale war has yielded little, if any, results -- and prospects for peace have further dimmed.

Despite a proposal from the U.S., France and other allies for a temporary cease-fire along the border with Lebanon, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a defiant speech Friday to the General Assembly, vowing to keep up operations against Hezbollah until tens of thousands of Israeli citizens displaced by rocket attacks can return home.

As Netanyahu spoke, Israel launched a massive strike on Hezbollah's main headquarters in Beirut. He then cut his already-truncated visit to New York short and was poised to head home without plans to meet senior U.S. officials.

Netanyahu's speech and his abbreviated trip -- without seeing anyone from Israel's largest and most important backer, the United States -- underscored the limits of American influence, which many believe has been waning since Israel's war with Hamas, another Iranian-backed militant group, began nearly a year ago.

""If we're able to get the cease-fire in the north, that may create some space and maybe even some momentum to try to get the Gaza cease-fire, the Gaza hostage deal, over the finish line,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken told MSNBC on Thursday.

This week began with Biden's top national security aides working to build support for a 21-day Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire that they hoped might also breathe new life into stalled efforts to secure a truce in Gaza.

After three days of intense talks with partners and allies -- punctuated by a brief spat between the United States and France over the timing -- the proposal was presented late Wednesday.

The Americans were particularly perturbed by France calling an emergency U.N. Security Council session on Lebanon for Wednesday evening -- at which the French foreign minister previewed the as-yet unfinished proposal -- while at the same time Biden was hosting a reception for world leaders at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. That effectively forced the U.S. to unveil it before many officials believed it was ready.

Nearly four hours after that Security Council meeting began, the White House released the plan. U.S. officials then offered upbeat assessments of its prospects over the objections of some in the Biden administration who had urged caution, according to several people familiar with the negotiations who spoke on condition of anonymity to detail private discussions.

After consulting with senior Israeli officials, Blinken and other diplomats had expected Israel to at least welcome, if not endorse, the plan. Instead, Netanyahu appeared to reject it when he arrived in New York on Thursday. He later clarified that Israel supports the goals of the cease-fire.

But in his U.N. speech, the Israeli leader castigated much of the world for trying to push his country into accepting an untenable situation along its northern border.

""We'll continue degrading Hezbollah until all our objectives are met,"" he told the General Assembly on Friday, just before reports emerged that Israeli had struck Hezbollah's headquarters. ""I've come here today to say: Enough is enough."""
"Wrapping up mission, US troops will leave some longstanding bases in Iraq under new deal",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/iraq-us-troops-military-withdrawal-iran-a79aa83dca8f776f87a138bfe5697fa3,2024-09-27T19:18:28Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. announced an agreement with the Iraqi government Friday to wrap up the military mission in Iraq of an American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group by next year, with U.S. troops departing some bases that they have long occupied during a two-decade-long military presence in the country.

But the Biden administration refused to provide details on how many of the approximately 2,500 U.S. troops still serving in Iraq will remain there or acknowledge it will mark a full withdrawal from the country.

""I think it's fair to say that, you know, our footprint is going to be changing within the country,"" Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Friday without providing specifics.

The announcement comes at a particularly contentious time for the Middle East, with escalating conflict between Israel and two Iranian-backed militant groups -- Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza -- threatening a broader regional war. Bases housing U.S. forces and contractors have been regularly targeted by Iran-backed militias over the last several years, and those attacks intensified late last year and early this spring after the Israel-Hamas war broke out nearly a year ago.

For years, Iraqi officials have periodically called for a withdrawal of coalition forces, and formal talks to wind down the U.S. presence in the country have been going on for months.

U.S. officials who briefed reporters Friday said the agreement will bring about a two-phase transition in the troops assigned to Iraq that began this month. In the first phase, which runs through September 2025, the coalition mission against ISIS will end and forces will leave some longstanding bases.

Following the November election, American forces will start departing from Ain al-Asad airbase in western Iraq and from Baghdad International Airport, according to Iraqi government officials who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity. Those forces will be moved to Hareer base in Erbil, in northern Iraq's Kurdistan region.

In the second phase, the U.S. will continue to operate in some fashion from Iraq through 2026 to support counter-ISIS operations in Syria, a senior Biden administration official and a senior defense official said on the condition of anonymity on a call with reporters to provide details ahead of the announcement.

Ultimately, the U.S. military mission would transition to a bilateral security relationship, the U.S. officials said, but they did not indicate what that might mean for the number of American troops who remain in Iraq in the future.

The Iraqi officials said some American troops may stay at Hareer base after 2026 because the Kurdistan regional government would like them to stay.

""We have taken an important step in resolving the issue of the international coalition to fight ISIS,"" Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani said in a speech this month. He noted ""the government's belief in the capabilities of our security forces that defeated the remnants of ISIS.""

The continued presence of U.S. troops has been a political vulnerability for Sudani, whose government is under increased influence from Iran. Iraq has long struggled to balance its ties with the U.S. and Iran, both allies of the Iraqi government but regional archenemies.

""We thank the government for its position to expel the international coalition forces,"" Qais Khazali, founder of Asaib Ahl al-Haq -- an Iran-backed Iraqi Shia militia that has conducted attacks against U.S. forces in Iraq -- said last week.

The agreement marks the third time in the last two decades that the U.S. has announced a formal transition of the military's role there.

The U.S. invaded Iraq in March 2003 in what it called a massive ""shock and awe"" bombing campaign that lit up the skies, laid waste to large sections of the country and paved the way for American ground troops to converge on Baghdad. The invasion was based on what turned out to be faulty claims that Saddam Hussein had secretly stashed weapons of mass destruction. Such weapons never materialized.

The U.S. presence grew to more than 170,000 troops at the peak of counterinsurgency operations in 2007. The Obama administration negotiated the drawdown of forces, and in December 2011, the final combat troops departed, leaving only a small number of military personnel behind to staff an office of security assistance and a detachment of Marines to guard the embassy compound.

In 2014, the rise of the Islamic State group and its rapid capture of a wide swath across Iraq and Syria brought U.S. and partner nation forces back at the invitation of the Iraqi government to help rebuild and retrain police and military units that had fallen apart and fled.

After ISIS lost its hold on the territory it once claimed, coalition military operations ended in 2021. An enduring U.S. presence of about 2,500 troops stayed in Iraq to maintain training and conduct partnered counter-ISIS operations with Iraq's military.

In the years since, the U.S. has maintained that presence to pressure Iranian-backed militias active in Iraq and Syria. The presence of American forces in Iraq also makes it more difficult for Iran to move weapons across Iraq and Syria into Lebanon, for use by its proxies, including the Lebanese Hezbollah, against Israel."
"Israel's Netanyahu, at UN, says he came to refute lies he heard there this week from other leaders",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-lebanon-united-nations-12e02fd82f35a8438aa907ca6762bac0,2024-09-27T14:11:40Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his leadership strained by conflicts on two fronts, took the U.N. General Assembly podium on Friday and said he was there to refute the untruths he had heard from other leaders on the same rostrum earlier in the week.

Netanyahu, armed with visual aids as he has been in the past, defended his nation's response to the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas on Israel that triggered an Israeli military operation that has devastated the Gaza Strip.

""I didn't intend to come here this year. My country is at war fighting for its life,"" Netanyahu said. ""But after I heard the lies and slanders leveled at my country by many of the speakers at this podium, I decided to come here and set the record straight.""

He insisted that Israel wanted peace but said of Iran: ""If you strike us, we will strike you."" He once again blamed Iran for being behind many of the problems in the region.

Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed more than 41,500 Palestinians and wounded more than 96,000 others, according to the latest figures released Thursday by the Health Ministry. The ministry, part of Gaza's Hamas government, doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants, but more than half the dead have been women and children, including about 1,300 children under the age of 2.

In recent days, Israel has turned its attention to the border with Lebanon, where it is targeting Hezbollah militants and has inflicted civilian casualties as well. Hezbollah began attacking Israel almost immediately after the Hamas invasion, and ongoing fighting between Israel and the Lebanese militant group have driven tens of thousands of people from their homes on both sides of the border. Israel is vowing to step up its attacks on Hezbollah until its citizens can return safely to their homes.

Late Wednesday, the United States, France and other allies jointly called for an ""immediate"" 21-day cease-fire to allow for negotiations as fears grow that the violent escalation in recent days -- following 11 months of cross-border exchange of fire -- could grow into an all-out war.

The United Nations says over 90,000 people have been displaced by five days of Israeli strikes on Lebanon, bringing the total to 200,000 people who have been displaced in Lebanon since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Hamas after it stormed into Israel, sparking the Israel-Hamas war.

Israel has maintained its military operations are justified and are necessary to defend itself.

As Netanyahu took the stage, there was enough ruckus in the audience that the presiding diplomat had to shout, ""Order, please.""

The two speakers who preceded Netanyahu on Friday each made a point of calling out Israel for its actions. ""Mr. Netanyahu, stop this war now,"" Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob said as he closed his remarks, pounding the podium. And Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, speaking just before the Israeli leader, declared of Gaza: ""This is not just a conflict. This is systematic slaughter of innocent people of Palestine."" He thumped the rostrum to audible applause."
"Israel-Hamas war latest: With nearly 700 killed in a week, Lebanon fears Gaza-level violence",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-27-september-2024-4dc3676b10be0fe7b41ab6d9cd897014,2024-09-27T07:40:09Z,"Nearly 700 people have been killed in Lebanon this week, according to Lebanon's health ministry. Israel has dramatically escalated strikes, saying it is targeting Hezbollah's military capacities and senior Hezbollah commanders.

Top Israeli officials have threatened to repeat the destruction of Gaza in Lebanon if the Hezbollah fire continues, raising fears that Israel's actions in Gaza since Oct. 7 would be repeated in Lebanon.

The International Organization for Migration estimated Thursday that more than 200,000 people have been displaced in Lebanon since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Hamas after it stormed into Israel, sparking the Israel-Hamas war. Lebanon says a total of 1,540 people have been killed within its borders in that time.

The United States, France and other allies jointly called for a 21-day cease-fire. Lebanon's foreign minister said the country welcomed the cease-fire efforts, and decried Israel's ""systematic destruction of Lebanese border villages.""

Israeli military vehicles were seen transporting tanks and armored vehicles toward the country's northern border with Lebanon, and commanders have issued a call-up of reservists. Netanyahu says Israel is striking Hezbollah ""with full force"" and won't stop until its goals are achieved.

Here's the latest:

JERUSALEM -- Incoming fire from Lebanon into Israel continued Friday, with one man suffering wounds from shrapnel.

The Israeli military said four drones came across the border Friday, all of which were intercepted. Earlier Friday, the Israeli miltiary said another 10 projectiles came into Israel from Lebanon, with some intercepted and others falling into open fields.

DAMASCUS -- An overnight Israeli airstrike on a military site in the area of Kfar Yabous in Syria near the border with Lebanon killed five Syrian army soldiers and injured another, Syrian state news agency SANA reported Friday, citing an unnamed military official.

Israel's military did not immediately acknowledge the strike. Israel regularly targets military sites in Syria and facilities linked to Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah but rarely acknowledges them.

Those strikes have become more frequent as Hezbollah has exchanged fire with Israeli forces for the past 11 months against the backdrop of Israel's war against Hamas -- a Hezbollah ally -- in Gaza.

Tens of thousands of Lebanese and Syrians have fled across the border from Lebanon into Syria since the beginning of the week amid intense Israeli bombardment that Israel says is targeting Hezbollah militants and weapons. The strikes have killed an estimated 700 people to date, including at least 150 women and children.

GENEVA -- A group of international trade unions on Friday filed a complaint against Israel at the U.N.'s labor organization in a bid to win compensatation for 200,000 Palestinians who have gone unpaid or seen their benefits withheld after the Oct. 7 attacks.

The nine unions say the workers from both Gaza and the West Bank had been employed in Israel before the deadly attacks by armed militants, but were barred from entering to go to their jobs afterward. As a result, the workers and their familites have faced millions of dollars' worth of lost income, financial insecurity and no access to remedies through the courts, they said.

""These workers have experienced widespread wage theft due to the suspension of work permits and the unilateral termination of their contracts,"" said a joint statement from the unions, whose members are active in industries as diverse as construction, education, journalism, agriculture, hospitality and transportation.

The filing at the International Labor Organization in Geneva, of which Israel is a member country, is based on language in its constitution that seeks to ensure that countries uphold international commitments they have already made.

Such economic woes that many Palestinians have faced come on top of the bloodshed, displacement and other troubles faced by Gaza and the West Bank as Israel continues its campaign against armed Palestinian militants.

BEIRUT -- Authorities in Lebanon say a family of nine was killed in an Israeli airstrike in a town near the border with Israel.

The state-run National News Agency reported the deaths in the strike early Friday in Shebaa. It put the strike at 3 a.m. local.

The report offered no other details and the Israeli military did not immediately acknowledge the strike.

MANILA, Philippines -- The Philippine government is bracing to evacuate thousands of Filipino workers in Lebanon in case the deadly conflict between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group further escalates, Philippine officials said Friday.

More than 11,000 Filipinos live and work in Lebanon, often as house cleaners. Philippine officials have not yet ordered a mandatory evacuation of its citizens because it was not yet clear whether a full-scale war would erupt, including an Israeli ground attack.

Many Filipinos were adamant not to leave their jobs in Lebanon and return to uncertainties at home, but they have been told to be ready to evacuate any time, Foreign Undersecretary Eduardo De Vega told a news briefing in Manila.

They say ""it's better for them to die in war than to die of hunger,"" De Vega said. But he added without elaborating that the Philippine government prepared a contingency plan for a massive evacuation if widespread ground fighting erupts across Lebanon.

Philippine Ambassador to Lebanon Raymond Balatbat told reporters in Manila via video on Friday that many Filipinos there ""will only decide to leave when the situation is so bad, when the war is at their doorsteps."""
Lebanon fears Gaza-like carnage as Israel ramps up airstrikes across the country,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-gaza-hezbollah-hamas-war-fears-ca37a9b6314d327f8719a4f513e81233,2024-09-27T04:36:57Z,"When she first heard about the evacuation warnings Israel was sending to residents of Lebanon, Aline Naser's thoughts immediately turned to Gaza.

For the past year, the 26-year-old Beirut resident has been following with horror the reports about besieged Palestinians in the Gaza Strip ordered to move from one place to the other, fleeing to ""humanitarian zones"" only to be bombed and ordered to leave again.

The Israeli calls for Lebanese citizens to evacuate ahead of a widening air campaign, delivered via mobile phone alerts, calls and leaflets this week, seemed chillingly familiar.

""It's definitely something on the back of my mind, and we don't really know where exactly is safe,"" she said.

Almost a year after the start of its war in Gaza, Israel has turned its focus on Lebanon, significantly ratcheting up its campaign against its archenemy Hezbollah. Among many in Lebanon, there is fear that Israel's military operations in Lebanon would follow the same Gaza playbook: Evacuation orders, mass displacement and overwhelming airstrikes. Israel says its strikes target Hezbollah weapons sites and militants.

There are key differences between Gaza and Lebanon and how Israel has so far conducted its operations, which it says aim to push back Hezbollah from the border so that tens of thousands of Israelis displaced by Hezbollah's rocket attacks can return to their homes. Although it has said it is preparing for a possible ground operation, Israel has so far not sent troops into Lebanon.

Still, there are fears that Israel's actions in Gaza, including the use of overwhelming and what rights groups and the United Nations have described as disproportionate force, would be repeated in Lebanon. Top Israeli officials have threatened to repeat the destruction of Gaza in Lebanon if the Hezbollah fire continues.

On Monday, Israel struck 1,600 targets across Lebanon, killing 492 people and wounding 1,645, and causing a massive wave of displacement as thousands fled from south Lebanon north. It was a staggering one-day toll that shocked a nation used to war. It was by far the deadliest barrage since the monthlong 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, when an estimated 1,000 people in Lebanon were killed.

Throughout the day, the Israeli military sent warnings to residents to immediately evacuate in anticipation of the strikes and to stay away from places where Hezbollah stores weapons -- something most would have no way of knowing.

""Please get out of harm's way now,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a recorded message. ""Once our operation is finished, you can come back safely to your homes.""

Israel's evacuation orders have been a central part of its military campaign in Gaza for the past year. In the first week after launching war, Israel ordered 1.1 million civilians in the Gaza Strip to relocate from the north to the south, sowing confusion and fear in the overcrowded enclave.

Since then, the Israeli military has issued dozens of evacuation orders calling on Palestinians to evacuate to Israeli-designated ""humanitarian zones."" Israeli officials say they are targeting Hamas militants who have embedded themselves among the population. Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to health officials in Gaza. The Health Ministry, part of the territory's Hamas government, does not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but says that just over half the dead have been women and children.""

With Gaza's borders sealed, residents of the crammed territory are trapped with nowhere to go, whereas in Lebanon, those fleeing Israeli strikes have been able to move to safer areas. Thousands have fled to neighboring Syria, while others have left through the country's airport.

Hezbollah started firing rockets on Israel in support of Gaza on Oct. 8, a day after Hamas militants launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and abducting another 250. Since then, the two sides have been engaged in cross border strikes that have gradually escalated and displaced tens of thousands of civilians on both sides of the border.

Many Lebanese have been following the growing hostilities with a mixture of nonchalance and dread, hoping they would remain contained. Lebanon has been in the throes of an economic meltdown since 2019 and can ill afford another devastating war with Israel.

Hostilities escalated dramatically last week when thousands of explosives hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah detonated, killing dozens of people and leaving thousands, including many civilians, with severe injuries to the eyes, face and limbs. Israel is widely believed to be behind the attack. Israel has also killed several top Hezbollah commanders in Beirut.

Meanwhile, intensifying Hezbollah barrages have wounded several people in Israel.

As the region appeared to be teetering toward another all-out war, Jana Bsat, 25, who works for a media analysis company in Beirut, said she now has a bag packed, ready for immediate evacuation. She feels it's only a matter of time.

""It feels surreal, to be honest. We heard about what was happening in Gaza and now we're experiencing it for ourselves,"" she said.

""I am in disgust of all this fear-mongering and psychological torture,"" she said, adding: ""But then you remember, it's all part of a warfare strategy and it's not going to stop anytime soon.""

While Israel's actions in Lebanon may have echoes of Gaza, the conflicts are different. In Gaza, Israel's goal is the complete destruction of Hamas, whereas Israel's stated goal in Lebanon is to push Hezbollah away from its border. Whereas Hamas rules Gaza, Hezbollah is a powerful militia with enormous influence inside Lebanon, and has representatives in the country's parliament and government.

In 2006, Israel flattened entire Beirut neighborhoods and bombed Lebanon's only international airport as well as key infrastructure, including bridges and power stations. By contrast, its current campaign seems to be, for the large part, targeting Hezbollah, although many civilians have also been killed.

Unlike Gaza, Lebanon is also a mixed tapestry of political and religious groups, including Christian and Sunni-majority areas where there is significant opposition to the Iran-backed Shiite Hezbollah.

Ali Safa, a 30-year-old interior designer who fled to Beirut from south Lebanon with his family this week, said he isn't worried about the Gaza scenario being repeated in Lebanon.

""Gaza is an open prison, it is besieged. Lebanon is much larger, it is not encircled. And it has Hezbollah, which is a much bigger force, much better-equipped than Hamas,"" he said.

U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, speaking at the United Nations Wednesday, said the world ""cannot afford Lebanon to become another Gaza.""

Whether the current hostilities will expand into an all-out war or whether Israel will launch a ground invasion remains to be seen. Israel's army chief said Wednesday that preparations were underway for a possible ground operation.

Many in Lebanon say they are haunted by the nonstop churn of horrifying images from Gaza over the past year, fearing the same scenario in Lebanon.

For several months, low-flying Israeli fighter jets have launched sonic booms over Lebanon, rattling windows and terrifying residents. More recently, the buzzing sound of Israeli military drones in Lebanese skies have added to the anxiety.

Some have gotten used to it. At a funeral for a Hezbollah commander recently where a few hundred people gathered, hardly anyone flinched when low-flying Israeli planes caused a thundering boom that shook the ground.

Bsat said at some point she, too, got used to hearing sonic booms that made the windows in her house shake.

""The drones I also got used to and now, unfortunately, the bombing,"" she said via Whatsapp.

""I've come to terms with reality, but my hands still can't stop shaking as I'm writing this,"" she said."
Jews and Catholics warn against Trump's latest loyalty test for religious voters,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-jewish-catholic-voters-religious-americans-c6b2c15a6019583b8afae4d496480469,2024-09-27T04:08:16Z,"Former President Donald Trump recently reissued his loyalty test to religious Americans, declaring that he can best protect their freedoms while preemptively blaming members of certain faiths should he lose the presidential election in November.

Jews and Catholics can vote for him and ace the test, but those who don't, he says, ""need their head examined."" If he loses, Trump added, ""Jewish people would have a lot to do with the loss.""

Among the Jewish leaders appalled at Trump's remarks was Rabbi Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism -- an umbrella group for more than 800 Reform synagogues in North America.

""Your words preemptively blaming Jews for your potential election loss is of a piece with millennia of antisemitic lies about Jewish power,"" Jacobs said in a social media post. ""It puts a target on American Jews. And it makes you an ally not to our vulnerable community but to those who wish us harm. Stop.""

Trump's speeches for years have hewed to divisive ""us"" versus ""them"" messaging, but tying those themes to specific religious Americans who oppose him is out of line and even dangerous, according to rhetoric experts, religious leaders and academics.

""Non-Jews shouldn't express public opinions about what is or isn't good Judaism and non-Catholics shouldn't express public opinions about what is or isn't good Catholicism,"" said Steven Millies, a public theology professor at the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago.

""Not only is it bad form, but it's also an ignorant waste of oxygen.""

Asked to respond to criticism from Jewish leaders, Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt sent statements from herself and several of Trump's Jewish supporters. The statements didn't directly address the potential blaming of Jews for a Trump defeat; rather, they depicted Trump as a stronger supporter of Israel than President Joe Biden and Trump's Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.

""Jewish Americans and Jewish leaders around the world recognize that President Trump did more for them and the State of Israel than any President in history,"" Leavitt said via email. ""The bottom line is that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden cave to Far-Left extremists and terrorists while President Trump will protect Jewish Americans and put American citizens first.""

Trump's latest provocative comments came in a span of four days. His warnings about Jewish voters were in Sept. 19 speeches to Jewish donors and the Israeli-American Council in Washington. His remarks about Catholics came on Sept. 22 in a post on Truth Social.

Matthew Boedy, who studies religious rhetoric as a professor at the University of North Georgia, said Trump has adopted spiritual warfare rhetoric, which is commonplace in certain Christian circles.

""Those who gave him that rhetoric saw Satan or evil as the enemy. Now that enemy is anyone -- Jew, Christian, Muslim -- who stands in his way,"" Boedy said via email, calling it dangerous to democracy and religion.

""Trump always makes his religious followers -- especially Christians -- choose. They have to choose him over pluralism, over morality, over evangelism,"" said Boedy, a Protestant.

""If God is already on your side theologically, it's not a far leap to say he should be on your side politically. That isn't new to American politics,"" Boedy said. ""Trump is only making that divide advantageous to him. He's furthering that which was there, but he is also adding his own weight to it. Making it worse.""

David Gibson, director of the Center on Religion and Culture at Jesuit-run Fordham University, said that in past elections, ""for a non-Catholic like Trump to be setting himself up as the savior of Catholics, or Jews for that matter, would have been political insanity.""

""But it's Trump, and conservatives who would attack a Democrat for such language are cheering for the Republican nominee,"" Gibson added in an email. ""There are many reasons, the most obvious is that they like Trump more than they heed their own church.""

Gibson also suggested that Trump's tough stance on immigration, which includes calls for mass deportations, is at odds with Catholic teaching.

""Catholics listening to the increasingly Nativist rhetoric on immigration from Trump and even his running mate, JD Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, ought to have their hearts examined if they support that,"" Gibson said.

Professor Jennifer Mercieca, a historian of American political rhetoric at Texas A&M University, said typical politicians seek to connect to voters based on shared policy beliefs, not by demanding religious loyalty.

""But Trump isn't a typical politician, and he's very concerned about loyalty,"" she said. ""He divides the world up into 'us' versus 'them' and tries to use those divisions to gain power.""

""It's especially dangerous to attempt to divide people based upon religious identity,"" said Mercieca, author of ''Demagogue for President: The Rhetorical Genius of Donald Trump."" ""The kind of language Trump is using here is more like that used by an authoritarian personality cult leader.""

Trump's recent comment about blaming Jews if he loses came at an event that also featured Jewish megadonor Mariam Adelson, widow of the late casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. She introduced Trump as ""a true friend of the Jewish people.""

Among the pro-Trump statements provided to The Associated Press by Leavitt was one from Ellie Cohanim, who served during the Trump administration as deputy special envoy for combating antisemitism.

Trump ""is absolutely correct in challenging our assumptions about voting on auto-pilot and failing to comprehend that the Democrat Party, which has been hijacked by its far-left base, is no longer a home for the Jewish people,"" Cohanim's statement said.

Adelson and Cohanim represent the portion of U.S. Jews that strongly supports Trump. In 2020, he received about 30% of Jewish Americans' votes compared to 70% for Biden, according to AP VoteCast.

The criticism of Trump's recent remarks came from the center as well as the left of the national Jewish community.

The American Jewish Committee -- a prominent advocacy group that strives to broadly represent Jews in the U.S. and abroad -- issued a sharply critical statement. It took issue with Trump's suggestion that if 40% of the U.S. Jewish electorate voted for him, ""That means 60% are voting for the enemy.""

""Setting up anyone to say 'we lost because of the Jews' is outrageous and dangerous,"" the AJC said. ""Thousands of years of history have shown that scapegoating Jews can lead to antisemitic hate and violence.""

""Some Jews will vote for President Trump and some will vote for Vice President Harris,"" the AJC added. ""None of us, by supporting the candidate we choose, is voting for the enemy.'""

To the left of center, a harsh denunciation of Trump came from Lauren Maunus, political director of IfNotNow -- an organization of U.S. Jews that has accused the Israeli government of oppressive policies toward Palestinians and protested Israel's military offensive in Gaza.

""Trump doubled down on his longstanding pattern of scapegoating Jews,"" Maunus said. ""Make no mistake: This is a clear and flagrant instruction to his fanatical base of extremists to target Jews with retributive violence if he should lose.""

Some Jews found a positive twist to Trump's remarks, as Betsy Frank of Mattituck, New York, conveyed in a letter published Sept. 23 in The New York Times.

""As a proud Jewish woman who believes in Israel's right to defend itself but supports the United States and everything it stands for even more, I would not vote for Donald Trump for any office,"" she wrote. ""If he loses the election, I will gladly take the blame.""

New British leader vows his nation will reengage on global leadership,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/britain-starmer-global-leadership-conflicts-climate-peace-707e771c934adea4842f2308381ccc00,2024-09-27T02:21:48Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- New British Prime Minister Keir Starmer took the international stage at the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday for the first time with a message: His nation is returning to ""responsible global leadership.""

The Labor Party leader, who won a landslide election victory in July, told the annual gathering of world leaders that with him as prime minister, ""the UK will lead again tackling climate change at home and internationally, and restoring our commitment to international development.""

Working with other nations, Starmer said, Britain will also tackle conflicts from Gaza and the West Bank to Ukraine and Sudan where immediate cease-fires are urgently needed..

He said nations must also work together ""to make the world less dangerous.""

""We have to face some hard truths,"" the prime minister said. ""The institutions of peace are struggling, underfunded, under pressure and outpoliticized.""

He said the entire global system of arms control and combating the proliferation of weapons which has been constructed over decades ""has begun to fall away"" and needs global action.

""We will also change how the UK does things,"" Starmer said. ""Moving from the paternalism of the past towards partnership for the future -- listening a lot more, speaking a lot less.""

He said the UK will also be offering other countries ""game-changing British expertise,"" and will work together with nations ""in a spirit of equal respect.""

Starmer told assembled ministers and diplomats that ""a sense of fatalism has taken hold"" in an age people describe as polarized and full of impunity and instabilitly.

""Well, our task is to say: No. We won't accept this slide into greater and greater conflict, instability and injustice,"" he said. ""Instead, we will do all we can to change it.""

"What to know from the UN: Before Netanyahu speech, 2 leaders denounce Israeli actions to their peers",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-un-general-assembly-guide-00806307d1da30811030be156dec0cba,2024-09-27T00:55:27Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The topics of Israel's war with Hamas and fighting in Lebanon have dominated speeches at the U.N. General Assembly's meeting this week. On Thursday, one side finally got the podium -- including a moment of drama amid the ocean of words from the world's leaders.

The first words from MAHMOUD ABBAS, head of the Palestinian Authority, were a single sentence repeated three times: ""We will not leave. We will not leave. We will not leave."" Abbas used the rostrum of the U.N. General Assembly as he typically does -- to criticize Israel. But this was the first time he did so since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas on Israel that triggered an Israeli military operation that has devastated the Gaza Strip.

He accused Israel of destroying Gaza and making it unlivable. And he said that his government should govern post-war Gaza as part of an independent Palestinian state, a vision that Israel's hardline government rejects.

Israel has maintained its military operations are justified and are necessary to defend itself. DANNY DANON, Israel's U.N. ambassador, responded to Abbas' speech within minutes with a critical assessment. ""Abbas spoke for 26 minutes and did not say the word 'Hamas' once. Since the massacre of Oct. 7, Abbas has failed to condemn Hamas for their crimes against humanity,"" he said. ""Only when he stands on the U.N. platform does he talk about a peaceful solution,""

Speaking later Thursday, Lebanon's foreign minister called for an immediate cease-fire ""on all fronts."" ABDALLAH BOUHABIB called Israel's actions ""acts that are tantamount to war crimes"" and warned that continued violence at his nation's border will ""transform into a black hole that will engulf international and regional peace and security.""

Israeli Prime Minister BENJAMIN NETANYAHU is scheduled to address the General Assembly on Friday morning and arrived in New York on Thursday.

Here's your daily guide to what's going on at the United Nations this week:

The president of Haiti's transitional presidential council says he supports a U.N. peacekeeping mission to fight gang violence still overwhelming authorities. It's the first public support announced by a Haitian government official since the U.S. proposed a U.N. peacekeeping mission earlier this month as one way to secure more resources for a U.N.-backed mission led by Kenya that officials say lacks personnel and funding. EDGARD LEBLANC FILS said he's convinced that a change of status would guarantee the full success of the current mission.

Kenyan President WILLIAM RUTO said his country is committed to international peace citing participation in regional and U.N peacekeeping missions. Ruto said 382 Kenyan officers had been deployed to Haiti and said the support had advanced Haiti's security, He and thanked member states that have supported the mission, and said insufficient equipment and logistics had hindered further deployment by other nations.

TINY THINGS, OUTSIZED IMPACT: World leaders endorsed a call for action against the threat of antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial resistance is the term officials use for when bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi develop the ability to shrug off medicines that previously had controlled them. Eight years ago, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a declaration in which countries pledged to track cases and develop action plans. On Thursday, the U.N. held another high-level meeting and adopted another declaration. This one calls for, among other things, sustainable national funding for antimicrobial resistance work and for an independent international panel focused on evidence-based measures to fight the problem. It also set a goal of reducing superbug-associated deaths by 10% by 2030.

RESPECTING ELECTION RESULTS: The United States and Argentina are leading calls for countries around the world to step up pressure on Venezuelan President NICOLAS MADURO to respect the result of July's elections and cede power. Secretary of State ANTONY BLINKEN and Argentine Foreign Minister DIANA MONDINO co-hosted an event on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly to urge others to boost their efforts to isolate Maduro ahead of a Jan. 10 inauguration ceremony, at which he will be sworn in for another term despite losing the election to the opposition, according to most analysts and observers.

GRIDLOCK: The General Assembly always brings a suite of police barricades to streets around the U.N. But the headquarters and some other parts of midtown Manhattan were ensconced in a shifting set of blocked streets and sidewalks Thursday evening because of protests related to Netanyahu's arrival in New York ahead of his assembly speech.

A trio of leaders of international climate negotiations urged colleagues to step up efforts to fight global warming, but outside groups and endangered nations told those leaders to look in the mirror, take their own advice and stop pumping out fossil fuels. At the United Nations, the troika of the current and next two presidents of U.N. climate conferences told other leaders to make their required climate-fighting targets -- due next February -- much more ambitious. New national plans should be aligned with the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times, urged the trio of leaders from the United Arab Emirates, Azerbaijan and Brazil.

Longtime climate negotiation analysts ALDEN MEYER of the think tank E3G and BILL HARE, CEO of Climate Analytics, which tracks emissions pledges, said the negotiation chiefs from the UAE, Azerbaijan and Brazil were big on soaring rhetoric, but their own nations' actions fell far short.

""The line that divides the legal from the just is sometimes merely a crack, but other times it is a deep gap and even an abyss. That gap, that abyss, most often and most severely affects the small nations and states that are the first victims of the clash between force and justice, because it can be an insurmountable obstacle to realizing the right to progress.""

-- GORDANA SILJANOVSKA-DAVKOVA, president of the Republic of North Macedonia

""Doom and gloom are not the hallmark of leadership.""

-- DOMINIQUE HASLER, Liechtenstein's minister for foreign affairs, education and sport

""I can only note that women have been underrepresented this week at the General Debate.""

-- MARIA MALMER STENERGARD, Sweden's foreign minister

A strange moment in American politics paid a visit to the U.N. General Assembly, brought there by Fils, the president of Haiti's transitional council. In his speech, he referenced false claims that Haitians living in Springfield, Ohio, were eating cats and dogs -- and made clear his country's concerns about the repercussions.

""I would like to extend a brotherly greeting to all friends of Haiti that have shown solidarity towards the migrants from our country -- and in particular those living in Springfield, Ohio,"" he said. ""The passions that naturally arise during an election campaign should never serve as a pretext for xenophobia or racism in a country such as the United States, a country forged by immigrants from all countries, and which has become a model of democracy for the world.""

The debunked information found its international spotlight in the U.S. presidential debate earlier this month, in which former President DONALD TRUMP repeated the claims that have circulated on the internet and been amplified by his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD VANCE. During the debate with Vice President KAMALA HARRIS, Trump specifically mentioned Springfield, saying that immigrants were taking over the city. ""They're eating the dogs. They're eating the cats. They're eating the pets of the people that live there,"" he said.

Number of years since North Korea has engaged with the international community on its nuclear program, according to RAFAEL GROSSI, head of the U.N.'s nuclear agency: 16

""The authoritarian wind's blowing.""

-- Mondino, speaking of the refusal of Maduro to step down after analysts agree he lost the election.

Netanyahu, facing military operations in Gaza and Lebanon and criticism from many quarters, is scheduled to speak on Friday. Protests around his visit are expected as well.

What is the 2006 UN resolution that some hope could help to end the Israel-Hezbollah conflict?,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/unsc-resolution-1701-lebanon-israel-hezbollah-addf018ee9da719329e1726f7156d456,2024-09-26T19:51:37Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- In 2006, after a bruising monthlong war between Israel and Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah militant group, the United Nations Security Council unanimously voted for a resolution to end the conflict and pave the way for lasting security along the border.

But while there was relative calm for nearly two decades, Resolution 1701's terms were never fully enforced.

And now, after nearly a year of low-level clashes, Israel and Hezbollah appear on the verge of another all-out war. As Israeli jets pound deep inside Lebanon and Hezbollah fires rockets deeper into northern Israel, U.N. and diplomatic officials have again turned to the 2006 resolution in a bid to end the conflict.

Years of deeply divided politics and regionwide geopolitical hostilities have halted substantial progress on its implementation, yet Resolution 1701 is still considered the brightest prospect for long-term stability between Israel and Lebanon.

In 2000, Israel withdrew its forces from most of southern Lebanon along a U.N.-demarcated ""Blue Line"" that separated the two countries and the annexed Golan Heights. U.N. peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, increased their presence along the line of withdrawal.

Resolution 1701 was supposed to finish the incomplete work from 2000 and end the 2006 war; Israeli forces would fully withdraw while the Lebanese army and UNIFIL -- Hezbollah excluded -- would be the exclusive armed presence south of Lebanon's Litani River.

The Lebanese state was to have full sovereignty over its south.

Meanwhile, up to 15,000 U.N. peacekeepers would help to maintain calm, return displaced Lebanese and secure the area alongside the Lebanese military.

The goal was long-term security, with land borders eventually demarcated to resolve territorial disputes.

""It was made for a certain situation and context,"" Elias Hanna, a retired Lebanese army general, told The Associated Press. ""But as time goes on, the essence of the resolution begins to hollow.""

For years, Lebanon and Israel blamed each other for countless violations along the tense frontier. Israel says Hezbollah's elite Radwan Force and growing arsenal remain, and accuses the group of using a local environmental organization to spy on troops. Lebanon complains about military jets and naval ships entering Lebanese territory even when there is no active conflict.

""You had a role of the UNIFIL that slowly eroded like any other peacekeeping with time that has no clear mandate,"" said Joseph Bahout, the director of the Issam Fares Institute for Public Policy at the American University of Beirut. ""They don't have permission to inspect the area without coordinating with the Lebanese army.""

UNIFIL for years has urged Israel to withdraw from some territory north of the frontier, but to no avail.

Hezbollah's power has meanwhile grown, both in its arsenal and as a political influence in parliament.

The Iran-backed group was essential in keeping Syrian President Bashar Assad in power when armed opposition groups tried to topple him, and it supports Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Yemen. It has an estimated 150,000 rockets and missiles, including precision-guided missiles pointed at Israel, and has introduced drones into its arsenal.

Hanna says Hezbollah ""is something never seen before as a non-state actor"" with political and military influence.

Efforts led by the U.S. and France for a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah have underscored that they still view the resolution as key. For almost a year, Washington has promoted various versions of a deal that would gradually lead to its full implementation.

But the circumstances now are far more complicated than in 2006.

Israel says its aerial bombardments aim to push Hezbollah back and allow its northern residents to return home safely. Hezbollah says it will stop firing rockets only once there is a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, where Israel continues to battle Hezbollah's key ally Hamas. Negotiations for a ceasefire there are gridlocked.

""You're tying 1701 with a hundred things,"" Bahout said. ""A resolution is the reflection of a balance of power and political context.""

So while the Security Council resolution's goals are still relevant, new issues have emerged that have sidelined its implementation.

""Between the warring parties, you have to make each party feel that they achieved something,"" Hanna said. ""Otherwise, you won't come to the table unless you are defeated or annihilated."""
ICRC visits the crew of hijacked ship for the 2nd time since being detained in Yemen,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/yemen-galaxy-leader-ship-houthis-red-sea-6c2b64e281ca51df76cb2a974de86baa,2024-09-26T18:08:25Z,"CAIRO (AP) -- A team of the international Red Cross visited a 25-member crew on board of the Galaxy Leader vessel, which was hijacked last year by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels and is docked in the port city of Hodeidah -- a Houthi stronghold.

The International Committee of the Red Cross said the visit Wednesday was coordinated with local authorities, who reportedly provided access to the crew on the ship, said Jurg Montani, ICRC's head of Yemen Delegation. A first visit by ICRC took place in May.

""It is part of the ICRC's mandate and activities to visit all persons detained in relation to a conflict, to monitor conditions of detention and the treatment of detainees,"" Montani said. He added that the organization is trying to facilitate links between the detainees and their families or diplomatic representations of their respective home countries.

Houthi rebels hijacked the cargo ship in the Red Sea in November 2023 and held its 25 crew members hostage in response to Israel's war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip which had begun a month prior.

The crew members being held are from Bulgaria, the Philippines, Romania, Ukraine and Mexico, according to the ship's Japanese operator NYK Line.

When asked about the overall conditions of the crew members, Montani said that the ""ICRC does not share its findings and observations publicly, but reserves these for a bilateral, confidential dialogue with the concerned authorities.""

Nasser El-Dien Aamer, general director of Saba News Agency who accompanied the ICRC during their visit, told Houthi-controlled al-Masirah TV that the fate of the crew members depends on negotiations with Hamas given that it's an Israeli ship.

""If negotiations are successful, the authorities in Sanaa will immediately release them once an agreement is reached with Hamas,"" he said, adding that the crew members are in ""very good condition"", communicating with their families and receiving health care.

The Philippines government said in a statement last month that several of the 17 Filipino crew members were experiencing ""significant health issues,"" showing symptoms of malaria.

The government's Honorary Consul to Yemen Mohammad Saleh al-Jamal at the time called for authorities in Sanaa to release the Filipino crew members because of their ""declining health condition.""

However, officials in Sanaa said that releasing them depends on ""external decisions,"" but didn't provide further details, saying only that negotiations over their fate are plausible.

In July, the Israeli army said it struck a number of military targets in Hodeidah in response to ""hundreds of attacks"" against Israel launched for months. The Philippines government confirmed that none of the Filipino crew members were affected by the Israeli strike.

The Houthis have sporadically targeted ships in the region over time, but the attacks have increased since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas on Oct. 7.

The Houthis control Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, and much of the north and center of the country since the 2014 ruinous civil war pushed the internationally recognized government into exile."
Israeli offensive in Lebanon rekindles Democratic tension in Michigan,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-arab-muslim-michigan-election-trump-lebanon-israel-palestine-2eb34bd82c8665cae43c6a91196959c0,2024-09-26T17:30:00Z,"DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- The rapidly escalating war in the Middle East has heightened anger at Democrats from within Michigan's Arab American community, just over a month before a presidential election in which Vice President Kamala Harris is counting on support from within a key party constituency.

Well over 1,000 people attended a rally Wednesday organized overnight by some of the top leaders in Dearborn, Michigan, a hub of the nation's largest Arab community, to protest an Israeli offensive against Hezbollah in which 600 people have been killed so far.

Hundreds of green and red Lebanese flags filled Dearborn's night sky. Many speakers blamed Harris and President Joe Biden for U.S. arms shipments to Israel, which has launched a second major offensive while still fighting Hamas in Gaza in a conflict that's caused thousands of civilian casualties already.

""We cannot condone any president that uplifts any administration that bombs every school, decimating children to smithereens. That is the message we have and those are values we will take with us to November,"" Dearborn's Democratic Mayor Abdullah Hammoud told the crowd.

As the 34-year-old leader of a community central to the Democratic divide over the Israel-Hamas war, Hammoud has been courted by top Democratic leaders for months. He met with Harris in August.

""I am not here to endorse any single candidate, for no candidate has earned my vote,"" said Hammoud, who is the son of Lebanese immigrants, on Wednesday.

The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.

While discord between the Democratic Party and a community frustrated with the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war has persisted for months, party leaders believed they had made progress when Harris stepped in as the party's nominee.

That goodwill is gone, said Arab American News Publisher Osama Siblani, an organizer of Wednesday's event who has also met with top Democrats. He suggested Harris now finds herself in the same predicament that Biden faced before he stepped down.

""A couple of months ago you could have argued to the community that Harris is different. Now, people are not convinced that she is any different,"" said Siblani.

Former President Donald Trump is actively attempting to court these dissatisfied voters. Earlier this week, he received the endorsement of Democrat Amer Ghalib, the Muslim mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan.

On Tuesday, Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas met with Massad Boulos, Trump's youngest daughter's father-in-law, who is spearheading the former president's outreach to Arab and Muslim communities. The meeting was confirmed by Bishara Bahbah, chairman of Arab Americans for Trump, who attended but could not disclose its details.

Many Arab American leaders, including Hammoud and Siblani, have strongly opposed a Trump presidency, citing his so-called ""Muslim ban"" on immigrants from several majority-Muslim countries.

Israel in recent days has expanded its air campaign against Hezbollah, with strikes on Lebanon killing many women and children. It's the deadliest bombardment since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war.

Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel one day after the Oct. 7 attack in support of its Hamas allies, which killed approximately 1,200 people. Since then, Hezbollah and Israel have engaged in ongoing exchanges of fire. In response to the Oct. 7 attack, Israel's offensive in Gaza has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians.

Michigan has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the nation, with nearly a quarter of them being of Lebanese descent. In Wayne County, which includes the cities of Detroit and Dearborn, approximately 34% of the 139,751 individuals of Middle Eastern and North African descent identified in the 2020 Census are Lebanese.

The close ties to the overseas conflict fueled raw emotions at Wednesday's rally. One speaker, Ali Dabaja, a resident of nearby Dearborn Heights, shared his grief over the recent deaths of family members in Lebanon.

Hossam Hossein, a Lebanese American born in Dearborn, attended the rally with his family, marking his first since the war began. While Hossein has been sympathetic to the Palestinian cause for months, the recent days of bombing in southern Lebanon compelled him to participate.

""It's really simple. Biden just needs to pick up the phone and tell Israel that he's not going to give any more weapons, that he needs to stop,"" said Hossein, who stated that he plans to vote for neither Trump nor Harris in November.

A razor-thin presidential election could hinge on crucial demographics, including Michigan's Arab American population, a group that helped lead a protest-vote in the state's Democratic primary in February that led to over 100,000 people voting ""Uncommitted.""

Harris appeared to make strides in the community after becoming the party's presumptive nominee, even sitting with the Dearborn mayor during a visit to the state in August. She gained the support of Emgage Action, a prominent Muslim American voter mobilization group, on Wednesday.

However, community leaders expressed skepticism about Emgage Action's influence.

""Voting for Harris now feels like what voting for Trump was like back in 2016. You don't say you're voting for Harris because it's shameful,"" said Dearborn City Council member Mustapha Hammoud, who said he considered himself a Democrat until recently.

Hammoud, who has sat on the Dearborn City Council since 2022, was visiting his grandparents in Lebanon in 2006, the last time the conflict escalated to this level. He said the past few days have felt similar to that war, a sentiment shared throughout the crowd Wednesday.

""I was born on the 4th of July. I've been a very patriotic American my whole life. I was a Democrat for an extremely long time up until fairly recently, because I always believed in the values of the Democratic Party,"" said Hammoud. ""But I can't support this."""
What obstacles stand in the way of an Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire?,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-ceasefire-talks-challenges-71b59e0db03f0014ce06d4aa21bc2907,2024-09-26T17:02:11Z,"Israel and Hezbollah each have strong incentives to heed international calls for a cease-fire that could avert all-out war -- but that doesn't mean they will.

Hezbollah is reeling after a sophisticated attack on personal devices killed and wounded hundreds of its members. Israeli airstrikes have killed two top commanders in Beirut in less than a week, and warplanes have pounded what Israel says are Hezbollah sites across large parts of Lebanon, killing over 600 people.

So far, Israel clearly has the upper hand militarily, which could make it less willing to compromise. But it's unlikely to achieve its goal of halting Hezbollah rocket fire with air power alone, and a threatened ground invasion of Lebanon poses major risks.

After nearly a year of war, Israeli troops are still fighting Hamas in Gaza. And Hezbollah is a much more formidable force.

""Hezbollah has yet to employ 10% of its capabilities,"" military affairs correspondent Yossi Yehoshua wrote in Yediot Ahronot, Israel's largest daily newspaper. ""The euphoria that is evident among the decision-makers and some of the public should be placed back in the attic: the situation is still complex and flammable.""

The United States and its allies, including Gulf Arab countries, have tried to offer a way out, proposing an immediate 21-day cease-fire to ""provide space for diplomacy.""

But any deal would require both sides to back away from their core demands, and they may decide the price is too high.

Hezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into northern Israel after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in the south triggered the war in Gaza. Hezbollah and Hamas are both allies of Iran, and the Lebanese militant group says it is acting in solidarity with Palestinians.

Israel has responded with waves of airstrikes. Overall, the fighting has killed dozens of people in Israel, more than 1,000 in Lebanon and forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from communities on both sides of the border.

Hezbollah has said it will halt the attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza. But months of negotiations over Gaza led by the United States, Qatar and Egypt have repeatedly stalled, and Hamas might be less motivated to reach a deal if it thinks Hezbollah and Iran will join a wider war against Israel.

For Hezbollah, halting its rocket fire without securing any tangible gains for the Palestinians would be seen as a capitulation to Israeli pressure, with all of its recent casualties suffered in vain.

Any deal involving a cease-fire in Gaza would be a hard sell for Israel, which would view it as a reward for Hezbollah rocket attacks that have displaced tens of thousands of its citizens for nearly a year.

Israel's goals in Lebanon are far narrower than in Gaza, where Prime Minister Benjmain Netanyahu has vowed ""total victory"" over Hamas and the return of scores of hostages.

Israel wants the tens of thousands of people who were evacuated from northern communities nearly a year ago to return safely to their homes. And it wants to ensure that Hezbollah never carries out an Oct. 7-style attack.

A weekslong cease-fire -- which would give Hezbollah a chance to reset after major attacks on its chain of command and communications -- might not be enough.

Few Israelis are likely to return if they know it's only temporary, and even an agreement for a lasting cease-fire would face skepticism.

The U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah called for the militants to withdraw north of the Litani River, some 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the border, and for the area between to be patrolled by Lebanese forces and U.N. peacekeepers.

Israel says that provision was never implemented and is likely to demand additional guarantees in any new cease-fire. But Hezbollah is far stronger than Lebanon's regular armed forces and the U.N. detachment, neither of which would be able to impose any agreement by force.

Netanyahu leads the most religious and nationalist government in Israel's history. His far-right coalition partners have threatened to bring down his government if he makes too many concessions to Hamas, and they are also likely to oppose any deal with Hezbollah.

Bezalel Smotrich, Netanyahu's hardline finance minister, said Thursday that Israel's campaign in the north ""should only end in one scenario - crushing Hezbollah and denying its ability to harm residents of the north.""

Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right National Security Minister, said he would not support a temporary cease-fire and would leave the government if it becomes permanent.

Although opposition parties would likely support the cease-fire, the defection of his partners would eventually bring down Netanyahu's government and force early elections, potentially leaving him even more exposed to investigations into the security failures of Oct. 7 and corruption charges that predate the war. It could even mean the end of his long political career.

In Lebanon, Prime Minister Najib Mikati has welcomed the cease-fire proposal, but he has little power to impose an agreement on Hezbollah.

Iran, which helped establish Hezbollah in the 1980s and is the source of its advanced weapons, has more sway over the group, but it has yet to express a position on any cease-fire. It likely fears a wider war that could bring it into direct conflict with the United States, but can't stand by indefinitely while its most powerful proxy force is dismantled.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, a relative moderate elected over the summer, struck a more conciliatory tone toward the West than his predecessors when he addressed the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday.

But he had sharp words for Israel and said its heavy bombardment of Lebanon in recent days ""cannot go unanswered."""

Abbas has had little influence in Gaza since Hamas overthrew his forces and seized power of the territory in 2007. The U.S. has said a reformed Palestinian Authority should play a future role in Gaza, but Israel does not consider him a reliable partner and has ruled that out.

""Palestine is our homeland. It is the land of our fathers and our grandfathers. It will remain ours. And if anyone were to leave, it would be the occupying usurpers,"" he said.

Israel has maintained its military operations are justified and are necessary to defend itself. South Africa has filed a genocide case against Israel in the U.N.'s top court. Israel rejects the accusations."
At least 11 killed in Israeli strike that hit a school in northern Gaza,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-palestinians-26-september-2024-5c2098250e347a622b7b51664126125d,2024-09-26T15:20:20Z,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- An Israeli airstrike hit a school sheltering thousands of displaced Palestinians in northern Gaza on Thursday, killing at least 11 people and wounding 22, including women and children, the territory's Health Ministry said.

The Israeli military confirmed it struck the school in the Jabalia refugee camp, saying it was targeting Hamas militants inside who were planning attacks on Israeli troops. The claim couldn't be independently confirmed.

Footage from the al-Falouja School showed rescue workers rushing casualties out of the school compound amid widespread debris and crowds of people. One video showed men wrapping a mangled, severed torso in a plastic sheet and putting body parts into a cooler.

Gaza's Health Ministry didn't immediately provide a breakdown of how many of the casualties were women and children.

Israeli forces have repeatedly struck schools, saying Hamas fighters use them as ""command centers"" to plan attacks. The military says it uses precision weapons to avoid civilian casualties.

The strikes have brought heavy death tolls. Tens of thousands of Palestinians are living packed in schools across Gaza after fleeing their homes in the face of Israeli bombardment and offensives. More than 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.4 million people have been displaced in the nearly yearlong conflict, according to the United Nations.

Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed more than 41,500 Palestinians and wounded more than 96,000 others, according to the latest figures released Thursday by the Health Ministry. The ministry's count doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants, but more than half the dead have been women and children, including about 1,300 children under the age of 2.

Israel launched its campaign in Gaza, vowing to destroy Hamas after its Oct. 7 attack, during which militants killed around 1,200 people and took about 250 others hostage. It blames civilian deaths in Gaza on Hamas, because the group's fighters operate in residential areas and use civilian infrastructure."
Israel-Hamas war latest: Israeli airstrike kills 23 Syrian refugees in Lebanon,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-26-september-2024-5b9819b5d3bd7b1c3da9268affb82b31,2024-09-26T09:20:17Z,"Twenty-three Syrian refugees were killed in Lebanon after an Israeli airstrike destroyed a building housing workers, Lebanon's state-run news agency reported Thursday.

State-run National News Agency quoted the village's mayor Ali Kassas as saying that the bodies of 23 Syrian citizens were pulled out from under the rubble, adding that four other Syrians and four Lebanese were wounded in the same airstrike late Wednesday in the village of Younine.

Israel's military chief said Wednesday they were preparing for a possible ground operation in Lebanon as Hezbollah launched dozens of rockets into Israel.

Later Wednesday, the United States, France and other allies jointly called for an ""immediate"" 21-day cease-fire to allow for negotiations as fears grow that the violent escalation in recent days -- following 11 months of cross-border exchange of fire -- could grow into an all-out war.

The Lebanese health minister said Israeli strikes killed more than 72 people Wednesday. That raised the death toll since Monday to more than 630, with more than 2,000 people wounded, and thousands in southern Lebanon seeking refuge.

The United Nations says over 90,000 people have been displaced by five days of Israeli strikes on Lebanon, bringing the total to 200,000 people who have been displaced in Lebanon since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Hamas after it stormed into Israel, sparking the Israel-Hamas war.

Here's the latest:

BEIRUT -- An Israeli airstrike on a village in northeast Lebanon destroyed a building housing Syrian workers, killing 23 of them and wounding another eight people.

State-run National News Agency quoted the village's mayor Ali Kassas as saying that the bodies of 23 Syrian citizens were pulled out from under the rubble, adding that four other Syrians and four Lebanese were wounded in the same airstrike late Wednesday in the village of Younine, just north of the ancient city of Baalbek in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley that borders Syria.

The Lebanese Red Cross said it evacuated the bodies of nine people following the airstrike. Others were taken by Hezbollah's paramedic arm as well as the Lebanese Civil Defense, NNA said.

A country of about 6 million people, Lebanon hosts nearly 780,000 registered Syrian refugees and hundreds of thousands who are unregistered -- the world's highest refugee population per capita.

TEL AVIV, Israel -- The Israeli military says it struck 75 sites overnight across southern and eastern Lebanon, part of a punishing air campaign in response to Hezbollah rocket fire.

The military said Thursday it was targeting Hezbollah military infrastructure, including weapons storage facilities and rocket launchers. Around half a dozen Israelis have been wounded in the latest escalation.

Israel strikes have killed more than 630 people in Lebanon since Monday, about a quarter of them women and children. Hezbollah has fired hundreds of projectiles towards Israel over the past week, including a surface-to-surface missile toward Tel Aviv that was intercepted Wednesday.

The Israeli military said around 45 projectiles were fired from Lebanon on Thursday, all of them either intercepted or falling in open areas. There were no reports of casualties or damage.

Hezbollah began firing rockets into Israel after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack ignited the war in Gaza, hoping to pin down Israeli forces. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are close allies of Iran.

The fighting has driven tens of thousands of people from their homes on both sides of the border. Israel has vowed to do whatever is necessary to allow its citizens to return, and has moved thousands of troops to the northern border in preparation for what could be a ground campaign into southern Lebanon.

The United States, France and other allies jointly called for an ""immediate"" 21-day cease-fire in the conflict to ""provide space for diplomacy"" as fears grow that the violence could become an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah, which would further destabilize a region already shaken by the war in Gaza.

NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Britain says it's sending $6.7 million worth of humanitarian assistance, including medical supplies, hygiene kits and fuel to Lebanon to support the civilian population there as fighting forces thousands to flee their homes.

The United Kingdom said in a statement that the United Nations agency for children, UNICEF, will distribute the supplies, which will also help aid workers better deal with urgent health and nutrition needs.

The U.K. earlier announced that 700 troops, including Border Force and Foreign Office officials, would be deployed to a British military base in Cyprus to prepare for possible evacuations of British citizens from the region as fighting could potentially escalate.

An online portal and phone line have been reopened for British nationals in Lebanon to register their presence.

Cyprus is situated approximately 210 kilometers (130 miles) west of the Lebanese capital. The east Mediterranean island nation served as a waystation for the repatriation of approximately 60,000 foreign nationals who where evacuated from Lebanon during the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war.

Britain's Minister of State for Development, Women and Equalities, Anneliese Dodds, said the U.K. will continue to support Lebanese people as it urges British nationals to leave the country.

British navy ships RFA Mounts Bay and the HMS Duncan were already in the eastern Mediterranean on Thursday, while the Royal Air Force has aircraft and transport helicopters on standby to provide support if needed.

The United States, France and other allies called Wednesday for an ""immediate"" 21-day cease-fire to allow for negotiations in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that has killed more than 600 people in Lebanon in recent days.

The joint statement, negotiated on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, says the recent fighting is ""intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation.""

""We call for an immediate 21-day cease-fire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy,"" the statement reads. ""We call on all parties, including the Governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary cease-fire immediately.""

The signatories include the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar."
"What to know from the UN: Ukraine doesn't want the world to forget, and attention turns to Lebanon",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-un-general-assembly-guide-d7ce6a436259604f6ae20ff0424cef49,2024-09-26T00:12:47Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Sometimes the issues brought forward at the United Nations signature annual meeting may feel a bit familiar. Climate change is always in focus, especially in the past few years. There are regular disputes about who is on the security council. Pleas to stop wars and address hunger.

But this year, it's what's not getting as much attention that has Ukraine concerned.

The war in Ukraine was center stage the last two times that world leaders convened for the high-level meeting of the General Assembly. But this year, the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the escalating developments along the Israeli-Lebanese border have gotten much of the spotlight.

Ukraine president VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, at the podium, implored world leaders not to give in to calls for a ceasefire that doesn't guarantee Ukraine's sovereignty. ""When some propose alternatives, half-hearted settlement plans, so-called sets of principles, it not only ignores the interests and suffering of Ukrainians who are affected by the war the most, it not only ignores reality, but also gives Putin the political space to continue the war,"" Zelenskyy said.

Here's your daily guide to what's going on at the United Nations this week, day by day:

French President EMMANUEL MACRON told the U.N. General Assembly that ""Israel cannot, without consequence, just expand its operations to Lebanon."" He urged Israel to cease the escalation, and Hezbollah to cease missile launches to Israel.

Panama President JOSE RAUL MULINO drew attention to the humanitarian crisis playing out in his country. More than half a million migrants crossed the Darien jungle last year that joins Colombia and Panama. ""Panama today is the new border of the United States,"" Mulino said, noting that the migrants crossing his country are seeking a better life in the U.S. ""I ask you to see the magnitude of what is happening because we feel like we don't have the international support we are due.""

The chance of a ceasefire proposal to try to stop fighting between Israel and Lebanon took up a lot of oxygen behind the scenes on Wednesday. Rumors floated through the halls, and France called a last-minute session to discuss the conflict. At the session, French Foreign Minister JEAN-NOEL BARROT said later in a meeting of the Security Council that France was working with the U.S. on a proposal for a 21-day ceasefire.

In a special high-level summit to address the impacts of rising seas, small island nations pleaded for the survival and insisted on their sovereignty despite overflowing oceans. Sea level rise ""threatens the well-being of our peoples' cultures, food security and livelihoods,"" said Samoan Prime Minister FIAME NAOMI MATA'AFA, speaking for 39 small island nations. Marshall Islands President HILDA HEINE and others said even if their lands are submerged, their nations should still be recognized, asking the world not to ""rig the map and try to erase us with a pencil... sovereignty ultimately rests with our people, not in distant diplomatic centers."" U.S. Secretary of State ANTONY BLINKEN said the United States is committed to counter -- or at least adapt to -- rising sea levels that pose an existential threat to many coastal communities around the world. Blinken also said that the Biden administration would oppose any effort to limit or curtail the rights of any countries affected by it.

""Globalization has failed in its mission to bring prosperity to people.""

-- XIOMARA CASTRO, president of Honduras

""In this emerging global order, we must ensure the United Nations remains at the forefront of global governance. If multilateralism is to trump unilateralism, the UN's role, as the world's foremost multilateral organization, is pivotal. With the necessary resources and resolve, the UN can ensure a future of peace, sustainable development, and human dignity.""

-- MOHAMED IRFAAN ALI, president of Guyana

Island nation leaders warned about sea level rise in the most dire and personal terms. ""Our future is uncertain,"" Fiji President WILIAME KATONVIERE said. ""Will our children and their children have a place to call home?"" And Maldives President MOHAMED MUIZZU said: ""An emergency is upon us, threatening our way of life. Our fight to live on will survive.""

Leaders' speeches take a variety of forms and are delivered in a variety of languages -- some rendered on plain paper, others on elaborate letterhead. Taken collectively, they represent the words and ideas of an entire governed world -- and the politics and maneuverings that come with leading, or helping to lead, one of the nations of Earth. In photos, you can sometimes see the speech on the lectern, including one of Zelenskyy from Wednesday.

Number of speakers scheduled at a last-minute, evening Security Council session on conflict between Israel and Lebanon: 24

""Colleagues, I'm often asked which one issue keeps me up at night. What I always say is this: We can't afford to limit our attention to just one issue.""

-- U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD, speaking to the Security Council

""Annihilation may bring military success but not political or moral victory. If security systems take over every political decision you forfeit your option to negotiate.""

-- MIRJANA SPOLJARIC EGGER, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross

""Rising seas mean a rising tide of misery. Communities swamped, fresh water contaminated, crops ruined, infrastructure damaged, biodiversity destroyed, and economies decimated - with sectors such as fisheries, agriculture, and tourism pummeled. The poorest and most vulnerable are hardest hit.""

-- U.N. Secretary-General ANTONIO GUTERRES

""Do not divide the world. Be united nations. And that will bring us peace.""

The price of gold keeps climbing to unprecedented heights. Here's why,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/gold-prices-today-record-high-8c06632a309a3a84442360921d6e2a86,2024-09-25T17:15:58Z,"Gold hit another all time high this week. Recent gains for the precious metal are largely credited to ongoing economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions and strong demand from central banks around the world.

If trends continue, analysts have bullish outlooks on the price of gold for the months ahead. But the future is never promised. Here's what you need to know.

The New York spot price of gold closed Tuesday at just over $2,657 per Troy ounce -- the standard for measuring precious metals, which is equivalent to 31 grams -- the highest recorded to date, per FactSet. That would make a gold bar or brick weighing 400 Troy ounces worth more than $1.06 million today.

This week's record high means that the price of gold has climbed hundreds of dollars per Troy ounce over the last year. Tuesday's price is up nearly $145 from a month ago and more than $740 from this time in 2023.

The price of gold is up nearly 30% year to date, analysts note -- outpacing the benchmark S&P 500's roughly 20% gain since the start of 2024.

There are a few factors behind the recent gains.

Interest in buying gold often comes at times of uncertainty -- with potential concerns around inflation and the strength of the U.S. dollar, for example, causing some to look for alternative places to park their money. Gold also surged in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Among sources of uncertainty today are geopolitical tensions -- which escalated over recent days with Israel's deadly strikes in Lebanon. And the ongoing wars in Gaza and Ukraine have continued to fuel fears about the future worldwide.

In markets like the U.S., there's also particular concern about the health of the job market. Last week's larger-than-usual half-point cut by the Federal Reserve signals a new focus on slowing employment numbers, and more rate cuts are expected before the end of the year. And such action arrives in the midst of a tumultuous election year -- which could prove crucial to economic policy in the road ahead, too.

In the near future, people are considering ""any case of turbulence in the economy,"" FxPro senior market analyst Michel Saliby explained. ""This is why they're keeping a decent portion of gold in their portfolio as a 'safe haven.'""

Analysts also point to strong demand from central banks around the world. Joe Cavatoni, senior market strategist at the World Gold Council, noted last month that central bank demand was well-above the five year average -- reflecting ""heightened concern with inflation and economic stability.""

Recent stimulus measures in China aimed at boosting consumer spending are also expected to up retail investments, Saliby added, further boosting gold's performance.

Advocates of investing in gold call it a ""safe haven,"" arguing the commodity can serve to diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate possible risks down the road. Some also take comfort in buying something tangible that has the potential to increase in value over time.

Experts caution against putting all your eggs in one basket.

Both retail and institutional investors shouldn't be influenced by the ""FOMO effect,"" or fear of missing out, Saliby notes -- explaining that people should not risk all their money just because they are seeing others rake in gains. He advises investors to watch the market and always have a clear risk management strategy for their position.

If geopolitical tensions cool, Saliby expects the price of gold to correct slightly, perhaps falling around $50 to $80. But he remains bullish overall for the near future -- expecting gold's spot price to soon surpass the $2,700 mark previously predicted for 2025, and perhaps reach as high as $2,800 or $2,900 if trends continue.

Still, future gains are never promised and not everyone agrees gold is a good investment. Critics say gold isn't always the inflation hedge many say it is -- and that there are more efficient ways to protect against potential loss of capital, such as through derivative-based investments.

The Commodity Futures Trade Commission has also previously warned people to be wary of investing in gold. Precious metals can be highly volatile, the commission said, and prices rise as demand goes up -- meaning ""when economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who typically profit from precious metals are the sellers.""

If you do choose to invest in gold, the commission adds, it's important to educate yourself on safe trading practices and be cautious of potential scams and counterfeits on the market."
"UN chief criticizes divided Security Council for failure of leadership to end wars, calls for unity",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/un-leadership-peace-gaza-ukraine-sudan-biden-7802b51c48347b2004665a6a7725e1dd,2024-09-25T17:07:55Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations chief sharply criticized the powerful but deeply divided Security Council at a high-level meeting Wednesday for a failure of leadership to end wars in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and beyond.

""Peace demands action. And peace demands leadership,"" Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the 15-member council charged with ensuring international peace and security. ""Instead, we're seeing deepening geopolitical divisions and mistrust.""

He pointed to repeated violations of the U.N. Charter and international law, conflicts multiplying and becoming more deadly, and civilians paying the steepest price.

The council has been blocked from any action on Ukraine because Russia is a veto-wielding member and a party to the conflict - invading its neighbor in violation of the U.N. Charter which requires all members to ensure the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all other nations.

It has been stymied in taking tough action on the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza because of Israel's close ally, the United States, another veto-wielding member. And in Sudan, there are divisions among some members supporting the warring rival generals.

The secretary-general said peace is possible in Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan if council members unite and follow the U.N. Charter and international law.

""A divided council cannot,"" he said. ""It is imperative that council members spare no effort to work together to find common ground"" as it has done overseeing 11 peacekeeping operations on three continents and authorizing humanitarian aid to global hotspots.

Slovenia, which holds the Security Council presidency this month, chose the topic, ""Leadership for Peace"" for its signature event during the annual gathering of world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly - and invited leaders from the 15 council nations to attend.

The advance speakers list has five presidents and prime ministers, six foreign ministers, a deputy foreign minister, a vice foreign minister, the U.S. ambassador, who is also listed as a member of President Joe Biden's Cabinet, and a Russian representative.

At the same time as the council was meeting, Biden was appearing on ""The View,"" a popular daytime talk show, while Secretary of State Antony Blinken's schedule said he was scheduled to attend a meeting of the Group of 20 major economic powers soon after.

Mirjana Spoljaric Egger, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, which works in the world's crisis areas, called for a renewed respect for international humanitarian law. ""Wars can be fought and won while adhering to the letter and the spirit of the law,"" she told the council.

Spoljaric said the Red Cross today sees warring parties overlooking their international humanitarian law obligations ""to justify violations, destruction and impediments to humanitarian action."""
Ukraine urges world leaders not to seek 'an out' from Russia's war instead of true peace,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/un-general-assembly-ukraine-zelenskyy-6ce7f77db02cc391b950d5e2c4781823,2024-09-25T14:59:58Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Ukraine's president urged global leaders Wednesday to stand with his country and not seek ""an out"" instead of a ""real, just peace"" more than two years into Russia's war.

At a time when he faces growing pressure from Western allies and some of his fellow Ukrainians to negotiate a cease-fire, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the U.N. General Assembly there's no alternative to the ""peace formula"" he presented two years ago. Among other things, it seeks the expulsion of all Russian forces from Ukraine and accountability for war crimes.

""Any parallel or alternative attempts to seek peace are, in fact, efforts to achieve an out instead of an end to the war,"" he said.

""Do not divide the world. Be united nations,"" he implored. ""And that will bring us peace.""

Russia hasn't yet had its turn to speak at the assembly's annual gathering of presidents, prime ministers, monarchs and other high officials. Low-level Russian diplomats occupied the country's seats in the huge assembly hall during Zelenskyy's speech. Russian President Vladimir Putin is not attending this year's high-level meetings at the General Assembly.

The war in Ukraine was center stage the last two times that world leaders convened for the U.N.'s signature annual meeting. But this year, the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and the escalating developments along the Israeli-Lebanese border have gotten much of the spotlight.

Ukraine and Russia, with one of the world's most potent armies, are locked in a grinding fight along a 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line.

The war began when Russia invaded in February 2022 and has killed tens of thousands of people. Russia has gained momentum in Ukraine's east; Ukraine, meanwhile, startled Russia by sending troops across the border in a daring incursion last month.

Zelenskyy argued Tuesday at the U.N. Security Council that Russia needs to "" be forced into peace,"" saying there's no point in pursuing peace talks with Putin.

In Moscow, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov responded Wednesday that the Ukrainian president's call for compulsion was ""a fatal mistake"" and ""a profound misconception, which, of course, will inevitably have consequences for the Kyiv regime.""

Zelenskyy is expected to present a victory plan this week to U.S. President President Joe Biden."
Attacks between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah raise fears of a wider Mideast war with Iran proxies,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-war-hamas-hezbollah-iran-proxies-c1bcc770721e39859ab7ffa9dbab6ea3,2024-09-25T14:08:09Z,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Cross-border attacks between Israel and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah have reignited concerns that the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip could break out into a regional conflict, nearly a year after it began.

That wider war could draw in Iran, and other regional militias that it has armed for decades could play a role in any attack.

Here's a look at Iran's history of arming militias, its allies in the region and what part they could play.

Iran's policy of arming militias took root in the aftermath of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Before it, the U.S. provided major weapon systems including F-14 Tomcat fighter jets to the government of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. After the revolution and the U.S. Embassy hostage crisis, those shipments and needed maintenance programs stopped. Iran's eight-year war with Iraq in the 1980s destroyed much of its arsenal. International sanctions on Iran, including over its nuclear program, also have kept it from receiving new arms while Israel and Gulf Arab states allied with the U.S. have received advanced weapons. While developing its own missile program, Iran can't match those sophisticated weapons. It relies on militias as an asymmetric threat to squeeze both Israel and the United States.

Iran's arming began in earnest in the 1980s with Shiite forces in Lebanon fighting against Israel. They became the Hezbollah militia. The arming expanded with the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein, a longtime foe of Tehran. Iran strongly backed Syrian President Bashar Assad in his country's long war. And Iran has continued when the opportunity has arisen, even arming Sunni militants while viewing itself as the world's defender of Shiite Muslims. Those relationships are managed by Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, one of the most powerful armed groups in the Middle East.

The militias in Iran's self-described ""Axis of Resistance"" include these:

In Iraq, Iran supported a slew of forces that mobilized in 2014 to battle the Islamic State group. Those state-sanctioned, mainly Shiite militias, known as the Popular Mobilization Forces, have grown into a powerful political faction, armed with rockets, drones and other weaponry. The International Institute for Strategic Studies puts their strength at some 180,000 fighters. Other smaller or little-known militant groups have emerged and claimed attacks against U.S. forces as well amid this Israel-Hamas war. Iran-backed armed groups attacked U.S. personnel in Iraq more than 60 times between October and Feb. 4, according to the Congressional Research Service. The deadliest came on Jan. 28, when the U.S. said a drone launched by Iranian-backed Iraqi militias hit a facility known as Tower 22 in Jordan on the Syrian border, killing three American troops and wounding dozens of others. In response, U.S. airstrikes hit more than 85 targets at seven locations, including command and control headquarters, intelligence centers, rockets and missiles, drone and ammunition storage sites and other facilities connected to the militias or the Guard's expeditionary Quds Force.

Hezbollah formed in 1982 amid Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon. Israel remains highly wary of Hezbollah, particularly over the vast missile arsenal it is believed to possess and its battle-hardened forces who also supported Assad in Syria. While Israel has sophisticated missile defenses including its Iron Dome system, a mass barrage of fire from Hezbollah and others at the same time could overwhelm the country. Estimates suggest Hezbollah has an arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles, including precision-guided missiles. The militia also has been blamed for suicide bombings in the past, including a 1983 bombing in Beirut that killed 241 American servicemen, though the group maintains it wasn't behind the attack. Hezbollah also has drones and surface-to-air missile systems. Hezbollah's forces number as many as 25,000 full-time fighters, with additional tens of thousands in reserves, according to an Israeli military assessment. Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah in 2021 said the group had 100,000 trained fighters.

Despite being Sunni, both the Palestinian militant group Hamas and Islamic Jihad have received weaponry and other materiel from Iran. The groups, however, have been struck hard by Israel since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that began the war, which saw militants kill 1,200 people and take 250 others hostage. Israel's war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip since has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count.

The Houthis have held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, since 2014 as part of that country's ruinous war. They follow the Shiite Zaydi faith, a branch of Shiite Islam that is almost exclusively found in Yemen. While broadly an insurgent force, the group with Iran's support is now able to launch drone and missile attacks that have drastically disrupted shipping in the Red Sea corridor and now even reach Israel. The U.S. Navy's efforts at stopping the shipping attacks have led to the most intense continuous combat its sailors have faced since World War II, but has yet to end the assaults. The amount of direct command Iran wields over the Houthis, however, remains a matter of debate among experts. The Houthis' attacks have raised their international profile while cracking down on dissent at home. The rebels claim they've recruited 200,000 additional fighters since launching their attacks. The rebels and their allies have a fighting force of some 20,000 fighters, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

For days now, Israel and Hezbollah have been launching strikes against each other. A wave of Israeli strikes on Monday and Tuesday killed at least 560 people in Lebanon and forced tens of thousands to flee. Israel now has called up some reservists and hasn't ruled out a ground offensive in Lebanon -- which could lead to bloody fighting. The Houthis, who have momentarily paused their attacks on shipping without explanation, also could join the fray. Iran so far has called for restraint, but could find itself drawn in. In April following an Israeli attack on the Iranian Embassy compound in Syria, Iran launched 170 bomb-carrying drones, more than 30 cruise missiles and more than 120 ballistic missiles toward Israel. Israel, the U.S. and other nations shot down many of the projectiles, some of which came from Yemen. But Iran could launch a similar attack, though questions remain over the accuracy of its ballistic missiles."
Top Muslim-voter organization endorses Harris as Middle East conflict escalates,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-emgage-muslims-endorsement-gaza-israel-trump-campaign-biden-ad30de2fc83a7fd4f65190c0f3d1a6da,2024-09-25T13:07:45Z,"LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris has secured the endorsement of one of the nation's largest Muslim American voter mobilization groups, marking a significant boost to her campaign since many Muslim and Arab American organizations have opted to support third-party candidates or not endorse.

Emgage Action, the political arm of an 18-year-old Muslim American advocacy group, endorsed Harris' presidential campaign on Wednesday, saying in a statement provided first to The Associated Press that the group ""recognizes the responsibility to defeat"" Donald Trump in November.

The group, based in Washington D.C., operates in eight states, with a significant presence in the key battlegrounds of Michigan and Pennsylvania. The organization will now focus its ongoing voter-outreach efforts on supporting Harris, in addition to down-ballot candidates.

""This endorsement is not agreement with Vice President Harris on all issues, but rather, an honest guidance to our voters regarding the difficult choice they confront at the ballot box,"" said Wa'el Alzayat, CEO of Emgage Action, in a statement. ""While we do not agree with all of Harris' policies, particularly on the war on Gaza, we are approaching this election with both pragmatism and conviction.""

The endorsement follows months of tension between Arab American and Muslim groups and Democratic leaders over the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war. Many of these groups, including leaders of the ""Uncommitted"" movement focused on protesting the war, have chosen not to endorse any candidate in the presidential race.

The conflict in the Middle East has escalated since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, which killed approximately 1,200 people. Israel's offensive in response has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

Israel in recent days also has expanded its air campaign against Hezbollah, with strikes on Lebanon killing at least 560 people, including many women and children, making it the deadliest bombardment since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war.

In an interview ahead of Emgage Action's formal announcement, Alzayat described the decision to back Harris as ""excruciatingly difficult,"" noting months of internal discussions and extensive meetings and outreach with Harris' policy team and campaign.

Ultimately, the group found alignment with many of Harris's domestic policies and is ""hopeful"" about her approach to the Middle East conflict if elected, Alzayat said.

""We owe it to our community, despite this pain, despite the emotions, that we are one organization that is looking at things in a sober, clear-eyed manner and just giving our voting guidance,"" Alzayat said.

In Wednesday's statement, Emgage Action endorsed Harris to prevent ""a return to Islamophobic and other harmful policies under a Trump administration.""

Many in the Muslim community cite Trump's so-called ""Muslim ban,"" which is how many Trump opponents refer to his ban on immigrants from several majority-Muslim countries, as a key reason for opposing his return to the White House.

Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Harris' campaign manager, noted in a statement that the endorsement comes ""at a time when there is great pain and loss in the Muslim and Arab American communities.""

Harris will continue working ""to bring the war in Gaza to an end such that Israel is secure, all the hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can exercise their right to freedom, dignity, security, and self-determination,"" she said."
"Netanyahu will address the UN as Israel, bogged down by one war, barrels toward another",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/netanyahu-speech-gaza-hezbollah-un-e761de05e4c4a7f54bfd27e8795bceb7,2024-09-25T08:57:49Z,"JERUSALEM (AP) -- From the dais of the U.N. General Assembly just a year ago, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu triumphantly hailed a new peace he said would sweep through the Middle East. A year later, as he travels back to that same world stage, that vision is in tatters.

The devastating war in Gaza is about to hit the one-year mark. Israel is on the cusp of a wider regional war with the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah. And the country finds itself increasingly isolated internationally and led by a polarizing leader whose handling of the conflict has sparked protests both in global capitals and on the streets of his own country.

And it's not just the mushrooming regional conflicts weighing Israel down. Netanyahu will head to New York burdened also by what could be an imminent warrant for his arrest by the International Criminal Court, what would put him in a fellowship of sorts with Russian President Vladimir Putin and former Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir.

""He arrives almost at a point of being persona non grata,"" said Alon Liel, a former director-general of Israel's Foreign Ministry and outspoken critic of Netanyahu.

Netanyahu is set to address the General Assembly on Friday. A gifted orator, he has long viewed speeches from such venerated perches as the optimal way to deliver a message and score political points with Israelis enthralled by his flawless English and fiery delivery. In July, he championed Israel's case for the war in Gaza in front of a joint session of the U.S. Congress, where he received multiple ovations and plaudits even from some critics back home.

""In his view, any such trips to New York, to the grand stage of world affairs, he considers an advantage,"" said Yossi Shain, a professor of international relations at Georgetown and Tel Aviv University. He said Netanyahu's speeches abroad were often meant to impress audiences at home, and this one was no different.

Netanyahu is known for his showmanship at the United Nations and has repeatedly used the pulpit to try make a case for his ideology and policies. At a speech in 2012, Netanyahu famously brandished a placard with a cartoon bomb to illustrate what he said was Iran's race toward a nuclear weapon. In 2009, he showed up with a copy of the plans for the Nazi death camp Auschwitz-Birkenau, using it to highlight what he said was the former Iranian leader's ""antisemitic rants.""

Last year, his focus was on what appeared to be a burgeoning normalization with Saudi Arabia that he said showed how a broader Middle East peace was not contingent on resolving the conflict with the Palestinians. He held up his prop, a map of the region, and used the word ""peace"" 42 times. The map appeared to show Gaza and the West Bank -- territories claimed by the Palestinians for a future state -- as being encompassed by Israel.

But Netanyahu arrives at the United Nations this week at a time when his own diplomatic capital and legitimacy, as well as that of the country he represents, are at a low. Critics say that aside from a moment in the spotlight, it's not clear what Netanyahu will achieve with the visit.

""He is a great believer in speechmaking,"" said Tal Schneider, an Israeli political commentator. ""He thinks that if he delivers a speech in English, he can convince people in the justness of his ways,"" she said, adding that that demonstrated he was ""disconnected from reality.""

Netanyahu's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Miki Zohar, a Cabinet minister who is close to Netanyahu, said the U.N. was a ""very important stage"" to lay out Israel's position and he hoped the speech would bolster international support.

At the U.N., Netanyahu will seek to persuade a world growing increasingly exasperated by Israel's war in Gaza that its aims are righteous. He may try to galvanize the world behind an Israeli war against Hezbollah. And he is likely to lay blame for the region's chaos on Iran, a repeated focus of his speeches at home and abroad. That he is making the trip at all, at a time of escalating violence with Hezbollah, points to how much significance he places on the speech.

But Netanyahu's words may fall on deaf ears.

The Israeli leader ""actually believes that his U.N. speeches have transformative effects on history. They do not,"" said Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli consul general in New York. Netanyahu's visit, Pinkas added, comes as Israel is now globally perceived as being ""on the precipice of a condemned pariah state"" with its leader seen as a ""rogue war-monger.""

Protests are expected during his visit. New York is home to Columbia University, site of some of the most intense campus demonstrations of recent years this spring -- by students objecting to the bloodshed in Gaza.

Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving leader, has been a divisive figure internationally for years, with his hard-line approach to the Palestinians in particular frustrating world leaders. But his handling of the war in Gaza has further stained his global perception.

The war was set off by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 250 people dragged as hostages into Gaza. Many Israelis blame Netanyahu and his policies for allowing Hamas to develop the military capacity for being able to burst through Israel's vaunted defenses and stage the attack.

The war has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to health officials in Gaza, and has often wiped out multiple members of the same family. It has displaced most of the tiny territory's 2.3 million population, in many cases several times, and set off a humanitarian crisis that has caused widespread hunger and lack of access to basic services. U.S.-led cease-fire efforts have stalled, and at home, Netanyahu has come under criticism for his failure to bring home the roughly 70 hostages still presumed to be alive and the bodies of some 30 others.

In the aftermath of Hamas' unprecedented attack, Israel initially had the backing of its allies to punish the militant group. But the fierceness of the retaliatory assault and the staggering toll it has taken on civilians have soured the international mood against Israel. Over time, the Biden administration has grown increasingly impatient and has slowed some weapons deliveries. Britain said earlier this month it was suspending some arms exports to Israel over the risk that their use could violate international law.

The request by the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court for an arrest warrant against Netanyahu will also loom large over the visit and could cast a leader who views himself as an international statesman as a global pariah instead. Liel guessed that very few heads of state will agree to meet him on the sidelines of the assembly and that the visit could turn out to be a bust for Netanyahu.

""There is no doubt that he knows how to deliver a speech,"" Liel said, adding: ""I think the world buys his chatter less and less."""
Hezbollah fires missile at Tel Aviv in further escalation after heavy Israeli strikes on Lebanon,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-news-09-25-2024-62cb173728d341c845bff9859addc7a5,2024-09-25T06:31:54Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Hezbollah launched a ballistic missile at Tel Aviv early Wednesday, in a further escalation after Israel carried out strikes on Lebanon that killed hundreds of people and the militants fired rockets across wider areas of northern Israel.

The Israeli military said it intercepted the surface-to-surface missile, which set off air raid sirens in Tel Aviv and across central Israel, and there were no reports of casualties or damage. The military said it struck the site in southern Lebanon from which the projectile was launched.

Hezbollah said it fired a Qader 1 ballistic missile targeting the headquarters of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, which it blames for a recent string of targeted killings of its top commanders and for an attack last week in which bombs hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies killed dozens of people and wounded thousands, including many Hezbollah members.

The Israeli military said it was the first time a projectile fired from Lebanon had reached central Israel. Hezbollah claimed to have targeted an intelligence base near Tel Aviv last month in an aerial attack, but there was no confirmation. The Palestinian Hamas militant group in Gaza repeatedly targeted Tel Aviv in the opening months of the war.

The launch ratcheted up tensions as the region appears to be teetering toward another all-out war, even as Israel continues to battle Hamas in the Gaza Strip. A wave of Israeli strikes on Monday and Tuesday killed at least 560 people in Lebanon and forced thousands to seek refuge.

Families have fled southern Lebanon, flocking to Beirut and the coastal city of Sidon, sleeping in schools turned into shelters, as well as in cars, parks and along the beach. Some sought to leave the country, causing a traffic jam at the border with Syria.

Israel said late Tuesday that fighter jets carried out ""extensive strikes"" on Hezbollah weapons and rocket launchers across southern Lebanon and in the Bekaa region to the north. The military has said it has no immediate plans for a ground invasion but has declined to give a timetable for the air campaign.

Tensions between Israel and the Lebanese militant group have steadily escalated over the last 11 months. Hezbollah has been firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and its ally Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group.

Israel has responded with increasingly heavy airstrikes and the targeted killing of Hezbollah commanders while threatening a wider operation.

The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on Lebanon for Wednesday at the request of France.

Nearly a year of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel had already displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border before this week's escalation. Israel has vowed to do whatever it takes to ensure its citizens can return to their homes in the north, while Hezbollah has said it will keep up its rocket attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, something which appears increasingly remote.

Israel has moved thousands of troops who had been serving in Gaza to the northern border. It says Hezbollah has some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including some capable of striking anywhere in Israel, and that the group has fired some 9,000 rockets and drones since last October.

Cross-border exchanges began ramping up on Sunday in the wake of the pager and walkie-talkie bombings, which killed 39 people and wounded nearly 3,000, many of them civilians. Lebanon blamed Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny responsibility.

On Sunday, Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel.

The next day, Israel said its warplanes struck 1,600 Hezbollah targets, destroying cruise missiles, long- and short-range rockets and attack drones, including weapons concealed in private homes. The strikes racked up the highest one-day death toll in Lebanon since Israel and Hezbollah fought a bruising monthlong war in 2006.

An Israeli airstrike in Beirut on Tuesday killed Ibrahim Kobeisi, who Israel described as a top Hezbollah commander with the group's rocket and missile unit. Military officials said Kobeisi was responsible for launches towards Israel and planned a 2000 attack in which three Israeli soldiers were kidnapped and killed. Hezbollah later confirmed his death.

It was the latest in a string of assassinations and other setbacks for Hezbollah, which is Lebanon's strongest political and military actor and is widely considered the top paramilitary force in the Arab world.

Lebanon's Health Ministry said six people were killed and 15 were wounded in the strike in a southern Beirut suburb, an area where Hezbollah has a strong presence. The country's National News Agency said the attack destroyed three floors of a six-story apartment building.

The U.N.'s High Commissioner for Refugees in Lebanon said one of its staffers and her young son were among those killed Monday in the Bekaa region, while a cleaner under contract was killed in a strike in the south.

Hezbollah fired 300 rockets on Tuesday, injuring six Israeli soldiers and civilians, most of them lightly, according to the Israeli military.

The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least 564 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since Monday, including 50 children and 94 women, and that more than 1,800 have been wounded, a staggering toll for a country still reeling from the deadly pager and walkie-talkie bombings last week."

It was the group's farthest strike yet in nearly a year of exchanges. Israel said it intercepted the projectile, and there were no reports of casualties or damage.

Hezbollah said it had fired a ballistic missile at the headquarters of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, which it said was responsible for the targeted killing of its senior leaders. Israel said it struck the site the missile was launched from in southern Lebanon.

Israel killed a top Hezbollah commander Tuesday as part of a two-day bombing campaign that left more than 560 people dead and prompted thousands in southern Lebanon to seek refuge from the widening conflict. Hezbollah has launched hundreds of projectiles towards Israel, causing some damage to buildings and homes and lightly injuring a number of people.

Israel and Hezbollah have been trading fire since the Israel-Hamas war began. Israel's military says it will do ""whatever is necessary"" to push Hezbollah away from Lebanon's border with Israel.

Meanwhile, 700 British troops were due to arrive Wednesday to the eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus as it prepared for the possible evacuation of its citizens from Lebanon.

Here's the latest:

JERUSALEM -- The Israeli military intercepted a missile launched from Lebanon into central Israel on Wednesday morning in the latest escalation of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah.

Israel Rescue Services said there were no injuries or damage reported from the missile, which triggered sirens in Tel Aviv and Netanya, two large cities in central Israel. It was Hezbollah's farthest strike yet in nearly a year of exchanges.

Hezbollah said it had fired a ballistic missile at the headquarters of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, which it said was responsible for the targeted killing of its senior leaders. Israel said it struck the site the missile was launched from in southern Lebanon.

LONDON -- Britain will send 700 troops to the eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus as it prepares for the possible evacuation of its citizens from Lebanon.

Cyprus is located across a strip of water from Lebanon, and Beirut harbor has been used before to evacuate foreign nationals by sea from Lebanon. During the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, tens of thousands of foreigners were evacuated by sea to Cyprus in a fleet of commercial and military vessels, many supplied by American, British, European and other naval forces.

The British troops and members of the Border Force were to arrive Wednesday, even as the government made repeated appeals for its nationals to immediately evacuate Lebanon. Britain retains sovereign military base areas in Cyprus, which are considered its territory.

""We continue to urge all sides to step back from conflict to prevent further tragic loss of life. Our government is ensuring all preparations are in place to support British Nationals should the situation deteriorate,"" said British Defense Secretary John Healey.

""The Royal Air Force also have aircraft and transport helicopters on standby to provide support if necessary,"" Healy said.

Israel's envoy to the U.N. says his country doesn't want to send troops into Lebanon but will do ""whatever necessary"" to halt the Hezbollah rocket fire that has driven tens of thousands of Israelis from their country's north."
Israel has landed heavy blows on Hezbollah. The victory it seeks could prove elusive,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-conflict-military-strategy-cce53839bbcf0a9a36af45ed2fa7dbb4,2024-09-25T04:09:22Z,"It has been a devastating week for Hezbollah and the people of Lebanon.

Bombs hidden in the group's pagers and walkie-talkies killed dozens of people and wounded thousands -- many of them Hezbollah members. An Israeli strike in Beirut killed one of its top commanders. And Israel has bombed what it said were 1,600 militant sites across large parts of Lebanon, killing hundreds of people and displacing thousands.

Israel says its objective is to secure the border so that tens of thousands of people who fled under Hezbollah fire nearly a year ago can return to their homes. But it's far from clear that its recent operations -- as tactically successful as they were -- will bring that about.

""No one either in or out of the defense establishment has any clue as to how to translate these brilliant operational achievements into political benefit, into a real victory that will stop the war in the north,"" columnist Nadav Eyal wrote in Israel's Yediot Ahronot newspaper.

""As long as Hezbollah retains any firepower, the northern border will not be able to return to normal.""

Hezbollah began firing into Israel the day after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza. Its stated aim was to pin down Israeli forces in the north to help its ally Hamas, which -- like Hezbollah -- is backed by Iran. The Lebanese militant group has said it would cease the attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which appears increasingly unlikely.

Hezbollah's response to the past week's escalation has seemed meager. The hundreds of rockets and drones it has fired into northern Israel -- including areas much farther from the border than it hit previously -- have caused few casualties and only scattered damage.

But experts say it can weather Israeli strikes and is likely holding its most potent weapons in reserve.

The footage on Monday of Israeli strikes sending up plumes of dust and smoke seemed grimly familiar.

The American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, the NATO campaign in Libya in 2011, and the U.S.-led war against the Islamic State group in 2014 all began with massive airstrikes lighting up the sky. In each case, the war dragged on for months or years, and ground forces played a crucial role.

Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza began with nearly three weeks of heavy airstrikes across the territory, followed by a full-scale ground invasion. Nearly a year later, Hamas is still putting up a fight and holding scores of hostages.

With Hezbollah, Israel has so far adopted narrower objectives -- not the disarmament or defeat of the Lebanese militant group, but a new arrangement in which militants retreat from the border and halt their attacks.

But even that may not be possible without a ground invasion.

There's also the risk of mission-creep, as America discovered after its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ground on for years after the toppling of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban. NATO airstrikes initially aimed at preventing a feared massacre in Benghazi morphed into a seven-month campaign of regime change from which Libya has yet to fully recover.

Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Gallant boasted that Monday's strikes alone had taken out tens of thousands of Hezbollah's rockets and missiles.

""This is the most difficult week for Hezbollah since its establishment,"" he added. ""A blow has been dealt to the chain of command, to the terrorists themselves on different levels, to their shooting capabilities and to their morale.""

Hezbollah has acknowledged suffering heavy blows, but even if Gallant's assessment is correct, it still has considerable resources.

""The rocket unit is still active, Hezbollah has absorbed the initial shock, and the battle has only begun,"" said Qassim Qassir, a former Hezbollah member who wrote a book about the group. ""Hezbollah has only used a small part of its capabilities.""

The militant group was established with the help of Iran following Israel's 1982 invasion and occupation of Lebanon, and it seeks Israel's destruction. It has survived countless battles with Israeli forces, replaced several slain commanders over the years and rearmed after a monthlong war in 2006.

Hezbollah claims to have some 100,000 fighters. Before the latest hostilities, it was believed to have some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including long-range projectiles capable of hitting anywhere inside Israel, and some precision-guided missiles.

Its more sophisticated weapons are likely being held in reserve as it seeks to avoid triggering an all-out war.

Sarit Zehavi, a former Israeli military intelligence analyst and founder of the Alma Research and Education Center, a think tank focused on the northern border, said Hezbollah has concealed its weapons in different parts of the country, including in areas close to Beirut where it has a strong presence.

""Hezbollah was building redundancy, so they spread their munitions and infrastructure all over, and that's why that many targets are being attacked, because it's everywhere,"" she said.

Hezbollah is far more advanced militarily than Hamas. Hezbollah also has a far larger area in which to operate, extensive supply lines linking it more directly to Iran, and networks of tunnels potentially even more extensive than those in Gaza.

In the event of a ground invasion, Hezbollah fighters could be joined by thousands of fighters from fellow Iran-backed groups from Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere in the region.

Israel says it has no immediate plans for a ground invasion but is prepared for one, and has sent thousands of battle-hardened forces from Gaza to the northern border. If the air campaign fails to bring Hezbollah to heel, Israeli leaders will be tempted to send them in.

Even if the goal is only to carve out a buffer zone to better secure the north, the risks are great.

Most Israelis are insulated from the air war by distance and Israel's missile defense systems, but a ground invasion would mean more casualties and protracted fighting for soldiers and reservists already weary from a year of war in Gaza.

Hezbollah waged an 18-year-long insurgency against Israel the last time it occupied Lebanon, eventually forcing it to withdraw, and another prolonged occupation could be similarly costly.

Israel has already faced international outrage over the war in Gaza, including ongoing investigations by top world courts, and risks even greater isolation if it launches a similar campaign in Lebanon.

Hezbollah also has few good options.

Halting its rocket fire on the north in the face of Israeli pressure would likely be seen by its supporters -- and its patron Iran -- as a humiliating capitulation and an abandonment of the Palestinians.

Escalating its attacks, either by launching more sophisticated rockets or targeting major cities like Tel Aviv, could bring an even more crushing Israeli response or an all-out war that devastates Lebanon -- with Hezbollah at risk of being blamed.

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah already faces criticism from many Lebanese who accuse him of tying their country's fate to Iran and inviting war at a time of financial ruin.

That leaves it stuck with the status quo, in which Israel carries out increasingly heavy strikes while Hezbollah makes do with a relatively restrained response.

For Hezbollah, and the Lebanese people, that might make the coming weeks even worse.

The Clintons pitch philanthropic commitments as pro-democracy work at their 2024 foundation meeting,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/bill-clinton-hillary-clinton-jose-andres-philanthropy-bea5c280d04cb8eece60a3099b6e6967,2024-09-25T01:33:46Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- With the backdrop of elections worldwide that highlight strains on democracy, former President Bill Clinton urged attendees of his foundation's annual meeting to meet their communities' needs through collective action.

Strong democratic institutions, Clinton argued, are necessary to achieve the social impact sought by the political, business, and philanthropic leaders convened this week by the Clinton Global Initiative in New York.

""Being here and making commitments to action can actually deliver real results to real people,"" he said Monday morning. ""It's the best way we can strengthen faith in those kinds of democratic institutions.""

It was a strong endorsement of philanthropy's ability to help address discontented voters' concerns at a time when surveys show higher levels of trust in the nonprofit sector than others. The Clinton Foundation underscored that outlook over the past two days through its theme of ""What's Working,"" unveiling 175 new commitments that seek to prove even the greatest challenges in these tumultuous times have solutions.

Throughout the conference, participants emphasized the need for collaborations when one sector alone cannot tackle a difficult problem.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture pledged more than $466 million to bolster food security in 16 other countries by providing school meals or implementing climate-conscious farming technology.

Partnerships are key, according to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, because much of the agency's food aid gets funneled through non-governmental organizations that ""are trusted in areas of the world where something coming from 'the U.S. government' may not be.""

""The reality is if you have people who are well fed, you're going to have less strife,"" Vilsack told The Associated Press. ""If you have less strife, it's going to be a less unstable world.""

Other commitments included the nonprofit Center for Mind Body Medicine's pledge to provide trauma healing services to 500,000 youth and adults throughout the Gaza Strip. Jill Biden unveiled a $500 million plan to advance women's health research. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the opening of a comprehensive women's center in Iraq led by Nobel Peace Prize recipient Nadia Murad to support survivors of sexual violence.

In between panels, attendees from over 80 countries mingled in lounges focused on issue areas like climate and health.

Wayuu Taya Foundation founder Patricia Velásquez credited past Clinton Global Initiative meetings for connecting her nonprofit with the partners necessary to scale up its provision food, water and medicine throughout indigenous parts of Venezuela.

Over 20 years of trust-building became all the more crucial in more turbulent recent years, she said. Runaway inflation, intensified repression and an exodus of millions have unfolded under Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

Velásquez told AP that philanthropic organizations like hers are best positioned to provide aid under those ""complicated"" circumstances because ""we don't take sides.""

""We can't put a color or political party on those who need,"" she said. ""If the political parties want to put colors on us, that's a whole other story. But our job is to help the people.""

The Clintons' deep network also allows the initiative to elevate new actors on the global stage.

Spotlighted was Welcome.US, a not-for-profit initiative connecting U.S. sponsors with refugees from countries including Ukraine, Afghanistan, Haiti and Cuba. After both parties clear background checks, U.S. citizens help refugees land on their feet through a lesser-utilized pathway to entry called humanitarian parole.

Since its founding in 2021, Welcome.US reports that the process has gone from welcoming roughly 11,000 refugees in one year to nearly 500,000.

""We can take some risks with things that government can't,"" Welcome.US President Anya McMurray told AP. ""Nonprofit philanthropy can make some big bets. There is more room to be innovative and creative because there is the ability to assume risk that, sometimes, government cannot do.""

To inspire their 2,000 attendees, organizers leaned on familiar faces like José Andrés. In less than 15 years, the celebrity chef has turned World Central Kitchen into a leading provider of food relief.

Yes, he said during a conversation with journalist Katie Couric and renowned conservationist Jane Goodall, the war in Gaza sometimes looks like ""a war against humanity itself."" But he added that ""the best of humanity shows up"" in the worst moments, citing the example of Israeli and Gazan chefs who he said have expressed interest in feeding the hungry on both sides of the border.

""These are the voices of humanity,"" he said to much applause. ""That's why we all need to be asking, always, for peace.""

The final panel featured Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the exiled Belarusian political activist whose husband has been imprisoned for over a year after he challenged his country's authoritarian president, and Yulia Navalnaya, who has similarly taken up the mantle left behind by her late husband Alexei Navalny after the Russian opposition leader died earlier this year in a state prison.

Dictators, Tsikhanouskaya said, try to make you believe they hold ""simple solutions to difficult situations."" The prevalence of dictatorship in any one country is a threat to democracy all over, she added.

""Every person has to understand this moral obligation of each of you to contribute somehow in strengthening democracy,"" she tasked the audience.

"What to know from the UN: Biden stops by, Gaza takes the spotlight, a dour world outlook prevails",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-un-general-assembly-guide-42898c4116a280b228f5307f114962a9,2024-09-24T23:39:16Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The world's leaders gathered in New York for the beginning of their annual meeting at the U.N. General Assembly. Let's just say the vibe was pretty grim.

Leader after leader spoke of the wars in Ukraine, Gaza, and Sudan, climate problems, exclusion from U.N. decision making, poor nations struggling to feed their populations. ""I cannot recall a time of greater peril than this,"" said KING ABDULLAH II of Jordan.

A few speakers, including U.S. President JOE BIDEN, tried to push a message of hope for the future. ""We are stronger than we think. We are stronger together than alone,"" Biden said. ""And what the people call impossible is just an illusion.""

But the U.S. was the target of much veiled criticism for acting unilaterally on the response to the Gaza war: ""Impunity"" was the word of the day.

Here's your daily guide to what's going on at the United Nations this week, day by day:

WAR IN GAZA: Many delegates focused their speeches on the war in Gaza. Jordan's Abdullah said Israel's campaigns are undermining a key part of the international system protecting human rights. He listed as examples: the bombing of U.N. shelters and schools; inability for U.N. workers to assist; and humanitarian workers being subsumed by the conflict. As for the idea of Palestinians finding new homes in Jordan, he said, forced displacement is a war crime and ""that will never happen.""

Turkish President RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN called the U.N. a ""dysfunctional, unwieldy and inert structure,"" and told delegates that ""international peace and security are too important to be left to the arbitrariness of the privileged five"" permanent members of the Security Council. He called for the Security Council to impose sanctions on Israel and said the general assembly should recommend the use of force to achieve an immediate cease-fire in Gaza, the exchange of prisoners, and the unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid.

Brazilian President LUIZ INÁCIO LULA DASILVA said: ""The right to self defense became a right for vengeance, which prevents a deal for the release of hostages and delays a ceasefire.""

Biden repeated his calls for a cease-fire and the return of hostages: ""Full-scale war is not in anyone's interest.""

IRAN: In his first speech at the U.N. General Assembly's annual gathering of world leaders, President MASOUD PEZESHKIAN struck a somewhat more measured tone than his predecessors often have in recent years. ""I aim to lay a strong foundation for my country's entry into a new era, positioning it to play an effective and constructive role in the evolving global order,"" said Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon who ran as a reformer. He took office in July.

LGBTQ+ RIGHTS: Erdogan criticized the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics in July, which featured drag queens and was widely misinterpreted as a representation of Christ's last supper with his disciplines. He called it a ""disgrace"" that ""revealed the dimensions of the threat we face as humanity."" Erdogan, whose government has clamped down on LGBTQ+ events in recent years, added: ""Anyone who raises a voice against this destruction project and shows the slightest reaction is silenced and becomes the target of lynching campaigns,"" he said. ""Turkey is determined to break this siege and resist this climate of fear at all cost.""

Israel's envoy to the U.N. says his country doesn't want to send troops into Lebanon but will do ""whatever necessary"" to halt the Hezbollah rocket fire that has driven tens of thousands of Israelis from their country's north. ""We prefer a diplomatic solution. But if it's not working, we are using other methods to show the other side that we mean business,"" said Ambassador DANNY DANON.

White House Principal Deputy National Security Adviser JON FINER said that Biden administration officials were in talks with allies to help find an off-ramp to the escalating tensions between Israel and Hezbollah. ""We're working on that it real time right here in New York and in capitals around the world,"" Finer said in an appearance at an event hosted by the news site Axios. He sidestepped questions about whether the fighting has already become the all-out war that the U.S. had been pressing Israel to avoid with Lebanon as it continues its nearly year-long conflict in Gaza. But he underscored that a ""big war, a wider war"" is neither in Israel or Lebanon's interest.

In the buildup to introducing Biden for a climate speech in New York, actress and activist JANE FONDA changed some words, some accidentally, some not so to call attention to climate change. In talking about Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, Fonda slipped and started to called it the ""Inflammation"" Reduction Act and then corrected it, saying inflammation actually works too, given global temperatures. Then in discussing fossil fuels that cause climate change, Fonda was blunt and profane: ""Forget natural gas, but the f -- -ing fossil gas. There's nothing natural about it, and it's terrible for people and the environment.""

Several leaders from Africa complained again this year about the lack of permanent representation on the U.N. Security Council. ""Africa and its 1.4 billion people remain excluded from its key decision-making structures,"" said CYRIL RAMAPHOSA, the president of South Africa. ""The U.N. Security Council must be reformed as a matter of urgency. It must become more inclusive so that the voices of all nations are heard and considered.""

El Salvador President NAYIB BUKELE boasted of his country's security turnaround, moving the tiny Central American nation from one of the world's most dangerous countries to one of its safest. Bukele was reelected by a landslide to an unprecedented second term in February largely on his security record of crippling the country's once-powerful street gangs. The media-savvy millennial leader has locked up more than 81,000 people under a state of emergency now in place for more than 2 ½ years that suspends some fundamental rights. ""Some say that we have jailed thousands, but the reality is that we have freed millions,"" Bukele said. ""Now it's the good (people) who live free, without fear, with their freedoms and human rights totally respected.""

""Security is not only about having strong armies and weapons of mass destruction. True security will only be achieved with trust, equality and prosperity for all peoples.""

-- SADYR ZHAPAROV, president of Kyrgyzstan

Of all the United Nations' 193 countries, Brazil had the first word at the General Assembly's big annual debate Tuesday -- as it has since the early days of the U.N. Why? Because back then, Brazil volunteered to speak first when no other nation would. A tradition was born. The United States typically goes second because it hosts the U.N. headquarters in New York. Everyone else's speaking slot is determined by multiple variables, including how high-level the speaker is (a head of state versus a cabinet member, for instance), countries' own preferences and geographic balance.

Number of times U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the word ""impunity"" in his opening speech Tuesday: 5

""My fellow leaders, let us never forget some things are more important than staying in power. It's your people that matter the most. Never forget, we are here to serve the people, not the other way around.""

-- Biden, who won applause when he used his decision not to run for re-election as fuel for calling all leaders -- particularly autocrats in the room -- to focus on democracy ahead of personal power

""Not only children are dying in Gaza; the United Nations system is also dying, the truth is dying, the values that the West claims to defend are dying, the hopes of humanity to live in a fairer world are dying one by one.""

-- Erdogan, speaking about the nations he says blindly support Israel, at the cost of tens of thousands of Palestinian lives.

Ukrainian President VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, the leader of a nation at war, will address the General Assembly on Wednesday. Also Wednesday, the Security Council will hold a meeting about the situation in Lebanon.

Iran's present tells the UN that his country wants to play a 'constructive role' in world affairs,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/un-general-assembly-iran-president-pezeshkian-bca11f4148e60d84a39f85cde78fa2bf,2024-09-24T23:05:33Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Iran's new president signaled to world leaders Tuesday that he wants to open a ""constructive"" chapter in his country's international relations -- but he made clear that everyone else, including the United States, needs to do their part.

In his first speech at the U.N. General Assembly's annual gathering of world leaders, Masoud Pezeshkian struck a somewhat more measured tone than his predecessors often have in recent years.

""I aim to lay a strong foundation for my country's entry into a new era, positioning it to play an effective and constructive role in the evolving global order,"" said Pezeshkian, a heart surgeon who ran as a reformer. He took office in July.

Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, opened the door last month to renewed negotiations with the United States over his country's rapidly advancing nuclear program, telling Iran's civilian government there was ""no harm"" in engaging with its ""enemy."" The United States, under former President Donald Trump, withdrew in 2018 from Iran's deal with several Western nations to curtail its nuclear program in exchange for getting sanctions lifted.

It remains unclear just how much room Pezeshkian will have to maneuver, particularly as tensions remain high in the wider Middle East over the Israel-Hamas war and as the U.S. prepares for a presidential election in November.

Pezeshkian, like Iranian presidents before him, had sharp words Tuesday for Israel. He accused the nation of ""atrocities,"" ""colonialism,"" ""crimes against humanity"" and ""desperate barbarism"" as it fights Hamas in Gaza and exchanges fire with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran backs both militant groups.

Israel's heavy bombardment of Lebanon in recent days ""cannot go unanswered,"" he said. He added that consequences would be borne by governments he described as thwarting efforts to end the ""catastrophe"" in the Middle East while calling themselves champions of human rights, an apparent reference to the United States and allied Western powers.

Washington has been attempting, with Egypt and Qatar, to get Israel and Hamas to agree to a cease-fire deal. But it has been elusive, and now the developments in Lebanon stand to complicate the efforts further.

Directly addressing the American people, Pezeshkian listed a number of Iranian grievances -- from sanctions to the 2020 killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a Trump-era U.S. drone strike -- and then urged ""all states pursuing a counterproductive strategy towards Iran"" to ""learn from history.""

""We have the opportunity to transcend these limitations and enter into a new era. This era will commence with the acknowledgement of Iran's security concerns and cooperation on mutual challenges,"" he said, appealing anew for sanctions relief.

""I hope that this message from Iran is carefully heard today,"" the new president concluded.

There was no immediate response from the U.S. or Israel.

Qatar is the second Muslim nation whose citizens can travel to the US without a visa,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/united-states-qatar-visa-free-travel-fd7cbb98ce42af12a6bb71f5e25b5ff5,2024-09-24T19:06:05Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- The Gulf nation of Qatar on Tuesday became just the second Muslim-majority country to be admitted into a program that allows its citizens to travel to the United States without first obtaining a U.S. visa.

The departments of State and Homeland Security jointly announced that Qatar had met stringent eligibility requirements to join the visa waiver program. Those requirements include a low visa refusal rate, a low rate of visa overstays and a demand of reciprocal treatment of American travelers, who are already allowed to visit Qatar without a visa for up to 30 days.

""Qatar has been an exceptional partner for the United States, and our strategic relationship has only grown stronger over the past few years,"" the departments said in a statement. ""This is further evidence of our strategic partnership and our shared commitment to security and stability.""

Qatar, which has played a key role in trying to negotiate a cease-fire deal in Gaza and was an instrumental U.S. partner before and during the American withdrawal from Afghanistan, is the 42nd country to be admitted to the program.

Most countries whose citizens can visit the U.S. without a visa are longstanding allies in Europe and Asia. The only other Muslim-majority country in the program is the tiny Southeast Asian nation of Brunei.

Although Qatar's population is just over 3 million people, only a small percentage of those -- about 320,000 -- are actually Qataris who would be eligible for the program if they hold valid passports. The vast majority of people who live in Qatar are foreign workers and other expatriates who do not hold Qatari passports.

The program allows citizens of qualifying nations to enter the U.S. for business or tourism without a visa for up to 90 days, although they must still obtain approval through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization, or ESTA, which is done online and doesn't require an in-person interview as visa applications do.

After Oct. 1, U.S. citizens will be allowed to stay in Qatar without a visa for 90 days.

Israel was the last country admitted to the program in 2023, and it was allowed in despite significant concerns that it does not treat Palestinian Americans, Arab Americans or Muslim Americans the same as other U.S. passport holders."
Palestinos en Gaza temen quedar en el olvido ante el conflicto Israel-Hezbollah,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-93527a109ea1279da7f0d91761c09a6c,2024-09-24T16:47:01Z,"MUWASI, Franja de Gaza (AP) -- A medida que el conflicto entre Israel y el grupo armado libanés Hezbollah acapara la atención mundial, los palestinos de Gaza se preguntan: ¿Qué pasará con su difícil situación después de casi un año de guerra devastadora?

Están petrificados de que la preocupación internacional se haya desviado y de que se cierne una oscura posibilidad: el abandono.

Las familias de los rehenes israelíes retenidos en Gaza tienen la misma preocupación.

Nezar Zaqout, uno de los 1,9 millones de palestinos que se han visto obligados a huir de sus hogares desde que estalló la guerra entre Israel y Hamás, teme que los combates en la frontera entre Israel y Líbano superen el interés por las pésimas condiciones de vida en Gaza y los esfuerzos para negociar un cese del fuego.

""Nos han olvidado por completo"", dijo Zaqout, quien vive en Jan Yunis después de huir de Ciudad de Gaza hace meses. ""No hay noticias sobre nosotros en los medios de comunicación"".

Los palestinos temen que las miserables condiciones en Gaza se conviertan en permanentes. El 90% de la población no tiene hogar, y cientos de miles viven en campamentos de tiendas insalubres y luchan por encontrar comida y agua potable.

""Ha pasado un año y nadie se preocupa por nosotros. Todos los días hay bombardeos, todos los días hay mártires y todos los días hay heridos"", dijo Saadi Abu Mustafa, quien huyó de Jan Yunis a Muwasi, un extenso campamento de tiendas de campaña en la costa sur de Gaza.

Desde el ataque de Hamás al sur de Israel el 7 de octubre y la respuesta de Israel en Gaza, han muerto más de 41.000 palestinos y más de 95.000 han resultado heridos, según el Ministerio de Salud de Gaza, que no diferencia entre civiles y milicianos, pero asegura que más de la mitad de los fallecidos son mujeres y niños.

Meses de intensos ataques aéreos y terrestres han acabado con bloques enteros de viviendas; expertos en imágenes satelitales calculan que casi el 60% de los edificios de la Franja de Gaza probablemente han sido dañados desde el comienzo de la guerra.

Israel prometió destruir a Hamás después del 7 de octubre, cuando sus milicianos mataron a unas 1.200 personas y secuestraron a otras 250. Si bien se ha visto muy afectado, el grupo armado palestino respaldado por Irán mantiene poder.

El gobierno israelí estima que unos 70 de los 100 rehenes siguen vivos. Sus familias temen que el enfoque del gobierno para poner fin a la guerra se esté desvaneciendo.

""Mi mayor preocupación es que toda la atención del público y del mundo se vaya hacia el norte"", dijo Udi Goren, pariente de Tal Haimi, un israelí asesinado el 7 de octubre y cuyo cuerpo fue llevado a Gaza. ""Al final, los rehenes se quedarán completamente solos, sin nadie que los saque"".

A medida que ha aumentado la amenaza de una guerra total entre Israel y Hezbollah, Israel ha reducido su presencia de tropas en Gaza para trasladar unidades clave a su frontera norte con el Líbano. Aun así, miles de soldados permanecen en Gaza, llevando a cabo incursiones esporádicas e impidiendo que los palestinos desplazados regresen a sus hogares.

Los ataques diarios también siguen en Gaza. Un bombardeo israelí contra una escuela convertida en refugio en el norte de Gaza mató el sábado al menos a 22 personas e hirió a otras 30, en su mayoría mujeres y niños, según el Ministerio de Salud de Gaza.

Las lluvias recientes han hecho que las difíciles condiciones de vida en Muwasi, que Israel designó ""zona segura"", sean insoportables. El domingo, niños que viven allí caminaban descalzos por el barro que les cubría hasta los tobillos, mientras unos hombres buscaban en medio del lodo valiosos productos enlatados y muebles.

""Toda la cocina en la que preparamos la comida estaba llena de agua. No sabíamos qué hacer. Este es el comienzo del invierno. ¿Qué pasará en los próximos días?"", dijo Rana Goza't, una madre desplazada de Ciudad de Gaza.

Otros lamentaban los colchones anegados y pedían a los grupos internacionales que ayuden a mantener la atención sobre la crisis humanitaria en Gaza.

""Esperamos que todas las personas se preocupen por nosotros y vean a dónde hemos llegado"", dijo Enas Kollab, quien se trasladó a Muwasi desde el norte de Gaza.

Una oleada de actividad diplomática para negociar un acuerdo entre Israel y Hamás parece haber menguado, mientras cada parte acusa a la otra de negociar de mala fe y hacer demandas insostenibles.

El primer ministro israelí, Benjamin Netanyahu, dice que Israel debe mantener tropas en dos áreas de Gaza para evitar que Hamás se rearme. Pero el grupo armado ha dicho que no aceptará ningún acuerdo que permita la permanencia de tropas israelíes.

Las esperanzas de un acuerdo se han difuminado aún más a medida que Estados Unidos, un mediador clave en las conversaciones, parece estar perdiendo la capacidad de influir en su aliado más cercano. En un viaje a la región la semana pasada, el secretario de Estado, Antony Blinken, visitó solamente Egipto porque las autoridades estadounidenses consideraron que ir a Israel en apoyo de un acuerdo podría hacer que Netanyahu dijera algo que socavara los esfuerzos de mediación.

No ha surgido una visión clara para Gaza en la posguerra, ni quién guiará y gobernará ese proceso, pero una cosa está clara: la reconstrucción del territorio llevará décadas. La ONU estimó este verano que solamente retirar unos 40 millones de toneladas de escombros llevaría 15 años."
"What is Hezbollah, the group battling Israel in Lebanon?",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/what-is-hezbollahisrael-lebanon-b4daa0a6084df27099cef45b59120034,2024-09-24T16:46:55Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- After almost a year of trading fire, Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah are now engaged in ferocious confrontations that threaten to turn into a full-blown war.

Israel faces a much more formidable foe in Hezbollah than it faced in Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Many consider the Iran-backed group the strongest paramilitary force in the region -- but the group also has political and social wings with considerable power in Lebanon.

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has warned Israel that his group has new weapons and capabilities, and it has published surveillance drone footage taken deep inside northern Israel that showed the port of Haifa and other sites far from the Lebanon-Israel border. In the past few days, it has struck deeper into Israel than at any time in the past year.

Founded in 1982 during Lebanon's civil war, Hezbollah was initially devoted to ending Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon. It achieved that in 2000 following a long war of attrition that eventually forced Israel to withdraw. But it has continued its battle and seeks Israel's destruction.

Shiite Muslim Hezbollah is part of a collection of Iranian-backed factions and governments known as the Axis of Resistance. It was the first group that Iran supported and used as a way to export its brand of political Islamism.

In addition to being an armed group, Hezbollah is also a political party with lawmakers in the Lebanese parliament and has had representatives in most Lebanese governments for decades. It also provides extensive social services, including running schools and health clinics, in southern Lebanon and other parts of the country where it has a strong presence.

In its early days, the group attacked U.S. interests, causing Washington to designate it a terrorist organization. Those attacks included taking U.S. hostages in Beirut and the infamous 1983 truck bombing of a Marine Corps barracks in Beirut that killed 241 American service members.

""Iran's support has helped Hezbollah consolidate its position as Lebanon's most powerful political actor as well as the most-equipped military actor supported by Iran in the whole of the Middle East,"" said Lina Khatib, the director of the SOAS Middle East Institute in London.

In 2006, Hezbollah fighters ambushed an Israeli patrol and took two Israeli soldiers hostage in a cross-border raid. That sparked a monthlong war between Hezbollah and Israel that ended in a draw, but Israeli bombardment wreaked widespread destruction in southern Lebanon.

Israel's objective was eliminating Hezbollah, but the Lebanese group came out stronger and became a key military and political power on Israel's northern border.

Domestic opponents have criticized Hezbollah for maintaining its arsenal and for coming to dominate the government. Hezbollah's reputation also suffered when it briefly seized a section of Beirut in May 2008 after the Lebanese government took measures against its private telecommunications network.

Hezbollah is the Arab world's most significant paramilitary force with a robust organizational structure as well as a sizeable arsenal. It claims to have some 100,000 fighters

Hezbollah's military capabilities have surged over the years, and it has played a key role in the Syrian civil war, helping keep President Bashar Assad in power there. It has also helped train Iran-backed militias in Syria and Iraq, as well as Yemen's Houthi rebels.

Israel estimates Hezbollah has some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including guided missiles and long-range projectiles capable of striking anywhere in Israel.

Throughout its latest conflict with Israel, Hezbollah has gradually introduced new weapons to its arsenal.

While Hezbollah initially began launching anti-tank missiles and rockets, it eventually introduced explosive drones and surface-to-air missiles for the first time. Nasrallah said the drones are locally manufactured, and they have many at their disposal.

The group sustained a severe blow last week, when thousands of communications devices, used mainly by its members, exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 and wounding nearly 3,000, many of them civilians. The attack -- an embarrassing breach of Hezbollah's supply chain -- is widely blamed on Israel.

Israel has recently also assassinated several of the group's senior leaders, including a top military commander.

Born in 1960 into a poor Shiite family in the Beirut suburb of Bourj Hammoud and later displaced to south Lebanon, Nasrallah studied theology and joined the Amal movement, a Shiite political and paramilitary organization, before becoming one of Hezbollah's founders.

He became Hezbollah's leader in 1992 after his predecessor was killed in an Israeli strike.

Idolized by many for presiding over Israel's withdrawal from the south and leading the 2006 war, his image appears on billboards and on gadgets in souvenir shops in Lebanon, Syria and other countries across the Arab world. But he also faces opposition among Lebanese who accuse him of tying their country's fate to Iran.

Nasrallah is also considered to be pragmatic, able to make political compromises.

He has lived in hiding for years, fearing Israeli assassination, and delivers his speeches from undisclosed locations."
Israel and Hezbollah renew fire after the deadliest day in Lebanon since 2006,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-news-09-24-2024-640a0046aceea1b5cfb395a54ff36bce,2024-09-24T09:31:53Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Israel and Hezbollah traded strikes again Tuesday, a day after a massive Israeli bombardment killed nearly 500 people, sent thousands fleeing from southern Lebanon and put the two sides on the brink of all-out war.

Displaced families slept in shelters hastily set up in schools in Beirut and the coastal city of Sidon. With hotels quickly booked to capacity or rooms priced beyond the means of many families, those who did not find shelter slept in their cars, in parks or along the seaside.

Well-wishers offered up empty apartments or rooms in their houses in social media posts, while volunteers set up a kitchen at an empty gas station in Beirut to cook meals for the displaced.

In the eastern city of Baalbek, the state-run National News Agency reported that lines formed at bakeries and gas stations as residents rushed to stock up on essential supplies in anticipation of another round of strikes on Tuesday.

The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah said it launched missiles overnight at eight sites in Israel, including an explosives factory in Zichron, 60 kilometers (37 miles) from the border.

The Israeli military said Tuesday morning that 55 rockets were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel, setting fires and damaging buildings. Military officials said they carried out dozens of airstrikes on Hezbollah targets, including on a cell that fired rockets overnight, and that tanks and artillery struck targets near the border.

Galilee Medical Center, a northern Israel hospital, said that two patients arrived with minor head injuries from a rocket falling near their car. Several others were being treated for light wounds from running to shelters and traffic accidents when alarms sounded.

The renewed exchange came after Monday's historic barrages racked up the highest death toll in any single day in Lebanon since Israel and Hezbollah fought a bruising monthlong war in 2006.

Israel said it targeted sites where Hezbollah had stored weapons. Data from American fire-tracking satellites analyzed Tuesday by The Associated Press showed the wide range of Israeli airstrikes aimed at southern Lebanon, covering an area of over 1,700 square kilometers (650 square miles).

NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System typically is used to track wildfires across rural areas of the U.S. However, it can also be used to track the flashes and burning that follow airstrikes. That's particularly true when an airstrike ignites flammable material on the ground, such as munitions or fuel.

Data from Monday showed significant fires breaking out across southern Lebanon and in the Bekaa Valley. Several areas showed intense, multiple fires, including near the southern coastal town of Naqoura, which hosts a base for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon known as UNIFIL. Others were in mountainous rural areas or villages.

The sides appear on the verge of war again after tensions have steadily escalated over the last 11 months. Hezbollah has been firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians and its ally Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group, in Gaza.

Israel has responded with increasingly heavy airstrikes and the targeted killing of Hezbollah commanders while threatening a wider operation.

Thousands of Lebanese fled the southern part of the country on Monday after the Israeli military ordered people to evacuate areas where it accuses Hezbollah of positioning rocket launchers and other weapons, in the biggest exodus since the monthlong war waged 18 years ago.

The Lebanese Health Ministry said Monday's strikes killed 492 people, including 35 children and 58 women, and wounded 1,645 people -- a staggering one-day toll for a country still reeling from a deadly attack on communication devices last week.

Nearly a year of cross-border fire had already emptied out communities near the border, displacing tens of thousands of people on both sides. Israel has vowed to do whatever it takes to ensure its citizens can return to their homes in the north, while Hezbollah has said it will keep up its rocket attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which appears increasingly remote.

The Israeli military says it has no immediate plans for a ground invasion but is prepared for one, after moving thousands of troops who had been serving in Gaza to the northern border. It says Hezbollah has launched some 9,000 rockets and drones into Israel since last October, including 250 on Monday alone.

The military said Israeli warplanes struck 1,600 Hezbollah targets Monday, destroying cruise missiles, long- and short-range rockets and attack drones, including weapons concealed in private homes. Lebanese officials have said many of the victims were civilians, including more than 90 women and children killed.

Israel estimates Hezbollah has some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including guided missiles and long-range projectiles capable of striking anywhere in Israel.

Monday's escalation came after a particularly heavy exchange of fire Sunday. Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in retaliation for strikes that killed a top commander and dozens of fighters.

Last week, thousands of communications devices, used mainly by Hezbollah members, exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000, many of them civilians. Lebanon blamed Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny responsibility.

The head of the Federal Criminal Police Office, Holger Münch, said in comments to the RND newspaper group published Tuesday that his office currently has more than 500 bodyguards. He was quoted as saying that it plans to add 100 next year and another 100 after that.

""This has to do not just with growing dangers at home but also abroad, for example with the Ukraine or Gaza wars,"" Münch said.

His office is responsible for the protection of politicians including President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Chancellor Olaf Scholz, federal government ministers and leading lawmakers in the German parliament.

The national election is scheduled for Sept. 28 next year. German politics are in a disgruntled and volatile state, with Scholz leading an unpopular three-party coalition government that has become notorious for infighting and the far-right Alternative for Germany party polling strongly."

At least 15 others, including women and children, were injured in the strikes, they said.

Israel's military says it will do ""whatever is necessary"" to push Hezbollah away from Lebanon's border with Israel. The two countries have been trading fire since the Israel-Hamas war began. On Monday, Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes in southern and eastern Lebanon, killing nearly 500 people and wounding more than 1,600 others.

Thousands of people fled southern Lebanon, jamming the main highway to Beirut in the biggest exodus since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war.

It's a staggering one-day toll for a country still reeling from a deadly attack on communication devices the week before. Lebanon blamed the attacks on Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny its responsibility.

Hezbollah launched more than 100 projectiles toward Israel on Monday, the military said, reaching deep into Israel including around the northern city of Haifa and parts of the occupied West Bank. Most of the missiles were intercepted but two people were lightly injured from falling shrapnel in northern Israel.

Here's the latest:

DEIR-Al-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Palestinian officials say Israel's strikes early Tuesday killed at least seven people in Gaza's southern city of Khan Younis. At least 15 others, including women and children, were injured in the strikes, they said.

The civil defense said the dead include five people who were killed in a strike on the Abu Harb family house in the Qizan al-Najjar area. The strike also wounded at least 10 others, it said.

Another strike hit a house in the Tahlia area in Khan Younis, killing at least two people and wounding five others, according to the rescue service. The casualties from both strikes were confirmed in hospital records in Khan Younis.

Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians but rarely comments on individual strikes.

Gaza's Health Ministry says over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war. It does not say how many were fighters, but says a little over half were women and children.

The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 of the captives are still being held in Gaza, and a third of them are believed to be dead.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Airlines in the United Arab Emirates, a key East-West travel hub, canceled flight Tuesday to Lebanon over the ongoing cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah.

Long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad canceled flights, as did FlyDubai, the low-cost carrier.

The United Arab Emirates, which reached a diplomatic recognition deal with Israel in 2020, is home to a large Lebanese population."
"World leaders meet under shadow of global divisions, 3 wars and possible Mideast conflict",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/un-world-leaders-gaza-ukraine-sudan-e9b8bd0ee132f6a7f56555975f67b0de,2024-09-24T05:09:51Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- World leaders will open their annual meeting at the U.N. General Assembly Tuesday under the shadow of increasing global divisions, major wars in Gaza, Ukraine and, Sudan and the threat of an even larger conflict in the wider Middle East.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres previewed his opening ""State of the World"" speech to presidents, prime ministers, monarchs and ministers at Sunday's ""Summit of the Future,"" saying ""our world is heading off the rails -- and we need tough decisions to get back on track.""

He pointed to conflicts ""raging and multiplying, from the Middle East to Ukraine and Sudan, with no end in sight"" and to the global security system, which he said is ""threatened by geopolitical divides, nuclear posturing, and the development of new weapons and theaters of war.""

He also cited huge inequalities, the lack of an effective global system to respond to emerging and even existential threats, and the devastating impact of climate change.

One notable moment at Tuesday's opening assembly meeting: U.S. President Joe Biden's likely final major appearance on the world stage, a platform he has tred upon for decades.

U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told reporters last week that the U.S. focus in the assembly will be on ending ""the scourge of war,"" lamenting that roughly 2 billion people live in conflict-affected areas.

But she also said: ""The most vulnerable around the world are counting on us to make progress, to make change, to bring about a sense of hope for them.""

Among other speakers on opening day are Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, King Abdullah II of Jordan, and Iran's new President Masoud Pezeshkian.

The Iranian leader accused Israel on Monday of seeking a wider war in the Middle East and laying ""traps"" to lead his country into a broader conflict. He pointed to the deadly explosions of pagers, walkie-talkies and other electronic devices in Lebanon last week, which he blamed on Israel, and the assassination of Hamas' political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, hours after Pezeshkian's inauguration.

""We don't want to fight,"" the Iranian president said. ""It's Israel that wants to drag everyone into war and destabilize the region. ... They are dragging us to a point where we do not wish to go."" Iran supports both Hamas in Gaza and Lebanon's Hezbollah militants.

International Rescue Committee President David Miliband recalled that at the San Francisco conference in 1945 where the U.N. was established, then-U.S. President Harry Truman pleaded with delegates to reject the premise that ""might makes right"" and reverse it to ""right makes might,"" which was enshrined in the U.N. Charter.

""Almost 80 years later, we have seen the terrible consequences of the failure to flip this equation,"" Miliband said. ""In contexts like Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine, might is making right.""

Facing mounting global humanitarian needs, unchecked conflict, unmitigated climate change and growing extreme poverty, Miliband challenged world leaders asking: ""How will you strengthen, not weaken, the principles of the U.N. Charter for the next 80 years?""

The assembly's annual meeting, which ends on Sept. 30, followed the two-day Summit of the Future, which adopted a blueprint aimed at bringing the world's increasing divided nations together to tackle the challenges of the 21st century from conflicts and climate change to artificial intelligence and women's rights.

The 42-page ""Pact for the Future"" challenges leaders of the 193 U.N. member nations to turn promises into real actions that make a difference to the lives of the world's more than 8 billion people.

""We are here to bring multilateralism back from the brink,"" Guterres said.

By adopting the pact, leaders unlocked the door, he said. ""Now it is our common destiny to walk through it. That demands not just agreement, but action.""

At last year's U.N. global gathering, Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, took center stage. But as the first anniversary of Hamas' deadly attack in southern Israel approaches on Oct. 7, the spotlight is certain to be on the war in Gaza and escalating violence across the Israeli-Lebanon border, which is now threatening to spread to the wider Middle East.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is scheduled to speak Thursday morning and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday afternoon.

Zelenskyy will get the spotlight twice. He will speak Tuesday afternoon at a high-level meeting of the U.N. Security Council called by the United States, France, Japan, Malta, South Korea and Britain, whose foreign ministers are expected to attend. He will also address the General Assembly on Wednesday morning."
Unversed in UNGA? Stumped by SDGs? Here's a handy glossary of UN General Assembly meeting lingo,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-lingo-terminology-global-972afdb8d6fa8d4f8658e1fa2d56d6de,2024-09-24T04:55:43Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. General Assembly's yearly meeting of world leaders is here -- and with it, an array of acronyms, abbreviations, titles and terms that can be confounding to observers. Here is some key vocabulary, decoded.

UNGA: Acronym (yes, people do pronounce it ""UN'-gah"") for the U.N. General Assembly's ""High-level Week."" It's the international organization's biggest annual event, inviting presidents, prime ministers, monarchs and other top leaders of all 193 U.N. member countries to speak to the world and each other. Although New Yorkers sometimes just use ""General Assembly"" to describe what many experience mainly as a week of street closures and whizzing motorcades, the assembly actually isn't just this meeting. It's a body that convenes countries' ambassadors throughout the year to discuss a wide range of global issues and vote on resolutions.

GENERAL DEBATE: The centerpiece of the week, it gives each country's leader (or a designee) the mic for a state-of-the-world speech from its viewpoint. There is a theme, chosen by the assembly's president -- this year's is about ""leaving no one behind"" and ""acting together"" to advance peace, sustainable development and human dignity. But speakers use the opportunity to opine on the planet's biggest issues and hotspots, spotlight domestic accomplishments and needs, air grievances, and project statesmanship. Dignitaries are asked to wrap up within 15 minutes, but there's no buzzer or Oscars-style music. While the ""debate"" is less an interactive back-and-forth than a series of speeches, rebuttals are allowed at the end of each long day, and some embittered neighbor nations routinely go multiple rounds.

BILATERAL (or ""bilat,"" for short): Private meetings between leaders of one country and another. Some argue the real value of UNGA lies in these tête-à-têtes and other personal, off-camera encounters among decision-makers.

MINISTERIAL: Applies to meetings of cabinet-level officials, such as foreign ministers, from different countries.

SECURITY COUNCIL: The U.N.'s most powerful component, charged with maintaining international peace and security. The 15-member council can enact binding (though sometimes ignored) resolutions, impose sanctions and deploy peacekeeping troops. While this week is the Assembly's show, the council generally holds at least one meeting of its own with high-wattage attendees in town for the events next door. This week, there are set to be two council sessions, one on Ukraine and one on the topic of ""leadership for peace."" Who's on the council? Read on.

P5: The Security Council's five permanent members with veto power. Under a structure set up in 1945, they are China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States.

E10: The Security Council's 10 elected, non-permanent members. The General Assembly elects them for two-year terms in seats allocated by region. Calls for council reform are an UNGA staple. One major complaint is the lack of permanent members from Africa and the Latin America-Caribbean region, though some other nations also have angled for years for a permanent presence.

G77: Stands for the ""Group of 77,"" a developing-countries interest group that formed within the U.N. in 1964. Despite its name, it actually now has 134 members.

COP29: A major U.N. global climate conference coming up in November in Baku, Azerbaijan.

1.5 DEGREES: A crucial climate threshold. Under the 2015 Paris climate accord, countries agreed to work to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial times. The earth already has warmed at least 1.1 degrees (2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid-1800s.

SDGs: The U.N.'s "" sustainable development goals, "" which range from combating climate change to eliminating hunger and poverty to achieving gender equality. The U.N.'s member countries adopted the goals in 2015 as a 15-year action plan, but the pace is seriously lagging. UNGA week this year began with a ""Summit of the Future,"" on Sunday and Monday, that's meant to ""turbocharge the SDGs,"" as U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has put it. If that sounds a lot like the ""SDG summit"" during last year's high-level week, well... consider it a sign of both the emphasis on and elusiveness of these grand goals.

SIDS: At the U.N., this stands for some 39 "" small island developing states. "" UNGA is an important platform for them to elevate concerns such as climate change and the existential threat they face from projections of rising seas and intensifying storms -- often a painfully timely subject at a meeting that falls in the thick of the Atlantic hurricane season.

BRICS: A developing-economies coalition that initially included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates joined this year. Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied, and Saudi Arabia has said it's considering doing so. There are many international groups centered around regional, economic, defense or other ties, but BRICS has gotten attention lately as a growing venue for Chinese-Russian influence when those powers are increasingly at odds with the West.

LDCs: Very poor nations that are known at the U.N. as "" least-developed countries."" Forty-five nations currently meet the criteria, which include a gross national income of $1,088 or less per person per year.

NGO: ""Non-governmental organization,"" such as an advocacy group, charitable foundation, nonprofit relief organization or other entity under the umbrella of what the U.N. likes to call civil society organizations.

IFIs: International financial institutions, including the so-called Bretton Woods institutions -- the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which were established at a 1944 U.N. conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. Critics -- including Guterres -- see the Bretton Woods duo as sclerotic entities that have badly failed poor and developing countries. The institutions have defended their work while saying they are trying to evolve.

MULTILATERALISM: Global or near-global partnership that is united and collectively develops enduring rules and shared norms -- the idea that undergirds the U.N. itself and which many warn is under threat.

MULTIPOLAR: A scenario in which there are several different and sometimes competing centers of power, not a single superpower or two.

MULTISTAKEHOLDER: An approach to big projects and problem-solving that incorporates not only governments but businesses, NGOs and possibly others. Guterres is a fan, seeing this concept as key to the future of world cooperation. But some progressive groups view it as a sell-out to big corporations and other powers in the status quo.

TWO-STATE SOLUTION: A concept for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by establishing an independent Palestinian nation living in peace alongside Israel. The framework was set down in the 1993 Oslo Accords and embraced by the U.N., but progress toward implementing it stalled long before Israel's nearly year-old war with Hamas in Gaza.

SOUTH-SOUTH COOPERATION: Collaboration among Southern Hemisphere countries, organizations and people, with aims that include amplifying their voice in their own development and in international affairs.

UNILATERAL COERCIVE MEASURES: A usually critical way of describing sanctions imposed by one country in hopes of spurring some action in another."
"As Israel's fight with Hezbollah heats up, people of Gaza fear being forgotten",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-war-lebanonrefugees-displaced-9d4d53e808ce5f67e234789f65d1ad71,2024-09-24T04:18:49Z,"MUWASI, Gaza Strip (AP) -- As the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah grabs global attention, Palestinians in Gaza wonder: What will become of their plight after nearly a year of devastating war?

They are petrified that international concern has been diverted, and that a dark possibility looms: abandonment.

The families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza have the same worry.

Nezar Zaqout, one of some 1.9 million Palestinians forced to flee their homes since the Israel-Hamas war broke out, said he fears the fighting across the Israel-Lebanon border will overtake interest in the abysmal living conditions in Gaza and efforts to negotiate a cease-fire.

""We have become completely forgotten,"" said Zaqout, who is living in Khan Younis after fleeing from Gaza City months ago. ""There is no news about us in the media.""

Palestinians fret the miserable conditions in Gaza will become permanent. Ninety percent of the population is homeless, with hundreds of thousands in unsanitary tent camps struggling to find food and clean water.

""A year on, and no one cares about us. Every day there is bombing, every day there are martyrs, and every day there are injuries,"" said Saadi Abu Mustafa, who fled Khan Younis to Muwasi, a sprawling tent camp along Gaza's southern coast.

Since Hamas launched the war on Oct. 7, Israel's retaliatory invasion of Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 95,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and militants, but says over half of the dead were women and children.

Months of intense air and ground assaults have razed entire housing blocks to the ground; researchers who study satellite imagery estimate nearly 60% of buildings in the Gaza Strip have likely been damaged since the start of the war.

Israel vowed to destroy Hamas after Oct. 7, when its militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted 250 others. While it has been badly hobbled, the militant group backed by Iran remains in power.

Israel's government says about 70 of the 100 hostages are still presumed alive. Their families dread the government's focus on ending the war is fading.

""My biggest concern is that all the public's attention and the world's attention would be gone to the north,"" said Udi Goren, a relative of Tal Haimi, an Israeli killed on Oct. 7 and whose body was taken to Gaza. ""Eventually the hostages will just be completely left alone without anyone to bring them out.""

As the threat of all-out-war between Israel and Hezbollah has risen, Israel has drawn down its troop presence in Gaza to move key units to its northern border with Lebanon. Still, thousands of soldiers remain in Gaza, carrying out sporadic raids and preventing displaced Palestinians from returning home.

Daily strikes have continued in Gaza, too. An Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter in northern Gaza Saturday killed at least 22 people and wounded 30 others, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry.

Recent rains have made already difficult living conditions in the Israeli-designated ""safe zone"" of Muwasi unbearable. On Sunday, children living there walked barefoot through mud that reached above their ankles, while men dug through the muck to salvage precious canned goods and furniture.

""The entire kitchen in which we prepare food was filled with water. We did not know what to do. This is the beginning of winter. What will happen in the coming days?"" said Rana Goza't, a mother displaced from Gaza City.

Others lamented water-logged mattresses and pleaded for international groups to help keep attention on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

""We hope that all peoples care about us and see where we have reached,"" said Enas Kollab, who relocated to Muwasi from northern Gaza.

A flurry of diplomatic activity to broker an agreement between Israel and Hamas appears to have subsided, with each side accusing the other of negotiating in bad faith and making untenable demands.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel must keep troops in two areas of Gaza to prevent Hamas from rearming. But Hamas has said it will not agree to any deal that allows Israeli troops to remain.

Hopes for a deal have further dimmed as the United States, a key mediator in the talks, appears to be losing the ability to influence its closest ally. In a trip to the region last week, Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited only Egypt because U.S. officials believed having him travel to Israel in support of a deal might cause Netanyahu to say something that would undermine mediation efforts.

No clear vision has emerged for postwar Gaza -- or who will guide and govern that process -- but one thing is clear: Rebuilding the territory will take decades. The U.N. estimated this summer that just removing some 40 million tons of rubble would take 15 years."
Conflicts in the Mideast and Ukraine will loom over Biden's farewell address at the United Nations,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/biden-un-general-assembly-ukraine-israel-gaza-4e4e839c3cdd4edd7543aea84af2346f,2024-09-24T04:07:09Z,"Biden is expected to use his wide-ranging address to speak to the need to end the Middle East conflict and the 17-month-old civil war in Sudan and to highlight U.S. and Western allies' support for Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

His appearance before the international body also offers Biden one of his last high-profile opportunities as president to make the case to keep up robust support for Ukraine, which could be in doubt if former President Donald Trump, who has scoffed at the cost of the war, defeats Vice President Kamala Harris in November.

Biden came to office promising to rejuvenate U.S. relations around the world and to extract the U.S. from ""forever wars"" in Afghanistan and Iraq that consumed American foreign policy over the last 20 years.

He achieved both goals. But his foreign policy legacy may ultimately be shaped by his administration's response to two of the biggest conflicts in Europe and the Middle East since World War II.

The Pentagon announced Monday that it was sending a small number of additional U.S. troops to the Middle East to supplement the roughly 40,000 already in the region, because of the rising tensions. All the while, the White House insists Israel and Hezbollah still have time to step back and de-escalate.

""It's in everyone's interest to resolve it quickly and diplomatically,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters as Biden made his way to New York on Monday ahead of his address at the U.N.

Biden administration officials will be speaking to their counterparts on the sidelines of the U.N. about ideas that they believe could prevent the fighting between Israel and Lebanon from escalating, according to two senior administration officials.

The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, declined to offer any further details on the potential off-ramps. One of the officials said that other countries were also keen to present ideas to reduce tensions.

Biden had a hopeful outlook for the Middle East when he addressed the U.N. just a year ago. In that speech, Biden spoke of a ""sustainable, integrated Middle East"" coming into view.

At the time, economic relations between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors were improving with implementation of the Abraham Accords that Israel signed with Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates during the Trump administration.

Biden's team helped resolve a long-running Israel-Lebanon maritime dispute that had held back gas exploration in the region. And Israel-Saudi normalization talks were progressing, a game-changing alignment for the region if a deal could be landed.

""I suffer from an oxymoron: Irish optimism,"" Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when they met on the sidelines of last year's U.N. gathering. He added, ""If you and I, 10 years ago, were talking about normalization with Saudi Arabia ... I think we'd look at each other like, 'Who's been drinking what?'""

Eighteen days later, Biden's Middle East hopes came crashing down. Hamas militants stormed into Israel killing 1,200, taking some 250 hostage, and spurring a bloody war that has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza and led the region into a complicated downward spiral.

Now, the conflict is threatening to metastasize into a multi-front war and leave a lasting scar on Biden's presidential legacy.

Israeli strikes on Lebanon on Monday killed more than 490 people, including more than 90 women and children, Lebanese authorities said, in the deadliest barrage since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war.

Israel has urged residents of southern Lebanon to evacuate from homes and other buildings where it claimed Hezbollah has stored weapons, saying the military would conduct ""extensive strikes"" against the militant group.

Hezbollah, meanwhile, has launched dozens of rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in retaliation for strikes last week that killed a top commander and dozens of fighters. Dozens were also killed last week and hundreds more wounded after hundreds of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah militants exploded, a sophisticated attack that was widely believed to have been carried out by Israel.

Israel's leadership launched its counterattacks at a time of growing impatience with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah's persistent launching of missiles and drones across the Israel-Lebanon border after Hamas started the war with its brazen attack on Oct. 7.

The stepped-up Israeli operations were launched shortly after a White House senior adviser, Amos Hochstein, visited Israel last week and urged the Israelis to avoid an escalation that could risk spurring a regional conflict.

""Reality is intervening,"" said Bradley Bowman, a defense strategy and policy analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington. ""There are contrasting interests that transcend the politics and the politicians of the U.S.-Israel relationship. For Israel, Oct. 7 did happen, and the reality is they are facing a multifront threat and the current status quo is unacceptable. Sometimes to get to a better status quo, you have to escalate.""

Biden has seemed more subdued in recent days about the prospects of Israel and Hamas agreeing to a temporary cease-fire and hostage deal. But he insists that he hasn't given up.

""If I ever say it's not realistic then I might as well leave,"" Biden said last week when asked if the chances for a deal were quickly fading under his watch. ""A lot of things don't look realistic until we get them done.""

Biden, in his address, also is expected to address ongoing Western support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. Biden helped galvanize an international coalition to back Ukraine with weapons and economic aid in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's February 2022 assault on Ukraine.

Biden has managed to keep up American support in the face of rising skepticism from some Republican lawmakers -- and Trump -- about the cost of the conflict.

At the same time, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is pressing Biden to loosen restrictions on the use of Western-supplied long-range missiles so that Ukrainian forces can hit deeper in Russia.

So far Zelenskyy has not persuaded the Pentagon or White House to loosen those restrictions. The Defense Department has emphasized that Ukraine can already hit Moscow with Ukrainian-produced drones, and there is hesitation on the strategic implications of a U.S.-made missile potentially striking the Russian capital.

Putin has warned that Russia would be ""at war"" with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to use the long-range weapons.

Over the course of the war, Biden has previously resisted Ukrainian requests for certain weaponry, including MI Abrams tanks and F-16 fighter jets, before agreeing to allow their use because of worries about escalating tensions with Russia.

Max Bergmann, a Russia analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the administration has slowly come around to giving Ukraine weapons that it initially deemed ""unimaginably escalatory"" at the start of the war.

""Allowing Ukraine to strike further into Russian territory with U.S. weapons would be another big step and the Biden administration is right to be deliberate,"" Bergmann said.

Biden and Harris are scheduled to hold separate meetings with Zelenskyy in Washington on Thursday. The Ukrainian leader also is expected to meet with Trump this week."
"What to know from the UN: Leaders speak of emerging threats, hints of war as big meeting nears",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-un-general-assembly-leaders-summit-e935290602c9c6658f305f20affac181,2024-09-23T22:02:52Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The security cordons are up. The streets are ready to be sealed off. Aircraft from myriad nations are landing in New York.

It all means one thing for the eastern part of Manhattan: The yearly gathering of world leaders at the United Nations is at hand.

The U.N. General Assembly's high-level leaders' meeting convenes Tuesday in a troubled world -- arguably even more troubled than last year, when the chief of the United Nations warned that the problems were overwhelming. Secretary-General ANTONIO GUTERRES will likely issue a similar warning on Tuesday as he opens the meeting, and world leaders take the stage amid war and rumors of war.

The day before the big meeting starts was full of hints as to the agenda in the days to come:

-- World leaders spoke at an event called ""Summit of the Future,"" with many focusing on emerging threats, to the earth's climate, on the battlefield and in cyberspace.

-- Iran's president pointed to the deadly explosions of pager and other devices in Lebanon, and the assassination of Hamas' political leader ISMAIL HANIYEH, as proof Israel is trying to coax Iran into war.

-- Most of Earth's systems are out of whack when it comes to climate change, and nations vary on who should pay to help poor nations deal with the impacts and switch to cleaner energy.

Here's your daily guide to what's going on at the United Nations this week, day by day:

A WARNING ON CYBERSPACE: At the ""Summit of the Future,"" Indian Prime Minister NARENDRA MODI voiced concerns about ""emerging theaters of conflict,"" including in cyberspace. ""There is a need for balanced regulation at a global level for the safe and responsible use of technology,"" Modi said, cautioning that ""we need global digital governance which ensures that national sovereignty and integrity are upheld.""

CHINA'S INITIATIVES: Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi talked up key Beijing initiatives such as the Belt and Road program, which brings Chinese companies to build Chinese-funded transportation, energy, and infrastructure projects overseas. He also hit some oft-repeated Chinese complaints, such as criticizing ""bloc confrontation"" and sanctions imposed by a single country.

PUBLICLY SILENCED: Representing a country where the median age is 28, Ecuador's president urged the international community to have ""a clear vision"" for education and youth employment. Then suddenly, no one could hear him. The microphone of DANIEL NOBOA AZIN was cut off. Speech time limits often aren't enforced at top-level U.N. meetings, but at the Summit of the Future, the mic was shut off after five minutes. Among the leaders who've run up against the limit: Brazilian President LUIZ INACIO LULA DA SILVA, Kuwait's Crown Prince Sheikh SABAH KHALID AL SABAH and Irish President MICHAEL HIGGINS.

U.S. Secretary of State ANTONY BLINKEN says upcoming leadership changes in Japan and the United States won't have any impact on their commitments to security in Northeast Asia.

Speaking at a meeting with the Japanese and South Korean foreign ministers on the sidelines of the general assembly, Blinken said the U.S. presidential race pitting Vice President Kamala Harris against former President Donald Trump, as well as Japanese Prime Minister FUMIO KISHIDA's impending retirement, will not change the three countries' joint resolve to combat threats posed by China and North Korea. He said the three-way collaboration among the allies after last year's historic Camp David summit between the leaders ""is stronger than it's ever been, more effective than it's ever been, and more important than it's ever been, given the shared challenges that we face as well as the many opportunities before us to seize.""

A group of scientists produced the first of what they hope is an annual planetary health check. The prognosis is grim.

Earth is in the danger zone on six of the nine special systems that scientists looked into, with a seventh flirting with that risky area and maybe already breaching the boundary, according to the ""planetary health check"" by the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research and the group called Planetary Guardians. The six areas definitely out of whack are the freshwater system, the climate, the phosphorous cycle, biodiversity, general land health and ""novel"" chemicals (such as microplastics). Ocean acidification is about to cross the danger line or may have done so already, the report said.

Only the ozone layer and health of the air are in decent shape, said Potsdam Institute Director JOHAN ROCKSTROM, who has done a similar planetary health check every several years and there is not much change from last year's.

""For 30, 40 years, the world has been conscious that Earth is going in the wrong direction but we did not feel the earth was on fire. Right now the planet is on fire and that's why we need to act,"" former Colombia President JUAN MANUEL SANTOS said in a press briefing.

Leaders of countries around the world spoke at the U.N.'s ""Summit of the Future"" one by one. Or, San Marino's case, two by two.

For centuries, the tiny European republic has had two heads of state at any given time. They're called capitani reggenti -- in English, captains regent -- and they're selected every six months by the nation's 60-person legislature. The current captains regent, ALESSANDRO ROSSI and MILENA GASPERONI, took turns delivering their country's speech. It touched on issues including refugees, food waste, violent extremism and the value of multilateralism -- the type of broad-based international system that the U.N. represents.

""In the case of small states, international law is seen as the one and only safeguard in the event of a threat to their existence, and multilateral fora represent a valuable megaphone to make their voices heard, which would otherwise remain unheard,"" Gasperoni said.

Number of women scheduled to address the assembly during the general debate, out of 194 total speakers: 19.

""They are dragging us to a point where we do not wish to go. There is no winner in warfare.""

-- Iranian President MASOUD PEZESHKIAN, speaking about Israel

""Today in Kabul, a female cat has more freedoms than a woman. A cat may go sit on her front stoop and feel the sun on her face. She may chase a squirrel into the park. A squirrel has more rights than a girl in Afghanistan today because the public parks have been closed to women and girls by the Taliban. A bird may sing in Kabul, but a girl may not, and a woman may not, in public. This is extraordinary.""

-- Actor MERYL STREEP, at a discussion focused on Afghan women

""Leaders must ask themselves whether this will be yet another meeting where they simply talk about greater cooperation and consensus, or whether they will show the imagination and conviction to actually forge it. With multiple crises around the world ... if they miss this opportunity, I shudder to think of the consequences. Our collective future is at stake.""

-- Amnesty International Secretary General AGNÈS CALLAMARD

Caribbean leaders want big polluters -- especially fossil fuel companies -- to pay more of the trillions of dollars the world needs to help poor nations deal with climate change's impacts and switch to cleaner energy.

In a brief video appearance, Barbados Prime Minister MIA MOTTLEY, a leader in the call for global financial reform and seen as a possible future U.N. secretary-general, said poorer and middle income nations realize that private money is going to have to be part of a financial deal. But she said many multinational companies, which are richer than dozens of small nations, should pony up more dollars.

Bahamas Prime Minister PHILIP DAVIS said fossil fuel companies need to be held accountable, but it will probably have to be in the courts through international lawsuits.

JOHN PODESTA, Biden's top climate official, says the United States is doing its part to fight climate change and it's paying off around the world. Podesta said the $300 billion Inflation Reduction Act spurred private businesses to spend $270 billion in clean energy. But the payoff wasn't just in the United States because for every ton of heat-trapping carbon that the country reduced because of the new law, the world cut 2.9 tons, he said.

On tap for Tuesday, among other remarks, is the last U.N. address from JOE BIDEN as president of the United States after five decades on various parts of the world stage. Conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon, Ukraine and Sudan are expected to take center stage all week. Guterres opens the debate Tuesday morning.

University of California accused of labor violations over handling of campus protests,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/university-of-california-campus-protests-labor-945b67e019064529017cf1391356e0a5,2024-09-23T20:53:17Z,"OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Faculty have accused the University of California system of labor violations over what they say was a sweeping campaign to suppress pro-Palestinian speech and campus protests across the state earlier this year.

The Council of University of California Faculty Associations made the allegations in a complaint filed last week with the state Public Employment Relations Board. Faculty associations at seven UC campuses co-signed the unfair labor practice charge, including Los Angeles, Irvine, San Diego, Santa Cruz, Berkeley, Davis and San Francisco, the Los Angeles Times reported Monday.

The council said UC administrators have threatened faculty for teaching about the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and launched disciplinary proceedings for those supporting on-campus student encampments.

The group's president, Constance Penley, described the university's actions as a ""relentless campaign to chill faculty's exercise of their academic freedom and to deter them from teaching about the war in a way that does not align with the university's position,"" according to the Times.

Protest camps sprang up across the U.S. in the spring, including at UC campuses, as students demanded that their universities cease doing business with Israel or companies they said supported the war in Gaza.

California faculty have also been investigated for pro-Palestinian social media posts, arrested for exercising their free speech rights and were surveilled and intimidated by university representatives, the state filing alleges.

The Times said that months after police cleared pro-Palestinian encampments at universities, the fallout has continued at campuses statewide, with university officials implementing new protest rules and student protesters grappling with ongoing suspensions and holds on their records.

The university system defended its actions. UC spokesperson Heather Hansen pointed to a university statement previously filed with the state labor board in response to an earlier filing by the UCLA Faculty Association.

The university stated that while it ""supports free speech and lawful protests,"" it must also ""ensure that all of its community members can safely continue to study, work, and exercise their rights, which is why it has in place policies that regulate the time, place, and manner for protest activities on its campuses.""

The Public Employee Relations Board will review and evaluate the case, and decide whether to dismiss the charge or proceed with having parties negotiate a settlement. If no settlement is reached, the case would be scheduled for a formal hearing before an administrative law judge."
Is this war? The Israeli-Hezbollah conflict is hard to define  --  or predict,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-conflict-war-57eb5ef4a77f3bcc0d2b920bc4536706,2024-09-23T14:34:37Z,"Israel is bombing targets across many parts of Lebanon, striking senior militants in Beirut and apparently hiding bombs in pagers and walkie-talkies. Hezbollah is firing rockets and drones deep into northern Israel, setting buildings and cars alight.

But no one is calling it a war -- not yet.

Israeli officials say they are not seeking war with Hezbollah and that it can be avoided if the militant group halts its attacks and backs away from the border. Hezbollah also says it doesn't want a war but is prepared for one -- and that it will keep up the strikes on Israel that it began in the wake of ally Hamas' Oct. 7 attack until there is a cease-fire in Gaza.

Israel and Hezbollah have repeatedly traded fire since then -- but the intensity rose to another level Monday, when Israeli airstrikes killed more than 180 people, according to Lebanese officials. That would make it the deadliest day in Lebanon since Israel and Hezbollah last went to war in 2006.

""If someone had told me or most analysts in summer 2023 that Hezbollah is striking Israeli bases in Israel, and Israel is striking southern Lebanon and parts of southern Beirut, I would have said, okay, that's an all-out war,"" said Andreas Krieg, a military analyst at King's College London.

The term hasn't yet been applied to the current conflict because ""there haven't been any boots on the ground,"" but that might be ""the wrong metric,"" he added.

Merriam-Webster defines war as ""a state of usually open and declared armed hostile conflict between states or nations."" Scholars generally expand that definition to cover large-scale violence involving insurgents, militias and extremist groups.

But any attempt at greater precision is difficult since armed conflicts run the gamut from states clashing with tanks and fighter jets to lower-level fighting.

Sometimes states officially declare war, as Israel did after Hamas' attack last year.

It has not made a similar declaration with regard to Hezbollah, but it has linked its strikes against the group to the war in Gaza, saying last week that allowing tens of thousands of residents to safely return to the north is an objective in that conflict. Israel's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, also frequently talks about an ongoing war with Iran and its allies along ""seven fronts,"" including Lebanon.

States often refrain from declaring war even when they are plainly engaged in one. Russia officially refers to its invasion of Ukraine as a ""special military operation"" and has banned public references to it as a war. The United States has not formally declared war since World War II, even as it took part in major conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan.

Part of the reason neither Israel nor Hezbollah is using the word ""war"" is because they both hope to achieve their aims without setting off a more severe conflict -- or being blamed for one.

""Though tensions are flaring, the situation in southern Lebanon is not that of a full-scale war as both Hezbollah and Israel hope to use limited means to pressure one another,"" said Lina Khatib, a Middle East expert at Chatham House.

With its rocket and drone attacks, Hezbollah hopes to pressure Israel to agree to a cease-fire with Hamas -- a fellow Iran-backed militant group -- and to avoid being seen as bowing to Israeli pressure.

Hezbollah has said it would cease the attacks if there were a truce in Gaza, but the prospects for such a deal appear remote.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to do whatever is necessary to halt the attacks so that displaced Israelis can return to their homes.

""I think the Israelis are trying to either tell Hezbollah, you come to the negotiation table and we'll settle this through diplomacy, or we'll push you into a corner until you overreact,"" Krieg said. ""And that will be the all-out war.""

Until recently, experts generally agreed that any future war between Israel and Hezbollah would look like the war they fought in 2006 -- but much, much worse.

For years, Israeli officials warned that in any future war with Hezbollah, the army would exact a punishing toll on Lebanon itself, destroying critical infrastructure and flattening Hezbollah strongholds. It came to be known as the Dahiyeh Doctrine, named for the crowded southern Beirut district where the militant group is headquartered, and that suffered heavy destruction in 2006.

Hezbollah, meanwhile, spent years expanding and improving its arsenal, and is believed to have some 150,000 rockets and missiles capable of hitting all parts of Israel.

The military build-up and threats created a situation of mutual deterrence that kept the border largely quiet from 2006 until October of last year. For most of the past year, the region has been braced for the worst, but both sides have showed restraint, and the talk of ""all-out war"" has been hypothetical.

That could change at any time.

""We've gone up a step, but we haven't yet made it to the penthouse floor,"" said Uzi Rabi, the director of the Moshe Dayan Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies at Tel Aviv University. ""At the end, I don't see there's going to be any alternative to a ground operation.""

Any Israeli decision to send tanks and troops into southern Lebanon would mark a major escalation and lead many to categorize the conflict as a war. But the two don't necessarily always go hand in hand.

Israel officially declared war in Gaza nearly three weeks before it sent any ground troops in. Israeli ground forces have been operating in the occupied West Bank for decades, and in recent months have routinely launched airstrikes against militants, without anyone suggesting it's a war.

In a similar vein, Russia sent its forces into Crimea and illegally annexed it in 2014, while also backing a separatist rebellion in eastern Ukraine. But it was only when Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of the country eight years later that it came to be seen internationally as an all-out war.

A limited Israeli ground incursion might still leave room for both sides to back down.

Of course, Lebanon would likely see a ground invasion as a blatant violation of its sovereignty and an act of war. But Beirut already accuses Israel of routinely violating its airspace and of occupying disputed territory along the border.

In fact, the two countries are already officially in a state of war, and have been since 1948.

Israel-Hamas war latest: Israel's air force launches dozens of airstrikes on southern Lebanon,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-f98720a8ba13ea1239c0b8a24522aeb5,2024-09-23T05:05:37Z,"Israel's air force carried out dozens of airstrikes early Monday on southern Lebanon, state media and the Israeli military said.

Residents of different villages in southern Lebanon posted photos on social media that they said showed their towns being struck. The state-run National News Agency also reported airstrikes in different areas.

The Israeli military's Arab-language spokesperson said Israel's air force was attacking targets related to Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group. The spokesman said more details would be released later.

The wave of airstrikes came after a tense day in which Hezbollah fired over 100 rockets into northern Israel, with some landing near the city of Haifa. Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes as well.

Hezbollah's rocket attack came after an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb on Friday killed a top Hezbollah military commander and more than a dozen Hezbollah members, along with dozens of civilians including women and children.

Last week, thousands of communications devices, used mainly by Hezbollah members, exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000. Lebanon blamed the attacks on Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny its responsibility.

Here's the latest:

CANBERRA, Australia -- Australia has announced it will provide an additional 10 million Australian dollars ($6.8 million) in aid to Gaza, bringing the total since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7 last year to AU$82.5 million ($56.2 million).

A government statement said on Monday the new money would focus on women and children. It would be provided through the United Nations Population Fund, a sexual and reproductive health agency, and the U.N. agency responsible for aiding children, UNICEF.

""Australia continues to push for safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian assistance to people in desperate need, and for all aid workers to be protected,"" the statement said.

MUWASI, Gaza Strip -- As the first rain of the cool season starts to fall in the Gaza Strip, displaced Palestinians living in the sprawling Muwasi tent camp are struggling to cope with flooding that is exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.

Some children are entertained by the novelty of walking barefoot in the ankle-deep water, but their parents are less amused. The adults try to save what they can from their family's tents. One mother tries to dry her temporary home with a mop.

""We woke up in the morning to find the tents with rainwater pouring on us, and water from the streets entering on us,"" said Rana Goza't, a displaced person from Gaza City. ""This is the beginning of winter. What will happen in the coming days?""

Suhail Al-Barawi, a displaced person from Beit Lahiya, was helping to build sand barriers to prevent more flooding in the camp.

""People wish for rain,"" he said, ""and we say, 'Oh God, do not give us rain.'""

The nearly yearlong war between Israel and Hamas has displaced 90% of Palestinians in Gaza, according to the United Nations.

Israel's defense minister says recent attacks on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon are a step toward facilitating the return of displaced Israelis to their homes in the north of the country.

Speaking Sunday evening after visiting the military's Northern Command headquarters, Yoav Gallant described the recent air strikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut as ""significant, important and powerful.""

He says Israel will take all necessary measures to ensure ""the safe return of Israel's northern communities to their homes.""

Israeli attacks since Friday have killed dozens in Lebanon, including a veteran Hezbollah commander. Hezbollah responded with more than 100 missile attacks in northern Israel early Sunday, sending hundreds of thousands of Israelis into air raid shelters.

Gallant says: ""The past week has been the most difficult in the history of Hezbollah's existence -- especially over the past day."""
World leaders are gathering in New York for the U.N. General Assembly. The outlook is gloomy,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/un-general-assembly-leaders-conflicts-crises-summit-c8dec645b01be23f67c542666c229d9d,2024-09-22T04:15:06Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Facing a swirl of conflicts and crises across a fragmented world, leaders attending this week's annual U.N. gathering are being challenged: Work together -- not only on front-burner issues but on modernizing the international institutions born after World War II so they can tackle the threats and problems of the future.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued the challenge a year ago after sounding a global alarm about the survival of humanity and the planet: Come to a ""Summit of the Future"" and make a new commitment to multilateralism - the foundation of the United Nations and many other global bodies - and start fixing the aging global architecture to meet the rapidly changing world.

The U.N. chief told reporters last week that the summit ""was born out of a cold, hard fact: international challenges are moving faster than our ability to solve them."" He pointed to ""out-of-control geopolitical divisions"" and ""runaway"" conflicts, climate change, inequalities, debt and new technologies like artificial intelligence which have no guardrails.

The two-day summit starts Sunday, two days before the high-level meeting of world leaders begins at the sprawling U.N. compound in New York City.

Whether it takes even a first step toward the future remains to be seen. There was no final agreement Saturday on its main outcome document - a lengthy pact that requires support from all 193 U.N. member nations to be adopted. Diplomats said Russia and a few others still had objections to the final text.

""Leaders must ask themselves whether this will be yet another meeting where they simply talk about greater cooperation and consensus, or whether they will show the imagination and conviction to actually forge it,"" said Agnès Callamard, the secretary-general of Amnesty International. ""If they miss this opportunity, I shudder to think of the consequences. Our collective future is at stake.""

The summit is the prelude to this year's high-level meeting, held every September. More than 130 presidents, prime ministers and monarchs are slated to speak along with dozens of ministers, and the issues at the summit are expected to dominate their speeches and private meetings, especially the wars in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan and the growing possibility of a wider Mideast war.

""There is going to be a rather obvious gap between the Summit of the Future, with its focus on expanding international cooperation, and the reality that the U.N. is failing in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan,"" said Richard Gowan, U.N. director for the International Crisis Group. ""Those three wars will be top topics of attention for most of the week.""

One notable moment at Tuesday's opening assembly meeting: U.S. President Joe Biden's likely final major appearance on the world stage, a platform he has tread upon and reveled in for decades.

At the upcoming meetings, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told reporters this week: ""The most vulnerable around the world are counting on us to make progress, to make change, to bring about a sense of hope for them.""

To meet the many global challenges, she said, the U.S. focus at the U.N. meetings will be on ending ""the scourge of war."" Roughly 2 billion people live in conflict-affected areas, she said.

Last September, the war in Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, took center stage at the U.N. global gathering. But as the first anniversary of Hamas' deadly attack in southern Israel approaches on Oct. 7, the spotlight is certain to be on the war in Gaza and escalating violence across the Israeli-Lebanon border, which is now threatening to spread to the wider Middle East.

Iran supports both Hamas in Gaza and Lebanon's Hezbollah militants. Its new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, will address world leaders on Tuesday afternoon. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is scheduled to speak Thursday morning and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday afternoon.

Zelenskyy will get the spotlight twice. He will speak Tuesday at a high-level meeting of the U.N. Security Council -- called by the United States, France, Japan, Malta, South Korea and Britain -- and will address the General Assembly on Wednesday morning.

Slovenia, which holds the council's rotating presidency this month, chose the topic ""Leadership for Peace"" for its high-level meeting Wednesday, challenging its 15 member nations to address why the U.N. body charged with maintaining international peace and security is failing -- and how it can do better.

""The event follows our observation that we live in a world of grim statistics, with the highest number of ongoing conflicts, with record high casualties among civilians, among humanitarians, among medical workers, among journalist,"" Slovenian U.N. Ambassador Samuel Zbogar told reporters. He cited a record-high 100 million people driven from their homes by conflict.

""The world is becoming less stable, less peaceful, and with erosion of the respect for the rules, it is sliding into the state of disorder,"" Zbogar said. ""We have not seen this high need to rebuild trust to secure the future ever before.""

A key reason for the Security Council's dysfunction is the deep division among its five veto-wielding permanent members. The United States, Israel's closest ally, is a supporter of Ukraine alongside Britain and France. Russia invaded Ukraine and has a military and economic partnership with China, though Beijing reasserted its longstanding support for every country's sovereignty without criticizing Russia in a recent briefing paper for the U.N. meetings.

French President Emmanuel Macron and Britain's new prime minister, Keir Starmer, will be at the United Nations this week along with Biden. But Russian President Vladimir Putin and China's President Xi Jinping are sending their foreign ministers instead. Neither Putin nor Xi attended last year, either.

Guterres, who will preside over the whole affair this week, warned that the world is seeing ""a multiplication of conflicts and the sense of impunity"" -- a landscape where, he said, ""any country or any military entity, militias, whatever, feel that they can do whatever they want because nothing will happen to them.""

""And the fact that nobody takes even seriously the capacity of the powers to solve problems on the ground,"" he said, ""makes the level of impunity (on) an enormous level.""

"Israel allana y cierra oficina de Al Jazeera en Ramala, Cisjordania",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-606a902022db871f67b3936c53e38b68,2024-09-22T03:50:05Z,"DUBÁI, Emiratos Árabes Unidos (AP) -- Soldados israelíes ingresaron a primera hora del domingo a la oficina de la cadena de noticias satelital Al Jazeera en la Cisjordania ocupada y ordenaron el cierre de operaciones como parte de una campaña más amplia de Israel contra la cadena noticiosa financiada por Qatar mientras realiza su cobertura de la guerra entre Israel y Hamás en la Franja de Gaza.

Al Jazeera transmitió imágenes en directo en su canal en árabe en las que se muestra el momento en que las fuerzas israelíes ordenan el cierre de las oficinas por 45 días. Las acciones se producen como parte de una orden extraordinaria emitida en mayo, la cual llevó a la policía israelí a allanar la sede de Al Jazeera en Jerusalén oriental, incautar su equipo, impedir sus transmisiones en Israel y bloquear sus sitios web.

Es la primera vez que Israel cierra un medio de comunicación extranjero que opera en el país. No obstante, Al Jazeera ha mantenido operaciones en Cisjordania y en la Franja de Gaza, territorios con los que los palestinos esperan contar para la creación de su futuro Estado.

Las fuerzas israelíes no reconocieron de inmediato el cierre de Al Jazeera. El ejército israelí no ha respondido de momento a una solicitud de comentarios de The Associated Press. Al Jazeera denunció la medida mientras seguía transmitiendo en directo desde Amán, capital de la vecina Jordania.

Las fuerzas israelíes ingresaron a las oficinas y le dijeron a un reportero que transmitía en vivo que la cadena permanecerá cerrada por 45 días ordenó que el personal abandonara de inmediato las instalaciones. Al Jazeera transmitió posteriormente imágenes de lo que parecían ser soldados israelíes mientras retiraban una pancarta de un balcón utilizado por la oficina de la cadena. Según Al Jazeera, en la pancarta se observaba la imagen de Shireen Abu Akleh, una periodista palestino-estadounidense que murió baleado por el ejército israelí en mayo de 2022.

La cadena ha informado incesantemente sobre la guerra entre Israel y Hamás desde el ataque transfronterizo inicial perpetrado por Hamás el 7 de octubre y ha mantenido una cobertura de 24 horas en la Franja de Gaza en medio de la fuerte ofensiva terrestre de Israel, la cual ha dejado muertos y heridos entre su personal.

Si bien Al Jazeera transmite reportes in situ sobre las víctimas de la guerra, su su rama en árabe también transmite con frecuencia declaraciones textuales de Hamás y otros grupos milicianos en la región.

Esto ha llevado a funcionarios israelíes, incluido al primer ministro Benjamin Netanyahu, a afirmar que la cadena ha ""puesto en peligro la seguridad de Israel e incitado contra los soldados"". Este señalamiento ha sido negado vehementemente por Al Jazeera, un medio de comunicación financiado principalmente por Qatar, país que ha desempeñado un papel clave en las negociaciones entre Israel y Hamás para alcanzar un cese al fuego que ponga fin a la guerra."
Israel raids and shuts down Al Jazeera's bureau in Ramallah in the West Bank,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-al-jazeera-gaza-war-hamas-4abdb2969e39e7ad99dfbf9caa7bb32c,2024-09-22T02:18:26Z,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Israeli troops raided the offices of the satellite news network Al Jazeera in the Israeli-occupied West Bank early Sunday, ordering the bureau to shut down amid a widening campaign by Israel targeting the Qatar-funded broadcaster as it covers the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.

Al Jazeera aired footage of Israeli troops live on its Arabic-language channel ordering the office to be shut for 45 days. It follows an extraordinary order issued in July that saw Israeli police raid Al Jazeera's broadcast position in East Jerusalem, seizing equipment there, preventing its broadcasts in Israel and blocking its websites.

The move marked the first time Israel has ever shuttered a foreign news outlet operating in the country. However, Al Jazeera has continued operating in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, territories that the Palestinians hope to have for their future state.

There was no immediate acknowledgement of the shutdown by Israeli forces. Israeli troops entered the office and told a reporter live on air it would be shut for 45 days, saying that staff needed to leave immediately.

The network has reported on the Israeli-Hamas war nonstop since the militants' initial cross-border attack on Oct. 7 and has maintained 24-hour coverage in the Gaza Strip amid Israel's grinding ground offensive that has killed and wounded members of its staff.

While including on-the-ground reporting of the war's casualties, its Arabic arm often publishes verbatim video statements from Hamas and other regional militant groups.

That has led to Israeli claims by officials up to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the network has ""harmed Israel's security and incited against soldiers."" Those claims have been vehemently denied by Al Jazeera, whose main funder, Qatar, has been key in negotiations between Israel and Hamas to reach a cease-fire to end the war."
Secret Service's next challenge: Keeping scores of world leaders safe at the UN General Assembly,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-security-unga-secret-service-new-york-0fdc166c4718f856ad74214e56138e78,2024-09-21T17:55:30Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Below United Nations headquarters, a state-of-the-art security post dubbed the ""Brain Center"" hums with activity on the eve of next week's high-level meeting of the U.N. General Assembly. The annual diplomatic pilgrimage is bringing more than 140 world leaders to New York City, including the heads of Israel, Palestine and Ukraine.

Keeping them safe is the U.S. Secret Service's next big challenge.

The agency, under a cloud after a July assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, is confident in its multi-layer, multi-agency plan to protect the U.N. General Assembly, which is deemed a Super Bowl-level National Special Security Event.

The plan -- developed with New York City police and the U.N. Security and Safety Service, among other agencies -- includes not just motorcades and protective details, but NYPD helicopters and patrol boats, a dozen U.N. security K-9 teams sweeping for explosives, road closures and traffic diversions. The Secret Service is bringing in agents from posts around the world for the event. The Coast Guard is restricting East River access near the U.N. and the Federal Aviation Administration is closing airspace.

With so many presidents, prime ministers, monarchs and others dignitaries in one city and under one roof at the same time, the U.N. General Assembly is actually bigger than the Super Bowl. It's the most complex event the Secret Service is involved in each year.

This year, it's coming during a especially busy stretch highlighted by the Republican and Democratic conventions and the final weeks of the presidential campaign. Speaking Monday after the Secret Service thwarted another apparent assassination attempt on Trump in Florida, Acting Director Ronald L. Rowe Jr. said employees were ""redlining"" like an engine pushed to its limit. But, he said, ""they are rising to this moment"" and meeting the challenges.

""The operational tempo is incredibly high,"" said Patrick Freaney, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service's New York field office.

The Associated Press got a rare look inside security preparations for the U.N. General Assembly, known as UNGA, including the ""Brain Center"" and a joint operations center that lets the Secret Service, NYPD and other agencies communicate instantly to root out threats and logistical snags. They're also coordinating with the foreign security services that protect each of the dignitaries.

Freaney said the National Special Security Event designation -- for special events of national significance -- smooths the way for interagency planning, communication and cooperation. The Secret Service is in charge, but the NYPD's robust counterterrorism and other operations, and the U.N.'s 300-person Security and Safety Service, play pivotal roles.

""We have over 140 heads of state, heads of government that we're moving around the city,"" Freaney said during a tour of the joint operations center, which has space for 10 local and federal agencies, including the FBI and Federal Emergency Management Agency and the State and Defense departments.

""One of the most important things is bringing all of them in here and then departing safely,"" Freaney said. ""Think about that logistically -- bringing 140 motorcades into one area all at the same time. This plays an integral part of bringing those details in safely.""

The Secret Service, NYPD and State Department will also be operating their own command centers -- in Brooklyn, at One Police Plaza in Manhattan and at a nearby hotel ballroom. The NYPD, the nation's largest police force, has its Joint Operations Center equipped to give officers real-time feeds from security, drone and helicopter-mounted cameras, along with other critical information.

The U.N. Security and Safety Service, which is in charge of keeping the U.N. headquarters campus secure, has its command post in the ""Brain Center.""

Down a basement hall from the main hub of U.N. activity, wall-to-wall monitors show live feeds from dozens of the 1,400 security cameras on the 18-acre (7.2-hectare) headquarters campus. All are recorded and can be reviewed instantly. Automated voices alert potential breaches and emergencies. Computers generate real-time data and photos for each of upwards of 22,000 people who pass through security checkpoints per day. Fire alarms tie directly into the city's central dispatch system for immediate response.

The command post is staffed around the clock by U.N. security officers who work in 12-hour shifts while world leaders are in town. The goal, Inspector Malinda McCormack said, is to receive, analyze and quickly disseminate information.

Security plans for UNGA started to take shape a few months ago. The Secret Service and its partner agencies use past gatherings -- this is the 79th edition -- as a blueprint, while making adjustments for changing world events such as the wars in Gaza and Ukraine.

""There's an incredible trust,"" said Michael Browne, chief of the U.N. Security and Safety Service. ""There's incredible sense of collegiality and collaboration, which I think is a key ingredient for success in a very complex and challenging operation such as UNGA.""

As of Friday, authorities said, there were no specific or credible threats to the event.

But, Rebecca Weiner, the NYPD's deputy commissioner for intelligence and counterterrorism, acknowledged ""the chaoticness, the diversity and the unpredictable nature of the threat environment"" requires law enforcement to be nimble and anticipate all the many ways someone could seek to cause harm.

""These are very different times,"" Weiner said.

World leaders are meeting at the UNGA for the first time since Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, triggered an Israeli offensive in Gaza that has killed tens of thousands of people. NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell said Friday that the department has tallied more than 4,000 protests over the war, with more anticipated next week.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas are both expected at UNGA. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is also expected to return, but not Russian President Vladimir Putin.

While the fighting is an ocean away, authorities are ""thinking about what's happening overseas in these home countries and what we can anticipate here,"" Weiner said.

""The whole purpose of this assembly is bringing countries together,"" she added. ""The whole purpose of our security posture is making sure we're doing the same."""

The strikes are part of a new cycle of escalation between the enemies that has raised fears of a full-out war erupting in the Middle East, particularly after two separate attacks in Lebanon in which communication devices exploded simultaneously around the country, reportedly killing 37 people and injuring more than 3,400 others.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire regularly since Hamas' Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel ignited the Israeli military's devastating offensive in Gaza.

Gaza's Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory during the nearly 1-year-old Israel-Hamas war. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.

Here's the latest:

BEIRUT -- The death toll from an Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb has risen to 31, including seven women and three children, Lebanon's health minister said Saturday.

Firass Abiad told reporters that 68 people were also wounded in Friday's airstrike, of whom 15 remain in hospital, in the deadliest Israeli strike on Beirut since the Israel-Hezbollah war in the summer of 2006.

Among the dead was Ibrahim Akil, a Hezbollah commander who was in charge of the group's elite Radwan Forces, and about a dozen members of the militant group who were meeting in the basement of the building that was destroyed.

Israel launched the rare airstrike in the densely populated southern Beirut neighborhood on Friday afternoon during the rush hour when people were returning home from work and students were leaving schools.

On Saturday morning, Hezbollah's media office took journalists to the site of the airstrike where workers were still digging through the rubble.

Lebanese troops cordoned off the area around the building that was destroyed as members of the Lebanese Red Cross stood nearby to take any recovered bodies from under the rubble.

UNITED NATIONS -- Weaponizing ordinary communication devices represents a new development in warfare, and targeting thousands of Lebanese people using pagers, two-way radios and electronic equipment without their knowledge is a violation of international human rights law, the United Nations human rights chief said Friday.

Volker Türk told an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council there must be an independent and transparent investigation of the two attacks in Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday where these devices exploded, reportedly killing 37 people and injuring more than 3,400 others.

""Those who ordered and carried out these attacks must be held to account,"" he said.

Lebanon has blamed Israel for the attacks, which appeared to target Hezbollah militants but also saw many civilian casualties, including children. Hezbollah has fought many conflicts with Israel, including a war in 2006, and it has conducted near-daily strikes against Israel to support Hamas militants who attacked Israel on Oct. 7.

When reporters asked Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon about speculation Israel was behind the two explosions, he said: ""We are not commenting."""

""We are not commenting on the specific attacks you mentioned, but I can tell you that we will do everything we can to target those terrorists to minimize casualties for civilians,"" he replied.

Lebanon's Foreign Minister Abdallah Bouhabib accused Israel of terrorizing the entire Lebanese population on streets, in markets, shops and their homes where their communications devices exploded.

He held up a photo of a mangled and bloodied hand, telling ambassadors from the 15 council nations: ""Look at the ugliness of what has happened in this picture.""

Bouhabib insisted that Israel not only launched the attacks but told the council there were ""official declarations"" and a tweet by an adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""that was lately deleted, emphasizing the responsibility of Israel and praising the positive results of this assault.""

He appeared to be referring to a deleted tweet by Netanyahu adviser Topaz Luke, who reportedly retweeted a post that included a reply indicating that Israel was behind the attacks in Lebanon and neighboring Syria.

Israel's Danon criticized the Lebanese minister for never mentioning Hezbollah and said the Lebanese people are ""trapped in the grip of this terrorist organization.""

Lebanon's Bouhabib warned the council that if it doesn't condemn the week's deadly explosions and name Israel as the perpetrator, a ""Pandora's Box"" will be opened, and governments and extremists will target, terrorize and kill civilians with similar communications devices on trains, planes and elsewhere.

Türk, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said the explosions not only violated international human rights law but also appear to violate international humanitarian law's key principles in carrying out attacks: distinction between civilians and combatants, proportionality, and precautions.

International law also prohibits the use of booby-trap devices that look harmless, he said, and ""it is a war crime to commit violence intended to spread terror among civilians.""

""Let me be clear -- this method of warfare may be new and unfamiliar,"" Türk said, ""but international humanitarian and human rights law apply regardless and must be upheld.""

Israel's Danon blamed Iran and its ""puppet"" Hezbollah for the military action across the Lebanon-Israel border.

""While Israel is not seeking a wider conflict, let me be clear: We will not allow Hezbollah to continue its provocations,"" he said. Israel will do ""whatever it takes"" to return its 60,000 citizens who fled their homes in the north because of attacks, ""and we will not allow Hezbollah's terror to dictate the future of our nation.""

Iran's U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani countered that ""Israel bears full responsibility for the perpetration of such horrific crimes,"" and said his government will pursue accountability for the attack on the country's ambassador to Lebanon, whose eyes were injured in the explosions Tuesday.

He said the gravity of the attacks against the Lebanese people must also be seen as ""a threat to peace and security across the region."" He added that ""the international community must not ignore the role the Western countries, in particular the United States and U.K., play in enabling Israel's aggressions.""

U.N. political chief Rosemary DiCarlo warned the council that the explosions along with more than 11 months of bloodshed in Gaza, and near-daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border, pose a grave risk to security and stability in the region.

She urged all actors to exercise maximum restraint, and she strongly urged countries with influence on the parties ""to leverage it now.""

Earlier, U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric urged Israel and Hezbollah to immediately return to the cessation of hostilities that existed before Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel and Israel's responding military campaign in Gaza, warning that ""the region is on the brink of a catastrophe"" and a diplomatic solution should be pursued urgently."
Did Middle East device attack violate international law? Advocates want an investigation,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-geneva-conventions-1d0044e23cdb902036884e66e8fea086,2024-09-20T19:15:29Z,"GENEVA (AP) -- Human rights advocates are calling for an independent investigation into the deadly explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies in Lebanon and Syria, suggesting the blasts may have violated international law if the devices were fashioned as booby traps.

The explosions that have been widely blamed on Israel killed at least 37 people and wounded more than 3,000, including many members of the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah. Israel has not confirmed or denied involvement.

The United Nations human rights office and some advocacy groups have cried foul, arguing that the strikes were ""indiscriminate"" because it's nearly impossible to know who was holding the devices, or where they were, when they went off. But some academics insist the explosions were precisely focused because the devices had been distributed to Hezbollah members.

The International Committee of the Red Cross, which aims to help protect civilians and other noncombatants in conflict and aims to stay neutral, said: ""This was a unique operation, and it will take time to have all the facts to establish a legal opinion.""

The committee declined to comment publicly about whether the operation violated international humanitarian law, which is difficult to enforce and sometimes flouted by countries.

International law has never addressed the targeting of communication devices that people carry on their bodies. The Geneva Conventions, which provide a rule book for the protection of civilians during conflict, were adopted 75 years ago, long before pagers, mobile phones and walkie-talkies were in widespread public use. The legal situation is further complicated by the fact that Hezbollah is an armed nonstate group acting inside Lebanon, a sovereign member of the U.N.

""There must be an independent, thorough and transparent investigation as to the circumstances of these mass explosions, and those who ordered and carried out such an attack must be held to account,"" the U.N. human rights chief, Volker Türk, said in a statement.

The question of how to apply international rules to the attack seems to center mostly on whether a secret explosive embedded in a personal electronic device might be considered a booby trap. Israel has been blamed for targeted strikes and assassinations in the past, but a large strike using mobile communication devices is virtually unheard of.

A booby trap is defined as ""any device designed or adapted to kill or injure, and which functions unexpectedly when a person disturbs or approaches an apparently harmless object,"" according to Article 7 of a 1996 adaptation of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, which Israel has adopted.

The protocol prohibits booby traps ""or other devices in the form of apparently harmless portable objects which are specifically designed and constructed to contain explosive material.""

Lama Fakih, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said the rules were designed to protect civilians and avoid ""the devastating scenes that continue to unfold across Lebanon today."" She too called for an impartial investigation.

The convention also sets rules for the use of land mines, remnants of cluster bombs and other explosives. It bars use of other ""manually emplaced munitions,"" such as improvised explosive devices that ""are designed to kill or injure, and which are actuated manually, by remote control or automatically after a lapse of time.""

The pagers were used by members of Hezbollah, but there was no guarantee that the members would be holding the devices when they went off. Many of the casualties were among members of Hezbollah's extensive civilian operations mainly serving Lebanon's Shiite community.

Laurie Blank, a professor at Emory Law School in Atlanta who specializes in international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict, said the law of war doesn't prohibit use of booby traps outright, but places limits on them. She said she believed the attack was ""most likely lawful under international law.""

She said booby traps can be used to target enemy forces in or near a military objective, including the communication systems used by Hezbollah fighters.

""That said, it's not clear that this is a booby-trap scenario. For example, if the attack is attacking the pagers themselves, then it's not an issue of booby-trapping,"" Blank wrote in an email.

Experts said the pager explosions suggested a long-planned and carefully crafted operation, possibly carried out by infiltrating the supply chain and rigging the devices with explosives before they were delivered to Lebanon.

""There is no world in which the explosion of hundreds, if not thousands, of pagers is not an indiscriminate attack prohibited by international law,"" Mai El-Sadany, who heads the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, a Washington-based think tank, wrote on X.

""The pager holders were scattered across civilian areas, from shopping malls to crowded streets and apartment buildings to hospitals, surrounded by women, children and men,"" she told The Associated Press. ""An attack like this cannot anticipate what innocent passerby is in the impact area or what carefree child picks up the pager when it beeps.""

British lawyer Geoffrey Nice, who prosecuted former Yugoslav and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, said in an interview: ""It's pretty obvious here it's a war crime. And we should call it out for what it is.""

But he noted criminal conduct on both sides of the Israel-Hamas conflict, alluding to rocket strikes by Hamas militants on Israel and casualties caused by Israel's military operation in Gaza, where the Health Ministry says at least 41,000 people have been killed since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel that triggered the latest war.

Amos Guiora, a professor at the S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah, said the strikes were ""justified in the context of self-defense,"" but he acknowledged the risks of collateral damage against civilians.

""International law does not articulate a number as to what is legitimate or illegitimate collateral damage, it's just to 'minimize.' The tragic reality of collateral damage is that innocent people will be harmed and killed,"" he said. ""I do have a sense on this one that there was a conscious effort to minimize it -- with the understanding it will be never perfect.""

""This particular attack strikes me -- whoever did it -- is as pinpointed as pinpointed can be,"" said Guiora, who spent 20 years in the Israeli military and advised its commanders in Gaza in the 1990s.

Israel has already faced heavy international criticism over its military response in Gaza and, more recently, in the West Bank since the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas.

Back in May, the top prosecutor at the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for top Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as Hamas leaders behind the attacks, over their actions in the war.

Israel ignored an order from the U.N.'s top court to halt its military offensive in southern Gaza after South Africa accused Israel of genocide. Russia, too, has ignored the court's call for it to end its invasion of Ukraine.

Hamas has also been investigated. Human Rights Watch released a report in July that concluded Hamas-led armed groups committed numerous war crimes during the attacks in Israel.

Hezbollah has been linked to numerous indiscriminate attacks on civilians over the years, including in Argentina, Bulgaria and, of course, Israel.

"Biden opens busy foreign policy stretch as anxious allies shift gaze to Trump, Harris",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/biden-quad-summit-modi-albanese-kishida-delaware-trump-kamala-harris-441f74e9f0442e08f1ca40689980a892,2024-09-20T18:23:40Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden is opening a busy stretch Friday tending to international allies anxious about where U.S. foreign policy is headed when he leaves office in four month, most likely leaving behind a difficult set of crises for former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris to contend with.

But even as Biden launches into a week of talks with world leaders that will take place in Delaware, the White House and at the United Nations, global attention has begun drifting toward Trump and Harris, who are offering voters -- and the world -- sharply diverging views on foreign policy.

""The more I talk to people around the world, the more I get a sense of profound anxiety about the shape of the U.S. election,"" said Jon Alterman, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

Alterman added that Biden's upcoming engagements with world leaders could seem like ""a sideshow"" as much of the world focuses on Harris and Trump.

Biden kicks off his spurt of diplomacy on Friday when he hosts Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for talks at his home near Wilmington, Delaware.

After Albanese, the president will hold one-on-one talks at his house on Saturday with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. They're all visiting the president's hometown for a meeting of the Indo-Pacific group known as the Quad.

The four leaders will get together for a joint meeting on Saturday, and Biden will hold a dinner for them at the high school he attend more than 60 years ago.

Biden will then welcome United Arab Emirates' President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to the White House on Monday for talks before setting off for three days at the U.N. General Assembly, where the wars in Gaza and Ukraine are expected to dominate the agenda and be at the heart of Biden's Tuesday address to the assembly.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will come to Washington on Thursday for talks with Biden. And more leader meetings on the sidelines of the U.N. are expected to be added to the president's schedule.

All the while, world leaders are beginning to seek audiences with Harris and Trump as they try to get a better understanding of what comes next.

Trump said this week that he plans to meet with Modi during the Indian leader's U.S. visit for the U.N. gathering and Quad summit.

The former president, speaking at a campaign rally, called Modi ""fantastic"" even as he grumbled that India had become a ""very big abuser"" in its trade relationship with the United States.

Trump said he will also ""probably"" meet with Zelenskyy next week. The two last spoke by phone in July and last met in person on the sidelines of the 2019 U.N. General Assembly.

That face-to-face meeting happened about two months after a phone call in which Trump called on Zelenskyy to investigate Biden's actions in Ukraine when he was vice president during the Obama administration. It was the call that led to Trump's first impeachment.

The Ukrainians have informed the White House that they are arranging a meeting with Trump, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to comment publicly.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether it was informed by the Indian government or Trump about the planned Modi visit with the GOP nominee.

Zelenskyy will also meet with Harris on Thursday, separately from Biden's sitdown, the White House said. Harris last met Zelenskyy on the sidelines of an international gathering in Switzerland in July, days before Biden abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed her candidacy.

The White House said that Harris would also hold her own meeting on Monday with UAE president.

Biden in his final months in office is trying to manage a set of foreign policy crises that could still worsen and complicate his legacy.

White House-led efforts to win a cease-fire and hostage deal in the nearly year-old Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza have stalled. The conflict is now in danger of spiraling into a full-blown regional war as tensions rise on the Israel-Lebanon border.

Those tensions heightened after Israel on Friday carried out targeted air strikes near Beirut.

The action followed two waves of deadly attacks earlier this week in which hundreds of hand-held pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah militants exploded. The sophisticated sabotage operations are widely believed to have been carried out by Israel. The operations killed dozens and wounded hundreds.

The air strikes and audacious electronic device attacks are raising questions about whether Biden's influence with Israel is waning, a notion that the White House disputes.

A day before Tuesday's first wave of attacks, senior White House official Amos Hochstein visited Israel and warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials against taking action that could intensify the conflict.

Asked if getting a hostage deal may be slipping out of reach in the final months of his presidency, Biden told reporters Friday he still had hope and that his national security team continues to work to get a deal completed.

""If I ever said it wasn't realistic, we might as well leave,"" Biden said. ""A lot of things don't look realistic until we get them done. We have to keep at it.""

Meanwhile, Ukraine is pressing Biden to allow the use of Western provided long-range weapons to strike deeper into Russia. It's a move that President Vladimir Putin has warned would mean that the U.S. and European countries are at war with Russia.

Harris, if elected, is expected to take a similar approach to foreign policy as Biden.

Since jumping into the presidential race, Harris has pitched herself as a critical member of Biden's foreign policy team, deeply engaged with the administration's response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Hamas' invasion of Israel and helping the president bolster ties in the Pacific.

At the same time, Harris has called out Trump for being too cozy with authoritarian leaders during his four years in the White House.

During this month's presidential debate, Harris told Trump that Putin ""would eat you for lunch"" and noted Trump had exchanged ""love letters"" with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and generally ""admires dictators.""

""It is absolutely well known that these dictators and autocrats are rooting for you to be president again, because they're so clear they can manipulate you with flattery and favors,"" Harris previously told Trump.

For his part, Trump has claimed that Harris is not capable as a negotiator, ""hates Israel,"" and shares responsibility for the Biden administration's ""embarrassing"" troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Biden's plans for the weekend's summit show he is trying to bring a personal touch to the gathering, welcoming leaders for talks at his private residence and hosting Saturday night's dinner at his high school alma mater, Archmere Academy, in Claymont, Delaware.

The White House said the leaders would also roll out an announcement related to Biden's Cancer Moonshot Initiative, a long-running passion project of the president and his wife aimed at reducing cancer deaths. The Bidens' son Beau died in 2015 at the age 46 of brain cancer.

White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that the summit was designed to have a more intimate feel.

""He wanted to have a private moment with them, to continue to grow those relationships,"" Jean-Pierre said. ""That's what this is about."""
Hezbollah azota el norte de Israel con 140 cohetes; no se reportan heridos,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-743b277e32d09199f5f38949f49307f1,2024-09-20T13:09:42Z,"JERUSALÉN (AP) -- Hezbollah azotó el norte de Israel con 140 cohetes el viernes, un día después de que el dirigente del grupo miliciano, Hassan Nasrallah, prometió tomar represalias contra Israel por unas explosiones masivas, informaron las fuerzas militares israelíes y el grupo rebelde libanés.

Las fuerzas militares israelíes señalaron que los cohetes llegaron en tres oleadas el viernes por la tarde, impactando sitios a lo largo de la devastada frontera con el Líbano.

Después de los ataques, las fuerzas militares israelíes señalaron que habían impactado zonas en el sur del Líbano, teniendo como objetivo infraestructura de Hezbollah, pero no dio detalles sobre los daños.

Hezbollah dijo que sus ataques habían impactado varios sitios a lo largo de la frontera con cohetes Katyusha, incluidas varias bases de defensa aérea así como el cuartel general de una brigada blindada israelí que dijeron haber atacado por primera vez.

Las fuerzas militares israelíes señalaron que se lanzaron 120 misiles contra zonas de las Alturas del Golán, de Safed y del norte de Galilea, algunos de los cuales fueron interceptados. Los equipos de bomberos trabajaban para extinguir los incendios provocados por fragmentos de los misiles que cayeron en varias áreas, según las fuerzas militares.

No dijeron si algún misil había alcanzado objetivos o causado víctimas.

Otros 20 misiles fueron lanzados contra las zonas de Merón y de Netu'a y la mayoría cayeron en espacios abiertos, dijeron las fuerzas militares y añadieron que no se habían reportado heridos.

Hezbollah señaló que los cohetes fueron en represalia de los ataques israelíes contra localidades y viviendas del sur del Líbano, no por los dos días de ataques que fueron ampliamente atribuidos a Israel, en los que explotaron miles de bíperes y walkie-talkies de Hezbollah.

Hezbollah e Israel han estado intercambiando ataques casi a diario desde el 8 de octubre, un día después del atentado de Hamás en el sur de Israel que desencadenó la guerra en la Franja de Gaza. Sin embargo, la andanada de cohetes del viernes fue más intensa de lo normal.

Israel-Hamas war latest: 15 killed overnight in Gaza in multiple attacks,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-latest-20-september-2024-03ffd81ceb3afc8737fbfbb2c89413ef,2024-09-20T11:38:26Z,"Palestinian authorities say 15 people were killed overnight in the Gaza Strip in multiple Israeli attacks.

An airstrike early Friday morning in Gaza City hit a family home, killing six people including an unknown number of children, Gaza's Civil Defense said. Another person was killed in Gaza City when a strike hit a group of people on a street.

Israel maintains it only targets militants and accuses Hamas and other armed groups of endangering civilians by operating in residential areas. The military, which rarely comments on individual strikes, had no immediate comment.

Gaza's Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children.

Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.

Meanwhile, the leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah is promising to retaliate for deadly attacks on its communication devices after Israel's defense minister announced a ""new phase"" of the war. Fears are increasing that 11 months of exchanges of fire between the two sides will escalate into all-out war.

Hezbollah began striking Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that sparked the Israel-Hamas war. They have come close to a full-blown war on several occasions.

Here's the latest:

Palestinian authorities say 15 people were killed overnight in the Gaza Strip in multiple Israeli attacks.

An airstrike early Friday morning in Gaza City hit a family home, killing six people including an unknown number of children, Gaza's Civil Defense said. Another person was killed in Gaza City when a strike hit a group of people on a street.

In Beit Hanoun, north of Gaza City, another person was killed and several others injured when a vehicle was hit by an Israeli strike, the Civil Defense said.

Late Thursday, six more people were killed in a strike that hit a home in the center of Gaza City, while another was killed in Beit Lahya, north of Gaza City.

Israel maintains it only targets militants and accuses Hamas and other armed groups of endangering civilians by operating in residential areas. The military, which rarely comments on individual strikes, had no immediate comment.

The war has caused vast destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million.

BAGHDAD -- A leader of an Iranian-backed Iraqi militia was killed Friday in a strike in Syria, a war monitor and a militia official said.

The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that a leader in Iraq's Kataeb Hezbollah group -- which is different from the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah -- was killed and another person injured in a drone strike on the car they were traveling in on the road to the Damascus airport.

An official with an Iraqi militia confirmed that a car carrying a group of militia members was struck in Damascus, killing one person and injuring three others. He declined to say which militia those targeted belonged to. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.

There was no comment from Israeli officials on the strike. Israel frequently strikes Iranian and Iran-linked groups in Syria but rarely acknowledges the strikes.

Tensions have heightened in the region following a wave of apparently remotely detonated explosions in Lebanon targeting pagers and walkie talkies belonging to the Lebanese Hezbollah. The attacks, widely blamed on Israel, which has not commented on them, killed at least 37 people - including two children - and wounded about 3,000.

BEIRUT -- Israel's military killed two Hezbollah members who were planting explosives along the border over the weekend, Israel's military and an official with a Lebanese group said.

The official with a Lebanese group said the two members of the militant group were killed Sunday and their bodies were taken by Israeli troops because they were too close to the fence along the tense frontier. The official spoke Friday on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.

On Thursday, Israel's military released a video it said was taken by one of the fighters showing the militants coming under fire. The military said that the two fighters were killed by Israeli troops as they tried to plant an improvised explosive device near a military post.

In the days following the tense border interaction, thousands of devices exploded in different parts of Lebanon and Syria, killing 37 people and wounding around 3,000 others. The attack was blamed on Israel, and many of those killed or injured were members of Hezbollah.

Thousands of exploding devices in Lebanon trigger a nation that has been on edge for years,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-pagers-hezbollahexplosion-israel-beirut-port-6c51ff6c743ba63154b95790357d31df,2024-09-20T04:47:58Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Chris Knayzeh was in a town overlooking Lebanon's capital when he heard the rumbling aftershock of the 2020 Beirut port blast. Hundreds of tons of haphazardly stored ammonium nitrates had exploded, killing and injuring thousands of people.

Already struggling with the country's economic collapse, the sight of the gigantic mushroom cloud unleashed by the blast was the last straw. Like many other Lebanese, he quit his job and booked a one-way ticket out of Lebanon.

Knayzeh was in Lebanon visiting when news broke Tuesday that hundreds of handheld pagers had exploded across the country, killing 12, injuring thousands and setting off fires. Israel, local news reports said, was targeting the devices of the militant Hezbollah group. Stuck in Beirut traffic, Knayzeh started panicking that drivers around him could potentially be carrying devices that would explode.

Within minutes, hospitals were flooded with patients, bringing back painful reminders of the port blast four years ago that killed more than 200 people and injured more than 6,000, leaving enduring mental and psychological scars for those who lived through it.

In total, the explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies over two days killed at least 37 people and injured more than 3,000. Israel is widely believed to be behind the blasts, although it has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility.

""The country's state is unreal,"" Knayzeh told The Associated Press.

The port blast was one of the biggest non-nuclear explosions ever recorded, and it came on top of a historic economic meltdown, financial collapse and a feeling of helplessness after nationwide protests against corruption that failed to achieve their goals. It compounded years of crises that have upended the lives of people in this small country.

Four years after the port catastrophe, an investigation has run aground. The ravaged Mediterranean port remains untouched, its towering silos standing broken and shredded as a symbol of a country in ruins. Political divisions and paralysis have left the country without a president or functioning government for more than two years. Poverty is on the rise.

On top of that and in parallel with Israel's war in Gaza, Lebanon has been on the brink of all-out war with Israel for the past year, with Israel and Hezbollah trading fire and Israeli warplanes breaking the sound barrier over Beirut almost daily, terrorizing people in their homes and offices.

""I can't believe this is happening again. How many more disasters must we endure?"" said Jocelyn Hallak, a mother of three, two of whom now work abroad and the third headed out after graduation next year. ""All this pain, when will it end?""

A full-blown war with Israel could be devastating for Lebanon. The country's crisis-battered health care system had been preparing for the possibility of conflict with Israel even before hospitals became inundated with the wounded from the latest explosions, many of them in critical condition and requiring extended hospital stays.

Still, Knayzeh, now a lecturer at a university in France, can't stay away. He returns regularly to see his girlfriend and family. He flinches whenever he hears construction work and other sudden loud sounds. When in France, surrounded by normalcy, he agonizes over family at home while following the ongoing clashes from afar.

""It's the attachment to our country I guess, or at the very least attachment to our loved ones who couldn't leave with us,"" he said.

This summer, tens of thousands of Lebanese expatriates came to visit family and friends despite the tensions. Their remittances and money they spend during the holidays help keep the country afloat and in some cases are the main source of income for families. Many, however, cut their vacations short in chaotic airport scenes, fearing major escalation after the dual assassinations of Hezbollah and Hamas commanders in Beirut and Tehran last month, blamed on Israel.

Even in a country that has vaulted from one crisis to another for decades, the level of confusion, insecurity and anger is reaching new heights. Many thought the port blast was the most surreal and frightening thing they would ever experience -- until thousands of pagers exploded in people's hands and pockets across the country this week.

''I saw horrific things that day,"" said Mohammad al-Mousawi, who was running an errand in Beirut's southern suburb, where Hezbollah has a strong presence, when the pagers began blowing up.

""Suddenly, we started seeing scooters whizzing by carrying defaced men, some without fingers, some with their guts spilling out. Then the ambulances started coming.""

It reminded him of the 2020 port blast, he said. ""The number of injuries and ambulances was unbelievable. ""

""One more horror shaping our collective existence,"" wrote Maha Yahya, the Beirut-based director of the Malcolm H. Kerr Carnegie Middle East Center.

""The shock, the disarray, the trauma is reminiscent of Beirut after the port explosion. Only this time it was not limited to a city but spread across the country,"" she said in a social media post.

In the aftermath of the exploding pagers, fear and paranoia has taken hold. Parents kept their children away from schools and universities, fearing more exploding devices. Organizations including the Lebanese civil defense advised personnel to switch off their devices and remove all batteries until further notice. One woman said she disconnected her baby monitor and other household appliances.

Lebanon's civil aviation authorities have banned the transporting of pagers and walkie-talkies on all airplanes departing from Beirut's Rafik Hariri International Airport ""until further notice."" Some residents were sleeping with their phones in another room.

In the southern city of Tyre, ahead of a speech by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, city resident Hassan Hajo acknowledged feeling ""a bit depressed"" after the pager blasts, a major security breach for a secretive organization like Hezbollah. He was hoping to get a boost from Nasrallah's speech. ""We have been through worse before and we got through it,"" he said.

In his speech, Nasrallah vowed to retaliate against Israel for the attacks on devices, while Israel and Hezbollah traded heavy fire across the border. Israel stepped up warnings of a potential larger military operation targeting the group.

Another resident, Marwan Mahfouz, said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been threatening Lebanon with war for the past year and he should just do it.

""If we are going to die, we'll die. We are already dying. We are already dead,"" he said.

Voters split on whether Harris or Trump would do a better job on the economy: AP-NORC poll,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-economy-poll-inflation-dc80ac9e5d7da42900762910d5f0a283,2024-09-20T04:04:19Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Going into November's election, neither Kamala Harris nor Donald Trump has a decisive edge with the public on the economy, turning an issue that was once a clear strength for Trump into the equivalent of a political jump ball.

About 4 in 10 registered voters say Republican Trump would do a better job handling the economy, while a similar number say that about the Democratic vice president, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. About 1 in 10 voters don't trust either candidate, and a similar share has equal faith in them.

The finding is a warning sign for Trump, who has tried to link Harris to President Joe Biden's economic track record. The new poll suggests that Harris may be escaping some of the president's baggage on the issue, undercutting what was previously one of Trump's major advantages.

The economy has long been a weak issue for Biden: A separate AP-NORC poll conducted in late June, before Biden's disastrous debate with Trump, found that about 6 in 10 Americans disapproved of his handling of the economy. Earlier this year, Americans were much more likely to say that Trump's presidency helped the country on cost of living and job creation, compared to Biden's.

The new poll found that the economy is one of the most important issues for about 8 in 10 voters as they consider which candidate to support, dwarfing other top issues like health care and crime.

The aftermath of inflation's spike in 2022 to a four-decade high has pervaded this year's presidential contest. Shoppers are upset over their grocery bills. Higher interest rates are financially squeezing the buyers of homes and motor vehicles. All that has appeared to matter more to the public than the low 4.2% unemployment rate and stock market gains.

According to the AP-NORC poll, only about one-third of voters say the state of the national economy is somewhat or very good, although they're more optimistic about their own situation, with about 6 in 10 voters saying their household's finances are somewhat or very good. Both of those numbers have remained steady over the course of the year, despite falling inflation.

The candidates have clashing ideas about how best to straighten out the economy, giving voters a stark choice that might hint at how partisan identity increasingly informs views of the economy and policy. But neither campaign has fully explained how its plans would be implemented. Harris insists her plans would be fully funded and not add to the deficit, while Trump's team assumes -- in defiance of most economic models -- that growth will be high enough to offset the cost.

Mark Carlough, 33, who works on medical records in Philadelphia, plans to vote for Harris and says he believes that the taxes on imports proposed by Trump would hurt most consumers.

""The tariffs would be horrible for the economy,"" he said.

Richard Tunnell, 32, of Huntsville, Texas, plans to vote for Trump, just as he did in 2020. He's not sure if the Republican has an advantage over Harris on the economy, but he noted that Trump has been a great businessman who remains one of the ""richest men on the planet"" even after filing for bankruptcy multiple times.

""I believe this country needs someone to reach their hand in it and work it like a game of Monopoly and that person is Donald Trump,"" said Tunnell, a military veteran on disability.

Chantelle Breaux, 38, a stay-at-home parent from Lafayette, Louisiana, feels neither candidate has much to offer on the economy. She doesn't plan to vote -- unless a candidate more to her liking enters the race.

""Kamala wants to put a Band-Aid where major surgery needs to be done on this economy,"" said Breaux. ""Trump wants to run the country as if it's a business, but it isn't a business that is going to support all of the people.""

Former President Trump suggests growth would come from tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy leading to more investment, while a universal tariff of as much as 20% would direct that investment to building U.S. factories.

Harris has campaigned on more benefits for the middle class to be funded by higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy, saying that would help to contain costs and deliver growth. Her team has warned that Trump's tariffs would lead to higher prices and worsen underlying inflation challenges.

The economy is one of many issues shaping public sentiment as the campaigns seek to turn out their voters. More than half of voters said health care was a top concern, while roughly half said that about crime, immigration, abortion policy and gun policy. Only about one-third called climate change one of the most important issues for their vote, and about one-quarter said that about the war between Israel and Hamas.

Trump and Harris are evenly matched in the poll on who would better handle crime and the war in Gaza. But the issues soon splinter in ways that reflect the distinct priorities of Republicans and Democrats.

Trump has an advantage over Harris on whom voters trust to better handle immigration. This issue was a problem for Biden, as well: Illegal immigration and crossings at the U.S. border with Mexico have been a challenge during much of his administration. Republicans are more likely to care about immigration, the issue where Trump has a clear upper hand.

Harris fares better than Trump when it comes to issues that Democrats care more about, including gun policy, health care, abortion policy and climate change.

Rosamaria Nunez, a 68-year-old retiree in San Antonio, Texas, identified gun violence as the most important issue facing the country, saying it became personal when her grandson called her last year to be picked up because of a school lockdown.

Nunez said she plans to vote for Harris, saying: ""First of all, she's a gun owner, so she can relate to the safety issue. She seems like she's more in tune with a real person than Trump is.""

Overall, voters see high stakes for the presidential election's impact on the country's future, the economy, and the future of democracy in the U.S., but they're less likely to think the election will have an impact on them personally. About 8 in 10 voters say the election will have ""a great deal"" or ""quite a bit"" of impact on the country's future. About three-quarters say the election will have a similar impact on the nation's economy and the future of democracy in the U.S.

By contrast, half of voters say the election will have at least ""quite a bit"" of impact on them personally.

The poll of 1,771 registered voters was conducted September 12-16, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for registered voters is plus or minus 3.4 percentage points."
"Las explosiones de dispositivos asestan duro golpe a Hezbollah, pero no fulminante, dicen analistas",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-8519fa0bf94296b1066e218df16971cc,2024-09-19T20:05:40Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Las oleadas de explosiones activadas de forma remota que alcanzaron los bípers y walkie-talkies que llevaban los miembros de Hezbollah en tiendas de comestibles, en las calles y en un funeral esta semana constituyeron un espectáculo inquietante e impactante.

Los analistas señalaron que Hezbollah podrá reagruparse militarmente y encontrar soluciones de comunicación tras el atentado, pero es probable que los efectos psicológicos sean profundos.

Las explosiones -- de las que se ha culpado ampliamente a Israel, que no ha confirmado ni desmentido su implicación -- mataron al menos a 37 personas, entre ellas dos niños, hirieron a más de 3.000 y perturbaron profundamente incluso a libaneses no afiliados a Hezbollah.

Las detonaciones afectaron a trabajadores de las instituciones civiles de Hezbollah, incluidas sus operaciones sanitarias y de medios de comunicación, así como a combatientes, asestando un duro golpe a las operaciones del grupo militante más allá del campo de batalla. No está claro cuántos civiles sin vínculos con Hezbollah resultaron heridos.

Los atentados también pusieron de manifiesto los puntos débiles del sistema de comunicaciones de baja tecnología al que había recurrido el grupo en un intento de evitar la vigilancia israelí de los teléfonos.

El general retirado del ejército libanés Elias Hanna describió los atentados como el ""Pearl Harbor o el 11-S de Hezbollah"".

Mohanad Hage Ali, investigador del centro de estudios Carnegie Middle East Center que estudia a Hezbollah, afirmó que, dado que las explosiones afectaron a personas de todas las instituciones del grupo, el atentado fue ""como una espada en las tripas de la organización"". Cientos de personas resultaron gravemente heridas, entre ellas muchas que perdieron ojos o manos.

""Se necesitará tiempo para curar y reemplazar a quienes fueron blanco del atentado"", afirmó.

Pero Hage Ali y otros analistas coincidieron en que la pérdida de efectivos no es un golpe demoledor. El líder de Hezbollah, Hasán Nasrala, ha afirmado que el grupo cuenta con más de 100.000 combatientes, lo que significa que el ataque, por dramático que fuera, sólo habría dejado fuera de combate a un pequeño porcentaje de sus militantes, incluso si todos los heridos y muertos fueran combatientes.

Qassim Qassir, analista libanés cercano a Hezbollah, afirmó que las detonaciones alcanzaron en realidad sobre todo a trabajadores civiles del grupo y no a militares o funcionarios de seguridad, lo que ha permitido a éste contener las repercusiones en su esfuerzo bélico.

Hezbollah, la fuerza armada más poderosa de Líbano, ha intercambiado ataques con el ejército israelí casi a diario desde el 8 de octubre, el día después de que un mortífero asalto dirigido por Hamás en el sur de Israel desencadenara una contraofensiva israelí masiva y la actual guerra en la Franja de Gaza.

Desde entonces, cientos de personas han muerto en ataques en Líbano y docenas en Israel, mientras que decenas de miles a cada lado de la frontera se han visto desplazadas. Hezbollah afirmó que sus ataques son en apoyo de su aliado Hamás y que cesarán si se aplica un cese del fuego en Gaza.

Hezbollah siguió lanzando cohetes sobre la frontera el miércoles y el jueves después de los ataques contra los bípers y walkie-talkies, aunque a un ritmo más lento de lo habitual.

Es probable que las repercusiones en la red de comunicaciones de Hezbollah sean más perjudiciales que las pérdidas humanas.

""Las telecomunicaciones son el nervio de las operaciones y comunicaciones militares"", afirmó el general retirado del ejército libanés Naji Malaeb, experto en asuntos de seguridad. Un retraso en las comunicaciones podría suponer un desastre, añadió.

Durante un discurso pronunciado en febrero, el líder de Hezbollah, Nasrala, advirtió a sus miembros de que no llevaran teléfonos, ya que, según dijo, podrían utilizarse para rastrearlos y vigilar sus comunicaciones.

Pero mucho antes de eso, Hezbollah utilizaba localizadores y su propia red privada de telefonía fija de fibra óptica para evitar la vigilancia de sus comunicaciones.

Los buscapersonas que detonaron el martes eran un nuevo modelo que el grupo empezó a utilizar recientemente. Al parecer, se habían implantado pequeñas cantidades de explosivos en los dispositivos en alguna fase del proceso de fabricación o envío y luego se habían detonado a distancia.

Hanna dijo que el grupo podría depender en mayor medida de su red de telefonía fija -- que Israel ha intentado intervenir en múltiples ocasiones -- o incluso de soluciones de menor tecnología, como cartas entregadas en mano.

""Quizá haya que volver a la comunicación humana, al cartero"", dijo. ""Esto es lo que realmente está ayudando a que (el líder de Hamás) Yahya Sinwar no sea blanco de ataques"" en su escondite de Gaza.

Orna Mizrahi, investigadora del Instituto de Estudios de Seguridad Nacional, con sede en Tel Aviv, y exanalista de inteligencia del ejército israelí y de la oficina del primer ministro, afirmó que perder la capacidad de comunicarse a través de los bípers es un ""golpe dramático"", pero que el grupo militante dispone de otros métodos de comunicación y reconstruirá su red de comunicaciones.

El mayor daño para Hezbollah fue psicológico, dijo.

""Es la humillación de llevar a cabo una operación de este tipo, demuestra hasta qué punto la organización está expuesta a la inteligencia israelí"", afirmó.

Amal Saad, profesor de política y relaciones internacionales de la Universidad de Cardiff, en Gales, que investiga sobre Hezbollah, afirmó que gran parte del impacto del atentado fue la ""desmoralización y el miedo"" que sembró.

""No se trata sólo de una falta de seguridad contra los militares"", afirmó. ""Toda la sociedad de Hezbollah va a estar muy preocupada porque ahora todo es susceptible de ser pirateado y manipulado"".

El grupo ""se replanteará ahora muchas cosas, no sólo los bípers"", dijo Saad.

"The exploding device attacks dealt a major but not crippling blow to Hezbollah, analysts say",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hezbollah-israel-exploding-pagers-walkie-talkies-devices-b8506471525e3848023b1d6a863827e8,2024-09-19T14:17:36Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- The waves of remotely triggered explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies carried by Hezbollah members in grocery stores, on streets and at a funeral procession this week made for an eerie and shocking spectacle.

Analysts said Hezbollah will be able to regroup militarily and find communications workarounds after the attack, but the psychological effects will likely run deep.

The explosions -- widely blamed on Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied involvement -- killed at least 37 people, including two children, wounded more than 3,000 and deeply unsettled even Lebanese who have no Hezbollah affiliation.

The detonating devices hit workers in Hezbollah's civilian institutions, including its health care and media operations, as well as fighters, dealing a blow to the militant group's operations beyond the battlefield. It is not clear how many civilians with no link to Hezbollah were injured.

The attacks also exposed the weaknesses in the low-tech communications system the group had turned to in an attempt to avoid Israeli surveillance of cellphones.

Retired Lebanese army Gen. Elias Hanna described the attacks as the ""Pearl Harbor or 9/11 of Hezbollah.""

Mohanad Hage Ali, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center think tank who researches Hezbollah, said that because the blasts hit people across the group's institutions, the attack was ""like a sword in the guts of the organization."" Hundreds of people were severely wounded, including many who lost eyes or hands.

""It will require time to heal and replace those who were targeted,"" he said.

But Hage Ali and other analysts agreed that the loss of manpower is not a crippling blow. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has said the group's fighting force numbers more than 100,000, meaning that the attack -- as dramatic as it was -- would have put only a small percentage of its militants out of commission even if all those wounded and killed were fighters.

Qassim Qassir, a Lebanese analyst close to Hezbollah, said the detonating devices actually struck mostly civilian workers within the group and not military or security officials, which has allowed it to contain the impacts on its war effort.

Hezbollah, which is Lebanon's strongest armed force, has exchanged fire with Israel's military almost daily since Oct. 8, the day after a deadly Hamas-led assault in southern Israel triggered a massive Israeli counteroffensive and the ongoing war in Gaza.

Since then, hundreds have been killed in strikes in Lebanon and dozens in Israel, while tens of thousands on each side of the border have been displaced. Hezbollah said its strikes are in support of its ally, Hamas, and that it will halt its attacks if a cease-fire is implemented in Gaza.

Hezbollah continued to launch rockets over the border Wednesday and Thursday after the pager and walkie-talkie attacks, though at a slower pace than usual.

The impacts on Hezbollah's communications network are likely to be more disruptive than the human loss.

""Telecommunications is the nerve of military operations and communications,"" said retired Lebanese army Gen. Naji Malaeb, an expert on security affairs. A delay in communication could spell disaster, he said.

During a speech in February, Hezbollah's leader, Nasrallah, warned members against carrying cellphones, which he said could be used to track them and monitor their communications.

But long before that, Hezbollah relied on pagers and its own private fiber-optic landline network to avoid the monitoring of its communications.

The pagers that detonated Tuesday were a new model the group recently began using. It appears that small quantities of explosives had been implanted in the devices at some stage in the manufacturing or shipping process and then remotely detonated.

Hanna said the group might rely more heavily on its landline network -- which Israel has attempted to tap into on multiple occasions -- going forward, or on even lower-tech solutions such as hand-delivered letters.

""Maybe you have to go back to human communication, the postman,"" he said. ""This is what is really helping (Hamas leader) Yahya Sinwar not to be targeted"" in his hiding spot in Gaza.

Orna Mizrahi, a senior researcher at the Tel Aviv-based think tank Institute for National Security Studies and former intelligence analyst for the Israeli military and prime minister's office, said losing the ability to communicate through pagers is a ""dramatic blow,"" but the militant group has other communication methods and will rebuild their communication network.

The bigger damage to Hezbollah was psychological, she said.

""It's the humiliation of having such an operation, it shows how much the organization is exposed to the Israeli intelligence,"" she said.

Amal Saad, a lecturer in politics and international relations at Cardiff University in Wales who researches Hezbollah, said much of the attack's impact was the ""demoralization and the fear"" it sowed.

""It's not just a security breach against the military,"" she said. ""Hezbollah's entire society is going to be extremely concerned because everything is liable now to being hacked and rigged.""

The group will ""be rethinking many things now, not just the pagers,"" Saad said.

Hezbollah fires new volley at Israel as fears of greater war mount after electronic devices bombing,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-exploding-devices-hezbollah-mideast-ab2436cf5bae5e2fe2dddb293671a0ac,2024-09-19T11:24:07Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Hezbollah fired a new barrage into northern Israel on Thursday, continuing its drumbeat of exchanges with the Israeli military as fears of a greater war rise after hundreds of electronic devices exploded in Lebanon, killing at least 32 people and wounding more than 3,000 others.

The device explosions appeared to be the culmination of a monthslong operation by Israel to target as many Hezbollah members as possible all at once. Over two days, pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah detonated, wounding and even crippling some fighters, but also maiming civilians connected to the group's social branches and killing at least two children.

It was unclear how the attack fit into warnings by Israeli leaders in recent weeks that they could launch a stepped-up military operation against Hezbollah, Lebanon's strongest armed force. The Israeli government has called it a war aim to end the Iranian-backed group's crossborder fire in order to allow tens of thousands of Israelis to return to homes near the border.

Speaking to Israeli troops on Wednesday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said, ""We are at the start of a new phase in the war -- it requires courage, determination and perseverance."" He made no mention of the exploding devices but praised the work of Israel's army and security agencies, saying ""the results are very impressive.""

Gallant said that after months of fighting Hamas in Gaza, ""the center of gravity is shifting to the north by diverting resources and forces.""

Hezbollah said early Thursday it had targeted military positions in northern Israel, without specifying what weapons it used. Israeli hospitals reported that they treated at least eight patients injured in the attacks. The military said early Thursday that it had struck several militant sites in southern Lebanon overnight.

The volley of strikes was a signal by Hezbollah that it would continue its near daily fire, which it says is a show of support for Hamas amid Israel's 11-month-old campaign in Gaza in retaliation for the Palestinian militants' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.

Israel has responded to Hezbollah's fire with strikes in southern Lebanon, and has struck senior figures from the group in the capital Beirut. The exchanges have killed hundreds in Lebanon and dozens in Israel and forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents on each side of the border.

Israel and Hezbollah have repeatedly pulled back from an all-out war under heavy pressure from the United States, France and other countries.

But in their recent warnings, Israeli leaders have said they are determined to change the status quo dramatically.

Israeli began moving more troops to its border with Lebanon on Wednesday as a precautionary measure, Israeli officials said. Israel's army chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said plans have been drawn up for additional action against Hezbollah, though media reported the government has not yet decided whether to launch a major offensive in Lebanon.

Meanwhile, Lebanon was still reeling from the unprecedented mass bombings of Tuesday and Wednesday.

The explosions have rattled anxious Lebanese fearing a full-scale war. The Lebanese Army said it has been locating and detonating suspicious pagers and communication devices, while the country's civil aviation authorities banned pagers and walkie-talkies on all airplanes departing from Beirut's international airport until further notice.

The attack was likely to severely disrupt Hezbollah's internal communication as it scrambles to determine safe means to talk to each other. Hezbollah announced the death of five combatants today, but didn't specify if they were killed in the explosions or on the front lines.

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was scheduled to speak later Thursday as the group vowed to retaliate against Israel.

The blasts went off wherever the holders of the pagers or walkie-talkies happened to be in multiple parts of Beirut and eastern and southern Lebanon -- in homes and cars, grocery stores and cafes and on the street, even at a funeral for some killed in the bombings, often with family and other bystanders nearby.

Many suffered gaping wounds on their legs, abdomens and faces or were maimed in the hand. Tuesday's pager blasts killed 12 people, including two children, and wounded some 2,800 others. The following day's explosion killed 20 and wounded more than 450.

Health Minister Firas Abiad praised Lebanon's hospitals, saying they had managed to deal with the flood of wounded within hours. ""It was an indiscriminate attack. It was a war crime,"" he said.

Mary Ellen O'Connell, a professor of law and international peace studies at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, said booby-traps are banned under international law. ""Weaponizing an object used by civilians is strictly prohibited,"" she said."
Harris plans a livestream with Oprah Winfrey while Trump is set to address an Israeli-American group,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-oprah-winfrey-miriam-adelson-f9384395f54a0d071ab52bca80d3659e,2024-09-19T11:23:58Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Both major presidential candidates are making appearances Thursday meant to fire up their core supporters, with Vice President Kamala Harris participating in a livestream with Oprah Winfrey and Donald Trump attending an event with prominent Jewish donors before addressing a gathering of the Israeli-American Council.

Winfrey, who has endorsed Harris and spoke at the Democratic convention in August, is set to host a two-hour ""Unite for America"" nighttime streaming session in Michigan with Harris that organizers say aims to highlight dozens of grassroots groups backing the vice president.

Trump will be in Washington to address a ""Fighting Anti-Semitism in America"" evening event with Miriam Adelson, a co-owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks and widow of billionaire casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who founded the Las Vegas Sands casino and was one of the Republican Party's largest donors.

Trump will also speak before the Israeli-American Council, a nonprofit long backed by Sheldon Adelson as well as Haim Saban, a major donor to President Joe Biden and Democratic causes. The council is holding its national convention in the weeks before the first anniversary of Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, which sparked the war in Gaza.

On Friday, Harris has campaign stops planned in swing states Wisconsin and Georgia as she calls attention to the case of a young mother who died after waiting 20 hours for a hospital to treat her complications from an abortion pill. Harris contends that outcome shows the consequences of Trump's actions.

Amber Thurman's death, first reported Monday by ProPublica, came two weeks after Georgia's strict abortion ban was enacted in 2022 after the Supreme Court's decision to overturn nationwide abortion rights. Trump nominated three of the justices who made that decision.

Trump has a Saturday rally set in battleground North Carolina.

Thursday's campaign stops follow the Federal Reserve cutting its benchmark interest rate by an unusually large half-point. That marked a dramatic shift after more than two years of high rates that helped tame inflation but also made borrowing painfully expensive for American consumers.

With the presidential election less than seven weeks away, the move has the potential to scramble the economic landscape just as Americans prepare to vote. Campaigning in New York on Wednesday, Trump said, ""I guess it shows the economy is very bad to cut it by that much, assuming they're not just playing politics.""

Asked about potential political influence of a rate cut so close to Election Day, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration has been ""very clear about this and very respectful of the independence of the Federal Reserve.""

""Unlike other administrations, we've been, I think, pretty steadfast about that, and have been continuous in making that clear,"" she added, without naming Trump and his past public criticism of the Fed or his suggestions during the campaign that presidents should have more authority over the central bank."
A war with Hezbollah may be looming. Is Israel prepared?,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-pagers-hamas-gaza-war-df4c835ee3d1471e79d1a7fe951226bf,2024-09-18T20:27:24Z,"JERUSALEM (AP) -- With Israel's defense minister announcing a ""new phase"" of the war and an apparent Israeli attack setting off explosions in electronic devices in Lebanon, the specter of all-out combat between Israel and Hezbollah seems closer than ever before.

Hopes for a diplomatic solution to the conflict appear to be fading quickly as Israel signals a desire to change the status quo in the country's north, where it has exchanged cross-border fire with Hezbollah since the Lebanese militant group began attacking on Oct. 8, a day after the war's opening salvo by Hamas.

In recent days, Israel has moved a powerful fighting force up to the northern border, officials have escalated their rhetoric, and the country's security Cabinet has designated the return of tens of thousands of displaced residents to their homes in northern Israel an official war goal.

Here's a look at how Israel is preparing for a war with Lebanon:

While the daily fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has escalated on several occasions, the bitter enemies have been careful to avoid an all-out war.

That appears to be changing -- especially after pagers, walkie-talkies, solar equipment and other devices exploded in Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 20 and wounding thousands in a sophisticated attack Hezbollah blamed on Israel.

""You don't do something like that, hit thousands of people, and think war is not coming,"" said retired Israeli Brig. Gen. Amir Avivi, who leads Israel Defense and Security Forum, a group of hawkish former military commanders. ""Why didn't we do it for 11 months? Because we were not willing to go to war yet. What's happening now? Israel is ready for war.""

As fighting in Gaza has slowed, Israel has fortified forces along the border with Lebanon, including the arrival this week of a powerful army division that took part in some of the heaviest fighting in Gaza.

The 98th Division is believed to include thousands of troops, including paratrooper infantry units and artillery and elite commando forces specially trained for operations behind enemy lines. Their deployment was confirmed by an official with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss troop movements.

The division played a key role in Gaza, spearheading the army's operations in the southern city of Khan Younis, a Hamas stronghold. The offensive inflicted heavy losses on Hamas fighters and tunnels, but also wreaked massive damage, sent thousands of Palestinians fleeing and resulted in scores of civilian deaths. Israel says Hamas endangers civilians by hiding in residential areas.

The military also said it staged a series of drills this week along the border.

""The mission is clear,"" said Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin, who heads Israel's Northern Command. ""We are determined to change the security reality as soon as possible.""

The military movements have been accompanied by heightened rhetoric from Israel's leaders, who say their patience is running thin.

Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Wednesday night declared the start of a "" new phase"" of the war as Israel turns its focus toward Hezbollah. ""The center of gravity is shifting to the north by diverting resources and forces,"" he said.

He spoke a day after Israel's Cabinet made the return of displaced residents to their homes in northern Israel a formal goal of the war. The move was largely symbolic -- Israeli leaders have long pledged to bring those residents home. But elevating the significance of the aim signaled a tougher stance.

After meeting Wednesday with top security officials, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared: ""We will return the residents of the north securely to their homes.""

Netanyahu delivered a similarly tough message with a top U.S. envoy sent to the region this week to soothe tensions.

An official with knowledge of the encounter told The Associated Press that the envoy, Amos Hochstein, told Netanyahu that intensifying the conflict with Hezbollah would not help return evacuated Israelis back home.

Netanyahu, according to a statement from his office, told Hochstein that residents cannot return without ""a fundamental change in the security situation in the north."" The statement said that while Netanyahu ""appreciates and respects"" U.S. support, Israel will ""do what is necessary to safeguard its security.""

Israeli media reported Wednesday that the government has not yet decided whether to launch a major offensive in Lebanon.

Much, it seems, will depend on Hezbollah's response. The group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is expected to deliver a major speech on Thursday.

But public sentiment in Israel seems to be supportive of tougher action against Hezbollah.

A recent poll by the Israeli Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank, found that 67% of Jewish respondents thought Israel should intensify its response to Hezbollah. The majority believed Israel should launch a deep offensive that includes striking Lebanese infrastructure.

""There's a lot of pressure from the society to go to war and win,"" said Avivi, the retired general. ""Unless Hezbollah tomorrow morning says, 'OK, we got the message. We're pulling out of south Lebanon,' war is imminent.""

Such a war would almost certainly prove devastating to both sides.

Already, more than 500 people have been killed in Lebanon by Israeli strikes since Oct. 8, most of them fighters with Hezbollah and other armed groups but also more than 100 civilians. In northern Israel, at least 23 soldiers and 26 civilians have been killed by strikes from Lebanon.

Israel inflicted heavy damage on Lebanon during a monthlong war against Hezbollah in 2006 that ended in a stalemate. Israeli leaders have threatened even tougher action this time around, vowing to repeat the scenes of destruction from Gaza in Lebanon.

But Hezbollah also has built up its capabilities since 2006. Hezbollah has an estimated 150,000 rockets and missiles, some believed to have guidance systems that could threaten sensitive targets in Israel. It has also developed an increasingly sophisticated fleet of drones.

Capable of striking all parts of Israel, Hezbollah could bring life in Israel to a standstill and send hundreds of thousands of Israelis fleeing.

Prosecutors charge 10 with failing to disperse during California protest,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/protest-campus-charges-university-of-california-irvine-34b21b3536a05208292e75fc909618df,2024-09-18T18:24:49Z,"SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Prosecutors in Southern California have charged 10 people, including two professors, with failing to disperse during a pro-Palestinian protest last spring at the University of California, Irvine that led to a clash with police, officials said Wednesday.

The Orange County District Attorney's office said those charged included two UCI professors and four students. All are due to appear in court on Oct. 16 to be arraigned on misdemeanor charges, the office said.

""The right to peaceful assembly is a constitutional right and we encourage protestors to exercise their right to peaceful assembly on any issue,"" Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said in a statement. ""However, criminal activity which transcends peaceful assembly will not be tolerated.""

Prosecutors are continuing to review evidence to determine whether charges will be filed against the remaining 40 people arrested during the May incident on campus, the statement said.

The university said in a statement that all members of the campus community are subject to ""all applicable laws, policies and relevant codes of conduct while engaging in protest activities.""

In the spring, university officials said they had allowed a peaceful encampment to remain on campus even though it violated school policies, but called in police after a small group barricaded themselves inside a lecture hall, supported by a large group of community members outside. Police in riot gear who were sent to the scene made dozens of arrests.

Protest camps sprang up across the U.S. in the spring, including at University of California campuses, as students demanded that their universities cease doing business with Israel or companies they said supported the war in Gaza.

University of California, Irvine is located in central Orange County and has more than 36,000 students."
Mideast Tensions latest: Gold Apollo says a Budapest company made exploding pagers under its brand,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-latest-18-september-2024-57883abeb4ec300edafc7395d17d0b38,2024-09-18T07:36:18Z,"Taiwanese company Gold Apollo said Wednesday that it authorized its brand on the pagers that exploded in Lebanon and Syria but that another company based in Budapest manufactured them.

Hundreds of handheld pagers exploded almost simultaneously Tuesday across Lebanon and in parts of Syria, killing at least nine people, government and Hezbollah officials said. Officials pointed the finger at Israel in what appeared to be a sophisticated remote attack. The Israeli military declined to comment.

Hezbollah began striking Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that sparked the Israel-Hamas war. Since then, Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged fire daily, coming close to a full-blown war on several occasions and forcing tens of thousands on both sides of the border to evacuate their homes.

Gaza's Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.

Here's the latest:

JERUSALEM -- The Israeli military says four soldiers were killed in southern Gaza and five others were wounded, with three of them in serious condition.

The deaths on Tuesday came nearly a year into the war in Gaza, which was triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. The army did not describe the circumstances, but Israeli media reported that the soldiers were killed by a hidden bomb that exploded inside a building.

One of the four, Staff Sgt. Agam Naim, an army paramedic, was the first female soldier to have been killed in combat in Gaza, according to Israeli media.

Hamas and other armed groups remain active across the territory despite months of heavy Israeli bombardment and ground operations that have destroyed vast areas and displaced most of the population.

Israel says 346 of its soldiers have been killed since the start of ground operations last October. The military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.

TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Taiwanese company Gold Apollo said Wednesday that it authorized its brand on the pagers that exploded in Lebanon and Syria but that another company based in Budapest manufactured them.

Pagers used by hundreds of members of the militant group Hezbollah exploded near-simultaneously Tuesday in Lebanon and Syria, killing at least nine people, including an 8-year-old girl, and wounding more than 2,000. Hezbollah and the Lebanese government blamed Israel for what appeared to be a sophisticated remote attack.

The AR-924 pagers used by the militants were manufactured by BAC Consulting KFT, based in Hungary's capital, according to a statement released Wednesday by Gold Apollo.

""According to the cooperation agreement, we authorize BAC to use our brand trademark for product sales in designated regions, but the design and manufacturing of the products are solely the responsibility of BAC,"" the statement read.

Gold Apollo chair Hsu Ching-kuang told journalists Wednesday that his company has had a licensing agreement with BAC for the past three years, but did not provide evidence of the contract.

The AR-924 pager, advertised as being ""rugged,"" contains a rechargeable lithium battery, according to specifications once advertised on Gold Apollo's website before it was apparently taken down Tuesday after the sabotage attack. It could receive text messages of up to 100 characters and claimed to have up to 85 days of battery life. That's something that would be crucial in Lebanon, where electricity outages have been common as the tiny nation on the Mediterranean Sea has faced years of economic collapse. Pagers also run on a different wireless network than mobile phones, making them more resilient in emergencies -- one of the reasons why many hospitals worldwide still rely on them."
The UN will vote on a Palestinian resolution demanding Israel end its occupation,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/un-israel-palestinians-assembly-vote-gaza-a0136b26cad52070e79628639edbec2c,2024-09-18T04:26:13Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The U.N. General Assembly will vote Wednesday on a Palestinian resolution demanding that Israel end its ""unlawful presence"" in Gaza and the occupied West Bank within a year, withdraw its military forces and evacuate all settlers.

The resolution is being put to a vote in the 193-member assembly as Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza approaches its first anniversary and as violence in the West Bank reaches new highs. The war was triggered by Hamas attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7.

Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian U.N. ambassador, opened the assembly meeting Tuesday by saying Palestinians face an ""existential threat"" and claiming Israel has held them ""in shackles."" He demanded an end to Israel's decades-long occupation and for Palestinians to be able to return home to live in peace and freedom.

Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Danny Danon, urged member nations to reject the resolution, describing it as ""an attempt to destroy Israel through diplomatic terrorism"" that never mentions Hamas' atrocities and ""ignores the truth, twists the facts and replaces reality with fiction.""

""Instead of a resolution condemning the rape and massacre committed by Hamas on Oct. 7, we gather here to watch the Palestinians' U.N. circus -- a circus where evil is righteous, war is peace, murder is justified and terror is applauded,"" he said.

If adopted, the resolution would not be legally binding, but the extent of its support would reflect world opinion. There are no vetoes in the General Assembly, unlike in the 15-member Security Council.

The resolution is a response to a ruling by the top United Nations court in July that said Israel's presence in the Palestinian territories is unlawful and must end.

In the sweeping condemnation of Israel's rule over the lands it captured during the 1967 war, the International Court of Justice said Israel had no right to sovereignty over the Palestinian territories and was violating international laws against acquiring the lands by force.

The court's opinion also is not legally binding. Nonetheless, the Palestinians drafted the resolution to try to implement the ruling, saying Israel's ""abuse of its status as the occupying power"" renders its ""presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful.""

Mansour stressed that any country that thinks the Palestinian people ""will accept a life of servitude"" or that claims peace is possible without a just solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is ""not being realistic.""

The solution remains an independent Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living side by side in peace and security with Israel, he said.

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas Greenfield told reporters that the resolution has ""a significant number of flaws,"" saying it goes beyond the ICJ ruling. It also doesn't recognize that ""Hamas is a terrorist organization"" in control of Gaza and that Israel has a right to defend itself, she said.

""In our view, the resolution does not bring about tangible benefits across the board for the Palestinian people,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""I think it could complicate the situation on the ground, complicate what we're trying to do to end the conflict, and I think it impedes reinvigorating steps toward a two-state solution.""

The resolution calls for Israel to pay reparations to Palestinians for the damage caused by its occupation and urges countries to take steps to prevent trade or investments that maintain Israel's presence in the territories.

It also demands that Israel be held accountable for any violations of international law, that sanctions be imposed on those responsible for maintaining Israel's presence in the territories, and for countries to halt arms exports to Israel if they're suspected of being used there.

Mansour said an initial Palestinian draft demanded Israel end its occupation within six months but that it was revised in response to concerns of some countries to increase the time frame to within a year.

Most likely, he said, Israel won't pay attention to the resolution."
US military acknowledges Yemen's Houthi rebels shot down 2 MQ-9 Reaper drones,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-american-mq9-reaper-drones-2ca2dc1c5316ca5473c3843d97780b2b,2024-09-18T02:50:31Z,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Yemen's Houthi rebels shot down two American MQ-9 Reaper drones in under a week, the United States military acknowledged Wednesday, further highlighting the regional spread of the Israel-Hamas war.

As the one-year anniversary of the war approaches, Houthis continue a campaign to target ships traveling through the Red Sea as U.S.-led airstrikes pound their positions in Yemen. That's imperiled a waterway that typically sees $1 trillion of trade pass through it, as well as crucial shipments of aid to war-torn Sudan and Yemen.

The U.S. military said Houthis shot down the first Reaper on Sept. 10, and the second on Monday. Online video showed the downing and the flaming wreckage on the ground afterward in Yemen's Dhamar province.

General Atomics Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes up to 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) and have an endurance of up to 24 hours before needing to land. The aircraft have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA over Yemen for years.

U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon's press secretary, said authorities continue to investigate Monday's downing, but declined to elaborate. He added that a claim by the Houthis that they shot down 10 Reapers since the start of their campaign in November over the Israel-Hamas war was ""not accurate.""

""For operation security reasons, I'm not going to be able to provide a specific number,"" Ryder said Tuesday.

Since Houthis seized the country's north and its capital of Sanaa in 2014, the U.S. military has seen Reapers shot down in Yemen in 2017, 2019, 2023 and 2024.

Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well.

The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.

Those attacks include a barrage that struck the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion in the Red Sea. Salvagers have towed away the burning oil tanker, hoping to avoid a catastrophic leak of its 1 million barrels of oil on board."
Israel has a long history of pulling off complex attacks like the exploding pagers,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-pagers-hamas-826a71b87e395f0195f877e4e9d238f1,2024-09-17T21:21:58Z,"JERUSALEM (AP) -- Hezbollah and the Lebanese government were quick to blame Israel for the nearly simultaneous detonation of hundreds of pagers used by the militant group's members in an attack Tuesday that killed at least nine people and wounded nearly 3,000 others, according to officials.

Many of those hit were members of militant group Hezbollah, but it wasn't immediately clear if others also carried the pagers. Among those killed were the son of a prominent Hezbollah politician and an 8-year-old girl, according to Lebanon's health minister.

The attack came amid rising tensions between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah, which have exchanged fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that sparked the war in Gaza. Iran's ambassador to Lebanon was among those injured by the pager explosions.

Israel rarely takes responsibility for such attacks, and its military declined to comment Tuesday. However, the country has a long history of carrying out sophisticated remote operations, ranging from intricate cyberattacks to remote-controlled machine guns targeting leaders in drive-by shootings, suicide drone attacks, and the detonation of explosions in secretive underground Iranian nuclear facilities.

Here is a look at previous operations that have been attributed to Israel:

Two major militant leaders in Beirut and Tehran were killed in deadly strikes within hours of each other. Hamas said Israel was behind the assassination of its supreme leader, Ismail Haniyeh, in Iran's capital. Although Israel didn't acknowledge playing a role in that attack, it did claim responsibility for a deadly strike hours earlier on Fouad Shukur, a top Hezbollah commander in Beirut.

Israel targeted Hamas' shadowy military commander, Mohammed Deif, in a massive strike in the crowded southern Gaza Strip. The strike killed at least 90 people, including children, according to local health officials. The Israeli military said in August that Deif was killed in the attack, though Hamas previously claimed he survived.

Two Iranian generals were killed in what Iran said was an Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Syria. The deaths led Iran to launch an unprecedented attack on Israel that involved about 300 missiles and drones, most of which were intercepted.

An Israeli drone strike in Beirut killed Saleh Arouri, a top Hamas official in exile, as Israeli troops fight the militant group in Gaza.

Seyed Razi Mousavi, a longtime adviser of the Iranian paramilitary Revolutionary Guard in Syria, was killed in a drone attack outside of Damascus. Iran blamed Israel.

An underground nuclear facility in central Iran was hit with explosions and a devastating cyberattack that caused rolling blackouts. Iran accused Israel of carrying out the attack as well as several others against Iranian nuclear facilities using explosive drones in the ensuing years.

In one of the most prominent assassinations targeting Iran's nuclear program, a top Iranian military nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was killed by a remote-controlled machine gun while traveling in a car outside Tehran. Iran blamed Israel.

An Israeli airstrike hit the home of Bahaa Abu el-Atta, a senior Islamic Jihad commander in the Gaza Strip, killing him and his wife.

Ahmad Jabari, head of Hamas' armed wing, was killed when an airstrike targets his car. His death sparked an eight-day war between Hamas and Israel.

The Stuxnet computer virus, discovered in 2010, disrupted and destroyed Iranian nuclear centrifuges. It was widely believed to be a joint U.S.-Israeli creation.

Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a top Hamas operative, was killed in a Dubai hotel room in an operation attributed to the Mossad spy agency but never acknowledged by Israel. Many of the 26 supposed assassins were caught on camera disguised as tourists.

Imad Mughniyeh, Hezbollah's military chief, was killed when a bomb planted in his car exploded in Damascus. Mughniyeh was accused of engineering suicide bombings during Lebanon's civil war and of planning the 1985 hijacking of a TWA airliner in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed. Hezbollah blamed his killing on Israel. His son Jihad Mughniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike in 2015.

Hamas' spiritual leader, Ahmed Yassin, was killed in an Israeli helicopter strike while being pushed in his wheelchair. Yassin, who was paralyzed in a childhood accident, was among the founders of Hamas in 1987. His successor, Abdel Aziz Rantisi, was killed in an Israeli airstrike less than a month later.

Hamas's second-highest military leader, Salah Shehadeh, was killed by a one-ton bomb dropped on an apartment building in Gaza City.

Mossad agents tried to kill the head of Hamas at the time, Khaled Mashaal, in Amman, Jordan. Two agents entered Jordan using fake Canadian passports and poison Mashaal by placing a device near his ear. They were captured shortly afterward and Jordan's king threatened to void a still-fresh peace accord if Mashaal died. Israel ultimately dispatched an antidote, and the Israeli agents were returned home. Mashaal remains a senior figure in Hamas.

Yahya Ayyash, nicknamed the ""engineer"" for his mastery in building bombs for Hamas, was killed by answering a rigged phone in Gaza. His assassination triggered a series of deadly bus bombings in Israel.

Islamic Jihad founder Fathi Shikaki was shot in the head in Malta in an assassination widely believed to have been carried out by Israel.

Palestine Liberation Organization military chief Khalil al-Wazir was killed in Tunisia. Better known as Abu Jihad, he had been PLO chief Yasser Arafat's deputy. In 2012, military censors allowed an Israeli paper to reveal details of the Israeli raid for the first time.

Israeli commandos shot a number of PLO leaders in their apartments in Beirut, in a nighttime raid led by Ehud Barak, who later became Israel's top army commander and prime minister. The operation was part of a string of Israeli assassinations of Palestinian leaders that were carried out in retaliation for the killings of 11 Israeli coaches and athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics."

General Assembly is considering a Palestinian resolution Tuesday demanding that Israel end its ""unlawful presence"" in Gaza and the occupied West Bank within a year and calling for sanctions and an arms embargo against the country.

It will be put to a vote in the 193-member assembly Wednesday as Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza approaches its first anniversary and as violence in the West Bank reaches new highs. The war was triggered by Hamas attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7.

Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Danny Danon, urged member nations to reject the measure, describing it as a ""reward for terrorism.""

""Instead of a resolution condemning the rape and massacre committed by Hamas on Oct. 7, we gather to watch the Palestinian circus under the auspices of the United Nations,"" he said Tuesday.

The resolution, if adopted by the General Assembly, would not be legally binding but the extent of its support would reflect world opinion. There are no vetoes in the assembly, unlike in the 15-member Security Council.

The resolution demands Israel withdraw its forces, immediately halt all new settlement building and evacuate all settlers from the Palestinian territories.

The measure also calls for Israel to pay reparations to Palestinians for the damage caused by its occupation. It urges countries to take steps to prevent trade or investments that maintain Israel's presence and implement sanctions, ""including in relation to settler violence.""

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas Greenfield told reporters that the resolution has ""a significant number of flaws,"" saying it goes beyond the ICJ ruling and doesn't recognize both that ""Hamas is a terrorist organization"" in control of Gaza and that Israel has a right to defend itself.

""I think it could complicate the situation on the ground, complicate what we're trying to do to end the conflict, and I think it impedes reinvigorating steps toward a two-state solution.""

Mansour told reporters this week that over 60 countries have asked to speak ahead of Wednesday's vote.

He said an initial Palestinian draft demanded Israel end its occupation within six months but that it was revised in response to concerns of some countries to increase the time frame to within a year.

He said the focus of the resolution is putting into place the International Court of Justice's ruling, which is also not legally binding.

""The idea is, you want to use the pressure of the international community in the GA, and the pressure of the historic ruling by the ICJ to force Israel to change its behavior in the direction of accepting to withdraw from the occupied territory,"" Mansour said.

Most likely, he said, Israel won't pay attention to the resolution and the Palestinians will then submit another one.

Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory."

Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, came before journalists just after news broke from Lebanon of several hundred people being wounded by pagers exploding, including members of the militant group Hezbollah. Suspicion immediately fell on Israel, which earlier Tuesday stressed that halting Hezbollah's attacks on Israel's north to allow residents to return to their homes was now an official war goal.

Borrell said he would seek more information from Beirut, where he just traveled from, but acknowledged it could escalate the already-boiling tensions in the region.

""Certainly there is the possibility of the war spilling over to Lebanon,"" Borrell said.

Borrell, when asked repeatedly about when he hoped a cease-fire could be reached, insisted he couldn't offer a time. Months of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas has not seen any major hostage release, while the Gaza Strip has been decimated by an Israeli offensive.

Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. The Israeli military operation has killed over 41,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Meanwhile, Israel has launched repeated, dayslong operations in the West Bank, which the Palestinians also hope will form a part of a future state.

""President Biden announced a plan for a cease-fire. Everybody was expecting it to be agreed and quickly,"" Borrell said. ""I cannot foresee what can happen in the next days or weeks. The only thing I can say is that all actors involved have to continue pressure on both parties to reach this agreement.""

He added: ""The trouble is not a matter of waiting for tomorrow. Tomorrow is already too late."""

A senior military intelligence official and an official with a Lebanese group with knowledge of the situation, both of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation said that pagers carried by Hezbollah members were detonated. The second official said it was believed to be an Israeli attack.

The state-run National News Agency reported that in Beirut's southern suburbs and other areas ""the handheld pagers system was detonated using advanced technology, and dozens of injuries were reported."" It wasn't immediately clear if people were killed.

A Hezbollah official said that at least 150 people, including members of the group, were wounded in different parts of Lebanon when the pagers they were carrying exploded. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said the explosions were the result of ""a security operation that targeted the devices.""

""The enemy (Israel) stands behind this security incident,"" the official said, without elaborating. He added that the new pagers that Hezbollah members were carrying had lithium batteries that apparently exploded. Lithium batteries, when overheated, can smoke, melt and even catch on fire.

The Associated Press reached out to the Israeli military and they declined to comment.

The incident comes at a time of heightened tensions between Lebanon and Israel. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Israeli forces have been clashing near-daily for more than 11 months against the backdrop of war between Israel and Hezbollah ally Hamas in Gaza.

The clashes have killed hundreds in Lebanon and dozens in Israel and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border.

Photos and videos from Beirut's southern suburbs circulating on social media and in local media showed people lying on the pavement with wounds on their hands or near their pants pockets.

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah previously warned the group's members not to carry cellphones, saying that they could be used by Israel to track their movements and to carry out targeted strikes.

Hezbollah began striking Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that sparked the Israel-Hamas war. Since then, Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged fire daily, coming close to a full-blown war on several occasions and forcing tens of thousands on both sides of the border to evacuate their homes.

Visiting White House envoy Amos Hochstein met with Netanyahu and other top officials Monday to try to soothe tensions and avoid the opening of a new front between Israel and Lebanon. Netanyahu told the envoy that Israel will do ""whatever is necessary"" to bring home the residents.

Gaza's Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory since Oct. 7. The ministry does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.

The war has caused vast destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million.

Here's the Latest:

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Palestinian officials say Israel has struck a number of homes in the central Gaza Strip, killing at least four people, including a child. The Civil Defense first responders say more people are trapped under the rubble and the toll is likely to rise after the strikes early Tuesday.

Another strike late Monday in Gaza City killed a man, his wife and child, according to the Civil Defense.

Israel says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians. It accuses Hamas and other armed groups of endangering civilians by operating in densely populated areas.

Gaza's Health Ministry says over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war, which was ignited by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel. It does not differentiate between civilians and combatants but says a little over half of those killed were women and children.

The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.

Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attacks and took another 250 hostage. They are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead, after most of the rest were released during a cease-fire in November.

JERUSALEM -- Returning residents evacuated from Israel's north due to cross-border fighting with Hezbollah is now an official war goal, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Tuesday.

Israeli officials have long said they aim to return the tens of thousands of displaced Israelis to their homes, so it was not immediately clear how the announcement would impact the conduct of the war. But it was a strong indication Israel is prepared to take tougher military action to realize that goal.

Visiting White House envoy Amos Hochstein met with Netanyahu and other top officials Monday to try to soothe tensions and avoid the opening of a new front between Israel and Lebanon.

Netanyahu told the envoy that Israel will do ""whatever is necessary"" to bring home the residents.

In a brief statement after an overnight Cabinet meeting, Netanyahu's office said Israel will continue to work toward the goal -- the latest sign that patience is running out.

Hezbollah began striking Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack that sparked the Israel-Hamas war. Since then, Israel and Hezbollah have exchanged fire daily, coming close to a full-blown war on several occasions and forcing tens of thousands on both sides of the border to evacuate their homes.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has said the focal point of military action is moving from Gaza to Israel's northern front. In talks with Hochstein on Monday, both he and Netanyahu warned that time was running out for a diplomatic solution and heavier military activity could be inevitable.

UNITED NATIONS -- The United States ambassador to the United Nations accused Israel's military of striking schools, humanitarian workers and civilians in Gaza in a sign of growing American frustration with its close ally as the war approaches its first anniversary.

Israel has repeatedly said it targets Hamas militants, who often hide with civilians and use them as human shields, in retaliation for the Oct. 7 attacks in southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people and launched the war in Gaza.

U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield was unusually outspoken against the Israeli military at a U.N. Security Council meeting Monday, saying many of the strikes in recent weeks that injured or killed U.N. personnel and humanitarian workers were preventable.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for an independent investigation.

Thomas-Greenfield told council members that the U.S. will keep raising the need for Israel to facilitate humanitarian operations in the Palestinian territory and protect humanitarian workers and facilities. She also reiterated outrage at the death of Turkish American activist Aysenur Eygi, who was shot and killed Sept. 6 during a protest in the West Bank. Israeli Defense Forces said it likely killed Eygi by mistake, and the government began a criminal investigation."
Israel says halting Hezbollah attacks is now a war goal as officials warn of a wider operation,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-39f6bdbacb2d4d0743f78a85bd138708,2024-09-17T08:36:22Z,"JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel announced Tuesday that halting Hezbollah's attacks in the north in order to allow its residents to return is now an official war goal, as the country considers a wider military operation that could ignite an all-out conflict.

Israeli officials have repeatedly threatened to take heavier military action to halt the near-daily attacks, which began shortly after the outbreak of the nearly yearlong Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Israel has regularly launched airstrikes in response and has targeted and killed senior Hezbollah commanders. As recently as last month it appeared a full-blown war was imminent.

The tit-for-tat strikes have displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border. Hezbollah has said it would halt the attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but those talks have repeatedly bogged down. The United States has pressed for restraint even as it has rushed military aid to Israel, warning its close ally that a wider war would not achieve its goals.

Israeli media have meanwhile reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considering firing Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and replacing him with a politician seen as far more hawkish. That would be the biggest leadership shakeup in Israel since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack triggered the war in Gaza and set off wider regional tensions.

The announcement on Lebanon came after Israel's security Cabinet met late into the night. It said the Cabinet has ""updated the objectives of the war"" to include safely returning the residents of the north to their homes. ""Israel will continue to act to implement this objective,"" it said.

U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, who has made several visits to Lebanon and Israel to try to ease tensions, met with Netanyahu on Monday.

Hochstein told the prime minister that intensifying the conflict with Hezbollah would not help achieve the goal of returning Israelis to their homes, according to a U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private talks.

Hochstein said Netanyahu risked sparking a broad and protracted regional conflict if he moved forward with a full-scale war in Lebanon and said the Biden administration remained committed to finding a diplomatic solution in conjunction with a Gaza cease-fire or on its own, the official said.

Netanyahu told Hochstein that residents cannot return without ""a fundamental change in the security situation in the north,"" according to a statement from the prime minister's office.

It said that while Netanyahu ""appreciates and respects"" U.S. support, Israel will ""do what is necessary to safeguard its security.""

Defense Minister Gallant has meanwhile said the focus of the conflict is shifting from Gaza to Israel's north. He told U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin this week that time is running out for an agreement with Hezbollah, saying ""the trajectory is clear.""

Hezbollah has said that while it does not want a wider war it is prepared for one.

Raed Berro, a member of Hezbollah's parliamentary bloc, said Monday that the militant group ""is ready for confrontation and has a lot in its pocket to deter the enemy and protect Lebanon in case Netanyahu thinks of expanding the war.""

The war in Gaza began when Hamas launched a surprise attack into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking another 250 hostage. Militants are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead, after releasing most of the rest during a cease-fire last year.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not specify how many were fighters but says just over half were women and children. The Israeli bombardment and ground invasion has devastated large areas of the densely populated enclave and driven around 90% of its 2.3 million residents from their homes.

Iran supports Hamas, Hezbollah and other militant groups across the region, which have carried out strikes on Israeli and U.S. targets in solidarity with the Palestinians. A missile launched by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels on Sunday set off air raid sirens in central Israel without causing casualties. Israel has hinted at a military response.

Israel and Iran traded fire directly for the first time in April, and Iran has threatened to avenge the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in an explosion in its capital in July. The targeted killing was widely blamed on Israel, which has not said whether it was involved.

The United States, Qatar and Egypt have spent most of this year trying to broker an agreement in which Hamas would release the hostages in exchange for a lasting cease-fire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.

President Joe Biden endorsed the framework of the agreement in May and the U.N. Security Council backed it days later. But since then, both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of making new and unacceptable demands, and the talks appear to be at an impasse.

Many council members cited last week's Israeli strike on a former school turned civilian shelter run by the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, in which six UNRWA staffers were among at least 18 people killed, including women and children.

Israel said it targeted a Hamas command-and-control center in the compound, and Israel's U.N. ambassador, Danny Danon, asserted Monday that Hamas militants were killed in the strike. He named four, claiming to the council that they worked for UNRWA during the day and Hamas at night.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for an independent investigation.

Thomas-Greenfield told council members that the U.S. will keep raising the need for Israel to facilitate humanitarian operations in the Palestinian territory and protect humanitarian workers and facilities like the UNRWA shelter.

She also reiterated U.S. ""outrage"" at the death of Turkish American activist Aysenur Eygi, who was shot and killed during a protest in the West Bank last week. Israeli Defense Forces said it likely killed Eygi by mistake, and the government has begun a criminal investigation.

""The IDF is a professional military and knows well how to ensure that incidents such as these do not happen,"" the U.S. envoy said.

Thomas-Greenfield said the United States expects Israeli military leaders to implement ""fundamental changes"" in their operations -- including to their rules of engagement and procedures to ensure that military operations do not conflict with humanitarian activities and do not target schools and other civilian facilities.

""We have also been unequivocal in communicating to Israel that there is no basis -- absolutely none -- for its forces to be opening fire on clearly marked U.N. vehicles as recently occurred on numerous occasions,"" Thomas-Greenfield said.

At the same time, she said Hamas is also hiding in -- and in some cases, taking over or using -- civilian sites, which poses ""an ongoing threat.""

She said it underscores the urgency of reaching a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza. While the United States works with fellow mediators Egypt and Qatar to try to get both sides ""to agree that enough is enough,"" she said, ""this is ultimately a question of political will"" and difficult compromises.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken heads to Egypt this week for talks partly about refining a proposal to present to Israel and Hamas.

The United States urges ""all council members with influence over Hamas to join others in pressing its leaders to stop stalling, make these compromises, and accept the deal without delay,"" Thomas-Greenfield.

She spoke after the top U.N. humanitarian official in Gaza said the territory is ""hell on Earth"" for its more than 2 million people, calling the lack of effective protection for civilians ""unconscionable.""

Sigrid Kaag, the U.N. senior humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, told council members and reporters that the war has turned the territory ""into the abyss.""

Over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed during Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants.

Humanitarian operations are being impeded by lawlessness, Israeli evacuation orders, fighting and difficult conditions for aid workers that include Israeli denials of access, delays, a lack of safety and security, and ""poor logistical infrastructure,"" Kaag said.

Danon insisted that Israel's humanitarian efforts ""are unparalleled"" for a country forced to go to war and urged the Security Council and the U.N. ""to speak to the facts.""

Over 1 million tons of aid have been delivered via more than 50,000 trucks and nearly 1 million land crossings, he said, adding that hardly a fraction have been stopped.

When asked about Danon's statement, Kaag pointed to recent strikes on humanitarian convoys and schools and health facilities where Israel had received prior notification.

""It's not about trucks. It's about what people need,"" she said. ""We're way, way off what people need, not only daily, but also what we would all consider a dignified human life."""
Iran's president insists Tehran wants to negotiate over its nuclear program,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/iran-nuclear-program-masoud-pezeshkian-cf64d84ddba7f1c439d513f640671ba2,2024-09-16T15:30:19Z,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's new reformist president insisted Monday that Tehran didn't want to enrich uranium at near-weapons grade levels but had been forced to by the U.S. withdrawal from its nuclear deal with world powers.

The comments by President Masoud Pezeshkian, in response to a question by The Associated Press at his first news conference, underlines a campaign promise he made to try to see international sanctions on the Islamic Republic lifted. However, it remains unclear just how much room for negotiation Pezeshkian will have -- and just who will be in the White House come next year.

""I think, we said many times, we don't want to do this at all. We want to solve our technical and scientific needs, we are not looking for nuclear weapons,"" Pezeshkian said. ""We adhered to the framework written in the (nuclear deal). We are still looking to maintain those frameworks. They tore them, they forced us to do something.""

He added: ""If they don't continue, we will not continue,""

Pezeshkian's comments came as Iran enriches uranium up to 60% purity, which is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iran long has insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, but Western nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency say Iran had a military nuclear program up until 2003.

Iran's supreme leader, the 85-year-old Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has opened the door to possible negotiations by earlier telling its civilian government there was ""no harm"" in engaging with its ""enemy."" There have been indirect talks between Iran and the U.S. in recent years mediated by Oman and Qatar, two of Washington's Middle East interlocutors when it comes to Iran.

Pezeshkian's new foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, also was deeply involved in negotiating the 2015 deal.

Meanwhile, tensions between Iran and Israel have hit a new high during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. Tehran launched an unprecedented drone and missile attack on Israel in April. A shadow war between the two countries over the years reached a climax with Israel's apparent attack on an Iranian consular building in Syria that killed two Iranian generals and others.

The July assassination in Tehran of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, suspected to have been carried out by Israel, also prompted Iran to threaten to retaliate against Israel.

Pezeshkian, meanwhile, said that Iran wouldn't give up its ballistic missile arsenal ""unless all are disarmed in our region."" He made a point to say that Israel should disarm after earlier criticizing its conduct in the ongoing war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

""We need military power for the security of our people and country,"" he said. ""We will not lose our defense power unless all are disarmed in our region. If America also respects our rights, we have no dispute. Do not sanction or threaten us, we will not be threatened.""

Yemen's Houthi rebels say they downed another US-made MQ-9 Reaper drone,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-drone-red-sea-gaza-1eb59e09351de0872de2e23cad720851,2024-09-16T10:33:29Z,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed Monday that they shot down another American-made MQ-9 Reaper drone, with video circulating online showing what appeared to be a surface-to-air missile strike and flaming wreckage strewn across the ground.

The U.S. military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Houthis' claimed downing of a drone over the country's southwestern Dhamar province. The Houthis have exaggerated claims in the past in their ongoing campaign targeting shipping in the Red Sea over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.

However, the online video bolstered the claim, particularly after two recent claims by the Houthis included no evidence.

Other videos showed armed rebels gathered around the flaming wreckage, a propeller similar to those used by the armed drone visible in the flames. One attempted to pick up a piece of the metal before dropping it due to the heat.

Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesperson, identified the drone as an MQ-9, without elaborating on how he came to the determination. He said it was the third downed by the group in a week, though the other two claims did not include similar video or other evidence. The U.S. military similarly has not acknowledged losing any aircraft.

Saree said the Houthis used a locally produced missile. However, Iran has armed the rebels with a surface-to-air missile known as the 358 for years. Iran denies arming the rebels, though Tehran-manufactured weaponry has been found on the battlefield and in seaborne shipments heading to Yemen despite a United Nations arms embargo.

Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes up to 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) and have an endurance of up to 24 hours before needing to land. The aircraft have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA over Yemen for years.

The Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well.

The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.

Those attacks include a barrage that struck the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion in the Red Sea. Salvagers have begun towing away the burning oil tanker, hoping to avoid a catastrophic leak of its 1 million barrels of oil on board."

A strike early Monday flattened a home in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza, killing at least 10 people, including four women and two children.

The Awda Hospital, which received the bodies, confirmed the toll and said another 13 people were wounded. Hospital records show that the dead included a mother, her child and her five siblings.

Another strike on a home in Gaza City killed six people, including a woman and two children, according to the Civil Defense, first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government.

Israel says it only targets militants and accuses Hamas and other armed groups of endangering civilians by operating in residential areas. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children.

The Gaza Health Ministry says over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack triggered the war nearly a year ago. It does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count but says a little over half of those killed were women and children. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence."

The Royal Court said the king has asked Jafar Hassan, a former planning minister and the current head of Abdullah's office, to form a new government.

Hassan has a Ph.D. in political science from the University of Geneva and a master's degree in public administration from Harvard University. He will replace the outgoing prime minister, Bisher Al-Khasawneh, whose Cabinet resigned on Sunday in the wake of a parliamentary election. Al-Khasawneh has served since October 2020.

Hassan must now cobble together a new Cabinet to confront a series of challenges, including a struggling economy and widespread public anger over the Israel-Hamas war. Although Jordan has a peace agreement with Israel, it's home to a large Palestinian population. In last week's parliamentary election, an Islamic party emerged as the largest faction, in part because of the anger over the war in Gaza.

In Jordan, a pro-Western monarchy, all power rests with the king. The prime minister and his Cabinet work with the king in setting and implementing policies."
Leading Lebanese novelist Elias Khoury dies at 76,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/elias-khoury-lebanon-novelist-palestinian-cause-israel-1b6e79f6a17f5d9f5dbdaf809b728653,2024-09-15T12:28:34Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Lebanese novelist Elias Khoury who dedicated much of his writings to the Palestinian cause and taught at universities around the world, making him one of Lebanon's most prominent intellectuals, has died. He was 76.

Khoury, a leading voice of Arab literature, had been ill for months and admitted and discharged from hospital several times over the past year until his death early Sunday, Al-Quds Al-Arabi daily that he worked for said.

The Lebanese writer, born and raised in Beirut, was outspoken in defense of freedom of speech and harsh criticism of dictatorships in the Middle East.

In addition to his novels, Khoury wrote articles in different Arab media outlets over the past five decades making him well known throughout the Arab world.

Two days after the Israel-Hamas war broke out on Oct. 7, Khoury wrote an article in Al-Quds A-Arab daily titled ""It's Palestine."" Khoury wrote then that ""the biggest open-air prison, the besieged Ghetto of Gaza, has launched a war against Israel, occupied settlements and forced settlers to flee.""

Born in Beirut on July 12, 1948, Khoury had been known for his political stances from his support of Palestinians to his harsh criticism of Israel and what he called its ""brutal"" settling policy in Palestinian territories. He studied at the Lebanese University and later at the University of Paris, where he received a PhD in social history.

""The Catastrophe began in 1948 and it is still going on,"" he once wrote referring to Israel's settlement policies in occupied Palestinian territories. The ""nakba,"" or ""catastrophe"" is a term used by many Arabs to describe the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians when Israel was created in 1948.

Khoury was an outspoken supporter of Arab uprisings that broke out in the region starting in 2011 and toppled several governments.

""The question is not why the Arab revolts broke out,"" Khoury wrote after uprisings that toppled long-serving leaders such as Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Tunisia's Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. ""The question is not how people tore down the wall of fear but how fear built Arab kingdoms of silence for five decades.""

Khoury, who belonged to a Greek Orthodox Christian family, took part in Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war and was wounded in one of the battles.

From 1992 until 2009, Khoury was the editor of the cultural section of Lebanon's leading An-Nahar newspaper. Until his death, he was the editor-in-chief of the Palestine Studies magazine, a bulletin issued by the Beirut-based Institute for Palestine Studies.

His first novel was published in 1975, but his second, Little Mountain, which he released in 1977 and was about Lebanon's devastating civil war was very successful.

Bab al-Shams, or Gate of the Sun, released in 2000, was about Palestinian refugees in Lebanon since 1948. A movie about the novel was made in Egypt.

His novels were translated to several languages including Hebrew.

Khoury also taught at different universities including New York University, Columbia, Princeton and Houston, as well as the University of London."
Salvagers launch new attempt to tow an oil tanker blown up by Yemen's Houthi rebels,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-red-sea-tanker-e56669ea8ea5ea9f9658cdd262c07b29,2024-09-14T09:38:38Z,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- A new attempt has begun to try to salvage an oil tanker burning in the Red Sea after attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels, a European Union naval mission said Saturday.

The EU's Operation Aspides published images dated Saturday of its vessels escorting ships heading to the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion.

The mission has ""been actively involved in this complex endeavor, by creating a secure environment, which is necessary for the tugboats to conduct the towing operation,"" the EU said.

A phone number for the mission rang unanswered Saturday.

The Sounion came under attack from the Houthis beginning Aug. 21. The vessel had been staffed by a crew of 25 Filipinos and Russians, as well as four private security personnel, who were taken by a French destroyer to nearby Djibouti.

The Houthis later planted explosives aboard the ship and detonated them. That's led to fears the ship's 1 million barrels of crude oil could spill into the Red Sea.

The Houthis have targeted more than 80 vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that also killed four sailors. One of the sunken vessels, the Tutor, went down after the Houthis planted explosives aboard it and after its crew abandoned it due to an earlier attack, the rebel group later acknowledged.

Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets.

The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran."
"AP PHOTOS: A visit to Gaza reveals rubble, tunnels and new asphalt along Egypt's border",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/gaza-philadelphi-tunnels-hostages-ceasefire-52443d91de680a7dcaa131f8f5c38f1a,2024-09-13T21:45:38Z,"RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- The Israeli military gave journalists a tour of the barren strip of land on Gaza's southern border that has become a major obstacle in talks over a cease-fire -- and to a nearby, devastated district where troops have been battling militants for months.

The escorted tour on Friday was a rare glimpse of Gaza's southern city of Rafah and the Philadelphi corridor, the narrow strip that borders Egypt and which Israeli troops seized in May. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel must keep control of it under any cease-fire deal, a demand rejected by Hamas -- and Egypt.

The corridor itself is a bleak place.

A fresh asphalt road ran along the border fence, replacing what had been a shattered route. It passed large swaths of dirt dug up by Israeli bulldozers and a few isolated piles of flattened buildings. In the distance stretched the demolished skyline of Rafah. On the other side of the border the deserts of Egypt's Sinai Peninsula were visible.

Netanyahu says a number of tunnels found in the corridor going under the border were used by Hamas to smuggle in weapons. Egypt says it sealed off all the tunnels on its side years ago.

Rafah's nearby district of Tel el-Sultan was a landscape of destruction, months into Israel's offensive in the city. Giant piles of wreckage that had once been homes of Palestinian residents lined the roads. A few shattered concrete skeletons of apartment buildings still stood.

Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said troops were still fighting Hamas militants operating from a ""maze of tunnels"" underneath the district. He showed journalists the entrance to a tunnel where he said Hamas militants killed six Israeli hostages two weeks ago as troops neared.

The military said troops had discovered the tunnel inside a home by accident when a bulldozer was operating and nearly fell into the entrance. The next day, they discovered the bodies of the six inside, shot to death.

""We are gathering all the DNA and the forensics to find and hunt those terrorists who committed this horrific crime,"" Hagari said.

Israeli forces moved into Rafah in May, forcing some 1.4 million Palestinians to flee -- including residents of Rafah and hundreds of thousands of people who had taken refuge in the area from other parts of Gaza. They are now dispersed around southern and central Gaza.

The journalists on Friday's escorted tour were unable to visit other parts of the city. Israel has barred international journalists from entering Gaza independently since the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 that sparked the war, though it has previously taken reporters on a small number of escorted visits to other parts of Gaza."
Universities of Wisconsin adopt viewpoint-neutral policy for college leaders,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/universities-of-wisconsin-viewpoint-neutral-policy-gaza-1fe96c1b3ddad97da60f81500b9e1eff,2024-09-13T16:52:39Z,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- University of Wisconsin leaders must limit their public statements to matters that affect school operations and maintain neutral viewpoints under a new policy that system administrators released Friday.

UW system spokesperson Mark Pitsch said in an email to The Associated Press that the policy will take effect immediately and doesn't need the approval of the board of regents. Asked what drove the policy's creation, Pitsch pointed to language in the policy that states the restrictions are necessary in order to uphold academic freedom and an environment where ideas can compete freely.

The move comes after UW-Milwaukee Chancellor Mark Mone struck a deal in May ending pro-Palestinian campus protests. The university agreed to call for a cease-fire in Gaza and discuss cutting ties with Israeli companies.

The deal drew intense criticism from Jewish groups. UW system President Jay Rothman also took Mone to task over the deal, posting on X that campuses need to remain viewpoint-neutral and make sure actions on campus have consequences. Rothman is trying to stay on good terms with Republicans who control the Legislature in the hopes of securing an $855 million boost for the system in the next state budget.

Republican lawmakers have complained for years that universities have become bastions of liberal thought and have been stifling conservative voices. Some in the GOP have called for federal legislation that would require colleges to protect free speech and punish those who infringe on others' rights.

Mone announced this summer that he plans to resign next July 1. He has not said specifically why he chose to step down. Like all UW chancellors, he has struggled with financial issues brought on largely by declining enrollment and relatively flat state aid. UW-Milwaukee spokesperson Angelica Duria didn't immediately respond to a Friday email seeking comment.

Under the new policy, university leaders can issue public statements only on matters that directly affect university operations and their core mission. They must maintain viewpoint neutrality whenever referencing any political or social controversy.

Any expression of support or opposition must be approved by Rothman or the school's chancellor. Statements expressing solidarity or empathy should be avoided when they imply support for one group's viewpoint over another.

The policy applies to Rothman, system vice presidents, university chancellors, provosts, vice chancellors, deans, directors, department chairs and anyone else perceived as speaking on behalf of a system institution.

The policy does not apply to faculty or staff when teaching or expressing their expertise of a situation related to their field, although they should be careful when posting such statements on university-owned channels so that they won't be construed as representing the institution's position. The policy also doesn't apply to faculty and staff's personal statements on non-university-owned channels.

The Wisconsin chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union didn't immediately reply to an email seeking comment."

A video posted on social media showed Isabella Giordano, 20, of Towson, using red spray paint to write ""Gaza"" on a fountain in front of Union Station and spray-painting the base of two of the flagpoles in Columbus Circle, according to a U.S. Park Police sergeant's affidavit.

Thousands of protesters gathered in Washington on July 24 to condemn Netanyahu's visit. A group of protesters had a permit to demonstrate in front of Union Station, but the Park Police revoked the permit after it couldn't reach protest organizers that afternoon, the affidavit says.

Some demonstrators outside Union Station removed American flags and hoisted Palestinian ones in their place. Others burned flags and sprayed graffiti on structures in Columbus Circle. The National Park Service estimated that it cost more than $11,000 to clean up the site and fix damages.

The Park Police said it received two tips from witnesses identifying Giordano as a suspect in the graffiti.

Giordano was scheduled to make her initial court appearance on Friday. She is charged with one count of willfully injuring or depredating federal property. It wasn't immediately clear if she has an attorney."
Faked video targeting France and UAE likely Russian despite Moscow's links to Gulf Arab states,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/uae-france-russia-faked-video-telegram-arrest-01da1ada6ea66df9b7818ae4a4d259f6,2024-09-13T07:16:30Z,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- A fake video that ricocheted across the internet claiming tensions between France and the United Arab Emirates after Telegram CEO Pavel Durov's detention in Paris likely came from Russia, an analysis by The Associated Press shows, despite Moscow's efforts to maintain crucial ties to the UAE.

It remains unclear why Russian operatives would choose to publish such a video falsely claiming the Emirates halted a French arms sale, which appears to be the first noticeable effort by Moscow to target the UAE with a disinformation campaign. The Emirates remains one of the few locations to still have direct flights to Moscow, while Russian money has flooded into Dubai's booming real estate market since President Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

France, however, remains one of the key backers of Ukraine and its President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as the war grinds on. Meanwhile, Russia likely remains highly interested in what happens to Telegram, an app believed to be used widely by its military in the war and one that's also been used by activists in the past. And the move comes amid concerns in the United States over Russia, Iran and China interfering in the upcoming U.S. presidential election.

Russia's Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.

The fake video began circulating online Aug. 27, bearing the logos of the Qatar-based satellite news network Al Jazeera and attempting to copy the channel's style. It falsely claimed the Emirati government had halted a previously announced purchase of 80 Rafale fighter jets from France worth 16 billion euros ($18 billion) at the time, the largest-ever French weapons contract for export. It also sought to link Dubai's ruler and his crown prince son to the decision, as Durov holds an Emirati passport and has lived in Dubai.

Such a decision, however, was never made. The UAE and France maintain close relations, with the French military operating a naval base in the country. French warplanes and personnel also are stationed in a major facility outside the Emirati capital, Abu Dhabi.

Reached for comment, Al Jazeera told the AP that the footage was ""fake and we refute this attribution to the media network."" The network never aired any such claim when reporting on Durov's detention as well, according to an AP check. On the social platform X, a note later appended by the company to some posts with the video identified it as ""manipulated media.""

The video also appeared to seek to exploit the low-level suspicion still gripping the Gulf Arab states following the yearslong Qatar diplomatic crisis by falsely attributing it to the news network. State-funded Al Jazeera has drawn criticism in the past from Gulf nations over its coverage of the 2011 Arab Spring, from the United States for airing videos from al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden and most recently in Israel, where authorities closed its operation over its coverage of the war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

The social media account that first spread the video did not respond to questions from the AP and later deleted its post. That account linked to another on the Telegram message app that repeatedly shared graphic images of dead Ukrainian soldiers and pro-Russian messages.

Such accounts have proliferated since the war began and bear the hallmark of past Russian disinformation campaigns.

In Ukraine, the Center for Countering Disinformation in Kyiv, a government project there focused on countering such Russian campaigns, told the AP that the account engaged in ""systematic cross-quoting and reposting of content"" associated with Russian state media and its government.

That indicates the account ""is aimed at an international audience for the purpose of informational influence,"" the center said. It ""probably belongs to the Russian network of subversive information activities abroad.""

Other experts assessed the video to be likely Russian disinformation.

The Emirati government declined to comment. The French Embassy in Abu Dhabi did not respond to AP's request to comment.

Durov is now free on 5 million euros bail after being questioned by French authorities and preliminarily charged for allegedly allowing Telegram to be used for criminal activity. He has disputed the charges and promised to step up efforts to fight criminality on the messaging app.

Despite the video being flagged as fake online, captions and versions of the video continue to circulate, showing the challenge of trying to refute such messages. Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov just attended a meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council in Saudi Arabia attended by the UAE. Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE have mediated prisoner exchanges amid the war.

Given those close ties, the UAE likely will or has reached out quietly to Moscow over the video, said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a research fellow at Rice University's Baker Institute who has long studied the region.

""It may be that this is a part of the Russian playbook which is to seek to create wedges between political and security partners, in a bid to create divisions and sow uncertainty,"" Ulrichsen said.

""The importance of the UAE to Russia post-2022 does make it unusual, but it may be that the campaign is aimed primarily at France and that any impact on the UAE's image and reputation is a secondary issue as far as those behind the video are concerned.""

The US and British leaders will talk about Ukraine's push to ease weapons restrictions,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/biden-starmer-ukraine-long-range-weapons-britain-8fec11abca0245d92a03291ab2d6b3fa,2024-09-13T04:08:57Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer are meeting Friday amid an intensified push by Ukraine to loosen restrictions on using weapons provided by the U.S. and Britain to strike Russia. The talks come amid signs that the White House could be moving toward a shift in its policy.

Ukrainian officials renewed their pleas to use Western-provided long-range missiles against targets deeper inside Russia during this week's visit to Kyiv by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.K. Foreign Minister David Lammy. Blinken said he had ""no doubt"" that Biden and Starmer would discuss the matter during their visit, noting the U.S. has adapted and ""will adjust as necessary"" as Russia's battlefield strategy has changed.

The language is similar to what Blinken said in May, shortly before the U.S. allowed Ukraine to use American-provided weapons just inside Russian territory. The distance has been largely limited to cross-border targets deemed a direct threat out of concerns about further escalating the conflict.

While the issue is expected to be at the top of the leaders' agenda, it appeared unlikely that Biden and Starmer would announce any policy changes during this week's visit, according to two U.S. officials familiar with planning for the leaders' talks who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.

In addition to Blinken, Biden also has hinted a change could be afoot. In an exchange with reporters earlier this week about whether he was ready to ease weapons restrictions on Ukraine, he responded, ""We're working that out now.""

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has pressed U.S. and allied military leaders to go much further. He argues that the U.S. must allow Ukraine to target Russian air bases and launch sites far from the border as Russia has stepped up assaults on Ukraine's electricity grid and utilities ahead of the coming winter.

Zelenskyy also wants more long-range weaponry from the United States, including the Army Tactical Missile System, known as ATACMS, for strikes in Russia.

ATACMS wouldn't be the answer to the main threat Ukraine faces from long-range Russian glide bombs, which are being fired from more than 300 kilometers (185 miles) away, beyond the ATACMS' reach, said Lt. Col. Charlie Dietz, Pentagon spokesman.

American officials also don't believe they have enough of the weapon systems available to provide Ukraine with the number to make a substantive difference to conditions on the ground, one of the U.S. officials said.

During a meeting of allied defense ministers last week, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said he did not believe providing Ukraine with long-range weapon systems would be a game-changer in the grueling war. He noted that Ukraine has already been able to strike inside Russia with its own internally produced systems, including drones.

""I don't believe one capability is going to be decisive, and I stand by that comment,"" Austin said.

Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, would not say Thursday if Austin's views had changed since last week: ""As of right now, the policy has not changed.""

Starmer said he was visiting Washington for ""strategic meetings to discuss Ukraine and to discuss the Middle East."" It's the prime minister's second meeting with Biden since his center-left government was elected in July.

It comes after Britain last week diverged from the U.S. by suspending some arms exports to Israel because of the risk they could be used to break international law. Both countries have downplayed their differences over the issue.

Biden and Starmer's meeting also comes ahead of this month's annual meeting of global leaders at the United Nations General Assembly. The Oval Office meeting was scheduled in part to help the two leaders compare notes on the war in Ukraine, languishing efforts to get a cease-fire deal in Gaza and other issues ahead of the U.N. meeting.

The White House also has sought in recent days to put a greater emphasis on the nexus between the war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East sparked after Iranian-backed Hamas militants in Gaza launched attacks on Israel on Oct. 7.

The Biden administration said this week that Iran recently delivered short-range ballistic weapons to Russia to use against Ukraine, a transfer that White House officials worry will allow Russia to use more of its arsenal for targets far beyond the Ukrainian front line while employing Iranian warheads for closer-range targets.

In turn, the U.S. administration says Russia has been tightening its relationship with Iran, including by providing it with nuclear and space technology.

""This is obviously deeply concerning,"" White House national security spokesman John Kirby said of the missile transfer. ""And it certainly speaks to the manner in which this partnership threatens European security and how it illustrates Iran's destabilizing influence now reaches well beyond the Middle East.""

US backs 2 permanent seats for African nations on the UN Security Council,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/un-security-council-expansion-africa-us-54d1a31c24229b40a2103e08f36e52b9,2024-09-12T23:55:52Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States announced Thursday that it will support the addition of two new permanent seats for African countries on the powerful U.N. Security Council -- and a first-ever non-permanent seat for a small island developing nation.

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield made the announcement in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations, calling it a follow-up to U.S. President Joe Biden's announcement two years ago that the U.S. supports expanding the 15-member body.

While Africa has three non-permanent seats on the Security Council, that doesn't allow African countries ""to deliver the full benefit of their knowledge and voices,"" she said.

""That is why, in addition to non-permanent membership for African countries, the United States supports creating two permanent seats for Africa on the council,"" Thomas-Greenfield said. ""It's what our African partners seek, and it's what we believe is just.""

However, a senior U.S. administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to brief reporters ahead of the announcement, said Washington doesn't think any new permanent members should have veto power because ""extending the veto would lead to only greater deadlock on the council.""

That view shows the limits in the amount of power that Washington wants to give to any other country. While Security Council resolutions are legally binding, they are often ignored by targeted countries.

Virtually all countries agree that nearly eight decades after the United Nations was established in the wake of World War II, the Security Council should be expanded to reflect the world in the 21st century and include more voices. But the central question -- and the biggest disagreement -- remains how to do it.

The Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security, has not changed from its 1945 configuration: 10 non-permanent members from all regions of the world elected for two-year terms without veto power and five countries that were dominant powers at the end of World War II are permanent members with veto power: the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France.

Russia's veto power, for instance, has stymied any council action on the war in Ukraine and U.S. support for its ally Israel has limited the council's response to the war in Gaza.

Attempts to reform the council to reflect the changing world began in 1979.

In 2005, world leaders called for the council to be ""more broadly representative, efficient and transparent."" That year, the General Assembly, which must approve any council reforms, shelved three rival resolutions to expand its membership, a reflection of deep divisions that have continued until today.

In September 2022, Biden called for increasing the number of both permanent and non-permanent members, including ""permanent seats for those nations we've long supported, and permanent seats for countries in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean."" The United States has long supported permanent seats for Germany, Japan and India.

Thomas-Greenfield made no mention of Biden's other pledge about permanent seats for countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. But the official said the U.S. still supports permanent seats for Latin America and the Caribbean as well as Africa.

Responding to countries arguing that it's time for the U.N. to look beyond just regional representation, the U.S. ambassador also announced that the United States is supporting the creation of an additional rotating seat for small island developing countries.

""These 39 states are not a monolith. They are home to 65 million people, across over 1,000 islands,"" she said. ""But each has critical insights on a range of international peace and security issues including, notably, the impact of climate change.""

In another announcement, Thomas-Greenfield said the United States plans ""to actually put our principles on paper"" and draft a resolution to reform the council.

Some countries argue that before negotiating a resolution, ""all 193 member states need to be in agreement about what a reformed council should look like,"" she said.

""I'm an optimist. But I'm also a realist. And the reality is this: no amount of conversation will ever get us to a place of total consensus on this issue,"" Thomas-Greenfield said.

US approves $165 million in weapons sales to Israel for 2027 delivery,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-weapons-us-tank-trailers-b5882a9ed12ad9d2ffe0a48a297f0424,2024-09-12T21:33:25Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. has approved $165 million in weapons sales to Israel to fund heavy-duty tank trailers, the State Department announced Thursday.

The systems include spare and repair parts, tool kits and technical and logistics support. They are not expected to be delivered until 2027.

Earlier this year, the U.S. announced a mammoth $20 billion weapons support package for Israel to include F-15 fighter jets. Like the tank trailers, those systems will not be delivered for several years and will not affect current Israeli military operations amid its 11-month-old war against Hamas militants in Gaza.

The Biden administration has had to balance its continued support for Israel with a growing number of calls from lawmakers and the public to curb military support there due to the high number of civilian deaths in Gaza.

It has curbed one delivery of 2,000-pound bombs amid continued airstrikes by Israel in densely populated civilian areas in Gaza."
Father of Turkish-American activist wants US probe into her killing by Israeli soldiers,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/turkish-american-activist-father-probe-53b7214f0a18f85b56644cc9170e8e2a,2024-09-12T18:16:28Z,"DIDIM, Turkey (AP) -- The father of the Turkish-American activist killed by Israeli soldiers in the occupied West Bank on Thursday welcomed Turkey's decision to initiate an independent investigation into her death and called on the United States to do the same.

Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, who held Turkey and American citizenship, was killed last Friday during demonstrations against settlements in the West Bank. A witness who was there, Israeli protester Jonathan Pollak, said she posed no threat to Israeli forces and that the shooting came during a moment of calm, following clashes between stone-throwing protesters and Israeli troops firing tear gas and bullets.

Turkey's Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc announced Thursday that Turkey had launched its own investigation into her death days after the Israeli military said in a preliminary report that Eygi was likely shot ""indirectly and unintentionally"" by its soldiers.

Mehmet Suat Eygi, who is based in Seattle but spoke in western Turkey, said he was very happy to learn that Turkey had opened an investigation into what he called the ""arbitrary murder"" of his daughter.

""I hope that the American government does the same,"" he said.

He said his daughter was 10 months old when the family left Turkey for the United States. ""She studied in the schools there, she grew up with freedoms there. She is a citizen of that country,"" he said. ""I hope the American government will show the same sensitivity.""

He was speaking in the Aegean coastal town of Didim, where Eygi used to come for vacations and spend time with family members - and where she is expected to be buried. Eygi's grandfather's home - and the street where the house is located - was adorned with Turkish flags - an honor usually bestowed to Turkish soldiers killed in conflict.

The Ankara chief prosecutor's office was leading the Turkish probe, Tunc said, adding that Turkey would seek international arrest warrants for those responsible for her death. He also said Turkey would present findings to a U.N. court overseeing a genocide case against Israel filed by South Africa over the war in Gaza.

""We will take every judicial step for our martyred daughter, Aysenur,"" Tunc said.

Mehmet Suat Eygi said his daughter was a ""special person"" who cared about nature and human rights and traveled to Brazil, Australia and Mexico to campaign for environmental and human rights issues.

Eygi, who attended Seattle schools and graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in psychology this year, was married and was financially comfortable, her father said. ""She could have enjoyed a comfortable life, but she pursued her ideals. She left everything and went to the hell of the Middle East. She was that idealistic,"" Eygi said.

Another relative, Ali Tikkin, told The Associated Press that Eygi's family believes she was deliberately targeted by Israeli soldiers.

""There was no error or accident,"" he said. ""I think it was a message to the world.""

Tikkin, who is married to Eygi's aunt, described the activist as a ""free-spirited person"" who began traveling the world on her own at an early age.

""Even at the age of 18 or 19, she went to different countries of the world on her own. First she started traveling out of curiosity. Later she took part in organizations by the United Nations,"" he said. ""She was sensitive to events happening around the world.""

Turkish Foreign Ministry officials said Eygi's body was expected to be flown from Tel Aviv to Baku, Azerbaijan and arrive in Turkey on Friday. Burial was likely to take place on Saturday.

US cites Egypt's help in Gaza as Washington sends full military aid despite human rights concerns,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/egypt-us-military-aid-human-rights-blinken-416c7e79e287c8ff937ba7b7a0be515d,2024-09-12T17:56:06Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden administration is sending Egypt its full $1.3 billion allocation of military aid, setting aside conditions placed by Congress on some of the money over human rights concerns and citing Cairo's role as a mediator in the Israel-Hamas war.

The State Department said Secretary of State Antony Blinken used his authority to waive those conditions on $225 million, saying the move is important for Mideast stability and Egypt's ability to help with U.S. national security priorities, including trying to broker a cease-fire and hostage deal in Gaza and increasing humanitarian assistance for Palestinians in the territory.

Blinken also told Congress this week that Egypt has made progress in freeing political prisoners and preventing Americans from being harassed, meeting benchmarks to gain $95 million in assistance.

""The United States is also continuing a rigorous dialogue with the Egyptian government on the importance of concrete human rights improvements that are crucial to sustaining the strongest possible U.S.-Egypt partnership,"" the State Department said.

The decision shows the weight given to Egypt's role as a key mediator in a conflict that threatens to expand into a regionwide war and pose risks to the U.S., even as allegations persist that President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi's government is behind a litany of human rights abuses.

The State Department and rights groups have said those allegations include numerous credible reports of arbitrary killings, torture and detention as well as systematic repression of civil society, free press and free expression. The U.S. withheld $85 million last year from the Egyptian government and $130 million in 2022.

Human Rights Watch says el-Sissi's administration has released hundreds of detainees but has arrested many more, and that thousands journalists, activists and others are still behind bars.

Democratic Sens. Chris Coons of Delaware and Chris Murphy of Connecticut decried the release of the millions of dollars, saying Egypt has failed to make progress.

""Over the last year, for every single political prisoner Egypt has released, it has jailed two more,"" they said in a statement. ""That's not clear and consistent progress -- it's one step forward and two steps back.""

Murphy, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee with oversight of the Mideast, said the U.S. has been able to maintain strategic ties with Egypt when withholding money before over human rights concerns. He said he saw no reason for the change now when ""it's no secret that Egypt remains a deeply repressive autocratic state.""

The State Department points to steps that Egypt has taken, including releasing over 950 political prisoners since September 2023 and moving forward with a proposal to reform pretrial detention. But the department said it made clear to Egyptian officials that ""more action is needed.""

El-Sissi has previously denied that his country has political prisoners and he justified government measures by saying they are needed to fight the spread of terrorism."
"The Palestinian economy is in free fall and will require billions to rebuild, the UN says",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/palestinian-economy-gaza-west-bank-unctad-israel-513fb2859f4732f198434116b649d959,2024-09-12T14:27:43Z,"GENEVA (AP) -- The Palestinian economy is ""in free fall,"" the United Nations reported Thursday, with production in Gaza plunging to one-sixth of its level before Israeli forces began a blistering military response to the Oct. 7 attacks in the territory.

The report from UN Trade and Development also warned of ""rapid and alarming economic decline"" in the West Bank, citing expanded Israeli settlements, land confiscations, demolition of Palestinian buildings and violence by settlers.

The report made no mention of corruption in Palestinian institutions,

""The Palestinian economy is in free fall,"" Pedro Manuel Moreno, the agency's deputy secretary-general, told reporters in Geneva. ""The report calls for the international community to halt this economic free fall, address the humanitarian crisis, and lay the groundwork for lasting peace and development.""

That would include a ""comprehensive recovery plan"" for Palestinian areas, more international aid, the lifting of Israel's blockade on Gaza, and the release of revenues and withheld funds for Palestinians retained by Israel, he said.

With violence continuing, there's little sign of any recovery plan being launched anytime soon.

Mutasim Elagraa, who coordinates the agency's assistance to Palestinians, said: ""If we want to return Gaza to pre-October 2023, we need tens of billions of dollars, or even more, and decades.""

The ultimate goal is ""to put Gaza on a path of sustainable development,"" which will take more time and money, he said.

Economic output in Gaza plunged to just over $221 million in the half-year including the last quarter of 2023 and first quarter of 2024 -- the last quarter for which figures are available -- or about 16% of the total figure for the same half-year period in 2022 and 2023, when the total was just over $1.34 billion, the agency said.

Meanwhile, more than 300,000 jobs in the West Bank -- home to some 3 million Palestinians -- have been lost, driving unemployment rates up to 32%, up from under 13% before the conflict, the agency reported.

By early this year, as much as 96% of Gaza's farming assets, including livestock farms, orchards, machinery and storage facilities, had been ""decimated,"" the agency, also known as UNCTAD, said.

Over 80% of businesses were damaged or destroyed, and the damage has continued to worsen, it said.

Israel's offensive in Gaza has killed at least 41,084 Palestinians and wounded another 95,029, the territory's Health Ministry said. The ministry's count does not differentiate between civilians and militants.

Israel launched its campaign vowing to destroy the Palestinian group Hamas after the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel in which militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted 250 others."
EU top diplomat urges Lebanon and Israel to ease tensions along their border,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/josep-borrell-lebanon-israel-hezbollah-border-5c3266b8f9e9cafa239db6129b8d6756,2024-09-12T12:38:08Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- The European Union's top diplomat on Thursday urged Lebanon and Israel to work on deescalating tensions along the border, saying that since his last trip to the region in January ""the drums of war have not stopped pounding.""

The comments of Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, came as members of the militant Hezbollah group and Israel's military carried out cross border attacks along the tense frontier on Thursday.

Western and Arab officials have visited Beirut over the past year to try to reduce tensions along the Lebanon-Israel border, but Hezbollah officials have said they will only stop carrying out attacks along the border when Israel stops its offensive in the Gaza Strip.

""Since I lasted visited Lebanon in January the drums of war have not stopped pounding,"" Borrell told reporters in Beirut during a joint press conference with Lebanon's Foreign Minister Abdallah Bouhabib. ""Since then the fears I was outlining have been growing, more escalation, fears of a spillover of the war in Gaza and fears of more widespread human suffering.""

In late August, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah pulled back after an exchange of heavy fire that briefly raised fears of an all-out war.

Borrell said that according to the United Nations more than 4,000 residential buildings have been completely destroyed in Lebanon and more than 110,000 Lebanese have been forced to leave their homes along the border. He said the same thing is happening on the Israeli side of the border.

The European official said that his message is that the European Union ""stands on the side of the Lebanese people to help to overcome the threats and challenges as much as we can.""

More than 500 people have been killed in Lebanon by Israeli strikes since Oct. 8, most of them fighters with Hezbollah and other armed groups but also more than 100 civilians. In northern Israel, 23 soldiers and 26 civilians have been killed by strikes from Lebanon.

""We need to deescalate military tensions and I use this opportunity to urge all sides to pursue this path,"" said Borrell, who on Tuesday visited U.N. peacekeepers deployed in southern Lebanon along the border with Israel.

He added that the ""full and asymmetrical implementation"" of the U.N. Security Council resolution that ended the summer 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war should pave the way for a comprehensive settlement including land border demarcation and allowing the return of people and reconstruction in the affected border areas.

""The European Union is doing a lot but we don't have a magic wand,"" he said."

Meanwhile, a Syrian pro-government media outlet and an opposition war monitor say an Israeli strike hit a car in southern Syria on Thursday, killing two people.

The developments came a day after Israeli airstrikes across Gaza killed dozens more Palestinians, according to local officials. Strikes on a U.N. school being used as a shelter and two homes killed at least 34 people in the Palestinian territory on Wednesday, including 19 women and children, they said.

The Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the Israel-Hamas war began. It does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count. The war has caused vast destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million, often multiple times.

Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in their Oct. 7 attack that sparked the war. They abducted another 250 and are still holding around 100. Around a third of them are believed to be dead.

Here's the latest:

ANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey's justice minister says his country is investigating the death of a Turkish-American activist shot and killed by Israeli forces last week while protesting settlements in the occupied West Bank.

The 26-year-old activist from Seattle was taking part in a demonstration against settlements in the Palestinian territory when she was fatally shot last Friday. Israel is investigating the killing of Aysenur Ezgi Eygi and its military later said she was likely shot ""indirectly and unintentionally"" by soldiers.

Turkish Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said on Thursday that the Ankara chief prosecutor's office was leading the Turkish probe. He also called on U.N. agencies, including the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, to investigate.

Tunc said Turkey would present its findings to a U.N. court overseeing a genocide case against Israel filed by South Africa over the war in Gaza.

""We will take every judicial step for our martyred daughter, Aysenur,"" Tunc said.

Meanwhile, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said Eygi's body was likely to be brought to Turkey on Friday. Her burial is scheduled to take place in the Aegean coastal town of Didim, in western Turkey, in line with her family's wishes.

BEIRUT -- A Syrian pro-government radio and a war-monitoring group say an Israeli strike hit a car in southern Syria, killing two people. The Sham FM didn't give further details on the Thursday morning strike on the village of Khan Arnabeh, near Syria's Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitor, also reported that two people were killed in the airstrike, without giving further details.

There was no immediate comment from Israel, which has carried out such airstrikes over the past months on the edge of the Golan Heights, captured by Israel during the 1967 Mideast war and annexed in 1981. Israel says it is targeting Iran-linked militants.

Israel has vowed to stop Iranian entrenchment in Syria, where thousands of Iran-backed fighters are deployed. Syria is a key route for Iran to send weapons to Lebanon's Hezbollah group."
US aircraft carrier in the Middle East is heading home,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/navy-carrier-israel-hamas-middle-east-64833ca78aad930ae77dd87c17f48085,2024-09-11T23:29:50Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon's rare move to keep two Navy aircraft carriers in the Middle East over the past several weeks has now finished, as the USS Theodore Roosevelt is heading home, according to U.S. officials.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had ordered the Roosevelt to extend its deployment for a short time and remain in the region as the USS Abraham Lincoln was pushed to get to the area more quickly. The Biden administration beefed up the U.S. military presence there to help defend Israel from possible attacks by Iran and its proxies and to safeguard U.S. troops.

U.S. commanders in the Middle East have long argued that the presence of a U.S. aircraft carrier and the warships accompanying it has been an effective deterrent in the region, particularly for Iran. Since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip began last fall, there has been a persistent carrier presence in and around the region -- and for short periods they have overlapped to have two of the carriers there at the same time.

Prior to last fall, however, it had been years since the U.S. had committed that much warship power to the region.

The decision to bring the Roosevelt home comes as the war in Gaza has dragged on for 11 months, with tens of thousands of people dead, and international efforts to mediate a cease-fire between Israel and the Hamas militant group have repeatedly stalled as they accuse each other of making additional and unacceptable demands.

For a number of months earlier this year the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower remained in the Red Sea, able both to respond to help Israel and to defend commercial and military ships from attacks by the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen. The carrier, based in Norfolk, Virginia, returned home after an over eight-month deployment in combat that the Navy said was the most intense since World War II.

U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss troop movements, said the San Diego-based Roosevelt and the USS Daniel Inouye, a destroyer, are expected to be in the Indo-Pacific Command's region on Thursday. The other destroyer in the strike group, the USS Russell, had already left the Middle East and has been operating in the South China Sea.

The Lincoln, which is now in the Gulf of Oman with several other warships, arrived in the Middle East about three weeks ago, allowing it to overlap with the Roosevelt until now.

There also are a number of U.S. ships in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and two destroyers and the guided missile submarine USS Georgia are in the Red Sea."

The Israeli military said it was targeting Hamas militants planning attacks from inside the school, located in the Nuseirat refugee camp. The claim could not be independently confirmed.

Officials from Awda Hospital in Nuseirat said they had received 10 dead from the strike, and another four dead were brought to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah. At least one woman and two children were among those killed, and at least 18 people were wounded in the strike, hospital officials said.

One of the children was the daughter of Momin Selmi, a member of Gaza's civil defense agency, which works rescuing wounded and bodies after strikes, the agency said in a statement. Selmi hadn't seen his daughter for 10 months, since he remained in north Gaza to keep working while his family fled south, the agency said.

Tens of thousands of Palestinians driven from their homes by Israeli offensives and evacuation orders are living in Gaza's schools.

The school hit Thursday -- called the al-Jaouni Boys Preparatory School, one of the many in Gaza run by the U.N. agency for Palestinians UNWRA -- has been hit by multiple strikes over the course of the war.

Israel frequently bombs schools, saying they are being used by Hamas militants. It blames Hamas for civilian casualties from its strikes, saying its fighters base themselves and operate among civilians.

More than 90% of Gaza's school buildings have been severely or partially damaged in strikes, and more than half the schools housing displaced people have been hit, according to a survey in July by the Education Cluster, a collection of aid groups led by UNICEF and Save the Children.

Israel's 11-month-old campaign in Gaza has killed at least 41,084 Palestinians and wounded another 95,029, the territory's Health Ministry said Wednesday.

Here's the latest:

RAMALLAH, West Bank -- An Israeli airstrike has killed five Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian officials say.

The Israeli military said it targeted a group of militants in the northern city of Tubas early Wednesday.

The Palestinian Health Ministry in the West Bank confirmed the toll but does not say whether those killed by Israeli fire are militants or civilians.

Israel has stepped up its military raids across the territory in recent weeks and says it is working to dismantle militant groups and prevent attacks. Palestinians say such operations are aimed at cementing Israel's seemingly open-ended military rule over the territory.

Israel captured the West Bank, along with east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. The West Bank has seen a surge in violence since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack out of Gaza ignited the war there.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Palestinian officials say Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip have killed at least 20 people, including 16 women and children.

An airstrike early Wednesday killed 11 people, including six siblings ranging from 21 months to 21 years old, according to the European Hospital, which received the casualties. The dead from the strike near the southern city of Khan Younis included three other women, a child and a man, according to the hospital.

A strike late Tuesday on a home in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza killed nine people, including six women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry and the Civil Defense first responders. The Civil Defense says the home belonged to Akram al-Najjar, a professor at the al-Quds Open University, who survived the strike.

Israel says it only targets militants, claiming 17,000 militant deaths without providing evidence. It blames civilian deaths on Hamas because its fighters are embedded in dense residential neighborhoods. The military rarely comments on individual strikes, which often kill women and children.

The Health Ministry says Israel's offensive, launched in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, has killed at least 41,020 Palestinians in Gaza and wounded nearly 95,000. It does not distinguish between fighters and civilians but says more than half of those killed were women and children.

Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, on Oct. 7 and abducted around 250. Around 100 hostages are still held in Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead."
Iran's new president travels to neighboring Iraq on his first trip abroad,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/iraq-iran-israel-hamas-pezeshkian-d5c2c12315d76e3e7a6607886452bca0,2024-09-11T05:41:09Z,"BAGHDAD (AP) -- Iran's reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian traveled to Iraq on Wednesday on his first trip abroad, hoping to cement Tehran's ties to Baghdad as regional tensions increasingly pull both countries into the widening Middle East fray.

For Iran, its relationship with Iraq remains crucial for economic, political and religious reasons -- something that has especially been true since the U.S.-led 2003 invasion of Iraq toppled dictator Saddam Hussein, who launched a bloody, yearslong war against Iran in the 1980s.

Baghdad, meanwhile, has been trying to balance its relationship with Tehran, which backs powerful Shiite militias in the country, as well as with the United States, which maintains a force of 2,500 troops in Iraq that remain in battle with remnants of the once-dominant extremist Islamic State group.

The American troops remain both a literal and rhetoric target for Iran, particularly as Israel's nearly year-old war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip grinds on. Just before Pezeshkian's arrival, an explosion struck a site near Baghdad International Airport used by the U.S. military Tuesday night. The circumstances of the explosion were not clear and there was no immediate information on damages or casualties.

Pezeshkian, who was sworn in as Iran's new president in July, is also scheduled to visit Shiite shrines in the cities of Karbala and Najaf, a railroad project to link the southern city of Basra to Iran and Irbil, the capital of Iraq's semiautonomous northern Kurdish region.

Ahead of the trip, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told an Iraqi television channel that Pezeshkian hoped to tighten security relations with Baghdad, as well as economic ties.

""We want to see Iraq develop, grow, be prosperous and strong on our borders, and any economic project that achieves this goal enjoys our support,"" Araghchi told Al-Furat Television, owned by Iraqi Shiite cleric and politician Ammar al-Hakim.

Still, there have been tensions between Iran and Iraq, particularly after Iranian missiles hit sites in Iraq in attacks over the past six years, targeting Kurdish militias, a base housing American forces and also what Tehran alleged were Israeli sites in Iraq.

Iran also fired missiles and flew drones over Iraq in its unprecedented direct attack on Israel in April. That attack followed a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus, Syria, that killed two Iranian generals and five officers, as well as a member of the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah, an Iranian ally.

The Islamic Republic has also threatened further retaliation against Israel over the July assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, which could include another missile barrage.

For Iraq, close ties with the Shiite powerhouse next door are also needed to maintain Baghdad's supply of imported Iranian natural gas to meet its electricity needs. A barter deal for Iraqi crude oil has seen the supply continue, though U.S. sanctions targeting Tehran over its rapidly advancing nuclear program have put pressure on Baghdad.

Meanwhile Tuesday, the United States and Britain formally accused Iran of supplying short-range ballistic missiles to Russia to use against Ukraine, announcing new sanctions on both Moscow and Tehran.

The continued presence of U.S. troops in Iraq remains a concern for Iran. Since the Israel-Hamas war broke out on Oct. 7, Iraqi militias allied with Iran have targeted U.S. forces here, leading to American airstrikes targeting the militias.

Iraqi politicians continue to debate the issue of whether to back having American troops remain in the country.

"To pumped-up Democrats, Harris was everything Biden was not in confronting Trump in debate",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/debate-trump-harris-2024-election-biden-319079a18ea993066bea750b57f6e0fa,2024-09-11T04:48:12Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- To many Democrats, Kamala Harris was everything Joe Biden was not in confronting Donald Trump on the debate stage: forceful, fleet of foot, relentless in going after her opponent.

In a pivot from Biden's debate meltdown in June, Democrats who gathered in bars, watch parties and other venues Tuesday night found lots to cheer in her drive to rattle the Republican.

In a race for the White House that surveys say is exceptionally close, with both sides looking for an edge, it was the Democrats who came away more exuberant after the nationally televised debate.

""She prosecuted Donald Trump tonight,"" said Alina Taylor, 51, a high school special education teacher who joined hundreds of people on a football field of the historically Black Salem Baptist Church of Abington in a suburb of Philadelphia, where people watched on a 33-foot (10 meter) screen.

As for Trump, she said, ""I was appalled"" by his performance. ""People were laughing at him because he wasn't making very much sense.""

In Seattle, people gathered at Massive, a queer nightclub where scores watched the debate on a projector set up in front of the club's large disco ball. The crowd laughed and cheered when Trump branded Harris a Marxist. More cheers when the debate moderator called out Trump's false claim that some states legalize the killing of babies after birth.

""He's getting smoked,"" one said.

But in Brentwood, Tennessee, Sarah Frances Morris heard nothing at her watch party to shake her support of Trump.

""I think he beat her on the border,"" she said. ""I think he also beat her on actually having plans and letting the American people know what those are. And I think that Kamala Harris likes to mention that she has plans for things, but she doesn't actually ever elaborate on what those plans are.""

Morris conceded she was watching history being made, ""because we have our first Black woman running for president."" But, she added, ""I don't think she delivered to get her to that place she needed to be.""

Harris supporter Dushant Puri, 19, a UC Berkeley student, said the vice president took command before the first words were spoken -- when she crossed the stage to shake Trump's hand. ""I thought that was pretty significant,"" Puri said. ""It was their first interaction, and I thought Harris was asserting herself.""

At the same watch party, fellow student Angel Aldaco, 21, said that unlike Biden, Harris ""came in with a plan and was more concise.""

Aldaco was struck by one of the night's oddest moments, when Trump ""went on that rampage about eating pets."" That's when Trump endorsed a baseless conspiracy theory that immigrants were stealing and eating people's dogs ands cats. Harris was incredulous. ""That was good,"" the student said.

It's questionable how much viewers learned about what Harris would do as president or whether she won over independents or wavering Republicans. But for some Democrats, despondent if not panicked after Biden's fumbling debate performance, it was enough to see a Democratic candidate getting seriously under Trump's skin.

""He is pretty incapable when he is riled up,"" said Ikenna Amilo, an accountant at a Democratic watch party in a small concert venue in downtown Portland, Maine.

""When you poke him, he is really reactive and he doesn't show the temperament you want in a president, so I think Kamala has shown she's doing a good job.""

Democrat Natasha Salas, 63, of Highland, Indiana, saw the debate from an Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority watch party at a bistro in Markham, Illinois, and welcomed Harris' call to cool the political temperature -- even as the vice president denounced Trump at every turn.

""We all want the same things, Democrats and Republicans,"" Salas said. ""We are more alike than different. I want to see the country move forward and less divisiveness.""

Interest in the debate transcended national borders. From a shelter for migrants in Tijuana, Mexico, where dozens watched a translated version of the debates on a television, Rakan al Muhana, 40, an asylum-seeker from Gaza, became animated when the candidates discussed Israel and Palestine.

""We are running from the war,"" he said. ""We are running from the Israeli bombs. He (Trump) doesn't see us as human. My daughter, who is four months -- for him, she's a terrorist.""

Al Muhana has been on a four-month journey from Gaza to this border city, with his wife and four children. They left when both his mother and father were killed in a bombing.

New president of UN General Assembly calls for unity to tackle borderless issues,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/un-general-assembly-president-nations-divided-unite-a673ebcb75612063f8445ed50ac05998,2024-09-11T01:08:51Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Cameroon's former prime minister took over the presidency of the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, issuing ""a clarion call"" to the world's divided nations to come together and take action to address global challenges from climate change and poverty to conflicts and armed violence.

Philemon Yang told the 193-member world body there are doubts that nations can join forces to tackle these and other pressing issues. But he said: ""We must demonstrate that international cooperation remains the most effective tool at our disposal for addressing the profound and borderless issues we confront.""

Yang, a former diplomat who was prime minister of his West African nation from 2009 to 2019, said the cornerstone of his one-year presidency ""will be built on the principles of unity in diversity.""

He said peace and security will continue to be ""of paramount importance"" during his presidency.

""This is why, I will urge the assembly to intensify its determination to prioritize the resolution of conflicts, including the intractable ones in the Gaza Strip, Haiti, and Ukraine, as well as find durable solutions to the situation in the Great Lakes region and elsewhere in Africa,"" Yang said.

Outgoing General Assembly President Dennis Francis urged the United Nations, which was established on the ashes of World War II, to rise to meet its mandate -- to maintain international peace and security.

""It is no understatement to say that the magnitude of manmade human suffering we are witnessing around the world is simply staggering,"" the former diplomat and ambassador from Trinidad and Tobago said, pointing to Gaza and other conflicts.

But Francis also warned that millions of people live in abject poverty and hopelessness today, and ""On our current trajectory, millions more will face poverty and hunger by 2030.""

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also focused on the need for nations to work together.

He said the 78th session of the General Assembly, which ended Tuesday morning, was ""a tumultuous year"" of continued poverty, inequality, injustice, division, violence and conflict -- and it was also the hottest year on record.

""But this session also closes at a time of growing hope and inspiration in what we can achieve if we work as one,"" the U.N. chief said.

At Tuesday afternoon's opening of the 79th assembly session, Guterres told diplomats: ""Step by step, solution by solution, we can rebuild trust and faith in one another, and in what we can accomplish through collaboration and solidarity.""

Yang will preside at the upcoming gathering of world leaders at the General Assembly, first at the Summit of the Future on Sept. 22-23 called by the secretary-general to spur multilateral action on global issues -- and reform global institutions founded after World War II including the United Nations.

Immediately after the summit ends, world leaders will hold their annual global meeting from Sept. 24-30, with public speeches in the assembly and lots of private meetings where a lot of the world's business often gets done."
"Patricia Heaton rips college campuses for allowing antisemitism, calls on Christians to visually support Jews",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/patricia-heaton-rips-college-campuses-allowing-antisemitism-calls-on-christians-visually-support-jews,2024-10-12T14:42:11Z,"Patricia Heaton partnered with international organization MyZuzah to activate Christians in verbally and vocally supporting Jews by adding a mezuzah to their door frames.

American actress Patricia Heaton is standing firm in her activism and leveraging her platform as a well-known star to bring awareness to the state of antisemitism across the U.S., especially on college campuses, and encourage Christians to visibly and vocally support Jews around the globe.

Heaton formed the October 7th Coalition (O7C) to activate Christians as supportive stewards of Jewish people and the right for Israel to exist and to fight antisemitism in the U.S.

""I grew up very, very Catholic, and I have a healthy fear of God,"" Heaton told Fox News Digital during a video interview. ""I do think about facing the Lord and answering for how I used what he gave me in service, especially to the Jewish people, to his chosen people.""

PATRICIA HEATON LEADS FIGHTBACK CAMPAIGN AGAINST ANTISEMITISM ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES: 'HAVE TO STAND UP'

Since founding the grassroots nonprofit, Heaton has partnered with MyZuzah, an international organization that delivers Jewish people mezuzahs free of charge to promote the #Myzuzah/Yourzuzah campaign.

""We've had such a response, and this isn't going away anytime soon,"" Heaton said of the Israel-Hamas war.

A well-received response from Jews around the world who said they feel safe and unified with Christians encouraged Heaton to continue her efforts to promote the movement.

""We need to spread that feeling,"" she said.

The ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" actress expressed scorn for federally funded college administrations that allow Jewish students in America to feel their religious rights are under attack by allowing antisemitic acts on campuses.

ACTRESS PATRICIA HEATON RALLIES CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY TO FIGHT ANTISEMITISM: 'IT'S UP TO US' TO DO SOMETHING

""What we've seen on college campuses from the administration has been horrendous, that they are not willing to support Jewish students,"" she told Fox News Digital.

""I believe that if a campus allows this to continue that they should lose their federal funding because they're breaking the law.

""It's the law that you should be able to express yourself in this way. People with all different agendas and political belief systems are expressing themselves fully and loudly all the time, including students for 'Justice in Palestine,' and they're doing it in a very violent way. And there doesn't seem to be any pushback for them.""

Today, Heaton is encouraging university students to purchase and hang a Solidarity Mezuzah on a door frame. The encasement reveals a yellow ribbon that calls for the safe return of Israeli hostages who were captured Oct. 7, 2023, and are still held captive in Gaza over 365 days later.

Christians can show their support by filming a video of themselves hanging the mezuzah, tagging Heaton in the social media post and using #MyZuzahYourZuzah and #SpartacusMoment.

PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTEST BREAKS OUT INSIDE SENATE OFFICE BUILDING

""When everybody has them on their door, I think it sends the message that we're not going to stand for it,"" she said to Fox News Digital.

Amid the terror attacks inflicted on innocent Israeli civilians Oct. 7, 2023, Heaton said she watched social media in horror as Hamas terrorists ""gleefully"" captured, abused and violated Israeli men, women and children and shared their war crimes with the world.

""It was so shocking,"" she said. ""I remember thinking to myself, 'Well, there's going to be outrage. There's going to be almost a George Floyd uprising over this because this is incredibly, insanely horrifying,' and I didn't see any response.""

The lack of outrage among Hollywood elites and churches inspired Heaton to initiate a response herself. Since then, she has connected Jews and Christians in Nashville, south of Miami, Los Angeles and Dallas. Heaton added that she received calls from Jewish federations around the world hoping to work with her to bring people together.

ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS SHUT DOWN SENATE CAFETERIA; AROUND 50 ARRESTED

""I don't know why it affected me so much and not other people,"" Heaton said. ""I think people were horrified, but they think of it as something happening way over there in that foreign country that has nothing to do with us.""

Hollywood, in particular, jolted Heaton because she expected an uprising of Jewish support from celebrities.

""Every other single movement or event that happened that caused a national response, Hollywood was first in line,"" Heaton said. ""Given that so many of our fellow coworkers in Hollywood are Jewish, you would think that we'd all be circling the wagons for our Jewish friends in Hollywood.""

Heaton took aim at the commotion at the 2024 Academy Awards, where well-known members of the entertainment industry adorned their embellished attire with anti-Israel red hand pins.

The pins are a symbol of ""brutality and human depravity,"" according to Anne Bayefsky, president of Human Rights Voices and director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust.

""I was stunned,"" Heaton said to Fox News Digital. ""I thought, 'Are they that stupid?' I hope it's that they're really stupid, because then you can forgive them for, 'Oh you don't understand what that means.' If they know what it means, and they wear that pin, then they're evil. They're evil. So, I hope they're just stupid."""
"Hunter Biden legal saga is 'real war' that 'preoccupied' outgoing president, new Woodward book claims",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hunter-biden-legal-saga-real-war-preoccupied-outgoing-president-new-woodward-book-claims,2024-10-11T13:40:07Z,"Hunter Biden's effort to seek government help for work is discussed on 'Special Report.'

President Joe Biden's decision to exit the presidential race in July was motivated in no small part by the high-profile struggles that plagued his son, Hunter Biden, in the final years of his first term -- leaving him with a ""crushing"" sense of guilt that those close to the outgoing president say plagued him more than the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.

In his new book, ""War,"" famed Watergate reporter Bob Woodward offers readers an intimate look inside both the Trump and Biden presidencies at some of their most vulnerable moments; offering a rare, split-screen view into the thinking of two very different leaders as they stared down some of the biggest foreign policy challenges and security risks in modern memory.

Fox News obtained an early copy of the book ahead of its release next week.

Woodward's book captures the more intimate moments of both presidencies, as well. For Biden, this includes the aftermath of his disastrous performance at the first presidential debate in June -- watched by an estimated 51 million people -- and the torrent of pressure it unleashed within the Democratic Party for Biden to exit the race.

Among party leaders and donors, it crystallized long-held fears that Biden, 81, was no longer fit to hold his own in a second match-up against Donald Trump. Their panic was matched only by their sense of urgency and the ticking clock they had to select a suitable nominee.

BIDEN WON'T PARDON HUNTER, WHITE HOUSE REAFFIRMS, BUT CRITICS AREN'T SO SURE

As Woodward reports, Biden struggled mightily to accept that consensus -- first, by attempting to brush off his catastrophic performance as a bad night and an event he could recover from in the months ahead. The tsunami of pressure on him to drop out only got stronger.

In fact, according to Woodward, Biden was leaning in the direction of staying in the race on July 4, when he met with Secretary of State Antony Blinken for a private lunch. Blinken, who had shown up to the lunch prepared for a difficult conversation, told Woodward that Biden still believed he could win a second term as president -- a title he had chased all his life and finally achieved.

In his telling, among the factors ultimately driving his decision to bow out was the scrutiny and legal troubles surrounding his son Hunter.

The toll his son's troubles had taken was apparent when the two met, Woodward reports. Blinken, in his telling, spoke frankly to Biden about dropping out. ""I don't want to see your legacy jeopardized,"" he said.

'60 MINUTES' DEFENDS HANDLING OF HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP COVERAGE AS IT HITS TRUMP FOR SKIPPING INTERVIEW

Sensing little headway, Blinken then tried a different approach. ""Do you really want to be doing this for the next four years?"" he asked.

Biden's first term included overseeing the U.S. recovery from a global pandemic, the first war on European soil since World War II, and the start of Israel's wars in Gaza and Lebanon. Each day was charged with turmoil and lasting consequence. And yet, those close to Biden say it was his younger son, Hunter Biden, whose struggles seemed to weigh most heavily on the president.

Hunter's troubles are described in the book as Biden's ""real war"": a constant source of preoccupation for the president, who was constantly fighting against his fatherly instincts to protect his son, his ""beautiful boy,"" as he called him -- and to reconcile the deep sense of guilt he felt, in knowing his presidency had been a driving factor behind much of the scrutiny surrounding his son.

POLITICAL STORM: ON TRUMP 'ONSLAUGHT OF LIES,' BIDEN URGES FORMER PRESIDENT TO 'GET A LIFE, MAN'

For Biden, this knowledge left him heartbroken"" and affected him more than the major crises playing out abroad in Europe and the Middle East, sources told Woodward took the president ""off an even keel,"" preoccupied him and taken ""a lot out of him.""

In describing the president's inner turmoil to Woodward, Blinken himself teared up, thinking of his own relationships with two young children.

Biden, Blinken explained, ""desperately"" wanted to pull Hunter ""out of the abyss"" -- to reel him in, to protect him -- but his attempts and best efforts had failed.

The book does not detail the extent to which Hunter's legal woes and investigations were directly involved in the president's decision to step down, which was likely the result of myriad factors, internal party pressures, and deeply personal considerations. The White House did not respond to Fox News's request for comment on the matter.

The book offers an unflinching look at one of the president's most emotionally difficult struggles, one which staying in the race would have ultimately exacerbated.

Ta-Nehisi Coates doesn't know if he would be 'strong enough' to oppose Oct. 7 if he were a Gazan,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/ta-nehisi-coates-doesnt-know-he-would-strong-enough-oppose-oct-7-he-were-gazan,2024-10-11T12:32:51Z,"Fox News media analyst Howard Kurtz unpacks the turmoil at CBS News on Special Report.

Author Ta-Nehisi Coates admitted he doesn't know if he would have been ""strong enough"" to not take part in the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attack last year.

""I haven't said this out loud, but I think about it a lot. Were I 20 years old, born into Gaza, which is a giant open-air jail, and what I mean by that is if my father is a fisherman and he goes too far out into the sea, he might be shot. Yeah. By somebody off, you know, the side of Israeli boats,"" Coates began on Trevor Noah's ""What Now?"" podcast Wednesday.

He continued, ""If my mother picks the olive trees and she gets too close to the wall, she might be shot. If my little sister has cancer and she needs treatment because there are no facilities to do that in Gaza and I don't get the right permit, she might die.""

""And I grow up under that oppression and that poverty and the wall comes down. Am I also strong enough or even constructed in such a way where I say this is too far? I don't know that I am,"" Coates concluded.

CBS BOSS BACKS NEWS NETWORK LEADERSHIP AFTER PARENT COMPANY CHAIR DISAPPROVED OF ITS HANDLING OF TONY DOKOUPIL

Coates acknowledged the sentiment was ""human history"" and ""not unique to Palestine,"" comparing it to slavery in the United States.

""The example I think about all the time is like Nat Turner, right? Like Nat Turner launches his rebellion in 1830. This man slaughters babies in their cribs. You know what I mean? Like, and I've done this thought experience experiment for myself over and over. Does the degradation and dehumanization of slavery make it so that you can look past something like that?"" Coates asked.

He continued, ""And I try to imagine and I think I can accurately imagine as much as possible that there were enslaved people, no matter how dehumanized, that said, 'This is too far. I can't do that.' Now, here's the flip side of it.""

Coates mostly addressed the viral CBS News interview with anchor Tony Dokoupil, admitting he was expecting a ""fight"" on the issue at some point.

""Like I was like, you've been, you know, like shadowboxing and waiting for a fight, and you see somebody throw the left that you've seen your sparring partner throw like a thousand times by that. And I figured at some point it was going to be a fight. You know, I didn't know it was going to be right then, but I figured at some point it was going to be a fight,"" Coates said.

Last week, ""CBS Mornings"" anchor Tony Dokoupil confronted him about his anti-Israel sentiment.

""I have to say, when I read the book, I imagine if I took your name out of it, took away the awards, the acclaim, took the cover off the book, publishing house goes away, the content of that section would not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist,"" Dokoupil said.

""So then I found myself wondering, why does Ta-Nehisi Coates, who I've known for a long time, read his work for a long time, very talented, smart guy, leave out so much? Why leave out that Israel is surrounded by countries that want to eliminate it? Why leave out that Israel deals with terror groups that want to eliminate it? Why not detail anything of the first and the second Intifada, the café bombings, the bus bombings, the little kids blown to bits. Is it because you just don't believe that Israel in any condition has a right to exist?"" the CBS anchor continued.

The Free Press later reported the network held a staff meeting Monday to address staff members offended by Dokoupil's questions, concluding that they did not meet ""editorial standards."""
Here's how the US has helped a tiny fraction of its citizens evacuate war-torn Lebanon,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-evacuating-americans-out-lebanon,2024-10-11T11:20:06Z,"Israeli troops from the 98th brigade storm Hezbollah strongholds in southern Lebanon. (Video: IDF.)

As bombing intensifies around Beirut, only a tiny fraction of the 86,000 Americans and green card holders who reside in Lebanon have been evacuated with U.S. help.

The State Department says it's made some 5,000 seats available on both commercial and chartered flights for U.S. citizens, but there's a catch: they have to get to the airport amid regular bombings on their own, and many may have to leave family behind.

That's what's led to only around a quarter of those seats being filled by 1,100 U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents and family members flying out across 10 U.S.-organized flights, according to advocates.

Since July, the U.S. has had a level 4 ""do not travel"" advisory for Lebanon encouraging citizens to get out.

On Sept. 27, the State Department said it would not be evacuating Americans, prompting airlines to charge exorbitant prices - between $5,000 and $8,000 per seat. The department then back peddled and said it would help organize flights at reasonable rates.

Some 8,500 U.S. citizens have reached out to the U.S. embassy in Beirut for information and assistance in evacuating.

""We're going to continue the flights for the time being because we do assess that there is demand,"" said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller. ""We believe we have a duty to do everything we can to help American citizens get out of the country.""

1 YEAR AFTER HEZBOLLAH STRIKES, ISRAEL REINFORCES TROOPS AND QUESTIONS MOUNT OVER 'LIMITED' OPERATION

But human rights attorney Maria Kari says those efforts are futile without a noncombatant evacuation operation (NEO) to bring in U.S. forces to get Americans out.

""The writing was on the wall several months ago that the situation in Lebanon was going to start disintegrating,"" she told Fox News Digital.

Kari said many of the U.S. citizens and green card holders in Lebanon she works with have family members who do not hold U.S. passports and refuse to leave the region without a parent or a child.

""The Beirut embassy has made it very clear they're not processing any new visa applications,"" she said.

Kari said the U.S. needs to extend the same protections it did to Israeli Americans who were looking to escape the region after Oct. 7 - allow immediate family members of U.S. citizens to get visas.

To the State Department, she said: ""You're not talking about how you're contributing to the problem of why these flights are not filling up. You're not talking about how it's not safe to get to the airport, key sites around the airport, including the road and the residential building by the airport, were bombed in the last few days, right?""

The only international airport in Beirut is less than three miles from where Hezbollah is headquartered.

When citizens contact the embassy, they get a response similar to the one shared with Fox News Digital: ""We are only assisting U.S. citizens currently in Lebanon and their immediate family members who have a valid U.S. or Schengen visa at this time. A valid visa is required to enter the United States. Lebanese passport holders can travel to Türkiye without a visa.""

""It's absolutely absurd that the U.S. thinks it's OK to take out Americans and their non-American relatives and drop them off in Turkey - a foreign government not responsible for Americans or Lebanese citizens,"" she said. ""Just another example of this administration's failure to protect Americans, first in Gaza and now in Lebanon.""

BIDEN AND NETANYAHU SPEAK AFTER REPORT US PRESIDENT CALLED ISRAELI COUNTERPART A 'BAD F---ING GUY'

On Oct. 19, 2023, the U.S. government created a Visa Waiver Program for family members of Israeli Americans who looked to flee with their loved ones as war broke out.

""We did the right thing there. We have failed consistently to do the right thing for another class of American citizens and their relatives,"" said Kari.

The security situation in Lebanon is rapidly deteriorating amid Israel's ground incursion to the home of Hezbollah, but the Biden administration has not yet determined it necessary to declare a noncombatant evacuation to bring in U.S. forces to get Americans out.

It calls to mind Israel's 2006 incursion into Lebanon, when the U.S. brought in service members to secure safe passage out of Lebanon for some 15,000 U.S. citizens. That time, the IDF bombed Beirut's international airport and its roadways.

""The airport is open, but it's not open indefinitely. Israel did strike directly at the airport last time. I'm sure that they're under pressure not to this time, but the pressure is no longer really working for the White House right now,"" said Zev Faintuch, head of research and intelligence at international security firm Global Guardian.

Some 2,000 have been killed in Israeli attacks on the country, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry. It's not clear how many of those were Hezbollah militants, but the figure includes 127 children and 261 women.

The fighting has sent some 1.2 million - roughly a quarter of the country's population - fleeing.

The Israeli military said it hit about 185 Hezbollah targets on Tuesday, as Lebanon reported dozens of people killed in Israeli airstrikes.

On Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it struck southern suburbs in Beirut to target a ""weapons productions facility and a Hezbollah intelligence headquarters.""

Israeli airstrikes killed Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and now his successor, too, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu."

""It is the longstanding policy of the Harvard University Police Department to not comment on open investigations,"" a department spokesman said.

Unity of Fields also published photos showing the campus of UMass Amherst defaced with pro-Palestinian graffiti.

An anonymous submission posted by the group accused UMass Amherst of being ""complicit in genocide through its partnerships with Raytheon and other war profiteers.""

""At their engineering career fair, both Raytheon and General Dynamics were present. Both are weapons manufacturers that are heavily complicit in genocide.

The anonymous message warned readers to expect more ""autonomous actions at UMass Amherst.""

""We will not rest until war profiteers are gone, and Palestine is fully liberated,"" the message concluded.

A spokesperson for UMass Amherst told Fox News Digital that the university ""is aware of incidents that are being investigated by UMass Police.""

""Beyond that, we do not comment on investigations,"" the spokesperson said.

It's unclear what affiliation, if any, the perpetrators had with either Harvard or UMass Amhest.

Both incidents raise the specter of renewed anti-Israel protests that swept college campuses during the spring semester. The National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) is orchestrating a nationwide ""Week of Rage"" on campuses beginning on the Oct. 7 anniversary.

Monday marked one year since Hamas terrorists stormed into Israel, killing nearly 1,200 people and taking hundreds more hostage. Israel responded by waging a war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, where the fighting has claimed the lives of an estimated 41,000 Palestinians and displaced nearly 2 million people.

Battleground Dem warns traditional voting bloc being 'split' in 2024,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/battleground-dem-warns-traditional-voting-bloc-being-split-2024,2024-10-10T15:50:38Z,"Former Democrat Melissa Chapman explains why she doesn't feel President Biden and Democrats have her best interests at heart and why she feels the Republican party is the better option.

Kamala Harris' most likely path to the presidency hinges on her winning the swing state of Michigan - but with just weeks left until Election Day, she is facing an unexpected groundswell of opposition from the state's Jewish population, which has increasingly soured on the Biden administration's response to the Middle East conflict.

The drop-off in support among Jewish voters could spell trouble for Harris in Michigan, considered to be a must-win state, and where the state's Muslim and Arab American populations have been increasingly vocal about their disapproval of the U.S. response to Israel's wars in Gaza and Lebanon.

Now, discontent now appears to be spreading to the state's Jewish voters as well, threatening a key bedrock of support in the state.

IDF MEETS LITTLE RESISTANCE FROM HEZBOLLAH AFTER WEEKS OF HITTING TERROR TARGETS, OFFICIALS SAY

Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., whose suburban Detroit district is home to a large Jewish American population, told the New York Times this week that she has seen a drop-off in support for Harris among younger Jewish voters who are disenfranchised by the Biden administration's handling of the Middle East crisis and failure to take stronger action on a policy reset in the region.

Stevens told the Times that the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that Hamas launched on Israel have indeed rallied some Jewish constituents together to combat what they see as rising hatred and antisemitism. But she noted that other, younger voters in the community are turned off by the administration's unwavering support for Israel in the face of the intensifying conflict - policies enacted under the Biden administration, but which Harris must now confront as the party's presidential nominee.

GEORGIA'S MUSLIM VOTERS OPPOSING HARRIS, TRUMP IN ELECTION OVER BOTH CANDIDATES' SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL

Nearly two-thirds of Michigan's Jewish electorate identifies as Democratic or Democratic-leaning, according to data collected by Brandeis University's Steinhardt Social Research Institute. In previous elections, this majority has been a fairly reliable bedrock of support for Democratic presidential nominees.

But that support is anything but guaranteed this year. ""I do know some more independent-type voters, and I have heard from friends with young families, of friends of theirs who have traditionally voted Democrat, that they feel a little split,"" Stevens told the Times.

This loss of support among Jewish voters in the state could be particularly damaging to Harris' chances of victory in Michigan and her broader path to the presidency, which hinges on victory in the key battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Still, it's Michigan where Harris could find herself in particularly hot water.

As the violence in the Middle East escalates, Harris has struggled to earn the support of Michigan's Muslim and Arab American populations, including some who have organized local voters to withhold support for the vice president in order to protest the Biden administration's response to the war.

In recent months, some groups have urged communities to back Green Party candidate Jill Stein, while others said they are weighing the idea of backing Republican candidate Donald Trump - an almost unthinkable position just four years ago, when the former president's so-called ""Muslim ban"" and other policies prompted Muslim voters to support Joe Biden by a strong 64% to 84% majority in 2020, according to exit polls."

""Let's go IDF,"" he said.

Jewish Breaking News first posted the interaction on its Instagram account.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are locked in a battle with Hamas and Hezbollah and have been since Hamas terrorists launched a sadistic attack in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. As Hezbollah fired rockets from Lebanon into Israel, the IDF has also responded against the regime.

Seinfeld, who is Jewish, was among a number of Hollywood stars to condemn colleagues for hesitating to call out Hamas' attacks on Israel, as well as the noticeable rise in antisemitism that followed.

Details of the phone call between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday, in which Jerusalem's pending response to Iran's attack last week was discussed, remain limited.

A readout of the call noted Biden's ""ironclad commitment to Israel's security,"" adding that Biden ""condemned unequivocally Iran's ballistic missile attack against Israel on October 1st.""

Prior to the readout, when asked about the details of the discussion, Vice President Kamala Harris - who sat in on the call - said she could not discuss ""private diplomatic conversations,"" telling CNN it was ""an important call.""

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was also short on any details, saying that the pair ""continued their discussion on a response to Iran's attack"" and that it was a ""straightforward, honest conversation.""

IRAN POSED TO OVERWHELM US BASES IN GULF FORMER CENTCOM COMMANDER WARNS

Following the attack by Tehran, in which the U.S. helped defend Israel against the more than 180 missiles fired at it, Netanyahu vowed to make Iran ""pay,"" prompting immediate speculation over what the counterattack would look like.

No casualties were reported in Israel, though one Palestinian was killed in the West Bank, and Biden has urged Netanyahu to issue nothing more than a ""proportionate"" counterstrike.

However, speculation has mounted over the type of attack Israel could hit Iran with, and security analysts have begun reviewing strike options that range from hitting military sites, infrastructure important to the Iranian regime like oil refineries and ports, to even an attack on Iran's expanding nuclear program.

According to an assessment by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), Iran has more than a dozen nuclear installations across the country, including uranium mines, fuel enrichment plants, a reactor and heavy water production plant, as well as several weaponization facilities - all of which could be in Israel's crosshairs.

However, the U.S. has warned the Israeli prime minister against attacking Iranian nuclear or oil facilities over concerns it could prompt a regional war.

Following Iran's attack in April, during which it levied some 300 missiles and drones at Israel, Jerusalem responded to Western calls for restraint by hitting Iran's air defenses and destroying part of an S-300 long-range air defense system.

However, the precision strike, seemingly muted compared to the missile launch levied by Iran, likely sent a loud message to Tehran after Israel successfully hit one of Iran's most coveted defense systems, strategically placed in between its nuclear sites.

The S-300 system was permanently deployed at the Isfahan Air Base, just 60 miles south of the Natanz enrichment plant and less than 10 miles north of the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center, two sites supposedly at the core of Iran's nuclear program, according a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

However, even given the significance of the previous hit, one expert suspects Jerusalem's response this time will be more ""public,"" even as Israel continues to butt heads with its biggest ally, the U.S.

""It is unknown what target, or in what order, or with what exact political verse military goal in mind, Israel may choose to strike back at the Islamic Republic,"" expert on Iran-Israel security matters and senior fellow with the FDD, Behnam Ben Taleblu, told Fox News Digital.

""What seems certain, however, is that Israel is intent on returning fire and likely in a larger and more public fashion than it did in April,"" he said, adding it remains likely that Israel again goes after Iran's air and missile defense capabilities.

NETANYAHU CONFIRMS NASRALLAH'S REPLACEMENT DEAD: 'THOUSANDS OF TERRORISTS' KILLED

Tension between the U.S. and Israel has been brewing for months over mounting concerns about the number of civilian deaths in the Gaza Strip, and reports suggested last month the U.S. was kept in the dark over Israel's alleged pager operation against Hezbollah in late September in which some three dozen terrorists were killed and 3,000 others were injured.

Additionally, Washington fervently warned Israel against any ground incursion into Lebanon, though Jerusalem ignored the international calls to ease fighting and argued its operations against Hezbollah were required to ensure the safe return of 60,000 citizens forced to evacuate from their homes near the border.

Despite U.S. objections over the ground incursion in Lebanon, the U.S. reinforced its troops in the region to better defend Israel ahead of the Iranian attack.

Questions over how the U.S. will support or respond to an Israeli attack on Iran remains as unclear as the type of retaliatory strike Jerusalem will throw at Iran.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant on Wednesday issued an ominous warning to Iran and said, ""Our strike will be powerful, precise, and above all - surprising. They will not understand what happened and how it happened.""

Ben Taleblu said Israel's forthcoming decision on what it decides to strike will ""tell analysts a great deal if Israel envisions this to be an operation verses a campaign,"" as well as serve as an indicator as to how involved the Biden administration was in the counterattack.

""Israeli military planners, in my estimation, are likely to be exploring options that enable them to do as much damage while keeping the U.S. on board,"" he said. ""But Israel's ability to signal the vulnerability of Tehran's nuclear weapons enterprise through other and more creative means ought not to be minimized."""

President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke by phone on Wednesday for the first time in more than 50 days.

It came after fresh tensions emerged in their relationship: Netanyahu refused to approve his Defense Minister Yoav Gallant's trip to the U.S. on Tuesday until Biden called him.

The call came together in short order after that.

Netanyahu spoke with former President Trump earlier Wednesday before he spoke with Biden. Vice President Kamala Harris joined the call along with the president.

It comes as Israel has been weighing its options to retaliate for the barrage of missiles Iran fired toward the Jewish state last week.

Gallant warned on Wednesday the Israeli response was sure to catch Iran by surprise.

""As we have shown until now in this war and in all arenas - whoever attacks Israel will pay a price. Our strike will be powerful, precise, and above all - surprising. They will not understand what happened and how it happened,"" he told the IDF's intelligence unit in a briefing.

Biden has warned Netanyahu to make sure his response is ""proportional"" and to avoid hitting Iran's nuclear facilities.

The longtime relationship between the two men soured in the months that followed the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks.

Further indication of their mutual disdain came on the one-year anniversary of the attacks, when Biden called Israeli President Isaac Herzog over Netanyahu.

HOPE FADES FOR A DEAL TO BRING HOSTAGES HOME

Since the world leaders' last call, Israel has launched an aggressive offensive operation in Lebanon, and successfully taken out top Hezbollah leadership over a short timeframe.

Israeli airstrikes killed the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and now his successor too, according to Netanyahu.

Netanyahu is also known to be distrusting of his defense minister, who he's tried to fire twice. Gallant has publicly criticized Netanyahu for not articulating a postwar plan for Gaza.

In a particularly heated April phone call, Biden asked Netanyahu, ""What's your strategy, man?"" according to Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward in his new book, ""War.""

Netanyahu, at the time, said Israel had to go into Rafah, a Gaza-Egypt border city, that he claimed to be a Hamas stronghold.

""Bibi, you've got no strategy,"" Biden reportedly told Netanyahu, who he also allegedly claimed ""doesn't give a damn"" about Hamas and ""only about himself.""

After Israel entered Rafah, Biden said of Netanyahu: ""He's a f---ing liar.""

""That son of a b----, Bibi Netanyahu, he's a bad guy,"" said Biden privately, according to Woodward. ""He's a bad f---ing guy!""

"'Feeling threatened': Jewish students at New York protests speak against antisemitism, reflect on Oct. 7",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/feeling-threatened-jewish-students-new-york-protests-against-antisemitism-oct-7,2024-10-09T16:29:23Z,"Jewish students at the October 7 anniversary protests in New York city spoke with Fox News Digital about their thoughts on Israel and antisemitism.

Jewish students who witnessed the massive anti-Israel protests in New York City on Monday offered strong messages of support for the Israeli people and spoke out against antisemitism on college campuses.

Sam, a student at New York University (NYU), told Fox News Digital that he and his Jewish friends were ""completely engulfed"" by anti-Israel protesters within 20 minutes of arriving at Washington Square Park.

Sam and his fellow Jewish students were not harmed during the event, and they thanked the New York Police Department (NYPD) for keeping them safe.

During the ""Within Our Lifetime"" protest at the park, anti-Israel demonstrators engaged in chants that called for Israeli citizens to ""go back home"" and criticized Jewish students when they gathered to sing Hebrew hymns.

ONE YEAR AFTER 10/7 ATTACKS AND DEMOCRAT-RUN STATES HAVE LET ANTISEMITISM FESTER

Police in the area successfully kept the opposing protest groups at bay, often breaking up tense arguments and erecting barricades to separate them. During one tense exchange, two anti-Israel protesters held up an Israeli flag to Jewish students before placing it on the ground. They proceeded to stomp and kick the flag a few feet from one of the barricades.

Later, an anti-Israel protester repeatedly blew a loud air horn into the face of a Jewish student, who eventually put on noise-canceling headphones to drown out the sound.

Sam told Fox News Digital that he feels heard and respected at NYU. However, he noted that feeling does not hold true outside the classroom.

""That doesn't reflect 100 feet out of the classroom up to the park or when I'm walking,"" he said. ""If I have any Jewish symbols on - on Friday nights I wear a Kippah. I'm yelled at. Sometimes, people will make rude comments to me in passing.""

AS OCTOBER 7TH ANNIVERSARY APPROACHES, JEWISH STUDENTS BRACE FOR PROTESTS, VOW TO 'WALK PROUDLY'

University of Pittsburgh student Racheli told Fox News Digital that she traveled over five hours from Pennsylvania to support Jewish students facing antisemitism and show them they are ""not alone.""

""College is supposed to be a time of community and learning - but instead they're feeling threatened in their own campuses,"" she said.

Racheli solemnly revealed that two of her elementary school classmates were murdered during the Nova Music Festival terrorist attack by Hamas on October 7, 2023.

""The only thing that Israel has ever done is protect its people, and they have the right to exist, and we want to exist in peace with all around us,"" she added.

ON OCT. 7 ANNIVERSARY, WE REMEMBER THIS BETRAYAL OF SILENCE

Sam also weighed in on the October 7 anniversary, calling it the most ""tragic"" attack against Jewish people since the Holocaust.

""October 6 was the last night we went to sleep with a full heart. Since then, it's been devastation. It's been every day, constant tragedy,"" he continued.

The 2023 attack perpetrated by Hamas terrorists killed 1,200 people in the worst day of violence against Jews since the Holocaust. Hamas also took hundreds of hostages.

Harris was pressed by ""The Late Show"" host to explain how close the administration has come to successfully brokering a peace deal in the Israel-Hamas war.

""We've been told that a cease-fire deal was very close several times,"" Colbert asked Harris. ""What does that mean? What does 'close' mean?""

""Close means that a lot of the details had been worked out but details remained,"" Harris responded. ""There has been some progress but it is meaningless unless a deal is actually reached.""

""The reality of it is 1,200 people [were] massacred, there are still hostages being held in Gaza. I've met with the families of hostages both who are alive and who have died. I've met with families of Palestinians who have been killed, innocent people who have been killed in Gaza.""

""There is pain, pain and suffering that is happening in that region of the world, and we must work, and the United States must work and not lose hope and not throw up our hands around the role we must play in urging and seeking and building toward a resolution,"" Harris said.

"As Gaza war drags past 1 year mark, hope fades for a deal to bring hostages home soon",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gaza-war-israeli-hostage-deal-hope-fades,2024-10-09T13:50:50Z,"WARNING: Graphic footage -- Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of an American held hostage in Gaza, reflects on Hamas' Oct. 7 attack one year later and efforts to bring his son home on 'Your World.'

For a year now, freeing the hostages taken by Hamas has been a top goal for Israel, but 101 still remain unaccounted for. Hope of a deal to get them home in the foreseeable future is waning quickly.

Of the 240 people taken hostage from Israel by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, 117 have either been freed during temporary truces or rescued during Israel Defense Forces (IDF) missions. Dozens of the 101 who have not been freed are believed to be dead.

Four Americans - Keith Siegel, 65, Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, Omer Neutra, 22, and Edan Alexander, 21 - remain trapped among them.

Many hostage families have lost faith in the U.S. and Israeli governments. ""We don't believe that Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu's priority is to bring home the hostages,"" Hannaha Siegel, Keith Siegel's niece, told CNN on Monday.

""The ability to negotiate with [Hamas Leader Yaya] Sinwar to try to get the hostages that remain alive out is extremely unlikely,"" said Mark Schwartz, a retired Army general and former U.S. security coordinator for Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

""There's no strategic benefit at all for Hamas. The hostages are useful human shields and getting several hundred Palestinians out of prisons, big deal,"" he said, referring to a potential prisoner exchange. ""That's not going to extend the life of Hamas leadership that resides inside Gaza.""

KAMALA HARRIS COURTS DISILLUSIONED ARAB AMERICANS OVER JEWISH VOTERS, RECORDS SHOW

President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have for months implored Netanyahu to agree to a cease-fire deal that would see the hostages returned home.

However, as war spread from Gaza to Lebanon to Tel Aviv - and with Israel considering an aggressive response to Iran's most recent missile attack - U.S. calls for a cease-fire increasingly rattle around an empty echo chamber.

""The mood is poor right now,"" said Michael Makovsky, president of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America.

""What's in Sinwar's interest to make a deal? Hamas' military capability is pretty much destroyed. I don't think he thinks he's ever going to get out alive. I don't think he necessarily wants to leave Gaza alive anyway.""

Sinwar, Hamas' shadowy leader and the architect of the Oct. 7 attacks, is believed to be alive and still committed to the destruction of Israel.

HARRIS WON'T SAY WHETHER BIDEN ADMIN HAS ANY 'SWAY' OVER NETANYAHU

On the eve of the anniversary of the attacks, Netanyahu held his first meeting on the plight of the hostages in a month. According to The Times of Israel, his officials warned him intel on the hostages was quickly drying up. They reportedly told him they believed half of the hostages remained alive and were subject to increasingly squalid conditions. They also warned that Hamas militants were under orders to execute them if they felt the IDF was closing in on their position.

Hamas executed six hostages in a tunnel in Rafah in August as the IDF drew near.

""You want to hold out hope for someone to be rescued, but for a hostage deal, it's not looking good,"" said Makovsky.

""I think Netanyahu should have demonstrated more sympathy towards the hostages early on, and then it became kind of entrenched that half the Israeli electorate didn't like him anyway, so he didn't care.

""In fairness to him, he was the prime minister that cut what turned out to be a terrible deal - which they released over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners - for one Israeli hostage in Gaza,"" added Makovsky. ""One of those prisoners was Sinwar.""

In 2011, Israel agreed to an exchange where it released 1,027 Palestinian prisoners - including Sinwar - for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Sinwar was 22 years into four life sentences he received in Israel for orchestrating the killing of two Israeli soldiers and four Palestinians he believed to be collaborators in 1989.

Gershon Baskin, who led negotiations on that deal, said he believes Hamas is ready to strike an agreement - and it is not the one U.S. officials have worked on for months.

""It would end the war in three weeks with an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. They would release and return all the hostages, military, civilian, alive and dead, and there would be an agreed-upon release of Palestinian prisoners. Hamas has agreed to me in writing that they would transfer the governance in Gaza to a civilian, technocratic, professional government, which they will not be part of.""

Critics of such ideas say they fall short of eliminating Hamas, which could rebuild itself and once again threaten Israel.

Baskin does not work on behalf of Israel or Hamas in any official capacity, but he said U.S. officials are aware of the offer and need to pressure Netanyahu and Hamas to work it out between themselves.

In May, Biden unveiled a three-phase deal that would see Hamas return 18-32 hostages in exchange for 800 Palestinian prisoners and a six-week pause in fighting.

""It's a bad deal, and I know that the American leadership - [CIA Director Bill] Burns and [White House Middle East coordinator Brett] McGurk and others have invested themselves deeply in these negotiations, but they need to simply recognize that it's not going anywhere,"" Baskin said. ""It's a dead deal, and they need to pick up another deal that might actually work.""

""Free, free Palestine!"" others shouted, while waving the Palestinian flag.

Yael and Adi, who live in New Jersey, met with Trump while he was in the Big Apple to pay tribute to the somber anniversary of the terror attack.

""I just told him about Edan, what kind of a Jersey boy he is. I told the president that people that [were] rescue[d] in mid-November, saw Edan inside the tunnels, and they told me that he was speaking with them, tell[ing] everyone that he's an American citizen,"" Yael recalled.

Alexander touted the American government for its effort to secure the release of American hostages, and urged the Israeli government to do the same.

""We have a great amount of access to the highest level of the government, and we are really grateful,"" he explained.

Edan is one of four Americans still being held in Gaza. Hamas is also holding the bodies of three Americans.

""In October 2023, under the darkening shadow of the U.S.-backed Israeli project of Palestinian annihilation, the Abandon Harris campaign - formerly Abandon Biden - was born. Our movement remains dedicated to ensuring that the American people, especially the Muslim-American community, recognize the responsibility we share in standing up against oppression and using all our power to stop genocide - wherever it may arise,"" the group declared in a press release.

""Hamas's terrorist attack on October 7 launched a war in Gaza. I am heartbroken over the scale of death and destruction in Gaza over the past year - tens of thousands of lives lost, children fleeing for safety over and over again, mothers and fathers struggling to obtain food, water, and medicine. It is far past time for a hostage and ceasefire deal to end the suffering of innocent people. And I will always fight for the Palestinian people to be able to realize their right to dignity, freedom, security, and self-determination,"" Harris said in the statement."
Islamic group calls out Jets for firing Robert Saleh after wearing Lebanon pin amid Israel war,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/islamic-group-calls-out-jets-firing-robert-saleh-after-wearing-lebanon-pin-amid-israel-war,2024-10-08T21:12:39Z,"Emmanuel Acho reacts to the New York Jets firing HC Robert Saleh after a 20-36 record and 2-3 start this season.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) released a statement on Tuesday addressing the firing of former New York Jets head coach Robert Saleh.

CAIR called on the Jets and owner Woody Johnson to explain reports that Saleh was escorted out of the building by security following his firing, and also brought up the fact that Saleh was fired just days after wearing a pin with the Lebanese flag amid ongoing attacks on the nation by Israel.

Saleh is of Lebanese descent and was the first Muslim head coach in NFL history.

""We commend Coach Robert Saleh for making history as the first American Muslim head coach in NFL history. Although no one should jump to conclusions about why the Jets fired Coach Saleh, the report that Jets security physically escorted Saleh out of the building does raise concerns about the possible motive for such unusual hostility -- especially given that Saleh wore a Lebanese flag pin at a game just days ago and that owner Woody Johnson is a former Trump administration official who has been accused of making racially charged remarks. We encourage the Jets to thoroughly explain its unusually hostile reported treatment of Coach Saleh,"" the statement read.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the Jets for comment multiple times but has not received a response at the time of publication.

Both of Saleh's parents were born in Lebanon and immigrated to the United States ahead of his birth in 1979. Saleh previously wore the Lebanese flag on his arm during a game against the Giants, just weeks after Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

Saleh wore that patch during the week that NFL executive vice president of club business Peter O'Reilly released a statement encouraging players to represent their heritage via decals to the back of their helmets with their flags, while coaches added a patch to their team gear.

Saleh's decision to wear the patch in London on Sunday came amid Israel's ongoing strikes on Lebanon and Gaza as it seeks to combat Hamas and Hezbollah.

CAIR's point that Johnson ""has been accused of making racially charged remarks,"" references an investigation in 2020 that never confirmed whether Johnson made those remarks. Johnson was accused of making racist and sexist comments to staff while serving as an ambassador to the United Kingdom under the Trump administration. Johnson was investigated in July 2020 by the State Department watchdog after the allegations.

Johnson denied the allegations in a post on the official X (then known as Twitter) account for the U.S. ambassador to the U.K. that same month.

""I have followed the ethical rules and requirements of my office at all times. These false claims of insensitive remarks about race and gender are totally inconsistent with my longstanding record and values,"" Johnson wrote.

The investigation's findings have never been made public.

At the time, Johnson was not involved with the Jets, as he was tending to his diplomatic duties for Trump. Still, the Jets released a statement regarding the allegations against Johnson and noted his denial of them.

""Since the Johnson family became owners of the New York Jets, the organization has consistently and actively supported, engaged and encouraged the development of many different social justice, diversity, women's, and inclusion initiatives,"" the team said in a statement. ""One of our fundamental principles is treating employees, players, coaches and fans with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, color, religion, or gender. These principles have been established by the Johnson family, which Woody implemented in our organization over the past 20 years.""

Saleh was hired by the Jets in January 2021 while Johnson was in the final month of his duties as ambassador to the U.K. Therefore, the owner did not make the final decision to hire Saleh. It was Johnson's brother, Christopher Johnson, who made the decision to hire Saleh.

When Trump left office and Woody Johnson returned to his duties as Jets owner, he kept Saleh employed for three straight seasons, none of which resulted in trips to the playoffs or winning records. Saleh went 20-36 with New York and never won more than seven games a year while at the helm.

Then, when Saleh was fired on Tuesday, the coach was reportedly escorted out of the team facility by security, according to multiple reports. The most recent head coach to be fired by the Jets, Adam Gase, was fired after the conclusion of his second season and was reportedly not removed by security.

The Jets were off to a 2-3 start this year after losing to the Minnesota Vikings 23-17 in London on Sunday, as New York is among the most penalized teams in the league this year. The Jets have struggled this year despite veteran star quarterback Aaron Rodgers starting all five games this season."
Prospects of a deal with Israel fade away as Saudis invite Iranian foreign minister to visit,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/iran-foreign-minister-saudi-arabia-deal-israel,2024-10-08T20:45:15Z,"One year ago, Saudi Arabia and Israel were supposedly on the brink of a deal to normalize relations.

That deal has seemingly evaporated as Iran's foreign minister visits the kingdom on Tuesday to discuss efforts to halt Israel's incursions into Gaza and Lebanon.

""Our dialogue continues regarding the developments in the region to prevent the shameless crimes of the Zionist regime in Lebanon, in continuation of the crimes in Gaza,"" Iran Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a video broadcast on state media.

He added: ""Starting today, I'll begin a trip to the region, to Riyadh and other capitals, and we will strive for a collective movement from the countries of the region... to stop the brutal attacks in Lebanon.""

The Saudis share a longtime strategic partnership with the U.S. and are the largest purchaser of its weapons. But in recent years, they've had a political rapprochement with Iran.

9/11 FAMILIES URGE TRUMP, HARRIS TO OPPOSE SAUDI DEAL UNTIL KINGDOM ADMITS INVOLVEMENT IN TERROR ATTACK

Last week, Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, reaffirmed their neutrality in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Iran has warned that if ""Israel supporters"" intervene directly, their interests in the region would be targeted. That could mean missile strikes on their oil facilities.

Iran rained some 200 missiles down on Israel last week, many of which were intercepted by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) with U.S. assistance.

""The Gulf states think it's unlikely that Iran will strike their oil facilities, but the Iranians are dropping hints they might from unofficial sources. It's a tool the Iranians have against the U.S. and the global economy,"" Ali Shihabi, a Saudi commentator close to the royal court, said.

In 2019, drones attacked Saudi Arabia's key refinery at Abqaiq, briefly shutting down around 5% of the world's oil supply. Those drones originated in Iran, according to U.S. intelligence.

Prior to Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the Biden administration considered a proposed deal, akin to the Abraham Accords, a major priority. This deal aimed to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, including security guarantees and cooperation on civil nuclear matters. For months, the White House had been saying the deal was nearly done.

The prospect of a deal was largely blamed as a catalyst for the Hamas attacks.

OPINION: WHY SAUDI ARABIA MATTERS MORE THAN EVER TO THE US

""I don't think we were ever really that close,"" Robert Greenway, former senior director of the National Security Council, told Fox News Digital.

""We were closest probably in the waning days of the Trump administration, but we knew that that would be a second-term issue if there was to be one, and obviously that didn't play out. I don't know that the Biden-Harris administration ever took it that terribly seriously.""

Just before the Hamas attack, a group of 20 Democratic senators made clear their opposition to the treaty, voicing concerns over Saudi Arabia's human rights record and that a peaceful nuclear energy program might one day be converted to a military one to produce a nuclear weapon.

And Oct. 7 changed the Saudis' calculus: they now demand a plan for a Palestinian state.

""If anyone believes there was a chance of getting the House or Senate in an election year with virtually no majority, getting anything as controversial as a security treaty, with Saudi Arabia - permission for them to enrich with our blessing and support - I don't know if anyone credibly believes that that was ever possible.""

Former deputy national security adviser Victoria Coates was optimistic that the Saudis could be brought back into the fold.

""From what I'm hearing from both sides, it's when, not if,"" she said. ""There are various reasons you might want to wait to find out what the makeup of the Congress is going to be... you're going to need supportive majorities in the Senate to get [a civil nuclear agreement] through."""
Kamala Harris' tough words on Iran confounds critics,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-iran-biggest-us-adversary-china,2024-10-08T19:40:49Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris told the women of ABC's 'The View' that she would put a greater emphasis on small businesses and crimes against women and children.

Vice President Kamala Harris had harsh words for Iran in an interview Monday evening as she said the regime is America's biggest foe.

In a sit-down with CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" the Democratic presidential nominee was asked to name the U.S.'s greatest foreign adversary. ""I think there's an obvious one in mind, which is Iran. Iran has American blood on their hands.""

""This attack on Israel, 200 ballistic missiles. What we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power. That is one of my highest priorities.""

Harris declined to say whether she would take military action if given proof that Iran is building a nuclear weapon.

""I'm not going to talk about hypotheticals at this moment,"" she told Bill Whitaker.

The suggestion that Iran was the greatest U.S. adversary raised some eyebrows -- as China is thought by many to be foe No. 1.

""Iran is our biggest adversary, not China?,"" Mary Kissel, former adviser to ex-Sec. of State Mike Pompeo, wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

5 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM HARRIS' '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW

""Harris is completely clueless for claiming that Iran is America's greatest adversary rather than China,"" former Trump adviser Steve Cortes said.

""Really? It's not Russia? It's not China? A middle power is America's greatest adversary?"" Iranian nuclear researcher Sina Azodi questioned.

Harris also defended U.S. aid to Israel -- at a time when many liberals are calling on her to halt that aid or put conditions on it amid the rising death tolls across Gaza and Lebanon.

""The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel,"" she said.

Harris highlighted threats from ""Hamas, Hezbollah... Iran,"" asserting it is ""without any question our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks.""

Still, she held out hope that Israel and its enemies could get to a ceasefire deal.

""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done, which would release the hostages and create a ceasefire."" She added, ""We're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders.""

""China is the far greater threat just about, I think, everyone's estimation,"" said Rob Greenway, a former Trump aide and senior director of the National Security Council. ""If you really do view Iran as a threat, then the behavior they've made makes absolutely no sense.""

Former President Donald Trump has blamed President Joe Biden and Harris for loosening sanctions on Iran, which he said made the U.S. adversary ""very rich in a very short period,"" and prompted the turmoil that began with the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023.

During a rally last week, Trump tore into the September 2023 prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Iran that facilitated a detainee swap in Qatar and resulted in the release of $6 billion in frozen Iranian assets from oil sales.

""If they have somebody who was kidnapped, it's always $6 billion. Whoever heard of that?"" Trump said. ""Somebody else gets like $4,000.""

Iran said it had reached a ""good understanding"" to access the money from a Qatari bank account on Monday.

The Biden administration, meanwhile, has long claimed it has not rolled back sanctions on Iran. But ""it's not enforcing any sanctions,"" according to Greenway. Iran is now bringing in nearly $36 billion per year from oil sales.

Last week, Iran rained down 200 missiles toward Tel Aviv, many of them intercepted by both Israeli Defense Forces and U.S. capabilities. Though Iran's proxies have long attacked both Israeli and U.S. postures, it was the regime's first direct attack on Israel since April.

Harris was sharply critical of Trump for pulling out of the Iran deal in 2018. President Joe Biden campaigned on returning to the deal, but failed to do so in office.

""[Iran] made a tremendous amount of money. They have had doors opened by the U.S. administration,"" Greenway said.

HARRIS' 'WORD SALAD' ON ISRAEL ALLIANCE

The Trump administration's policies ""brought them to the brink of financial collapse.""

After Biden rolled back sanctions on Iran, the regime went from 500 centrifuges needed to make a nuclear bomb to 7,000. It went from 5% enriched uranium to 60% (90% is needed for a nuclear weapon.) It went from exporting 400,000 barrels of oil per day in 2019 under the Trump administration's harsh sanctions to 1.7 million barrels per day today.

Reports also suggest renewed activity in two nuclear weaponization sites in Iran - Sanjarian and Golab Dareh.

Last week, Biden warned Israel to make sure its response to the Iranian missile attacks was ""proportional,"" and urged them not to go after Iranian nuclear facilities.

While speaking at a campaign event in Fayetteville, North Carolina, he said when Biden was asked about Israel attacking Iran, the president answered, ""'As long as they don't hit the nuclear stuff.' That's the thing you wanna hit, right? I said, 'I think he's got that one wrong. Isn't that what you're supposed to hit?'""

He added nuclear proliferation is the ""biggest risk we have.""

Trump said when Biden was asked about Israel and Iran: ""His answer should have been: 'Hit the nuclear first. Worry about the rest later.'"""
Netanyahu confirms Nasrallah's replacement dead: 'Thousands of terrorists' killed,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-confirms-nasrallahs-replacement-dead-thousands-terrorists-killed,2024-10-08T17:43:32Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed on Tuesday that Hezbollah's intended replacement of its former leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed late last month, has also been ""taken out.""

""Today, Hezbollah is weaker than it has been for many, many years,"" Netanyahu said in a message tailored directly to the ""people of Lebanon.""

""We've degraded Hezbollah's capabilities, we took out thousands of terrorists, including [former Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah himself, and Nasrallah's replacement, and the replacement of his replacement.""

BIDEN WHITE HOUSE HAS 'VERY LOW' TRUST IN NETANYAHU REGIME, URGES TRANSPARENCY: REPORT

Netanyahu said Iran has ""conquered"" Lebanon to ensure Hezbollah serves Tehran's interests in the region by turning it into a ""stockpile of ammunition and weapons"" serving as a pseudo ""Iranian military base"" on Israel's border.

""Now you, the Lebanese people, you stand at a significant crossroads. It is your choice,"" he continued. ""You can now take back your country. You can return it to a path of peace and prosperity.""

""If you don't, Hezbollah will continue to try to fight Israel from densely populated areas at your expense,"" the prime minister added. ""Free your country from Hezbollah.""

Netanyahu did not explicitly say what it would take to stop Israeli strikes on Hezbollah in Lebanon, but earlier on Tuesday the group's deputy leader Naim Qassem suggested he may be open to a cease-fire without the inclusion of Gaza in the negotiations.

Netanyahu's announcement regarding the death of Hashem Safieddine, who sat as the head of Hezbollah's executive council and was most likely slated to be the group's next leader, comes as Israeli forces expanded their incursion westward along the border in Lebanon.

1 YEAR AFTER HEZBOLLAH STRIKES, ISRAEL REINFORCES TROOPS AND QUESTIONS MOUNT OVER 'LIMITED' OPERATION

Though Safieddine was not as well-known as Nasrallah, who served as the leader of Hezbollah for more than 30 years, his close ties to Iran and his outspoken behavior following the Hamas attacks against Israel on Oct. 7,2023 cemented him as a top target of Jerusalem's.

It is not clear how or where Safieddine was allegedly killed, though the announcement of his death followed an update provided by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) which said ""hundreds of terrorists"" had been ""eliminated"" since the 98th Brigade first entered Lebanon last week.

The brigade, which is made up of paratroopers, commandos as well as top soldiers of the 7th Brigade and the Yahalom Unit, has been targeting and dismantling Hezbollah strongholds, weapons depots and tunnel routes used by Hezbollah's elite Radwan Forces near the border with Israel.

The IDF has said it will carry out a ""limited, localized, targeted"" operation in Lebanon, but as Israeli forces continue to hit Hezbollah strongholds well north of the border including the capital city of Beirut, concerns are mounting that Lebanon could see similar destruction to that caused in Gaza, with one U.N. official referring to the strategy of bombardment as the ""spiral of doom,"" reported multiple outlets Tuesday.

Internally displaced people from southern Lebanon have been pouring into Beirut following Israel's increase in strikes three weeks ago, followed by the incursion earlier this month.

Beirut mayor Abdallah Darwich urged a cease-fire to be reached between Hezbollah and Israel and told the BBC on Tuesday there was ""no safe place in Beirut,"" warning that the capital city had reached the ""limit of its tolerance.""

""You do not know who is living in this building or that building, so you do not know if there is a target there,"" he said. ""You can no longer say Beirut is safe. Where the next Israeli target is, nobody knows.""

Roughly 1.2 million people have been displaced in Lebanon since the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel escalated last month. More than 400,000 people have fled Lebanon into Syria, and roughly 1,400 have been killed based on numbers provided by the Lebanese Health Ministry and the number of combatants believed to have been killed by Israel. Some 70,000 Israelis have been forced out of the country's northern communities since the start of the conflict."

5 key takeaways from Kamala Harris' '60 Minutes' interview,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/5-key-takeaways-from-kamala-harris-60-minutes-interview,2024-10-08T15:03:35Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview on ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, when she dodged or refused to get specific about her plans for the country.

With less than a month before the election, CBS correspondent Bill Whitaker repeatedly pressed Harris for details on how to pay for her economic proposals, on whether President Biden's loose immigration policies were a mistake and how a Harris foreign policy might differ from Biden or former President Donald Trump. There were several moments when Whitaker had to ask follow-up questions after Harris did not directly answer his inquiries.

Overall, the Democratic vice president did not differentiate herself much from her 2020 running mate, the sitting president of the United States. CBS said her Republican rival, former President Trump, backed out of an invitation to appear on ""60 Minutes,"" though the Trump campaign said there was never a formal agreement for Trump to appear on the program.

Here are some standout moments from the Harris interview.

'60 MINUTES' ASKS HARRIS WHETHER IT WAS A 'MISTAKE' FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO GO SOFT ON BORDER, VP REPEATEDLY DODGES

Whitaker asked Harris about the ongoing crises in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, with Israel under assault from Iranian proxies and Ukraine persevering in the fight against Russia's invasion. In her answers, Harris did not do much to distinguish her foreign policy from that of the current administration.

On Israel, Harris echoed Biden's call for the war with Hamas to end, though she acknowledged the Jewish nation's right to defend itself after the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, when terrorists slaughtered 1,200 people and took 250 captives back to Gaza.

""I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end,"" Harris said.

Whitaker pointed out that although the United States has handed billions of dollars to Israel in military aid, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted the Biden-Harris administration's call for a cease-fire with Hamas. When asked if the U.S. holds no sway over Netanyahu, Harris dodged the question and stayed on message, emphasizing the current administration's diplomatic efforts.

""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles,"" she said.

KAMALA HARRIS SET FOR EXTREMELY FRIENDLY INTERVIEW BLITZ WITH 'THE VIEW,' STEPHEN COLBERT AND HOWARD STERN

Whitaker pressed, ""but it seems Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening.""

Harris declined to answer that point. ""We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.""

On Europe, Harris stuck with Biden's position that Ukraine must be involved in any resolution to the war with Russia.

""There will be no success in ending that war without Ukraine and the U.N. charter participating in what that success looks like,"" she said.

In a definitive statement, Harris said she would not meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss an end to the war unless Ukrainian representatives were present. However, she was less specific on whether Ukraine should join NATO.

""Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression,"" Harris said. ""Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, oh, he can end it on day one. You know what that is? It's about surrender.""

TRUMP CAMPAIGN DENIES IT EVER AGREET TO '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW AFTER CBS NEWS CLAIMED HE BACKED OUT

Whitaker confronted Harris on her apparent flip-flop on immigration, noting that she supported Biden's efforts to reverse Trump's strict policies even as a historic flood of illegal immigrants crossed the border. Now, the vice president has ""embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers,"" he said.

Whitaker asked, ""If that's the right answer, now, why didn't your administration take those steps in 2021?""

Harris responded by pointing to congressional Republicans who backed out of a bipartisan agreement on a border security bill negotiated by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla. ""Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed. And he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. So he told his buddies in Congress kill the bill. Don't let it move forward,"" she said.

However, Whitaker pushed back on the vice president, observing that in the first three years of the Biden-Harris administration, border arrivals quadrupled and there was no action from Biden or Harris.

""Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did?""

Harris did not answer the question but asserted that her administration has offered solutions ""from day one, literally.""

""We need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem,"" she said, again echoing Biden.

To fight inflation, Harris said she intends to ask Congress to pass a federal ban on price gouging for food and groceries. She would expand the child tax credit to $6,000, give first-time homebuyers $25,000 in down payment assistance and offer generous assistance to people starting a small business.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that the total cost of her economic proposals would add $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.

""How are you going to pay for that?"" asked Whitaker.

""Okay, so the other economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent and determined that my economic plan would strengthen America's economy, his would weaken it,"" Harris answered. ""But my plan, Bill, if you don't mind, my plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy.""

HARRIS SAYS WEALTHY AMERICANS, CORPORATIONS WILL PAY HIGHER TAXES TO FUND ECONOMIC PLAN

Whitaker pressed again. ""Pardon me, madam vice president. The question was, how are you going to pay for it?""

The Democratic candidate's answer was that the rich must ""pay their fair share in taxes.""

""It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations, and I plan on making that fair,"" Harris asserted.

Whitaker followed up again, stating, ""we're dealing with the real world here"" and observing that Congress has shown no inclination to raise taxes.

""I disagree with you,"" Harris responded. ""There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""

""None of us, and certainly I cannot afford to be myopic in terms of how I think about strengthening America's economy,"" she continued. ""Let me tell you something. I am a devout public servant. You know that I am also a capitalist, and I know the limitations of government.""

After a discussion on foreign policy, Whitaker took ""a hard left turn"" and asked Harris about her recent admission that she is a gun owner.

""I have a Glock, and I've had it for quite some time,"" Harris said after he asked what kind of gun she owns. ""And, I mean, look, my background is in law enforcement, and so there you go.""

Harris served as the district attorney of San Francisco from 2004-2011 and was California's attorney general from 2011-2017 before she was elected to the U.S. Senate and later selected as Biden's 2020 running mate.

She told Whitaker she has fired her handgun ""at a shooting range.""

Though Harris had served in government for decades before becoming vice president, she remains a largely unknown figure in national politics. She did not run for president in the 2024 Democratic primary and only became a candidate two and a half months ago, when Biden decided to drop out of the race amid mounting pressure from Democrats concerned that he was too old to win.

""A quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you,"" Whitaker told Harris. They don't know what makes you tick. And why do you think that is? What's the disconnect?""

""It's an election, Bill,"" Harris replied. ""And I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote. This is an election for President of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support."
"1 year after Hezbollah strikes, Israel reinforces troops and questions mount over 'limited' operation",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/one-year-after-hezbollah-strikes-israel-reinforces-troops-questions-mount-over-limited-operation,2024-10-08T08:10:46Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

One week after Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon and one year after Hezbollah fired rockets into northern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in support of Hamas, Jerusalem reinforced its troops fighting inside Lebanon with a third division, prompting immediate questions over the extent of its ""limited"" operations in Lebanon.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Sunday sent troops from its 91st Division, also known as the Galilee Formation, to join forces already in Lebanon hunting down Hezbollah strongholds.

The 91st Division, traditionally responsible for overseeing security for the entirety of the border with Lebanon, will reinforce efforts already being carried out by two other divisions.

AMERICAN FATHER OF HAMAS HOSTAGE ITAY CHEN PUSHES US, ISRAEL ON 'PLAN B' AS NEGOTIATIONS FALTER

Israel's initial advance into Lebanon was led by soldiers from the 98th Division on Oct. 1, which encompassed paratroopers, elite commandos and the 7th Armored Brigade, who were transferred to northern Israel from the border with Gaza in early September for training, reported the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) Long War Journal on Sunday ahead of the IDF announcement.

""Forces from the Commando Brigade, including soldiers from the Egoz Unit, located and destroyed a Hezbollah attack infrastructure, which included a rocket launcher, explosive stockpiles, and additional military equipment,"" the IDF said of the initial operation.

Though Hezbollah's response was fairly muted as many were believed to have retreated ahead of the incursion, at least nine IDF soldiers were killed between Oct. 1-2 during one of the opening battles in Lebanon, confirmed the Long War Journal.

Reinforcements from the IDF's 36th Division, including the Golani infantry, 188th Armored Brigade and the 6th Reserve Infantry Brigade were then sent in, according to reports last week.

Following the Israeli incursion - a security measure that the U.S. and other international allies warned Jerusalem against - IDF spokesperson Rear. Adm. Daniel Hagari said Israel would not push its ground forces north toward Beirut and would instead focus on securing the villages near the border.

Jerusalem has said the operation in Lebanon is necessary to secure the area so some 60,000 Israelis from northern Israel could return home, though data collected by the FDD shows that some 150,000 Israelis have evacuated from the northern border areas.

IDF MEETS LITTLE RESISTANCE FROM HEZBOLLAH AFTER WEEKS OF HITTING TERROR TARGETS, OFFICIALS SAY

Hagari said the incursion would be ""limited"" and take ""days"" to ""weeks"" to complete.

But the renewed support of additional troops on Monday prompted questions over the scope of Israel's plans in southern Lebanon, including from the U.S. State Department on Monday.

In response to questions from reporters regarding Israel's operations in Lebanon, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, ""We're watching this very closely.""

""We support their ability to target militants, to degrade Hezbollah's infrastructure, to degrade Hezbollah's capability. But we are very cognizant of the many times in the past where Israel has gone in on what looked like limited operations and has stayed for months or for years,"" he added. ""And ultimately, that's not the outcome that we want to see.""

Israel has not announced any additional plans for its ground forces and said the IDF Divisions have engaged in ""targeted, limited, and localized operations"" in southern Lebanon to destroy Hezbollah's infrastructure.

But one security expert with the FDD pointed out that Israel could be taking precautionary steps to build up its force in the region should Israel decide it needs to bolster its ability to go after Hezbollah even further.

""What the Israelis have been doing is gradually ratcheting up pressure on Hezbollah to make the price of continuing to attack in support of Gaza too costly for the organization,"" David Daoud, senior fellow at FDD specializing in Hezbollah and Lebanon, told Fox News Digital.

Daoud explained that in the wake of the Oct. 8 attacks, Israel and Hezbollah engaged in ""mutual attrition,"" continuing to strike one another but rarely taking the level of attack beyond aerial bombardments, unlike the attacks carried out by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023.

ISRAEL'S GROUND INVASION INTO LEBANON IMMINENT AS CABINET APPROVES NEXT PHASE OF THE WAR

This level of engagement shifted after Israel's telecommunication device operation in which it allegedly detonated some 5,000 pagers previously distributed to Hezbollah operatives, killing more than three dozen and wounding nearly 3,000 others in a coordinated attack in late September.

Israel has not taken credit for the attacks, but according to open-source data compiled by the FDD in its latest interactive report dubbed ""Road to the Third Lebanon War, Mapping the War of Attrition,"" the event was a clear launching point in which Jerusalem drastically changed its modus operandi when it came to countering Hezbollah.

On Sept. 22, Israel carried out its most significant bombardment against the terrorist group than at any other point since the Oct. 8, 2023,attacks, firing some 1,182 strikes, nearly five times the number of attacks it fired during its second-heaviest strike campaign on Feb. 11, 2024, when 239 strikes were fired, the FDD found.

""I would call it a kind of proactive attrition,"" said Daoud, who co-authored the FDD report. ""The Israelis are no longer keeping a balance of attrition, they're really weighing heavily on Hezbollah without going to a full ground invasion.""

The expert explained that the IDF is ""ratcheting up pressure"" on Hezbollah in an attempt to get it to back off its support for Hamas, a similar strategy it has taken in Gaza in an attempt to persuade Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to hand over the hostages.

The merits of this approach are debatable as hostages remain in Hamas captivity despite the immense pains the IDF has caused in the Gaza Strip, and Daoud questioned whether this tactic would be effective against Hezbollah, an organization that is more sophisticated, better armed, better financed and more entwined in Lebanese society.

""I don't see Hezbollah backing down, even at this level of pain that the Israelis are inflicting upon them,"" Daoud said. ""So a ground invasion may become necessary, and you want to make sure that your forces are in place for that to move into effect immediately, if that becomes the case.""

The expert highlighted that Israel may once again be considering the establishment of a ""security zone"" in Lebanon in order to create a buffer between Hezbollah strongholds and the Israeli border, a move that would replicate steps Israel took between 1985 and 2000 and one that would require a prolonged IDF stay in Lebanon.

It is unclear if Israel could be considering another buffer-zone scenario, though it would likely prove unpopular not only with the Lebanese government but with the international community, which has increasingly urged Israel to reduce its footprint in the region by embracing a two-state solution with the Palestinians in the south and along Israel's eastern border.

But Daoud argued that the threat Hezbollah poses isn't going away and that creating a buffer zone combined with continued air strikes could be the solution that appeases the international community best by avoiding an all-out ground invasion across Lebanon.

""There are ways to avoid a ground invasion,"" Daoud argued. ""It will take much longer, but given where international opinion is, this is probably a better option for Israel now than a full ground invasion up to Beirut.""

Though Israel has not announced any plans to engage in a ground operation to oust Hezbollah forces from strongholds like Beirut, it has ramped up the number of strikes on suburban areas outside the capital city, and since late September the U.S. has organized the departure of some 700 Americans from Lebanon."

An imminent ballistic missile strike from Iran looms, but the current alarm is different - more immediate, more dangerous.

It's a terror attack in Jaffa.

The details are still emerging, but we know this much: Several people have already lost their lives.

In a rush, we load up our gear and protective equipment into our vehicle. Just as we're pulling out of the hotel, orders from New York come through: Get back inside. They don't want us on the road with Iran's attack approaching.

FOUR AMERICAN HOSTAGES REMAIN IN HAMAS CAPTIVITY A YEAR AFTER OCT. 7 MASSACRE

Before my producer can even hang up, the car fills with a new sound: the blare of alarms. Iran has fired ballistic missiles - headed straight for us.

It takes about 12 minutes for a missile to travel from Iran to Israel. How far into those 12 minutes we are is anyone's guess.

Our photographer, doubling as our driver, floors the accelerator, weaving through traffic as we race back to the hotel.

We make it back and join about two dozen others in the hotel's shelter. Many of them are Israelis. A father plays with his two daughters, rolling on the ground, laughing. Nearby, people chat calmly, unbothered by the threat of nearly 200 ballistic missiles targeting Israel. I notice a young man standing calmly beside his girlfriend. He's missing a leg from the knee down but stands strong and composed.

""Hamas terrorists,"" he tells me when I ask about his injury. ""They hit us with an RPG.""

He credits his - and others' - composure during this attack to their faith in Israel's air defense systems.

From the shelter, I go live on Fox News Channel, describing those around me. As Israel's layered air defense - comprised of the Iron Dome, David's Sling and Arrow systems - intercepts incoming threats, it becomes clear why the soldier's confidence is well-placed.

HAMAS LAUNCHES ROCKETS FROM GAZA ONE YEAR AFTER OCT. 7 ATTACKS, WHILE IDF STRIKES TERROR TARGETS

Iran is launching the largest ballistic missile barrage in history. Amid this, a Palestinian man in the West Bank dies from falling shrapnel, but not a single additional person in Israel is seriously harmed by the missiles.

It strikes me: the calm in the shelter is born of a tragic familiarity - being fired upon has become normal here.

Terror attacks, while common, rarely reach Tel Aviv.

When we're given the all-clear, we race to the scene of the attack in Jaffa, as originally planned.

Evidence of the brutality is everywhere along the light rail tracks: bloodstains and evidence markers hint at the horror that unfolded just before we arrived.

""When the train stopped and opened its doors, the terrorists walked inside, began firing their automatic weapons, then stepped back out and continued their killing spree,"" the Israeli Police International Spokesman, Dean Elsdunne, tells me.

US ON ALERT FOR POSSIBLE 'VIOLENT EXTREMIST ACTIVITY' ON AMERICANS ONE YEAR AFTER OCT. 7

""I even saw an image where the terrorists stood over a civilian who had clearly already been shot, and they continued shooting him,"" he adds.

Seven people lost their lives in the attack.

My mind flashes back to what I witnessed 63 miles south of Tel Aviv, in the devastated city of Rafah in southern Gaza.

Weeks earlier, I had embedded with the IDF in the evacuated city, where soldiers exchanged gunfire with militants.

There wasn't a single civilian in sight, but remnants of life before the war were scattered everywhere - a child's superhero mask, clothes, household goods buried beneath the rubble from Israeli airstrikes.

The Minnesota Vikings released a statement on Monday remembering the one-year anniversary of the ""reprehensible"" Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

""We mourn the loss of all innocent lives from this ongoing conflict,"" the statement read. ""We stand against the rising antisemitism and Islamophobia and know we must steadfastly work towards combating hate in all forms. We pray for the 101 hostages who have yet to be freed, and our deepest hope is for a future of peace and safety throughout the region.""

Hamas launched an attack on Israel that sparked a massive conflict in the Middle East, which continues to rage on today.

The initial attacks had a large impact on the sports world, including the NFL as the war began in the middle of the 2023 season.

Many within the NFL, especially New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft with his Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, spoke about after the Hamas attacks, calling Jewish hate ""out of control.""

VIKINGS' GREG JOSEPH TO WEAR 'I STAND WITH ISRAEL' CLEATS DURING NEXT GAME

The Vikings also saw their veteran kicker at the time, Greg Joseph, raising money to provide aid in Israel by starting a ""Kicks for Israel"" campaign on Oct. 17, 2023.

Joseph, who is Jewish and noted his religion ""absolutely"" guided him throughout his life, donated $54 for every extra point made and $180 for every field goal made to the non-profit organization Leket Israel.

Joseph now kicks for the New York Giants, who signed him after Graham Gano got hurt earlier this season. He wore cleats that said ""I Stand With Israel"" last season, and his campaign raised over $7,000.

As the Vikings' statement mentioned, there are still 101 hostages who remain in Gaza as the conflict continues.

The United States has helped Israel with military aid, while vetoing U.N. Security Council ceasefire resolutions.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken vowed Monday that the U.S. ""will continue to work tirelessly"" to bring home the four American hostages who have now been held by Hamas for more than a year inside the Gaza Strip.

The four that remain -- Keith Siegel, 65, Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, Omer Neutra, 22, and Edan Alexander, 21 -- were abducted by the Palestinian terrorist group exactly one year ago Monday on Oct. 7, 2023. The abductions took place alongside the murder of approximately 1,200 Israelis.

""Hamas also took 254 people hostage that day, including 12 Americans. Four of those Americans - Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Itay Chen, Judy Weinstein, and Gad Haggai - were murdered by Hamas. Four were released through an agreement the United States negotiated last November, but four remain in captivity in Gaza: Edan Alexander, Keith Siegel, Sagui Dekel-Chen, and Omer Neutra,"" Blinken said in a statement.

""There are also an estimated 97 other hostages who remain held in Gaza today. They include men, women, young boys, young girls, two babies, and elderly people from more than 25 nations,"" Blinken added. ""Hamas should release these hostages immediately. Every single one of them must be returned to their families, and the United States will continue to work tirelessly to bring them home.""

HAMAS LAUNCHES ROCKETS FROM GAZA ONE YEAR AFTER OCT. 7 ATTACKS, WHILE IDF STRIKES TERROR TARGETS

Blinken, who on Monday called Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel the ""largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust,"" also said ""It is time to reach a ceasefire agreement that brings the hostages home, alleviates the suffering of the Israeli and Palestinian people, and ultimately brings an end to this war.""

The youngest of the hostages, 20-year-old Edan Alexander, graduated from Tenafly High School in New Jersey in 2022 before volunteering to serve with the IDF.

""He was kidnapped Oct. 7th from his post, from the IDF post, and since then, we have no additional information about this abduction,"" his father Adi has said.

Adi and his wife Yael wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times in September saying that for hundreds of days ""the world has failed our son and his fellow hostages: The Israeli government has abandoned them, too many countries have turned a blind eye, and while we're grateful for the U.S. government's steadfast support, its efforts have yet to yield results.

US ON ALERT FOR POSSIBLE 'VIOLENT EXTREMIST ACTIVITY' ON AMERICANS ONE YEAR AFTER OCT. 7

Omer Neutra, 22, also volunteered to serve in the IDF, according to his parents Orna and Ronen.

""He's like an all-American kid. He loved sports. He was accepted to Binghamton University, but decided to defer this school. And he went to Israel on a gap year, and he connected deeply with the country, with his peers, and he decided to volunteer to the IDF, and he was taken from his post,"" his mother Orna has said.

She recently told the New York Post from her home in Plainview, New York, ""Our kid is a bargaining chip in this geopolitical nightmare, and we, the families, we're just floating on this wave. We're trying not to sink.""

HEZBOLLAH ROCKET ATTACK ON ISRAEL HITS HAIFA FOR FIRST TIME

Jonathan Dekel-Chen, whose 36-year-old son Sagui is still being held in Gaza following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, said in an interview with ""Fox & Friends"" in September, ""It is absolutely clear, the only way to get hostages home alive is by some kind of negotiated agreement with Satan.""

Dekel-Chen was abducted by Hamas in Kibbutz Nir Oz one year ago, according to the American Jewish Committee. The organization said he made sure his then-pregnant wife and his two daughters were safe in a shelter before confronting Hamas terrorists who had broken into his home.

Last November, Elan Siegel, the daughter of 65-year-old Keith Siegel, wrote in a column for Fox News Digital, ""They forced my parents, unassuming people filled with kindness and a quiet sensitivity, into my father's car and took them to Gaza.""

Siegel's wife Aviva later was released from captivity.

""It's just cruel to think that he's in such terrible conditions for so long,"" Aviva Siegel recently told the New York Post. ""What they're going through is the cruelest thing on Earth.""

The 'Outnumbered' panel also discusses the tragedy as the Israel-Hamas war rages on.

Vice President Kamala Harris appears to prioritize winning back Arab American and Muslim voters who were dejected by President Joe Biden's handling of war in the Middle East over courting the Jewish voter.

That's according to an internal review of her calendar meetups with both groups since becoming the Democratic nominee for president.

Harris met with Arab American advocates ahead of a campaign event in Flint, Michigan, on Friday. That followed a meeting with activists with the Pro-Palestinian Uncommitted Movement, which has declined to endorse her, in Michigan in July.

Her public schedule hasn't included meetings with Jewish groups since meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu privately in July, after she declined to preside over his joint address to Congress.

In August, her campaign nominated Ilan Goldenberg as its liaison to the Jewish community, and on Aug. 15, Harris sent campaign officials to meet with Jewish leaders in Michigan. In September, she called the parents of the late Hersch Goldberg-Polin, the American hostage slain by Hamas. Fox News Digital could not find a record of any other face-to-face Jewish outreach by Harris.

Wa'el Alzayat, the CEO of Emgage Action, told CNN that Harris had told the Arab group on Friday ""that she also wants the war to end and that she will do all she can to work in this regard.""

The Arab Americans told her she needed ""to show distance between how she would govern on this matter with the current administration policies, which we don't agree with.""

HARRIS REFUSES TO CALL NETANYAHU A 'CLOSE ALLY' ONE YEAR AFTER OCTOBER 7

Michigan, which Biden narrowly won in 2020, is a crucial battleground state this election. It has the second-highest population of Arab American residents, who make up around 3% of its population.

On the anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, former President Donald Trump will speak to Jewish community leaders at one of his Florida resorts in Doral. Harris will briefly speak to journalists and plant a pomegranate tree on the grounds of the Vice President's Residence in honor of those killed a year ago.

One year on from the outbreak of war with Hamas in Gaza, Israel is now entrenched in war on other fronts too. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) recently launched a ground offensive in Lebanon to fight Hezbollah, and last week missiles rained down on Tel Aviv -- though most were intercepted -- from Iran.

Jewish Americans tend to vote Democratic -- in 2020, Biden won 69% of their vote. Trump won 30%.

Harris' focus on Arab American outreach could in part be due to shifting polling within the community and an aggressive outreach from the Trump campaign to capitalize on that.

Arab Americans also historically favor Democrats -- but new polling suggests that could change. Of likely voters in the community, Arab Americans favor Trump over Harris 46% to 42%, according to new polling by the Arab American Institute.

Trump has been airing ads aimed at Arab Americans in Michigan, and his former director of national intelligence Ric Grenell and his daughter Tiffany Trump's father-in-law Massad Boulos, a Lebanese American businessman, have been leading his outreach to the community.

HARRIS WON'T SAY WHETHER BIDEN ADMIN HAS ANY 'SWAY' OVER NETANYAHU

""His outreach now is much better, much different than it was in 2016 and 2020,"" Adel Ayoub, leader of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, told Fox News Digital of Trump.

Biden won 60% of the Arab American vote in 2020, but support from that community has cratered since the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7, 2023.

The National Uncommitted movement launched a campaign calling on voters to cast uncommitted ballots in swing state primaries to send a message to Democrats, and more than a million did so.

Harris spoke with leaders of the Uncommitted Movement in August. That same month, her campaign manager met with Arab and Muslim leaders.

Trump has blamed Harris and Biden for loosening sanctions on Iran, thus emboldening Iran's proxies to carry out the attack last year.

Trump has repeatedly said that Jewish voters who vote for Democrats ""should have their head examined"" and that if he loses the Nov. 5 election, ""the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that."""
Israel Soccer accuses Palestine of 'distorting reality' after suspension proposal,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/israel-soccer-accuses-palestine-distorting-reality-after-suspension-proposal,2024-10-07T18:52:45Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The Israel Football Association (IFA) has responded to allegations of discrimination and a proposed suspension of its team from the Palestinian Football Association (PFA).

FIFA, the world's soccer governing body, launched an investigation into allegations of discrimination against the IFA last week. FIFA leaders made this decision when they ruled against suspending Israel from international play after the PFA proposed a suspension to Israel amid the war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza earlier this year.

In a statement provided to Fox News Digital by IFA head of communications Shlomi Barzell over the weekend, the IFA condemned the PFA for its recent proposal to FIFA.

""Whoever fantasized about the suspension of Israeli football from the international arena or sanctions through lies and false accusations, has suffered a defeat,"" the statement read. ""Again, we have acted over time in different channels, in a calculated and proactive manner in the face of the challenge of the Palestinian Association and its leader to distort reality, and the result today leaves no room for doubt.

""We respect the authors of the report submitted to the council members and the decision of the council members to consider transferring two issues to a legal examination, as long as there is any factual justification for it. Thanks to values that represent a glorious democracy and an independent and determined legal system of the Football Association, we have never violated and will not violate any of the FIFA/UEFA rules,"" the statement read.

The PFA has not responded to multiple requests for comment from Fox News Digital.

The PFA's original proposal claimed at least 92 non-professional Palestinian players have been killed in the war, football infrastructure has been destroyed, its leagues suspended and its national team required to play World Cup qualifiers abroad. The Palestinian federation wanted FIFA to adopt appropriate sanctions against Israeli teams, including the national side and clubs.

Katarina Pijetlovic, head of the PFA's legal department, addressed FIFA's decision not to suspend Israel in posts on X on Oct. 3.

""FIFA allowed Israel FA to continue using the Palestinian territory [occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem] as their own territory, and to use football under its umbrella as an instrument of colonial expansion,"" she wrote in a post on X. ""The decision is purely political. Will we wait 2 yrs again, as in 2015-17, for the committee to suggest the obvious and then have their suggestion rejected again? Why don't they just say it: Israel has impunity to destroy FIFA member associations & use their colonized territories.""

BENJAMIN NETANYAHU'S CHURCHILL MOMENT COMES AMID MULTIFRONT WAR AGAINST IRANIAN TERROR, EXPERT SAYS

Gaza-based soccer journalist Abubaker Abed previously told Al Jazeera that the Palestinian Federation ""acts as a form of resistance"" and alleged that more than 50 Palestinian sports facilities had been destroyed.

""The people of Palestine know this team acts as a form of resistance and is conveying a message to the world,"" Gaza-Abed said. ""More than 50 sports facilities have been reduced to rubble in Gaza, including nine out of 10 of Gaza's stadiums. Almost every club has been destroyed in this war, while one stadium in Deir el-Balah has been turned into a shelter for thousands of displaced people.""

FIFA's disciplinary committee will now be asked to look into the allegations of discrimination. The PFA has specifically accused the IFA of complicity in violations of international law by the Israeli government, discrimination against Arab players and inclusion in its league of clubs located in Palestinian territory.

""The FIFA Disciplinary Committee will be mandated to initiate an investigation into the alleged offense of discrimination raised by the Palestine Football Association,"" FIFA said in a statement. ""FIFA's Governance, Audit and Compliance Committee will be entrusted with the mission to investigate... the participation in Israeli competitions of Israeli football teams allegedly based in the territory of Palestine.""

The PFA's proposal of suspension was enough to convince FIFA to seek an independent legal council and hold a landmark council meeting to make a decision on whether to suspend Israel from international soccer because of the conflict with Hamas, said FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the FIFA congress in May.

However, for the time being, it doesn't appear that Israel will be subject to a suspension. A suspension may have severely impacted its hopes to compete in the 2026 World Cup, which will be played in North America. The final will be played in East Rutherford, New Jersey, just across the Hudson River from New York City.

Countries have been banned from competing in the World Cup in the past based on the actions of their governments and national team administrations.

Germany and Japan were banned from the 1950 World Cup after the end of World War II. South Africa was banned from 1966 to 1992 for violating FIFA's anti-discrimination charter due to apartheid. Mexico was banned for two years after using overage players in qualifiers for the 1989 World Youth Championship.

Israel has only ever qualified for the World Cup once, in 1970, and it didn't make it out of the group stage. Israel won a championship in the 1964 Asian Games. However, they were moved from the Asian Football Federation to the the European Confederation UEFA in 1994, where they have struggled to compete. The team suffered its most lopsided loss in its history in a 7-1 blowout to Germany in 2002.

Israel is currently in the midst of its UEFA Nations League schedule. It will play France on Thursday after starting off 0-2.

Meanwhile, Palestine is currently in the midst of group play for the FIFA World Cup Asian qualifiers. It will play Iraq on Thursday after starting group play with one loss and one draw. Palestine has never qualified for the World Cup.

Monday marks the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel, which killed 1,195 people, including 815 civilians, and resulted in 251 people being taken hostage. At least 31 Americans were killed during the attacks and 13 others were missing.

On Aug. 15, at least 40,005 Palestinians were reported to have been killed in Gaza since the war began. Gaza's health ministry doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but says at least 5,956 women and at least 10,627 children have been killed.

One year after the attack, Hamas marked the anniversary by firing a barrage of rockets at Tel Aviv on Monday.

Israel's war in Gaza rages on even as Israel is now fighting a new war against Hezbollah, escalating its bombing campaign in Lebanon the past three weeks. Last week Israel faced additional attacks from Iran, which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah, in the form of missile strikes.

The strikes forced nearly 10 million people to find safety in bomb shelters on Tuesday, and even forced a pair of Israeli women's basketball teams to abandon their game and flee to shelter, per the Jerusalem Times."

Vance, R-Ohio, spoke during the Philos Project's Memorial Rally and March on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., briefly taking aim at President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.

Iran-backed Hamas terrorists launched a massacre against Israel in the Oct. 7 attack last year, killing about 1,200 people, including 46 U.S. citizens, and taking about 250 hostages. A year later, about 100 people, including several Americans, remain in Hamas captivity, as U.S.-led efforts to negotiate a cease-fire and hostage release deal have sputtered out.

The Iranian-backed Hamas and its supporters unleashed a scale of unprecedented barbarism, including beheadings and burning bodies, within the territory of the Jewish state, resulting in the mass murder of nearly 1,200 people, including over 30 Americans.

The U.S. designated terrorist movement Hamas also kidnapped more than 250 people on that fateful day that jolted Israel like none of the numerous wars against Iran-backed proxies that the tiny Jewish state has fought within this century. As of Monday, 101 hostages still remain in Hamas captivity, .

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

After a year of intense war with Hamas, including the opening of six additional fronts against the Islamic Republic of Iran's ""Axis of Resistance,"" Netanyahu has bounced back to take on the threat to Israel's very existence. He is in his prime as a modern war planner and head of state, a number of Israeli experts told Fox News Digital, including Israel's top diplomat to the United Nations.

""Prime Minister Netanyahu's leadership in this war is a case study in tenacity and courage.""

""Netanyahu was completely shocked during the first hours on the first day of the attack, but at the same time, he understood what was going on and controlled events. Netanyahu responded very quickly,"" Ariel Kahana, the senior diplomatic correspondent for the widely read Hebrew-language daily Israel Hayom, told Fox News Digital.

Kahana referenced Netanyahu's public announcement on Oct. 7, in which he declared, ""Citizens of Israel, we are at war, not in an operation or in rounds, but at war. This morning, Hamas launched a murderous surprise attack against the State of Israel and its citizens.""

FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ISSUE WARNING AHEAD OF OCT 7 ATTACKS ANNIVERSARY

Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Danny Danon, said, ""This isn't a war Israel started nor is it a war Israel wanted. But, under the leadership of Prime Minister Netanyahu, Israel has succeeded in mitigating the threat of Hamas by destroying its tunnel infrastructure and taking out its leaders. Israel is also successfully degrading Hezbollah in the north by eliminating its senior leadership and launching a targeted operation in southern Lebanon with the goal of pushing the group north of the Litani River and reducing the threat the terrorist organization poses to our northern border.""

Danon, who is a member of Netanyahu's conservative Likud party, added, ""While we are making progress, there is still work to be done. We still have 101 hostages who are held in brutal captivity in Gaza, and we still have 70,000 Israelis who are refugees in their own country, unable to return to their homes in the north.""

Prior to Oct. 7, Netanyahu was an embattled prime minister. His right-wing coalition government had suffered public humiliation when his administration was forced to abandon its judicial reform plan because of massive civil society protests.

Now, with a string of tactical victories over Hezbollah and Hamas' top leaders, including Israeli control over most of the Gaza Strip, Bibi, as he is known in Israel by his nickname, has gained popularity in political polling.

""Bibi made the right actions against Hamas and Hezbollah. That is why you see him rising in the polls.""

One key turning point for Israel is the near total decimation of the leadership of the U.S. classified terrorist movement Hezbollah, including its leader Hassan Nasrallah, in Lebanon.

Kahana noted, ""Bibi made the right actions against Hamas and Hezbollah. That is why you see him rising in the polls. He is the only one to use the term victory. You don't hear that from the security establishment."" He cited the examples of Bibi's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, and Herzi Halevi , the chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, who ""are not talking about a complete defeat of Hamas.""

The veteran Israeli commentator said Israel's seizure of the southern Gaza city of Rafah was a telling example of a clash between Bibi and his war planners, Gallant and Halevi. There was hesitation on the part of Gallant and Halevi while Netanyahu wanted to expedite the capture of Rafah, the last major holdout of sizeable Hamas terrorist forces. Kahana chalked up a possible explanation of delay from Gallant and Halevi to the Biden administration's interference in having expressed opposition to the IDF operation in Rafah.

After a four-month offensive in Rafah, the IDF, in September, declared victory over Hamas' Rafah brigade. The incursion into Rafah also secured the release of four Israeli hostages in June. From May to September, the IDF eliminated thousands of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists in Rafah.

According to Kahana, ""Bibi had to push the army to act."" He compared Bibi to Britain's WWII prime minister, Winston Churchill, who demanded that his army do certain things but encountered resistance. Kahana noted, ""Netanyahu has full responsibility for what brought about Oct. 7, but he is leading the war better than Gallant, Halevi and Benny Gantz.""

""What is the strategy, what is the exit plan in the war against Hezbollah?""

Gantz, a retired general and leader of the main opposition party, left Bibi's war cabinet in June.

Yet Bibi still has many critics who believe he should have tendered his resignation on Oct. 7 or a few months into the war against Hamas. Netanyahu has also been accused of forgoing the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and thousands of Israelis have protested on a near weekly basis against his policies since the war began.

Yossi Melman, a veteran Israeli columnist for the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper, is one of Bibi's sharpest critics. Melman said, ""His performance is very bad."" He said Bibi has ""no vision and no strategy."" Melman asked, ""What is the strategy, what is the exit plan in the war against Hezbollah?""

HEZBOLLAH BIGGER CHALLENGE THAN HAMAS TO ISRAEL: 'CROWN JEWEL IN THE IRANIAN EMPIRE OF TERROR'

He claimed, ""Most of his decisions are about political and personal survival.""

Israel's then-attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, charged Netanyahu with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a legal saga that started four years ago and is still unfolding. Netanyahu has vehemently denied all the allegations against him.

Melman also claimed that Netanyahu, along with his cabinet, military and security chiefs, refused to accept responsibility for Oct. 7.

As one of Israel's leading intelligence experts, he attributed the penetration of Hezbollah's leadership structure to the ""last four chiefs of the Mossad and the military chiefs. ""Israel's foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad, built these abilities over the years,"" he said.

He also claimed that Netanyahu also ""strained relations with the U.S. in an unprecedented way. His performance is full of ungratefulness. The U.S. sent air carriers and the U.S. provided $14 billion in extra military aid and resupplied ammunition. Without that, Israel could not sustain one year against Gaza and now Lebanon and also Iran.""

Melman also noted that Bibi has failed to secure the freedom of 101 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.

Caroline Glick, who served as an adviser to Netanyahu, took issue with criticism against him, pointing out, ""Prime Minister Netanyahu's leadership in this war is a case study in tenacity and courage. Israel's other political leaders and military leadership all demanded that he capitulate to continuous pressure from the Biden-Harris administration to stand down and permit Hamas to survive and accept Hezbollah's continued presence on the border, sufficing with an entirely defensive posture.""

She continued, ""Had Israel agreed, its regional standing would have completely collapsed. He refused. His tenacious refusal to give up the fight and determination to fight to victory is the reason Israel has been able to turn the corner. Israel is winning today in a way that seemed unimaginable a year ago. We never would have made it to this turning point had it not been for Netanyahu."""
Harris' 'word salad' answer on Israel alliance confounds social media users: 'Someone please interpret',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-word-salad-answer-israel-alliance-confounds-social-media-users-someone-please-interpret,2024-10-07T13:03:40Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris did not directly answer a question about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's relationship with the U.S. and refused to say whether the U.S had any sway over him.

Vice President Kamala Harris was roasted on social media for a comment on Israel and how she ""can't make any sense at all"" in a new viral clip.

Harris gave a rare sit-down interview on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" Sunday, where Bill Whitaker asked whether the U.S. has any ""sway"" over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the war against Hamas continues. Monday marks one year since the brutal terrorist attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza.

""The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel. And when we think about the threat that Hamas, Hezbollah presents, Iran, I think that it is without any question, our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks,"" Harris responded.

She continued, ""Now the work we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages and create a cease-fire. And we're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders.""

BILL MAHER TRASHES KAMALA HARRIS FOR BEING 'FULL OF S---' ON ISRAEL, MIDDLE EAST: 'JUST SHUT UP'

The lengthy ""word salad"" and her inability to commit to Israel as an ally shocked and frustrated several X users after the clip premiered.

""Kamala is asked about Israel, can't make any sense at all. Kamala is like a running team that's behind that can't throw the ball. After hiding her for months, they are now panicking and doing interviews everywhere. But that's going to get her behind more,"" Outkick founder Clay Travis, a supporter of former President Trump, wrote.

Former ESPN anchor Sage Steele asked, ""Someone please interpret what she just said here...""

""People talk this way when they have absolutely nothing substantive to say because they know next to nothing about the subject at hand,"" Federalist senior editor John Daniel Davidson said.

""Shocking,"" Fox News host Mark Levin exclaimed.

Comedian Tim Young commented, ""60 minutes asked Kamala if Netanyahu even listens to us after we give Israel weapons and money. Kamala replies with a pile of word salad. It would be easier if she just said that no world leader respects or listens to her even after we hand out money.""

""This is the real Kamala. And she's no friend of Israel,"" California Rep. Darrell Issa wrote.

New York Rep. Elise Stefanik wrote, ""Israel is taking out Iranian-backed terrorists across the Middle East, making the world safer for Israel and the United States yet Kamala Harris refuses to say that Prime Minister Netanyahu is a strong ally to America. Kamala Harris is unfit to be the President of the United States.""

During the interview, Harris dodged repeated questions from Whitaker over her support for Israel.

Whitaker asked, ""Do we have a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu?""

""I think with all due respect, the better question is do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people, and the answer to that question is yes,"" Harris responded.

Harris was also criticized last month for providing scant details about whether she would change her policies on Israel as president.

(COURTESY: IDF Spokesman's Unit)

The Israel Defense Forces announced Monday that multiple rockets were fired toward Israel from the Gaza Strip on the one-year anniversary of the Hamas terrorist attack that launched the war.

Military officials say the Israeli Air Force ""intercepted five launches that crossed from the north of the Gaza Strip"" into Israel. The Jerusalem Post reported that two people were lightly injured after being hit with shrapnel.

""Sirens sounded in Israeli communities surrounding Gaza a few moments ago,"" the IDF wrote on X. ""At exactly this time last year, sirens were sounded all over Israel, marking the beginning of Hamas' October 7 massacre.""

The Israeli military said prior to the attack, its troops ""struck Hamas terror targets and launchers throughout the Gaza Strip"" in order to thwart ""an immediate threat.""

""A short while ago, the Israel Air Force (IAF) struck Hamas launch posts and underground terrorist infrastructure,"" the IDF added. ""Furthermore, overnight, the IAF and IDF artillery struck targets in the central Gaza Strip that posed a threat to IDF troops operating in the area.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a memorial in Jerusalem on Monday for civilians, first responders and soldiers killed in Hamas' attack on Oct. 7, 2023.

""We remember our fallen, our hostages - whom we are committed to return - our heroes who fell in defense of our homeland and country. We went through a terrible massacre a year ago and we arose as a nation as lions,"" he said.

There are still 101 hostages who have been held in Gaza by Hamas since the start of the war. Thirty-six of them are declared dead and their bodies are being held by the terrorist group.

Idan Shtivi, a 28-year-old who volunteered to photograph the Nova music festival in southern Israel that Hamas attacked on Oct. 7, was declared dead on Monday.

Idan, an environmental sciences student, loved nature, camping, and music. He was planning to work in the energy sector to combat climate change and join an African volunteer program that aids children.

""On October 7, Idan arrived at the Nova Festival in the early morning to document his friends' performances and workshops.

"Saving lives on 'Death Street,' how an Israeli kindergarten teacher became a battlefield hero on October 7",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/saving-lives-death-street-how-israeli-kindergarten-teacher-became-battlefield-hero-october-7,2024-10-07T11:32:10Z,"SOUTHERN ISRAEL - Tali Hadad is a 49-year-old mother of six and a kindergarten teacher whose days would normally be spent teaching basic reading, math and social skills to 5-year-olds. She never imagined that one day she would be forced to make life-or-death decisions while under fire in the middle of a war zone.

But on Oct. 7, 2023, she was thrust into unimaginable circumstances.

As Hamas launched its assault at 6:45 a.m., she awoke to the sound of sirens and gunfire in her hometown of Ofakim, a small, working-class city in southern Israel 15 miles from the border with Gaza. The piercing alarms that filled the air signaled this was not an ordinary rocket attack, to which much of the region had, over the course of many years, become accustomed.

ISRAELI SOLDIER GRAVELY INJURED IN OCT. 7 TERROR ATTACK FINDS NEW FAITH, OFFERS HOPE TO OTHERS

Hadad instantly knew her family was in grave danger.

Her son, Itamar, a soldier in officer training, was home on leave for the weekend. As the sounds of gunfire grew closer, he grabbed his rifle, fully aware that there was fighting just outside their door. Without hesitation, he ran toward the terrorists. Hadad, still in her pajamas, quickly slipped on running shoes and chased after him, her instincts as a mother taking over.

""I ran toward the playground,"" Hadad told Fox News Digital. ""I hid behind a wall and saw a line of terrorists walking with rifles, heading in the direction where my son had gone."" Moments later, she heard gunshots. ""I knew Itamar was in the middle of it. I waited, hoping he would come out, but he didn't. So, I ran toward him.""

Dodging through alleys while gunfire rang out around her, Hadad saw the devastation unfold. ""People were yelling from windows, begging for help,"" she said. ""But there were no ambulances coming, no one to save them.""

Then, she saw Itamar. He had been shot multiple times - in the stomach, leg and thigh. Two of his comrades lay dead on the ground beside him.

""He looked at me and said, 'Mom, what are you doing here?' I told him, 'You're hurt, I'm going to take you to the hospital,'"" she recalled.

With gunfire still echoing around her, Hadad sprinted back to her house, jumped into the family car and drove straight back to her son. ""They put Itamar in the car, along with more of the wounded, and I drove as fast as I could, 120 kilometers per hour, to the Magen David Adom station (Israel's national emergency medical service) at the entrance to the city,"" she said. ""I knew if I drove slowly, the terrorists would shoot me.""

After handing Itamar over to the paramedics, she made a fateful decision. ""I told him, 'Mom isn't coming with you. You'll go in the ambulance, I'll join you later. I have to go back and help the others.'""

6 MONTHS ON, FAMILIES OF US HOSTAGES IN GAZA STUCK IN 'AMBIGUOUS TRAUMA'

Hadad returned to the scene of the fighting and made three more trips to rescue 13 people in total, all while under constant fire. ""People tried to stop me,"" she said. ""They told me it was too dangerous, but I took Itamar's rifle, and I knew this was something I had to do. I had no choice but to act.""

After hours of intense fighting involving police officers, forces from the Yamam special-operations unit, armed civilians and off-duty soldiers, Israeli forces regained control of the town. A helicopter arrived to evacuate the wounded. Only then was Hadad able to step away from her role as a rescuer and check on her son at the hospital. Itamar had survived, but his road to recovery would be long.

""Half of the rehabilitation is physical, and half is mental,"" Itamar Hadad told Fox News Digital, reflecting on the traumatic events of that day, the friends he lost in the battle, and those he has lost since in Gaza, where his unit, Sayeret Nahal, has suffered many casualties. Despite the pain, his dream remains to return to his unit and continue fighting.

AN INSIDE LOOK AT ISRAEL'S SPECIAL FORCES RESCUE UNIT FIGHTING TERRORISTS, RESCUING HOSTAGES: 'FULL ON FAUDA'

On Oct. 7, 47 of Ofakim's 50,000 residents were murdered, and the street where Hadad lives became known as Rechov Ha'Mavet - ""Death Street.""

A year after the attack, Ofakim is rebuilding. Death Street, once a symbol of horror, has been renovated. The city has built a memorial, painted murals and planted olive trees - a sign of life replacing the destruction.

""We've gathered the pieces, all the memories of the victims, and we're trying to bring life back to the place that was destroyed,"" Hadad said.

Ofakim was not among the many towns and settlements in the south that were resettled in other parts of Israel. But the psychological scars remain. The waiting list for trauma counseling has grown, overwhelming the available therapists. In response, the Israel Psychoanalytic Society and the NGO IsraAid established a multidisciplinary trauma center, offering free mental health support to survivors of the massacre.

Hadad, like many others in Ofakim, and in the entire country, continues to struggle with the emotional aftermath. ""We're still bleeding,"" she said. For her, the experience was life-changing. She hasn't returned to work since the attack, choosing, instead, to stay home and care for Itamar. Five of her six children are serving in the IDF, either on active duty or in the reserves. At the moment, two of them are fighting in Gaza. Her youngest daughter will enter the army in a month.

The community of Ofakim continues to heal, but the memories of Oct. 7 will never fade. ""We remember how our children ran through the streets barefoot, fighting like lions. No politicians come here anymore. No tour buses arrive. But we remember. We will always remember,"" Hadad said."
One year after 10/7 attacks and Democrat-run states have let antisemitism fester,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/one-year-after-10-7-attacks-democrat-run-states-have-let-antisemitism-fester,2024-10-07T09:22:57Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

October 7th was the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Hamas invaded Israel, murdering people at random, raping, destroying homes and kidnapping people back to Gaza. There are more than 100 still held hostage, including four Americans.

Raw and hurting, American Jews watched the streets of U.S. cities fill up with crowds. The people in the streets weren't marching to stand with the slaughtered and the raped. They were gleeful, exuberant and there were many of them.

In New York's Times Square, hundreds of people gathered on October 8, while Israel was still sorting through their dead, and counting how many children and elderly had been kidnapped, to flash swastikas and chant ""death to Israel"" as well as ""700,"" the number of Israeli dead counted at the time. That number was later revised to 1,195.

AS OCTOBER 7TH ANNIVERSARY APPROACHES, JEWISH STUDENTS BRACE FOR PROTESTS, VOW TO 'WALK PROUDLY'

In Los Angeles, it's been nearly a year of violent protests outside synagogues and in Jewish neighborhoods. One Jewish man was killed after a confrontation in November.

It seemed like antisemitism was festering all over the country.

But a closer look showed that it wasn't, actually, happening everywhere, it was very specifically happening in places primarily run by Democrats. It's not that antisemitism can't exist in red areas. It can, it does. Vandalism, verbal harassment, even physical assault can happen in Republican-led places. But the occurrence is far rarer and the real difference is the consequences.

According to the Anti Defamation League (ADL) ""The states with the highest number of incidents were California (1,266), New York (1,218), New Jersey (830), Florida (463) and Massachusetts (440)."" Four of those states are blue states. In my red home state of Florida, we had approximately the same number of incidents as Massachusetts while having about three times the population and a third of the incidents of New York despite having over 2 million more people.

The ADL is a left-leaning Jewish organization, and yet they admit, ""On a per capita basis, the states with the highest concentration of antisemitic incidents were New Jersey - with 8.93 incidents per 100,000 residents - followed by Vermont (6.64), Massachusetts (6.28), New York (6.23), Maryland (5.49) and Connecticut (5.09). On the city level, two cities - Manhattan (26.84 per 100,000) and Washington, D.C. (25.75 per 100,000) - stood out with far and away the highest levels of incidents per capita. Brookyln [sic], NY, stood out specifically in terms of physical assault incidents, with 1.16 assaults per 100,000 residents."" Again, all deep blue states and cities.

The argument to defend the blue states, and their rampant antisemitism, is that Jews primarily live in those blue states, so of course, antisemitism will be higher. But that doesn't explain Florida's low count. It's also hard not to notice that Mississippi had 19 incidents of vandalism and harassment while New Hampshire had 35 when they each have under 1% of their population being Jewish and Mississippi is nearly double New Hampshire's population. There is a pattern, and it's related to whom the population elects.

Antisemitism simply does not thrive in red areas the same way as it does in areas dominated by Democrats. Jew-hatred, and the chaos that accompanies it onto our streets is put down as quickly as it surfaces in places like Florida.

Last October, Dr. Ahmed ElKoussa was fired from his job as a Miami dentist after ripping down posters of kidnapped hostages being held by Hamas. Anti-Israel agitators protested outside Real-Time Laboratories, an American company which is a subsidiary of an Israeli weapons manufacturer, in Boca Raton, but were met with even more pro-Israel protesters. When the anti-Israel protesters got violent, Boca Raton Police immediately took action and made arrests.

And in May, when anti-Israel protesters pulled their usual move of attempting to block a highway in Orlando, they lasted a total of 11 minutes before Florida Highway Patrol arrested them. Governor Ron DeSantis boasted, ""I think that's the world record.""

Meanwhile, in New York, the Manhattan district attorney has dropped all charges against the violent anti-Israel protesters who occupied Columbia University's Hamilton Hall. In California, protesters have spent the last year blocking traffic for the Palestinian cause. Only some incidents yielded arrests. In March, protesters stopped traffic outside San Francisco International Airport and blocked security lines inside for four hours. No one was arrested. This simply does not happen in red states.

School campuses in red states were relatively quiet, while Ivy League campuses in the northeast featured Jewish students being told to ""go back to Poland"" and assaulted. The protests that did spring up on red state campuses were quickly brought under control.

Antisemitism simply does not thrive in red areas the same way as it does in areas dominated by Democrats. Jew-hatred, and the chaos that accompanies it onto our streets is put down as quickly as it surfaces in places like Florida.

It was obvious to the students at some of the red-state universities that the protests were about Israel, yes, but they were about America too. U.S. flags were often torn down and replaced with Palestinian flags. At the University of North Carolina, fraternity brothers protected an American flag from being defaced, while at Princeton University, protesting students halted a Memorial Day parade because it featured an American flag.

Open antisemitism exposes a deep rot in societies and the hatred of Jews for the last year has caused many to notice that the same people hate America too. History is filled with examples of governments and societies that no longer exist because succumbing to the world's oldest hatred was a clear sign that their civilization was on a downhill trajectory. What is happening in blue cities is exposing their own decay.

Cities, like New York, that had been prospering not so long ago have had a hard time bouncing back from the bad policies enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with the rolling back of crime policies during the Bill de Blasio administration. Antisemitism is a symptom of a larger problem and places that control antisemitic activity can count on flourishing in a way that places that don't won't. Jew-hatred can happen anywhere, the acceptance of it does not."

One year ago, Iran took a gamble and started a war in Gaza with the attack by Hamas that killed nearly 1,200 Israelis, including over 40 Americans, and took more than 200 hostages

A year later, it is clear that Iran is losing this war.

For his part, Ayatollah Khamenei on Friday, October 4, 2024, remembered the massacre as ""logical and legal"" and used his first public Friday sermon in five years to proclaim that Iran ""won't back down."" He also had a rifle at the podium. He's that worried.

ISRAELI MILITARY KILLS 250 HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS SINCE START OF LIMITED GROUND OPERATION IN LEBANON

You can measure the defeat of Iran in two ways. The first is restoring Israel's security and carrying out the military destruction of Iran's terror agents Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and more.

Israeli strikes of the past several weeks have brought this goal closer.

Second, getting Israel and Saudi Arabia back on track toward normalizing relations will be the ultimate defeat for Iran.

Of all the vile causes for the Hamas attack, the strategic tipping point came because Saudi Arabia and Israel were close to a historic normalization of relations.

Iran couldn't stand it.

Last fall, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman were in serious, quiet negotiations. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan wrote in his Foreign Affairs article that the work toward joint infrastructure projects and new partnerships between Israel and its Arab neighbors was ""bearing fruit.""

""Every day we get closer,"" bin Salman said in an interview aired Sep. 20, 2023.

""We can forge a historic peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said to President Joe Biden during a televised meeting in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly sessions that same day.

The impending deal included a significant Palestinian component of concessions by Israel. ""It is not a done deal and there are many variables, but the odds are more than 50%,"" a senior Israeli official told Axios at the time.

Diplomacy was bubbling along, with Netanyahu invited to Washington, D.C., at the end of the year.

You can imagine how that went over in Tehran.

Less than two weeks later, Iran gave ""the green light for the assault at a meeting in Beirut"" on Monday, Oct. 2, 2023, sending word to Hamas and Hezbollah, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The objective was to force Israel into a war to blacken its reputation and scorch any path to peace.

To do it, Iran coached Hamas to change tactics.

Just three years earlier, in May 2021, Hamas waged an all-out missile war with huge salvoes to overwhelm Israel's missile defenses, to no avail. Even with the incredibly brief warning times characteristic of short-range launches, Israel's multi-layered defensive system held. Of course, the Israeli Air Force hit weapons caches and launch sites. Egypt stepped in to broker the ceasefire.

This time, the kind of war sought by Iran would have to go beyond missile attacks.

Officers of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps began specific planning with Hamas for the attack in August 2023. The goal was ""the most significant breach of Israel's borders since the 1973 Yom Kippur War,"" the Journal reported Oct. 8, 2023.

And so it was. Note Iran was content to let the civilians of Gaza pay a terrible price being caught of the middle of a war zone.

Most of the Hamas military structure in Gaza was destroyed by the spring of 2024. Biden offered a ceasefire on May 30. Hamas toyed with agreement, but this time there would be no ceasefire despite strenuous efforts by Egypt and Qatar. Iran wasn't ready.

Enter Hezbollah. A surge in rocket attacks across the alleged UN ""blue line"" effectively saw Hezbollah take the lead in fighting. Now, Israel would have to contend with Hezbollah, too. The war entered a new phase with the July 30 killing of Ismail Haniyeh, head of the Hamas Politburo, in Tehran itself.

Israel's systematic campaign has decimated Hezbollah's leadership, culminating with the pager attacks and the death of Hassan Nasrallah. Israel's strikes in Lebanon are now attempting to restore border safety.

A year after the initial attack, Iran is the loser by any military standard. Two big missile attacks on Israel have been thwarted. The military advantage rests with Israel. However, I suspect more strikes on legitimate military and infrastructure targets to reduce Iran's power may be required.

Despite Israel's military successes, dangers remain. For a year, the American military has done everything President Joe Biden asked in the name of deterrence. This includes steps that made sense: U.S. Navy destroyers intercepting Iran's missiles, aircraft carriers and F-22s deployed with strike options. And measures that didn't, such as the Gaza aid pier. The bottom line is 40,000 U.S. forces deployed to the U.S. Central Command region, all to keep a lid on Iran. That can't go on forever (although China would like it).

The path ahead depends on restoring Israel's security and taking out Iran's capabilities. After that, the goal is to get back to the normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a goal shared by the Trump and Biden administrations. It's not easy - the two-state dilemma remains. But it is the one sure way to defeat Iran, for good.

Of all the vile causes for the Hamas attack, the strategic tipping point came because Saudi Arabia and Israel were close to a historic normalization of relations.

And it's important for Americans to stay committed to Israel's security and to the diplomatic goals, despite the pain caused by the shock unleashing of antisemitism. Too many 21st Century Americans turned out to be biased, ignorant, susceptible to foreign instigation, or all of the above. We Americans have to do better than this.

Don't forget that in the words of the Justice Department's Indictment of Hamas, the government of Iran's regional and global campaign of terrorism aims to ""weaken and ultimately destroy both the United States and Israel.""

America's best interest remains to support Israel - and take all military steps necessary to get back to the regional diplomacy that will shut down Iran for good."

In the lead-up to the attack's anniversary, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued a public service announcement warning of hate crimes or violence: ""Jewish, Muslim, or Arab institutions - including synagogues, mosques/Islamic centers, and community centers - and large public gatherings, such as memorials, vigils, or other lawful demonstrations, present attractive targets for violent attacks or for hoax threats by a variety of threat actors, including violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators,"" it stated.

A new report from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), also released before the attack's one-year anniversary, revealed that after Oct. 7, antisemitic incidents in the U.S. rose more than 200% from the year prior.

According to the ADL, there were more than 10,000 antisemitic incidents after the Hamas terrorist attack, which was more than any other year since the ADL began recording them in 1979.

In a Hebrew message to Israeli citizens after Rosh Hashanah, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recounted the months of war on multiple fronts and touted recent military successes in taking out key Hamas and Hezbollah terrorist leaders.

""Citizens of Israel, as the New Year dawns upon us, we do not forget, and I do not forget, our 101 hostages in Gaza, to whom we are fully committed to bringing back home,"" he said in a translated quote."
"One-year anniversary of Oct. 7 attacks arrives with lasting trauma for Israelis, American Jews: expert",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/one-year-anniversary-oct-7-attacks-arrives-lasting-trauma-israelis-american-jews-expert,2024-10-07T08:23:04Z,"Dr. David Fox, a director at Chai Lifeline International, spoke to the lasting ""traumatization"" of Oct. 7 survivors and the families of victims, as well as the lingering impact on civilian life, one year after the attacks.

Life in Israel one year after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks is far from a return to normal, as one expert explained to Fox News Digital what it's like dealing with the psychological fallout of the massacre while living near an active war zone - and even the lasting consequences for American Jews 12 months later.

Dr. David Fox, director of crisis and trauma services for Chai Lifeline International, a Jewish nonprofit and network supporting families living with illness or loss, said he's traveled to Israel multiple times over the last year to meet with hostages' families and consult with survivors' families on the ground.

""I think Oct. 7 will remain seared into the consciousness of Jews and of Israelis,"" Fox told Fox News Digital. ""It's sometimes just referred to as 'the seventh' or as 'October.' October is not an Israeli or Hebrew word, but that's what it's been called. So I don't think it will ever be forgotten as an infamous day of what has become an ongoing battle for survival.""

The Los Angeles-based rabbi described to Fox News Digital how daily life in Israel remains uprooted: Tens of thousands of Israelis are internally displaced, and Israeli families must adjust as parents who were in the Army Reserves are tapped again for active duty. With a cease-fire and hostage release deal still yet to actualize, Fox also explained the lasting trauma and constant fear of another attack -- especially in border areas.

Fox said he spoke to one of the country's most prominent infertility specialists who transitioned from his day-to-day life as a gynecologist and obstetrician back into military service.

The doctor now spends his days crawling onto the battlefield to rescue soldiers who have been hit and carry them back to ambulances to be transported to hospitals.

ISRAELI AIR FORCE STRIKES HOUTHI TARGETS IN YEMEN WITH 'EXTENSIVE' OPERATION

""The families of those reservists who have now been activated and deployed, they may not see daddy for weeks or sometimes months at a time. Spouses may not see one another for a while... and there is that apprehension. Will he or will she return? So that has been a crisis for many individuals,"" Fox explained. ""On the other hand, those who serve in the IDF and the armed forces, they do it with a strong sense of conviction that we're doing the right thing, and we're doing really what God wants, but we're doing what our families need us to be doing right now. So those unfortunate separations don't end up fragmenting the family.""

""But I believe in most situations, the children will look up to that parent who has to be away,"" Fox said. ""They'll look up with love and admiration. But this has definitely been a change in what goes on on the ground, that family life has been changed.""

A heightened threat environment is especially palpable in moshavs, which are cooperative Jewish agricultural settlements in Israel. Fox cited a recent conversation with members of one moshav, which was ""surrounded by villages which were hostile,"" where settlers could hear messages broadcast from prayer towers or minarets calling out for attacks against Jews.

""Some of them are armed and many of them are not,"" Fox said of the Jewish residents. ""The army and security guards may not always be available at this point to shelter, to protect civilians. So there is a feeling of fluidity. The situation is changing.""

Over the past year, Fox said Chai Lifeline worked to expand its crisis hotline to provide ""around the clock"" support, as well as Zoom counseling, trauma intervention and other materials to Israelis or people who had family in Israel who witnessed the horrors of Hamas terrorists slaughtering approximately 1,200 people and taking hundreds of hostages on Oct. 7, 2023. Since then, the rabbi said he observed another societal change among young Israelis ""who are politically conscious"" as they look at the ""response or non-response of other countries, of the Red Cross or the United Nations"" and are ""rethinking their confidence in who we trust.""

""An ally who's with you in peace time, but who ignores you or turns against you in times of strife is not an ally,"" Fox said.

""The world does not expect the Jews to fight back,"" he added. ""The world does not expect a small country who has faced massacre and slaughter to get up and protect itself by going on the, let's say, the avenging offense. And we do have to face the condemnation of many of the sanctions of others. But I think a groundswell of understanding from still others that we are fighting to survive, and we are doing what any other country would do. If citizens were attacked and raped and mutilated and butchered, and their homes desecrated, I think we are doing what virtually any sovereign nation would do if its people were attacked.""

The trauma of the Oct. 7 attacks, Fox said, has remained for Israeli civilians and the families of hostages, including those who are still held in Gaza and are subjected to deprivation and torture.

Yet, Fox said there's also a bolstered sense of support among the Israeli people in supporting each other as the Jewish state continues its war effort.

""We know that there is a constant punctuation of the reactive grief by an intensification of horror and feeling terrorized,"" Fox told Fox News Digital. ""The attitude of the Jewish people historically and of the Israeli nation since its inception has been to react to oppression by displays of resilience coming together.""

IRAN'S AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI IN HIDING WITH EXTRA SECURITY FOLLOWING HEZBOLLAH LEADER'S DEATH: REPORT

The rabbi told Fox News Digital that he has been directly in touch with Israeli families who've retreated from their homes in the north along the Lebanon border amid the Israeli military's escalating skirmishes and exchanges of rocket fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah terrorists, as well as people who have fled their homes in the south along the border with Hamas-controlled Gaza. Fox spoke to the continued need for intervention services, as people ""out of familiar territory"" have been finding ""it's very difficult to feel grounded emotionally and spiritually when you're not sure what's going to happen next, when you're not sure where to go.""

""There are families uprooted from their homes, nothing to go back to. All their belongings vanished,"" Fox said. ""But the country and its people, its blessed people, have absorbed those who have nowhere to go. And other communities have welcomed those in need of shelter. And we're finding ways to get them into schools with their children and to give them some type of financial support or even employment if that's needed.""

""There's also an upsurge in the principles that really have defined the Jewish religion in terms of loving kindness, charitable loss, compassion and caring for one another,"" the rabbi added. ""So there is this resounding feeling that we're in this together. We're going to help each other. Nonetheless, there's traumatization.""

""There's the abject traumatization of those who were part of the targeted massacres, who still have the imprint of what they saw, what they heard, what they witnessed, and some of them what they endured physically and mentally themselves,"" Fox explained. ""So there has been a definite need for trauma intervention services. We've been providing some of that.""

His work also extends to supporting Jewish Americans experiencing rising antisemitism in the United States.

Anti-Israel protests reached a fever pitch last spring at U.S. college campuses. With the return of the fall semester and the Oct. 7 anniversary approaching, Fox said there's a lot he unfortunately can't control.

""I think there's a lot we can't do,"" Fox said. ""Despite the fact that we're offering support, we can't get away from the fact that there is a new fear in the air, and it's based on a credible threat. And how that will pan out in the course of time, whether the bigotry and the prejudice will skyrocket again or whether it will come down. I don't think any of us can predict.""

Fox also pointed to attrition, as more Jewish students opt to transfer to Jewish institutions and out of major elite American universities. He made a parallel with what happened in Germany leading up to the Second World War and noted that, in the present day, leadership at universities seem to ""close their eyes"" or ""at times seem to condone"" antisemitism, causing Jewish students and parents to no longer feel safe.

""We saw this in Germany in the 1930s, where professors were fired from their positions if they were Jewish and students were, if they were Jewish, might not be admitted into the medical school or into the graduate school. So we've seen this before. That was because of the political governing of the state of Germany. What we're seeing here is not coming from the White House,"" Fox said. ""It's coming from other influences, other attractions. And the government or the police in some cases are just tolerating, and as I said earlier, at times, are condoning this. So it has some parallels, some echoes of pre-World War II.""

""There is a sea of change, I believe, in the attitudes shown toward Jewish people. We didn't think it would happen in America,"" he added."
"American father of Hamas hostage Itay Chen pushes US, Israel on 'Plan B' as negotiations falter",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/american-father-hamas-hostage-itay-chen-pushes-us-israel-plan-b-negotiations-falter,2024-10-07T08:16:30Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

""When was the last time you talked to your kid? Do you know where he slept last night? Do you know what he ate? Do you know if he had a blanket on him?"" Ruby Chen, father of Itay Chen who was taken by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, asked in a sit-down interview with Fox News Digital.

""All those types of questions are questions that we ask ourselves constantly,"" he said. ""The feeling is that we've been failed.""

Itay,19 years old when he was taken, has remained a hostage held in Gaza for 365 days after his unit in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was attacked in southern Israel when Hamas terrorists flooded the border in a series of mass assaults.

Chen, a New York City native, said he and his wife have been given ""unprecedented"" access to the White House, the CIA and other top agencies throughout the last year to discuss ongoing strategies to try and get the hostages out of Gaza.

ISRAEL SAYS TOP HAMAS RAFAH BRIGADE 'DISMANTLED' ON PHILADELPHI CORRIDOR, 2,000 TERRORISTS KILLED

The Chens have not only met with national security adviser Jake Sullivan a dozen times, as well as CIA Director William Burns and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, they also hold a weekly call with the White House.

But ultimately, these supportive efforts have fallen flat when it comes to the real needs of American families whose loved ones are still held hostage by Hamas.

""We have been failed by the Israeli government, we, as U.S. citizens, feel we've been failed by the Biden administration despite all of the access that they've provided us,"" he explained. ""They share as much as they can. But at the end of the day, it's... very black and white.

""Where is he?""

Chen explained that following the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, the Israeli government pushed a strategy to secure the release of the then 251 hostages by bombarding suspected Hamas positions in Gaza.

In the initial weeks following the deadly Hamas attacks, Israel began pounding northern Gaza - a move Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believed would bring Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar ""to his knees"" and make him be ""willing to release hostages.""

A week-long cease-fire in November saw the release of 105 hostages. Twelve other hostages have been freed following negotiations during the immediate aftermath of the attack, or because of IDF rescue operations between February and August.

YAZIDI WOMAN HELD HOSTAGE FOR 10 YEARS IN GAZA RESCUED IN ISRAEL, US OPERATION

None of the eight American hostages that were kidnapped have been released, and only seven continue to be held by Hamas after the body of Hersh Goldberg-Polin was discovered by IDF forces in late August, after he along with five others were killed by the terrorist group.

More than 100 hostages remain in captivity in the Gaza Strip - 97 of whom were abducted on Oct. 7, 2023.

The Chens, other American families and the international community have repeatedly urged Israel and Hamas to reach a cease-fire agreement and return all hostages to their families.

But disagreements over security corridors in Gaza have created a seemingly insurmountable hurdle as U.S., Egyptian and Qatari officials work to get Israel and Hamas to reach an agreement.

The father of the IDF soldier pointed out that so long as no one is discussing a ""day after"" plan for the Gaza Strip and the Palestinians there, Hamas will continue to hold tightly to its most powerful bargaining chip, the hostages.

""Where is Hamas in the day-after? And if no one is willing to talk about it, then Hamas believes that they are better off holding on to the hostages until something changes,"" he explained. ""It's a jihad organization. They wish to have chaos. They are looking for a regional conflict.

""When they see that there's now a conflict with Lebanon, that does not motivate them to get into a cease-fire agreement. On the contrary, they wish to belong, and have other players join in this jihad against Israel,"" Chen continued. ""So I question, what is the plan?""

""I am very critical of the time,"" Itay's father said. ""The last 10 months, I've been asking Mr. Sullivan, What's plan B?

""I haven't heard of a Plan B. And that's unacceptable,"" he added.

BLINKEN TRAVELS TO EGYPT FOR CEASE-FIRE TALKS AS ISRAEL ADDS NEW WAR GOAL

Securing peace in the region became even more precarious last week after Israel, against the objections of the U.S. and its international allies, launched an incursion into southern Lebanon with the expressed intent of dismantling the threat posed by Hezbollah.

Chen pointed out that this second front not only added another dimension to securing the release of the hostages, but it also seemingly pushed talks with Hamas on the backburner as concerns remain high over a broader regional conflict.

""If you could follow the news, you could see that the hostage issue has been less prioritized,"" he said. ""And that's a very difficult feeling for us and the families.""

Netanyahu has said his top priority is securing the release of the hostages, but his refusal to withdraw from the Philidelphi Corridor due to security reasons has created a negotiation impasse and questions have begun to mount over whether the prime minister is truly prioritizing the hostages over his push to ""eliminate Hamas.""

But the parents of Itay - who has been described as a ""fun-loving kid,"" the ""sandwich"" of the family with an older sibling and younger sibling, everybody's ""best friend,"" and a former Boy Scout turned a young man with a loving girlfriend - cannot allow for him, or the others still in Gaza, to be at the mercy of any political agenda.

""I'm a guy that comes from New York City - and we talk less, we look at actions. The actions of the last year show the opposite."" Chen said. ""He can say whatever he wants. I don't believe a thing that comes out of his mouth, I believe in what he does.""

The father of three also urged the Biden administration to question whether it is still in the U.S.'s strategic interest to unequivocally back Netanyahu.

""There is no accountability from either side for failed negotiation. You do not see any equation that says, 'OK, if you do not do A, then there's a consequence' on either side,"" Chen said in reference to both Israel and Hamas. ""There's no consequence associated with a negative action to a strategic interest of the United States.""

Chen also argued that ""effective pressure"" needs to be put on Hamas by reevaluating what other ""pressure points"" can be utilized.

The father pointed to the clear need for tougher economic and diplomatic involvement when it comes to international aid sent to Gaza - including tougher sanctions not only on adversarial nations but on partner countries that allow aid to flow into Gaza.

This includes stricter oversight of United Nations-provided humanitarian aid, which though intended for the Palestinian people, is falling into the hands of Hamas, a group that is not designated as a terrorist organization by the UN.

Hamas has long been accused of seizing basic goods in Gaza and then reselling them in a black-market scheme at exuberant prices.

Reports have further indicated that Hamas for years has had substantial access to monetary aid siphoned from funds provided by top organizations like the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which has been directly used for combatant operations against Israel, including tunnel building and access to arms.

But aside from the substantial need to address aid-based concerns, Chen also argued that diplomatic solutions are not being fully recognized by the U.S.

Nations like Russia and Thailand secured the release of their citizens taken by Hamas, and Chen argued Washington - which was able to negotiate with its biggest adversary just months ago to free U.S. citizens from Russian prisons - should be working to do the same to secure the release of those held in Gaza.

""So, it's possible,"" Chen said. ""Complicated, yep. Doable, yep.""

""The assumption that was put in front of us at the beginning was that U.S. hostages will come out via a larger deal that Israel will be a part of. And if that assumption is not working out after a year, then yes, we need to challenge the administration and look at that assumption."

Israeli official warns 'everything is on the table' as IDF prepares response to Iranian missile attack,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/israeli-official-warns-everything-table-idf-prepares-response-iranian-missile-attack,2024-10-06T20:50:17Z,"Former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq and Chair of the Middle East Program at the Wilson Center James Jeffrey reacts to escalating tensions in the Middle East on 'Fox News Live.'

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant issued an ominous warning to Iranian officials during an interview with Fox News on Sunday, amid the rapid escalation of the Israel-Hamas war in the Middle East.

The interview came days after Israel invaded Lebanon as part of a mission to eliminate Hezbollah, on the heels of several successful strikes against the terrorist group. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that it had killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah last weekend - prompting Iran to launch 181 retaliatory missiles in response.

During an exchange with Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst on Sunday, Gallant promised that Israeli forces are considering all options in terms of its response to Iran's attacks against Israel - even potentially striking Iranian nuclear sites.

""At the moment, everything is on the table,"" the Israeli official said. ""Israel will respond to the unprecedented Iranian attack in the manner of our choosing, and at the time and place of our choosing.""

ISRAEL LAUNCHES LIMITED GROUND OPERATIONS IN LEBANON AS WAR AGAINST HEZBOLLAH, TERRORIST GROUPS CONTINUE

President Biden told reporters last week that he would not support a strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, but said Israel had the right to act ""proportionately"" to Iran. On Saturday, Vice President Kamala Harris vowed to send $157 million of ""additional assistance"" to Lebanon, which, she claimed, is ""facing an increasingly dire humanitarian situation.""

""I am concerned about the security and well-being of civilians suffering in Lebanon and will continue working to help meet the needs of all civilians there,"" Harris said.

Amid the White House's response to the IDF's recent strikes, Gallant emphasized that he hopes the United States continues to cooperate with the Israeli military.

""It is important for us to hold discussions on strategic cooperation between our countries and defense cooperation in light of the threats posed by Iran and its proxies,"" Gallant said. ""We are powerful when we are aligned and I want to make sure of it.""

BIDEN SAYS HE WILL TALK TO NETANYAHU AS ISRAEL PUMMELS SUNNI TERROR TARGETS IN BEIRUT

Gallant also said the IDF's recent strikes in northern Gaza were in response to terrorists planning ""Oct. 7-style attacks"" against Israelis.

""We have conducted counterterrorism activities in northern Gaza and in Judea and Samaria, following intel indicating that terrorists were planning Oct. 7-style attacks on Israeli citizens,"" he explained. ""We will operate precisely and preemptively when necessary in order to defend our citizens.""

The military official acknowledged the IDF's ""extraordinary"" wins against Hezbollah in recent weeks and vowed to continue its mission. On Friday, the IDF announced that it had killed 250 Hezbollah terrorists since the ground strikes began, including several commanders.

""Israel has made extraordinary achievements against Hezbollah - we will do what it takes to defend our citizens and our sovereignty,"" Gallant said. ""This includes eliminating their attack capabilities, taking out leadership, and placing a weapons embargo on Hezbollah.""

Fetterman made the remarks on ""Fox News Sunday,"" telling anchor Shannon Bream that Israel knows best about how to take on Iran and the regime's proxies.

As rockets continue to rain down on Israel, Tuesday marked an unprecedented attack from Iran, which fired 181 ballistic missiles toward the country. For an hour, the entire nation took shelter; fortunately, there were no casualties or injuries, thanks to Israel's air defense system.

This system has been crucial in protecting Israeli civilians, intercepting thousands of missiles aimed at population centers. However, some missiles did land at several air force bases and near the Mossad headquarters, although they did not cause ""significant damage,"" according to the IDF chief of staff.

Israel's air defense strategy extends beyond Iron Dome. Systems like David's Sling and Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 provide defense against medium- and long-range missiles, and these systems have also been crucial in the current conflict. Israel Air Force Reserve Brig. Gen. Doron Gavish explains that the multi-layered defense structure was designed to handle a wide range of threats. ""We've used David's Sling to intercept rockets from Lebanon, and Arrow 3 to counter ballistic missiles from Iran. It's not just Iron Dome - it's a network of systems working together.""

HEZBOLLAH'S NEIGHBORS: ISRAELI BORDER COMMUNITY UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK FROM TERROR GROUP

While the Iron Dome wasn't extensively utilized against Iran, its operators have kept busy keeping Israel safe since the start of the war on Oct. 7 last year.

""The Iron Dome has done incredible work, but, like any defensive system, the extended, high-intensity fighting has taken its toll on it - it wasn't built for a conflict of this length and intensity,"" Hilla Haddad Chmelnik, an aerospace engineer who played a key role in developing Iron Dome, and who acknowledges that the system is being tested in ways it was not originally designed for.

Haddad Chmelnik, who also served as director-general of Israel's Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Technology, emphasizes the need for ongoing innovation to keep up with evolving threats.

And with Lebanon and Israel's escalating fight with Hezbollah, the need for the system is greater than ever, she says. Just this last week alone, hundreds of rockets, missiles and UAVs were launched against Israel from Hezbollah in Lebanon.

While Hamas's rocket supply in Gaza has been largely depleted, the situation in Lebanon is very different. ""In Gaza, we have significantly reduced the number of rockets left in Hamas' arsenal. But in Lebanon, the numbers have not dropped enough,"" she says. Hezbollah is believed to have perhaps 140,000 rockets, and they are much more sophisticated than those used by Hamas and can penetrate much deeper into Israel.

And then there is the question of Iran, and the possibility of the war widening to include direct conflict with that country. ""Compared to Lebanon, the threat from Iran is more manageable,"" she says. Staging a large-scale missile attack from Iran is a complex undertaking, which can be detected and preemptively targeted,"" Haddad Chmelnik says. ""Launching a ballistic missile 1,500 kilometers requires preparation, and that's visible. It's very hard to hide from satellites, and that gives us the opportunity to strike preemptively, in addition to preparing to defend ourselves.""

Haddad Chmelnik emphasizes that Israel's missile-defense systems, which were built in coordination with the U.S., are capable of withstanding Iranian attacks. ""The Iranian missile threat can be countered, and our second-strike capability is very significant. Israel has the upper hand in that respect,"" she says. ""That's why Iran is cautious - it has more to lose than to gain.""

IRAN WARNS OF 'DECISIVE RESPONSE' IF ISRAEL CROSSES 'RED LINES'

Iron Dome was first deployed in 2011, following years of development in response to the growing threat of rocket fire from Gaza. What sets the system apart, Haddad Chmelnik says, is its innovation and simplicity. ""It's a brilliant technology that no other country has. Iron Dome was developed with the support of the U.S., and now we're seeing other nations buying it for their own defense.""

Indeed, the success of Iron Dome has attracted international attention. Countries such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Finland have purchased Iron Dome components or batteries. ""Israel is the most protected country in the world when it comes to air defense,"" Haddad Chmelnik explains. ""Now, we are seeing countries across the globe investing in it.""

Israel Air Force Reserve Brig. Gen. Doron Gavish, former commander of Israel's Air Defense Corps, recalls the initial skepticism surrounding the project. ""Before Iron Dome, we had no real answer to these types of rockets,"" he says. ""People doubted we could create an effective, cost-efficient interceptor. But the system has proven itself over the years. Iron Dome has intercepted thousands of rockets.""

Each Iron Dome interceptor missile costs around $50,000, while some of the rockets it is designed to destroy, such as those made by Hamas, can cost just a few hundred dollars. The cost of maintaining one Iron Dome battery, which requires dozens of soldiers to operate, is about $100 million. Currently, there are approximately 12 Iron Dome batteries spread out across the country, each capable of defending up to 60 square miles, providing vital coverage in strategic areas.

WHAT IS ISRAEL'S FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE, THE IRON DOME?

Half of Iron Dome operators are women, who agree to extend their service to three years - the same as is mandatory for men - to accommodate the long period of training. ""The experience these soldiers have gained under fire is invaluable. But the pressure is enormous,"" Brig. Gen. Gavish says. ""It's not like a video game. You're making real-time decisions on which rockets to intercept. These soldiers know they're protecting their families, their cities - sometimes even their own homes.""

But the current conflict, which has seen more than 20,000 rockets fired from Gaza and Lebanon since October 2023, has pushed the system, and its operators, to their limits. ""When we designed Iron Dome, we never imagined it would have to function under such continuous strain,"" Haddad Chmelnik says. ""The system was built for short, intense bursts of fighting - not for a war that lasts nearly a year.""

In recent months, some enemy rockets have slipped past the defenses, causing destruction in northern Israel. ""No system is hermetic,"" Gavish says. ""There is no perfect defense. The reality is, the longer the war continues, the more pressure the system is put under.""

Meanwhile, the enemy is learning. ""Every time Iron Dome successfully intercepts a rocket, our enemies are watching, learning and adapting,"" Haddad Chmelnik says. ""That's why we see more complex threats emerging, like UAVs, and drones, which are harder to intercept.""

While Iron Dome remains effective, the future is uncertain. ""The system is saving lives every day,"" Brig. Gen. Gavish says. ""But as the war goes on, it becomes harder and harder to maintain the same level of defense.""

Despite these successes, Haddad Chmelnik points out that no defense system is foolproof. ""The way Iron Dome is built, it's about more than just about identifying individual threats; it's about adapting quickly as those threats evolve."" She emphasizes that while Iron Dome continues to play a crucial role, Israel's long-term security will depend on continued technological advancements.

Despite the challenges they face in the current situation, those operating Iron Dome continue their mission. ""The soldiers - men and women - are making complex decisions in real-time, protecting cities and families,"" Brig. Gen. Gavish says, ""They are the key to Iron Dome's success."""
Anti-Israel protester lights himself on fire outside of White House,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/anti-israel-protester-lights-himself-fire-outside-white-house,2024-10-06T14:37:00Z,"Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst reports on Israel targeting Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters and his new book on 'Special Report.'

A photojournalist lit himself on fire outside the White House on Saturday in protest against Israel's war in Gaza and America's support for the regime.

The man, Samuel Mena Jr., lit his left arm on fire and was seen screaming in pain and shouting that the media was spreading ""misinformation."" Law enforcement officers quickly surrounded Mena and restrained him, putting out the fire.

One bystander could be seen pouring a bottle of water on Mena's arm after the flames were extinguished.

A blog posted to Mena's website shortly before the incident suggested he only intended to burn his arm.

HAMAS TERRORISTS 'SYSTEMATICALLY AND INTENTIONALLY' COMMITTED SEXUAL VIOLENCE DURING OCT. 7 ATTACK: REPORT

""To the 10 thousand children in Gaza that have lost a limb in this conflict, I give my left arm to you. I pray my voice was able to raise up yours, and that your smiles never disappear,"" Mena wrote.

The blog also says Mena first tried to end the ""genocide"" in Gaza by making a documentary. He later gave up on the effort, however, convinced that it wouldn't make a difference.

Mena's social media profiles say he worked for the local CBS affiliate AZFamily and graduated from Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism.

Authorities transported Mena to the hospital soon after the incident and confirmed that his injuries were not life-threatening.

""The District of Columbia has a long and proud history of peaceful first amendment activities and the Metropolitan Police Department handles hundreds of protests, demonstrations and other events every year,"" first responders said in a statement.

""We will continue to support those who choose to protest peaceful and safely, and we will continue to hold accountable those who commit criminal acts while in our city,"" the added.

The incident comes months after a member of the U.S. Air Force set himself on fire outside the Israeli embassy in February. Senior Airman Aaron Bushnell, 25, also carried out the act in protest against Israel's campaign in Gaza, saying in a recorded video that he would ""no longer be complicit in genocide."""
Fox Nation's 'Black Saturday' with Trey Yingst takes viewers inside horrific events of October 7,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/fox-nations-black-saturday-trey-yingst-takes-viewers-inside-horrific-events-october-7,2024-10-06T12:20:32Z,"Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst's new book, which is available now, provides a riveting, on-the-ground account of the devastating Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel.

A three-part docuseries of the same name, based on Yingst's book, is streaming now on Fox Nation, with a condensed version airing on Fox News Channel on Sunday night at 10 pm ET.

Yingst began writing ""Black Saturday: An Unfiltered Account of the October 7th Attack on Israel and the War in Gaza"" during the immediate aftermath of Hamas' horrific assault. At the same time, he was also working to provide Fox News viewers with the latest information from southern Israel and Gaza.

Yingst told Fox News Digital he feels the book is unique because it was penned in the field by a correspondent who was ""living this story"" in real time.

ANTONY BLINKEN DOES VICTORY LAP ON BIDEN-HARRIS 'STRONGER' FOREIGN POLICY SAME DAY IRAN ATTACKS ISRAEL

""'Black Saturday' is the gold standard in storytelling when it comes to what took place on October 7 in southern Israel and the war that followed,"" Yingst said from Tel Aviv.

""A massacre against the civilian population of Israel unfolded in the early hours of October 7, when Hamas militants crossed the border from the Gaza Strip into the communities that line Gaza in southern Israel, and it killed soldiers and civilians alike and dragged more than 240 hostages back into Gaza,"" he continued. ""'Black Saturday' talks about our experience, the Fox News team in Jerusalem responding to that attack.""

Yingst and his team reported from the Gaza border area as the attack unfolded.

""'Black Saturday' tells that story, and then the stories of the soldiers and the police officers and the civilians in southern Israel who were trying to make sense of what was unfolding, and then take the fight back to Hamas inside Gaza, along with the stories of Palestinian civilians who were directly affected by this conflict and continue to be affected today,"" he said.

Yingst has extensive sources inside the Israeli military, along with inside Hamas' senior leadership. He also speaks to Palestinian civilians in Gaza on a regular basis, and Israeli civilians who are waiting for their loved ones to come home after being taken hostage.

""This book really captures all of those angles. It is a book about Israelis. It is a book about Palestinians. It is a book about October 7 and the war that followed, and it is a book about humans,"" Yingst said.

He details the horrifying ordeal at the start of the book and shows readers the risks that reporters take to bring critical information to the world.

""The soldiers that we were with got lost, and they were driving through areas that hadn't been cleared, that Hamas was routinely operating in, firing RPGs, anti-tank missiles and small arms fire at Israeli soldiers in the weeks prior, and we had no way out. We were stuck in that moment, and as I open this book, 'Black Saturday,' I talk about this moment,"" he said.

""I truly thought this could be it,"" Yingst continued. ""This could be the moment that I die.""

For the project, Yingst interviewed a range of people to include multiple perspectives, including Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, high-ranking IDF soldiers, Hamas official Dr. Basem Naim and Gazan journalist Nael Ghaboun.

""I think that when you read it, you will learn more about what that morning was like for Israelis who were living through hell on Earth. You'll learn more about the behind-the-scenes reporting that we did to bring that story to our viewers under fire in real time,"" Yingst said.

""Black Saturday,"" the latest offering from Fox News Books, also includes 16 pages of full-color photographs.

The Fox Nation series based on the book of the same name includes Yingst and the Fox Jerusalem Bureau team racing to cover the devastating terror attack, the team experiencing the haunting aftermath of horrific massacres throughout the Israeli communities along the Gaza border and the Fox News chief foreign correspondent entering the Gaza Strip during the Israeli ground invasion."
'There is no life' after Oct 7: An Israeli mother grapples with grief one year after Hamas' devastating attack,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/there-no-life-after-oct-7-israeli-mother-grapples-grief-one-year-after-hamas-devastating-attack,2024-10-06T11:06:34Z,"Sigal Shemer, an Israeli mother from Lod, Israel, opens up about the murder of her eldest son on Oct. 7 and how she's navigating her grief one year later.

Sigal Shemer headed to the cemetery in Lod, a city in central Israel, in late September to wash her son's headstone and place flowers on his grave.

Ron, her eldest son, was murdered by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023, after the militant group launched an early morning attack on southern Israel, killing roughly 1,200 people and taking more than 250 as hostages, according to estimates from Israeli authorities.

Numbers compiled by Fox News indicate an estimated 101 hostages are still being held in Gaza, almost 365 days later, including seven Americans.

Sigal reflected on the death of her son and the enduring impact of Oct. 7, one year later, in an interview with Fox News Digital.

Trauma has reshaped her life and left an indelible mark on her family, but she's found some solace and hope through the Jerusalem-based nonprofit OneFamily, which offers support and resources to victims of terror. Through community outreach, the organization has become a lifeline, helping her navigate the complexities of her sorrow while honoring her son's memory, amid a background of ongoing violence and loss.

Ron had been attending the Nova music festival in Re'im when the carnage unfolded, running with his friends to a car to escape the sound of gunshots in the area and the horror that was beginning to take place.

But the 23-year-old didn't want to leave without two of his close friends. He opted not to get into the car and instead went to look for Dan and Omar. Soon after he found them, the trio went inside a shelter not far from the festival.

HAMAS TERRORISTS 'SYSTEMATICALLY AND INTENTIONALLY' COMMITTED SEXUAL VIOLENCE DURING OCT. 7 ATTACK: REPORT

""He told to a friend, 'Don't be afraid. I will attack if someone will come in. I will attack them, and I will take care of you.' But the terrorists dropped three grenades into the shelter,"" his mother told Fox News Digital.

Dan was killed, Omar survived and Ron was taken outside, where he was heard fighting and struggling with Hamas militants. He wasn't heard from for days and his family feared he had been taken hostage.

""One week after, there was a knock on the door, and they told us -- the army and the police told us -- that Ron is... is not... is not alive because they shot him in the head,"" Sigal said.

She took a moment to remove her glasses and wipe away the tears from her eyes. The death of her son is still palpable and raw for the mother of two, who is survived by her husband Oren, and younger son Bari.

Sigal remembered Ron as a young man who loved people and animals, loved to travel and loved to help others.

He was a counselor at a Jewish youth summer camp in Pennsylvania, where he taught children Muay Thai, a form of boxing and the national sport of Thailand.

Since his murder, the Shemer family has returned to the camp, meeting with those who knew Ron and visiting all of his favorite places in the United States.

Before Oct. 7, Ron was on a 10-month trip to South America and Sigal feared for his safety.

""All the time, I was afraid that something will happen to him because it's, you know, in Brazil, the Amazonas, Colombia -- places that -- they're not so safe. And I tell him, please come home, please come home. It's not safe there. So, he came home and it's not safe here. It's not safe to be here,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""The terrorists, the monster... came inside the country and killed and murdered and raped and burned a lot of people, innocent people.""

""There is no life. I think there is no life. There is no life from the 7th of October,"" she added.

Sigal was working as an event producer prior to the day that's now known as ""Black Saturday."" She's since left her job, consumed by grief, and now works two days a week taking care of dogs, something her son loved to do.

""I want people to know that my son and all of the murdered boys and girls on the 7th of October are lost for the world,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""Many people in Israel lost their sons and daughters for nothing. Just for nothing.""

OneFamily Fund has provided support to many families whose loved ones were murdered in the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust.

Naomi Nussbaum, OneFamily's executive director, told Fox News Digital how they use different types of therapy to help families cope with the loss of a loved one.

""We offer three types of support: Emotional support, financial support and legal aid. We've given out much, much more financial aid now than before because of the kind of devastation, you know, the nature of the attack on October 7th,"" she said.

""There's traditional therapy with psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, trauma-informed therapists tackling PTSD throughout all the categories. Dealing with PTSD is the most insidious and difficult part of the terror attacks to deal with. Then, we have the social network, which is really the heart and soul of OneFamily.""

Sigal has met with other mothers whose children were murdered and said it's not an easy thing to do, but it's helpful to speak with someone who's suffering from a similar situation and going through the same stages of grief.

DOJ CHARGES HAMAS LEADERS OVER 'TERRORIST ATROCITIES' IN OCT 7 ISRAEL ATTACK

""We're like professional friends for life. And the other people in the group that we put her with will be there also. You know, she can call anybody at any time to have dinner or to go for a walk or for a birthday or the anniversary of a death. They'll be there for each other forever,"" said Nussbaum.

""It takes a lot of courage and strength to smile again for the first time or to take a little bit of joy to say, let's go out to dinner tonight. Sometimes, the guilt and the grief and bereavement is too strong, and people can't do that. So, OneFamily, really with open arms and a lot of love, does everything they can to get them to want to come back to life again.""

A State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital in Israel's nearly 12-month-long war against Hamas, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed, including more than 6,200 women and 11,300 children.

The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count.

"Georgia's Muslim voters opposing Harris, Trump in election over both candidates' support for Israel",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgias-muslim-voters-opposing-harris-trump-election-over-both-candidates-support-israel,2024-10-06T10:17:03Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A growing group of Muslim voters in Georgia say they will not back either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump in next month's election because of both candidates' support of Israel amid the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.

Harris has said she supports Israel's right to defend itself and would not withhold weapons from the country, but has also called for a ceasefire in Gaza, while Trump said recently he is Israel's ""protector"" and reaffirmed his support for the Jewish state.

In battleground Georgia, where Trump narrowly lost in 2020 to President Joe Biden, the Peach State could help determine whether Harris or Trump wins the presidency.

The Muslim population in Georgia could also impact which candidate wins the state's 16 electoral votes. Muslim voters across the country are virtually tied between Harris and Trump, with Harris only securing a single-point advantage, according to a recent poll by the Arab American Institute.

KAMALA HARRIS' SUPPORT WITH ARAB AND MUSLIM COMMUNITIES IN MICHIGAN IS 'TENUOUS': DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST

Kristen Truitt, a Muslim American voter in Atlanta, has voted for Democrats in prior elections but now says the party will not have his support over its position on Israel.

""Just to give unlimited funds and access to Israel, I think that is totally ridiculous,"" Truitt told Fox 5 Atlanta.

This comes just ahead of the one-year mark of the ongoing war in Gaza between Israeli forces and Hamas terrorists. The conflict began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel and took more than 250 hostages, which prompted retaliatory action from Israel's military.

The Hamas-run government's Gaza Health Ministry estimates that more than 41,000 people have been killed in the conflict, although it does not distinguish between civilian and terrorist deaths. More than 1,500 people have reportedly been killed in Israel since the start of the conflict, with most of them being killed on Oct. 7 and its immediate aftermath.

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

The growing group of Muslim voters in Georgia and across the country have said they will not vote for Harris or Trump due to both sides' vocal support of Israel in its war in Gaza, and the conflict is now expanding to include Israel attacking Hezbollah terror targets in Lebanon.

""What we're trying to say is we should really do away with the logic of voting for the 'lesser of two evils,'"" Kareem Rosshandler, Georgia co-chair of the ""Abandon Harris"" campaign, told Fox 5.

The ""Abandon Harris"" campaign group is urging Muslims to vote third-party to send a message to Republicans and Democrats that they need to earn the votes of the Muslim community.

""I think the main one is to say that the Muslim community in the United States won't be taken for granted,"" Rosshandler said.

Rosshandler said the group has already secured commitments from more than 10,000 Muslim voters to support third-party candidates. Some third-party candidates, including Libertarian Chase Oliver and the Green Party's Jill Stein, have been critical of Israel's war in Gaza.

The loss of Muslim voters is expected to hurt Harris more than Trump, as the Republican candidate has previously struggled to secure Muslim votes.

""That would essentially have a greater adverse impact on the Harris-Waltz ticket than it would on Trump-Vance,"" Emory University assistant professor of law Alicia Hughes, who is also a voting expert, told Fox 5 Atlanta. ""Trump, historically, has not been able to count on those votes.""

Hughes also says that if Harris or Trump were more vocally critical of Israel, it may not help their election chances either.

""There's a great possibility that you would lose more from the change than you would actually gain,"" she said."
"Netanyahu calls Macron, other Western leaders who support arms embargo against Israel a 'disgrace'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-macron-western-leaders-support-arms-embargo-against-israel-disgrace,2024-10-05T23:13:33Z,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed French President Emmanuel Macron and other Western leaders on Saturday who he said had called for an arms embargo on Israel over its airstrikes against Hamas in Gaza.

""As Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilized countries should be standing firmly by Israel's side, yet President Macron and other western leaders are now calling for arms embargoes against Israel. Shame on them, ""Netanyahu said in a statement.

He continued, ""Is Iran imposing an arms embargo on Hezbollah, on the Houthis, on Hamas and on its other proxies? Of course not. This axis of terror stands together, but countries who supposedly oppose this terror axis call for an arms embargo on Israel.""

Netanyahu called their stance a ""disgrace,"" adding that Israel would win ""with or without their support, but their shame will continue long after the war is won.""

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

He said, ""in defending ourselves against this barbarism, Israel is defending civilization against those who seek to impose a dark age of fanaticism on all of us. Rest assured, Israel will fight until the battle is won - for our sake and for the sake of peace and security in the world.""

Netanyahu noted that Israel is defending itself on seven different fronts, including Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Lebanon, Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria, terrorists in Judea and Samaria and Iran.

On Saturday, Macron said France would no longer supply arms to Israel, although the country will continue to send missile defense equipment.

""I think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza,"" Macron said in an interview, according to Euro News.

Also on Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had raided and dismantled a Hezbollah underground command complex in Lebanon.

""The troops entered a terror tunnel about 250 meters long, located about 300 meters from the border and not crossing into Israeli territory,"" IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a press conference.

He said a kitchenette and rooms that allowed for extended stays underground along with weapons and command rooms were found inside the complex.

""These compounds were intended to be used by Hezbollah terrorists in an attack on the communities of the Galilee,"" he said. ""This tunnel did not cross into our territory, and yesterday we destroyed it.""

The U.S. continues to supply Israel with arms, although President Biden has spoken out against the country's approach to its war with Gaza where tens of thousands of civilians have died.

""I think what he's doing is a mistake,"" Biden said in August, while continuing to call for a cease-fire. ""I don't agree with his approach.""

This week in a surprise appearance at a White House press briefing, Biden, in answering a reporter, said he wasn't sure if Netanyahu was holding off on a cease-fire to influence the November election.

""Whether he's trying to influence the election, I don't know - but I'm not counting on that,"" Biden said. ""No administration has helped Israel more than I have. None, none, none, and I think he should remember that."""
Rising from the ashes: Israelis in nation's war-torn south move home a year after October 7 massacre,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/rising-from-ashes-israelis-nations-war-torn-south-move-home-year-after-oct-7-massacre,2024-10-05T15:27:58Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Before October 7, the communities of the mostly agricultural cooperative settlements, commonly known as kibbutzim, near the Gaza Strip, were considered some of the most picturesque places in Israel, characterized by green fields and carpets of vibrant red anemones. Yet, they were also among the most bombarded areas in the country. ""Ninety-nine percent of the time, it's paradise; one percent of the time, it's hell,"" was a common saying among residents.

""It's fair to say this year, we live in that one percent"" Ofer Liberman admits, reflecting on the harsh reality faced by his community. For 22 years, he has served as the spokesperson for Kibbutz Nir Am, nestled in the Gaza envelope.

On October 7, it was Liberman's daughter, Inbal, the community's security coordinator, who displayed remarkable courage. She opened the weapons storage lockers and distributed arms to the community's rapid response team, sending them to various locations along the kibbutz fence. She and the team engaged in face-to-face battles with Hamas terrorists. Her quick actions prevented them from entering the kibbutz and prevented a massacre similar to what occurred in neighboring communities.

ISRAEL'S MILITARY SAYS FORCE IS 'AT WAR' WITH HAMAS AS IDF HITS BACK AT TERROR TARGETS

On Wednesday, during Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, Liberman celebrated with his family back in Kibbutz Nir Am. ""My wife and I were the only ones to come back in mid-November, while the kibbutz was under full military control. I manage the agriculture in Nir Am, and I had to be here. By the end of March, a small number of families returned, and on August 15, when government funding ended, everyone returned except for 12 families,"" he recounted.

""This was a sad holiday; some of our friends still have family members and friends held in Gaza. In the morning, we were informed by the IDF there would be loud noises coming from their fighting in Gaza,"" Liberman described the ongoing tension in the region. ""People got anxious because it reminded them of October 7 -- the booming and gunfire. But we're managing a routine. People go to work, and children go to school, living my life completely, with sounds of war.""

After October 7, 15,000 people were evacuated from the 21 kibbutzim in southern Israel, first to hotels and then into temporary housing across the country. Remarkably, about 70% have returned home, a significant achievement considering the ongoing war in Gaza and the devastating impact of the attack, which claimed the lives of some 1,200 people, 319 of whom were kibbutz members, and destroyed hundreds of homes.

FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ISSUE WARNING AHEAD OF OCT. 7 ATTACKS ANNIVERSARY

However, six of the communities where the impact was most severe have yet to return. In Kibbutz Be'eri, 98 men, women, and children were murdered, and 30 were kidnapped. In Kfar Aza, home to 700, 64 people, including women and children, were massacred, and 19 were taken hostage. In Nahal Oz, a small community of 450, 15 were killed and 8 were kidnapped.

""Only twenty members of Kibbutz Nahal Oz have returned to the kibbutz, while 330 residents -- eighty percent of our community -- are in Mishmar Ha'emek, a kibbutz in north-central Israel. They've been hosting us since October 8,"" Amir Tibon, a resident of Nahal Oz, told Fox News Digital. ""Being together as one community in this temporary housing has been significant, as we are surrounded by the people we love. Our children still go to school and kindergarten together, which makes a big difference.""

On October 7, Tibon and his wife Miri were rescued along with their two younger daughters, thanks to his mother Gali, and father, retired IDF Major General Noam Tibon, who drove from Tel Aviv to the kibbutz to rescue them. On their way, they rescued survivors of the music festival massacre and helped wounded Israeli soldiers. Hours after leaving his home in Tel Aviv, Amir's father battled a Hamas terrorist in Nahal Oz and saved his family. Tibon later chronicled his experiences in his new book, ""The Gates of Gaza: A Story of Betrayal, Survival, and Hope in Israel's Borderline,"" where he intertwines his personal story with the history of the kibbutz.

FOREIGN SURVIVORS OF BRUTAL HAMAS ATTACK ON ISRAEL RECALL TERROR MASSACRE: 'EVERYTHING WAS BURNING'

""The kibbutzim's key role in the history of Israel, in creating and protecting the borders of Israel, remains crucial. This way of life, with a strong emphasis on community and togetherness, is more important now than ever,"" Tibon believes.

""A kibbutz can be understood as a microcosm of collective living, where community, equality and shared labor play vital roles in the daily lives of its members,"" Ayelet Harris, head of the community division in the Kibbutz Movement, said of the leadership dynamics in these communities.

""The Kibbutzim institutional structure has been crucial in the process of recovery. I saw women and men leading their kibbutzim and prioritizing the mission of returning, even in uncertain times. They decided to focus on the mission of going, working through their emotional states while being part of the teams planning the return. This sense of ownership fosters a deeper sense of belonging than in other places where people feel less influence over future plans.""

Tibon reflected on the complexities surrounding the decision to return home. ""This is a conversation we have every day. The issue is about the sense of security that the government and IDF must provide, and overcoming the psychological barriers of returning to a place where such horrors occurred.""

The ongoing trauma is compounded by the uncertainty of their friends and family who remain in Hamas captivity. ""We received five of our hostages back alive in November, thanks to a deal orchestrated by President Biden. But we still have two friends, Omri and Zachi, in the hands of the enemy,"" Tibon explained. ""For me, going back to the kibbutz means living in a house where a neighbor was killed in the house in front of me, and another neighbor was murdered in the house behind. This is where I will raise my daughters. I believe I can do that, but I don't know if I can pass by the homes of these two friends and know they were left to die in the tunnels of Gaza.""

Last week, while walking around Kibbutz Gvulot, the contrast between the children's laughter and the reality of their lives was striking. Children played soccer on the grass, joyfully unaware of the shadows cast by the shelters positioned every few meters, decorated with pictures of beloved cartoon characters. The regional school at the center of the kibbutz has been improvised from structures that existed prior to October 7.

""After the attack, we found ourselves in a hotel in Eilat with a large part of the traumatized community of the south,"" Lior Dafner, the chairman of Kibbutz Gvulot, recalls. ""Every day we received news about more people we knew being kidnapped or murdered- a truly incomprehensible situation."" Kibbutz Gvulot was one of the very few places that were not raided during the October 7 massacre.

""You see a slow deterioration of people into helplessness; there are no frameworks for children. We realized we needed to establish ourselves and figure out where to go next. We wanted to ensure that the children and staff started the year on September 1, like all children in the country, and finish on June 30, in the same classroom with the same teacher and group of kids -- all in a safe and stable environment. After everything they've been through, losing friends and teachers, seeing them now in school gives us hope. This is the future. It gives us hope for what lies ahead,"" Dafner said.

Throughout the communities that are back in their homes, there is a call for resilience despite the challenges. Liberman said, ""I think we had to return here and hold this place. We need to preserve our country. I was just in New York, sitting with Jews who lamented that they are not in Israel.

Newly revealed emails show senior military officials raised concerns with the White House within days of Israel commencing its operation in Gaza.

Reuters obtained and examined emails between senior State Department and Pentagon officials between Oct. 11-14 that showed concern and alarm as Israel started hitting the Gaza Strip with missile strikes.

The emails specifically focused on the mass evacuation of Palestinians as a potential legal issue. Dana Stroul, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East at the time, wrote to senior Biden aides Oct. 13 and warned that Israel could face war crime charges for its actions.

The emails also include pressure to include messages of sympathy for the Palestinian people and to allow more aid into Gaza while seeking to remain in solidarity with Israel.

ISRAELI MILITARY KILLS 250 HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS SINCE START OF LIMITED GROUND OPERATION IN LEBANON

Israel's invasion of Gaza has proven polarizing and painful for the Democrats. The progressive wing and younger voters are trying to hold the Biden administration to account for its support of Israel as tens of thousands of Palestinians die.

The invasion also made it difficult -- if not impossible -- for aid groups to help the displaced residents of Gaza who fled their homes to avoid getting caught up in Israel's operations.

Stroul outright alleged that Israel could be ""close to committing war crimes"" after the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) dropped leaflets over northern Gaza urging residents to flee their homes ahead of the military rolling into the territory as part of the early ""targeted incursions.""

""Their main line is that it is impossible for one million civilians to move this fast,"" Stroul wrote. One official said that such an operation was not possible without creating a ""humanitarian catastrophe.""

Three senior U.S. officials argued the White House was slow to address these problems, with Biden's team at one point arguing that the U.S. was ""leading international efforts to get humanitarian aid into Gaza,"" which would remain a ""top priority.""

Bill Russo, at the time an assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of Global Public Affairs, attempted to drive home the long-term impact of the U.S.'s ""lack of response on the humanitarian conditions"" in Gaza, calling it ""ineffective and counterproductive"" while also harming relations with Arab nations.

""If this course is not quickly reversed by not only messaging, but action, it risks damaging our stance in the region for years to come,"" Russo wrote in one email, according to Reuters. A colleague forwarded his emails to White House officials and warned that ""otherwise would-be stalwart"" Arab partners might think twice about relations with the U.S.

Russo eventually resigned from his post in March 2024, citing personal reasons for his decision.

Far-left voters have placed the fate of Gaza front and center of their concerns approaching November's election. The voters of Michigan started an ""uncommitted"" protest vote during the Democratic primary as a means of venting frustration at the Biden administration's handling of the crisis.

Those same voters shredded Harris for her DNC speech in August, calling it ""horrible"" and accusing Harris of ""downplaying"" U.S. complicity in the Gaza invasion by providing Israel funding and weapons.

Disapproval mounts both at home and abroad as US avoids direct action against Houthi rebels,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/disapproval-mounts-home-abroad-us-avoids-direct-action-against-houthi-rebels,2024-10-04T08:09:52Z,"Fox News senior strategic analyst Ret. Gen. Jack Keane joins 'Fox Report' to discuss the escalating tensions in the Middle East amid fears of a wider war.

While much of the world has eyes on Israel's battles with Hezbollah and Hamas, the U.S. Navy has its sights set on another of Iran's proxies, the Yemeni Houthi rebels.

With a mission to keep international waterways at peace, the Navy now finds itself fending off attacks from the shadowy gang of pirates who have gone from arming themselves with assault rifles, pickup trucks and motorboats - to a seemingly unending supply of drones, missiles and other weaponry.

The Houthis often attack unarmed Western ships carrying goods through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden - while the U.S. has responded in kind with drone attacks on Yemen.

ISRAELI AIR FORCE STRIKES HOUTHI TARGETS IN YEMEN WITH 'EXTENSIVE' OPERATION

That's led to perilous waters along a trade route that typically sees some $1 trillion in goods pass through it, as well as shipments of aid to war-torn Sudan and the Yemeni people.

And as the attacks continue, some experts argue the U.S. response has not been strong enough to deter the Houthis from inflicting billions of dollars worth of damage to the global economy.

""The U.S. response has been ineffective,"" Can Kasapoglu, a Turkey-based Hudson Institute fellow who specializes in Middle East political-military affairs, told Fox News Digital.

""We have very limited intelligence about [the Houthis] and they are in a different part of the world, in a distant corner of the Middle East. But that corner also happens to be right next to a choke point on global trade... The Houthis are the most daring of the Iranian proxy network. And the U.S. has never gone into a preemptive phase where they target the Houthi leadership.""

IRAN WARNS OF 'DECISIVE RESPONSE' IF ISRAEL CROSSES 'RED LINES'

The U.S. has responded to attacks with air and missile defense efforts, drone and missile interceptions - only engaging the Houthis once an attack is imminent, said Kasapoglu.

""We never saw a high-yield targeted killing campaign by the United States, for instance, Israel killed [Hezbollah leader] Hassan Nasrallah. Or just like Israel went after, for instance, the higher, high-level Iranian Revolutionary Guards generals, so this is what is missing - the U.S. acting against critical leadership.""

In addition to destroying goods destined for the West, the regular Houthi attacks drive up insurance costs: premiums for some shot up tenfold. They force some ships to travel the long way - down around the Horn of Africa, which can add $1 million in fuel costs for a round trip.

""They are launching relatively low-cost weapon systems, and inflicting major economic damage on the West on behalf of Iran. This is a very lucrative business,"" said Kasapoglu.

One argument for restraint could be the cost of action: Houthi drones are estimated to cost a few thousand dollars each. The Naval missiles the U.S. fires back at them can run around $2 million a shot.

Houthi attacks ramped up after Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel, targeting 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones over the past year.

They've seized one vessel and sunk two and killed a total of four sailors. A U.S.-led series of airstrikes in May killed at least 16 people, the rebels said.

BIDEN ADMIN NEEDS 'MORE AGGRESSIVE' PLAN TO TAKE ON HOUTHIS

On Tuesday, the rebel group claimed it shot down a multimillion-dollar, U.S.-made MQ-9 Reaper drone flying near Yemen. The U.S. acknowledged losing one of the drones, which costs around $30 million apiece.

In January, the Iran-backed militias killed three U.S. service members and injured 40 others in an attack on a U.S. base in Jordan. The U.S. responded forcefully to that attack with a barrage of airstrikes on 85 targets across Iraq and Syria.

""That response proved to be effective, and I think that we could do more of that certainly - take that approach,"" said retired Lt. Gen. Mark Schwartz, former security coordinator of the Israel-Palestinian Authority.

Since the Houthis seized the country's north and its capital of Sanaa in 2014, the U.S. military has seen Reapers shot down in Yemen in 2017, 2019, 2023 and 2024. The U.S. military acknowledged the Houthis shot down two MQ-9s in September.

The Houthis also continue to launch missiles targeting Israel. In response, Israel Defense Forces launched aggressive retaliatory strikes in Yemen's key port city of Hodeida.

The rebels have maintained that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel's campaign in Gaza against Hamas. But many of the ships they attack have little connection to the conflict - some were even bound for Iran.

BIDEN SAYS HE WOULD NOT BACK ISRAELI STRIKE ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR SITES

Last month, they attacked the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion, which was carrying 1 million barrels of oil in the Red Sea.

And last week, Houthi rebels fired half a dozen ballistic missiles, anti-ship cruise missiles and two drones at three U.S. ships traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. All were intercepted by Navy destroyers, a U.S. official said Friday.

""This gets resolved when we finish our dealings with Iran, whatever that looks like in the long term,"" said Seth Krummrich, a retired Army colonel and former chief of staff at Special Operations Command Central (SOCCENT).

Sources say the U.S. lacks a will to put boots on the ground to fight the Houthis. Central to the Biden administration's global strategy is a concern over escalating tensions that could lead to a full-scale confrontation with Iran - a nation that, by many estimates, is only weeks away from having the capability to build a nuclear bomb.

""The Israelis have the will to fight the Houthis, but they have limited capability, and they're also engaged with two wars going on right now, so it necessitates American intervention if the West really wants to stop them,"" said Kasapoglu.

US FORCES DESTROY HOUTHI WEAPONS

""Avoiding escalation is an obsession right now. It is a psychological case, not a political case. And it is imprisoning American military capabilities.""

Krummrich argued that the Pentagon ""has been staring at the Houthi problem long enough to understand that there is a limit to what you're going to be able to do without putting boots on the ground.""

""That would be like a giant sponge. It can absorb an endless amount of our resources,"" he said. ""But the Houthis are also smart. They launch and then retreat quickly... if they stay outside of our rules of engagement, they will be less likely to be struck.""

But others say there is more to be done that does not amount to ground forces.

""Yemen has proven time and time again that they're willing to absorb a lot of lethal activity from the U.S. and the coalition and still attack vessels, still attack Israel,"" said Schwartz.

""There's this fear of escalation, doing something that's so provocative that we're going to have a broader war. Yemen is at war with the United States from their perspective, right? Just like Lebanese Hezbollah is at war and has been with Israel, and the same with Hamas prior to Oct. 7.""

""We overestimate our concern in terms of a broadening conflict, because at the end of the day, the Houthis in particular, they're not a viable military force,"" Schwartz went on.

""We could be much more aggressive in terms of our military response to the Houthis and find an overwhelming response that falls well short of getting the U.S. mired in some type of major conflict."""
"FIFA to investigate Israel, days after Iran attacks, for alleged discrimination due to Palestinian complaints",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/fifa-investigate-israel-alleged-discrimination-after-palestinian-complaints,2024-10-03T22:49:54Z,"Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., says the Biden-Harris administration is ""out of step"" with the conflict in the Middle East.

FIFA, the world governing body of soccer, intends to launch an investigation against the Israel Football Association (IFA) over allegations raised by the Palestinian Football Association (PFA), it announced on Thursday.

FIFA's disciplinary committee will be asked to look into allegations of discrimination as the PFA has accused the IFA of complicity in violations of international law by the Israeli government, discrimination against Arab players and inclusion in its league of clubs located in Palestinian territory.

""The FIFA Disciplinary Committee will be mandated to initiate an investigation into the alleged offense of discrimination raised by the Palestine Football Association,"" FIFA said in a statement. ""FIFA's Governance, Audit and Compliance Committee will be entrusted with the mission to investigate... the participation in Israeli competitions of Israeli football teams allegedly based in the territory of Palestine.""

Fox News has reached out to the PFA and IFA for comment.

The PFA previously proposed a suspension for Israel over the war in Gaza. The PFA proposal to 211 member federations called for ""appropriate sanctions, with immediate effect, against Israeli teams,"" according to FIFA documents released this year.

The proposal cited ""international law violations committed by the Israeli occupation in Palestine, particularly in Gaza"" and cited FIFA statutory commitments on human rights and against discrimination.

""All the football infrastructure in Gaza has been either destroyed, or seriously damaged, including the historic stadium of Al-Yarmuk,"" the PFA wrote, adding that it had support for the motion from the federations of Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Syria and Yemen.

The PFA's proposal was enough to convince FIFA to seek an independent legal council and hold a landmark council meeting to make a decision on whether to suspend Israel from international soccer because of the conflict with Hamas, said FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the FIFA congress in May.

""FIFA will mandate as of now, independent legal expertise to [analyze] the three requests [from the Palestinian FA] and ensure the statutes of FIFA are applied in the right way,"" Infantino said. ""Due to the urgency of the situation, an extraordinary FIFA Council will be convened and will take place before July 20 to review the results of the legal assessment and to take the decisions that are appropriate.""

FIFA said on Thursday that it won't suspend Israel but that the investigation into alleged discrimination will be carried out.

The most recent and prominent example of a country to have its athletes banned from major international sports competition was Russia at the Paris Olympics this summer.

ISRAELI WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAMS FLEE GAME AFTER IRANIAN MISSILE STRIKES

Russia was banned because it had invaded Ukraine just four days after the end of the 2022 Winter Olympics. The International Olympic Committee considered this attack a violation of the Olympic truce, which is a resolution that calls for all nations to lay down arms and not engage in conflict starting one week before the Olympics begin and ending one week after the end. The Russian Olympic Committee lost its appeal against its suspension by the International Olympic Committee in February.

Belarus, which was used as a staging ground for the invasion, was also not allowed to compete in Paris.

However, a total of 32 athletes from Russia and Belarus competed in Paris as neutral participants; 17 previously represented Belarus and 15 represented Russia. They were not allowed to boast their country's flag, but they were able to attend the closing ceremony.

Countries have also been banned from competing in the World Cup in the past, but those nation's players were never allowed to compete as neutrals.

Germany and Japan were banned from the 1950 World Cup after the end of World War II. South Africa was banned from 1966 to 1992 for violating FIFA's anti-discrimination charter due to apartheid. Mexico was even banned for two years after using overage players in qualifiers for the 1989 World Youth Championship.

FIFA's announcement comes the same week that Iran launched a massive missile strike against Israeli cities.

Iran's strikes on Israel forced nearly 10 million people to find safety in bomb shelters on Tuesday.

The barrage of aerial warfare was the first time in Israeli history that the country's densely populated cities - Tel Aviv and Jerusalem - in the center of the biblical nation, faced such potentially devastating attacks. The Israeli military said most of the missiles were intercepted, per the Associated Press.

Iran also warned that a retaliatory strike could warrant further ballistic response.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said during the Asia Cooperation Dialogue summit this week that Israel must not believe it can act with ""impunity,"" according to Reuters.

""Any type of military attack, terrorist act or crossing our red lines will be met with a decisive response by our armed forces,"" said Pezeshkian.

A Yazidi woman held captive by Islamic terrorists for the last decade has been reunited with her family in Iraq following her escape and safe evacuation on Oct. 1 in a coordinated effort between Israeli and U.S. officials, the State Department confirmed to Fox News Digital on Thursday.

Fawzia Amin Sido, now 21, was just 11 years old when she was kidnapped by ISIS terrorists before she was sold and trafficked into Gaza, where she was forced to marry an alleged Hamas fighter.

Amin Sido was apparently able to escape after her captor was killed in what was believed to have been an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) strike, enabling her to flee to a ""hideout"" within the Gaza Strip.

CHILDREN ONCE HELD HOSTAGE STILL WORKING THROUGH TRAUMA: 'ARE THEY COMING FOR US AGAIN?'

""In a complex operation coordinated between Israel, the United States, and other international actors, she was recently rescued in a secret mission from the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom Crossing,"" the IDF said in a statement Thursday. ""Upon her entry into Israel, she continued to Jordan through the Allenby Bridge Crossing and from there-returned to her family in Iraq.""

The operation was led by the IDF's Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories unit along with help provided by the U.S. Embassy in Israel, as well as other international actors, though the IDF did not detail who.

""Her story is heartbreaking, and we are glad that she will be reunited with her family in Iraq,"" a spokesperson for the State Department told Fox News Digital. ""As Secretary [Antony] Blinken has noted, '2,600 Yezidis remain missing and unaccounted for. We are determined to find them, to learn their fates, and to rescue those who remain alive'.""

The IDF said the coordinated trafficking efforts in Amin Sido's case are ""further evidence of the connection between the terrorist organization Hamas and ISIS.""

WHY NO ISIS MEMBER HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH GENOCIDE OR SEXUAL VIOLENCE FOR CRIMES AGAINST YAZIDIS

ISIS attacked Yazidi populations in the northern Iraqi town of Sinjar in August 2014, abducting some 6,400 people and killing another 1,200, according to a report by the Times of Israel.

Roughly half of the abductees have reportedly been able to escape or have been freed.

The growing ties between ISIS and other terrorist organizations like Hamas signify a growing shift in the Middle East in which extremist groups, despite prior differences, are increasingly expanding ties, often facilitated by the backing of Iran.

The IDF vowed to continue to counter the ""Hamas-ISIS terrorist organization"" by striking terrorist-based infrastructure sites and pledged to ""free all hostages in Hamas captivity.""

There are still 101 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, including seven Americans, most of whom were taken during the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks, though four of them were abducted in 2014 and 2015.

This figure does not include other Yazidi abductees mentioned by Blinken who may also be being held in Gaza."

Watch: Pro-Israel influencer recovers West Bank interview with Palestinian woman he was threatened to delete,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/pro-israel-influencer-recovers-west-bank-interview-with-palestinian-woman-that-he-was-threatened-to-delete,2024-10-03T09:09:30Z,"Zach Sage Fox traveled to the West Bank to see if Palestinian people truly support the Hamas terror group, but he almost didn't make it out alive.

Comedian and pro-Israel influencer Zach Sage Fox believes an interview he filmed in the West Bank could show Americans how Palestinian civilians truly feel about Jewish people - but it took him months to recover the footage after he was threatened to delete it.

Fox has been on a crusade to educate his followers since the terror attacks of October 7. He went viral earlier this year when his ""Gaza Graduation"" video featured anti-Israel protesters in New York City struggling to correctly answer basic questions about the Israel-Hamas war and decided to take his popular man-on-the-street style interviews to the West Bank, a contentious territory that Palestinians hope to establish as an independent state along with the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip.

Fox, a ""loud and proud"" Jewish American, told anyone who asked that he was an Italian American and was able to cross the border into the West Bank without issue, because Israelis and Jewish people are not welcomed in the region.

INFLUENCER WENT TO THE WEST BANK TO SEE IF PALESTINIANS SUPPORT HAMAS - HE ALMOST DIDN'T MAKE IT OUT ALIVE

Fox found several people walking West Bank streets who were quick to express support for the Hamas terror group and declared Israeli hostages should not be released, but things got dicey when he tried to interview a woman whose hair was fully covered. A ""very upset"" Palestinian man approached him and asked him to delete the footage.

""They're not used to anybody questioning their narrative that they've been brainwashed to believe. And you can see it ... I'm interviewing that girl just for several minutes and these men watching it, they can't even accept that you would be asking questions because it's not a free society,"" Fox told Fox News Digital.

Fox recalled the man yelling ""something about modesty,"" and that females shouldn't speak for all Palestinians. Fox attempted to ignore the man, but he only grew more agitated and started calling additional Palestinian men for support. He explained that he caved and deleted the footage when his Muslim cameraman said the angry group was threatening their lives.

Fox initially enlisted a team of IT specialists who were able to recover some of the footage, and every interview that was salvaged made the viral ""Wild West Bank"" video. But his conversation with the woman who sparked the conversation remained lost.

""Dozens of cyberhackers,"" additional IT specialists and even an Israel Defense Forces veteran with a passion for technology all tried unsuccessfully to restore the video. Fox was beginning to lose hope, but was eager to show the world what this woman had to say because she was ""emblematic of the mindset"" in the region.

She was ""clearly educated"" and spoke perfect English, dressed in designer clothes and said she was an engineer. Yet, she believed all Zionist should be killed.

FOX NEWS MEDIA DRAWS 10.4 MILLION FOR SIMULCAST OF THE CBS VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Another technology expert caught wind of the story and offered to help recover the video. Fox thought it was impossible and was reluctant to set himself up for further disappointment but eventually said ""f -- k it"" and gave them a shot.

""A week later I got a call that they recovered almost all of it. It was a miracle,"" Fox said.

Fox then watched the footage and ""couldn't believe his eyes.""

""To see that interview back after three months was insane... I didn't know when my cameraman stopped filming, so I didn't realize, one, that you could see the men starting to pull the other men in the into the thing. I didn't realize you could see that behind me,"" he said.

""I also didn't realize that my cameraman kept the camera going long enough so that you actually saw the people cut the camera off and stop the shoot,"" Fox added. ""So, that was like wild to me.""

Fox then published ""Wild West Bank: Deleted Scenes Exploded,"" allowing the world to see the footage the angry Palestinian men tried to scrub.

VIRAL INFLUENCER ZACH SAGE FOX PUT SPOTLIGHT ON CLUELESS ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS: 'NO ONE KNEW ANYTHING'

In the shocking video, the woman told him that most Palestinians support Hamas, she proudly declared being ""really satisfied"" with footage Hamas terrorists took on Oct. 7. She also denied Hamas killed babies and women during the attack and said no Israelis are ""innocent civilians."" She suggested she is a ""refugee"" despite her family living in the West Bank for multiple generations and flatly dismissed a two-state solution. Along the way, Fox politely pushed back on antisemitic claims and absurd talking points.

""I am an educated person, it's either us or us,"" she said when suggesting Jewish people need to leave Israel for good. When Fox told her there would ""never be peace"" with that mindset, she fired back, ""It's their problem.""

As a man began lurking in the background, Fox asked if she believes Zionists deserve to die.

""Cut, cut real quick,"" the man said. ""What side are you on?""

Fox calmly responded that he was simply asking questions, but the man demanded to know where he was from.

""I'm from the states,"" Fox answered as the man demanded the cameraman stop recording.

The video abruptly cuts off.

NETANYAHU RESPONDS TO HEZBOLLAH ATTACK THAT KILLED CHILDREN AT SOCCER FIELD: 'THIS WILL NOT GO UNANSWERED

Fox feels ""vindicated"" that he was able to share the footage.

""I just think this girl is really representative of how these people think,"" Fox said.

""I feel bad for her, I know that sounds crazy cause she's literally sitting there saying everyone who I love deserves to die,"" he continued. ""But my takeaway is that she's the perfect example of somebody who's not stupid. She's an engineer, she's a smart girl, but she's been brainwashed by the propaganda they're taught in Palestine.""

Earlier this year, the Department of State urged Americans to avoid the West Bank because of ""terrorism and civil unrest.""

Fox remains one of the only Americans to enter the West Bank and try to ask tough questions, but he doesn't believe State Department warnings are the thing keeping America journalists out of the region.

""I genuinely think that they know deep down, whether they want to admit it or not, that they would find... it totally negates their narrative, which is that, you know, 'Hamas is bad, but the Palestinians are separate,'"" Fox said.

""I wish that was the case. I truthfully didn't believe it myself until I went there that day,"" he added. ""They love Hamas."""

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) met on Wednesday following Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel, but overshadowing the meeting was Israel's announcement that it had banned the U.N. secretary-general due to his failure to condemn Iran.

""Anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran's heinous attack on Israel does not deserve to step foot on Israeli soil,"" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said about the decision to declare U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as persona non grata.

""This is an anti-Israel secretary-general who lends support to terrorists, rapists and murderers,"" Katz argued. ""Guterres will be remembered as a stain on the history of the U.N. for generations to come.""

Iran on Tuesday fired over 180 ballistic missiles at Israel after the death of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah and after the Israel Defense Forces began focused incursions into Lebanon to hit the terrorist group.

ISRAEL URGES UN TO CONDEMN IRAN AFTER LATESTS ATTACKS

Guterres on Tuesday issued a brief statement following Iran's attack, calling it the ""latest attacks in the Middle East"" and broadly condemned the conflict as ""escalation after escalation.""

He also slammed Israel for its actions in Gaza and the West Bank, claiming that Israel has ""conducted in Gaza the most deadly and destructive military campaign in my years.""

""The suffering endured by the Palestinian people in Gaza is beyond imagination,"" Guterres said. ""At the same time, the situation in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, continues to deteriorate, with Israeli military operations.""

""Construction of settlements, evictions, land grabs and the intensification of settler attacks progressively undermine any possibility of a two-state solution, and simultaneously, armed Palestinian groups have also used violence,"" he said.

HAMAS LEADER KILLED IN LEBANON WAS UN EMPLOYEE, AGENCY CONFIRMS

Israel blasted Guterres for failing to ""unequivocally"" condemn Iran's attack or even name Iran while discussing the attack. Israel responded with the persona non grata declaration, effectively banning him from entering its borders.

""Anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran's heinous attack on Israel, as nearly all the countries of the world have done, does not deserve to set foot on Israeli soil,"" Katz said.

""This is a secretary-general who has yet to denounce the massacre and sexual atrocities committed by Hamas murderers on Oct. 7 and has not led any resolutions to declare them a terrorist organization,"" Katz continued.

""A secretary-general who provides support to the terrorists, rapists and murderers of Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and now Iran, the mothership of global terror, will be remembered as a stain on the history of the U.N. for generations to come,"" he added. ""Israel will continue to defend its citizens and uphold its national dignity, with or without António Guterres.""

BBC NEWS SPURS OUTRAGE AFTER COMMENTATOR DEFENDS HEZBOLLAH, IRAN: 'OPENLY PRO-TERRORIST'

And while it took nearly a day following the attacks to condemn Iran, Guterres seemed to get the message, telling council members: ""As I did in relation to the Iranian attack in April - and as should have been obvious yesterday in the context of the condemnation I expressed - I again strongly condemn yesterday's massive missile attack by Iran on Israel.""

Israel's decision to ban Guterres prompted anger from Algeria, which first expressed ""sincere gratitude... solidarity, admiration and support for the secretary-general.""

""This decision reflects a clear disdain of the U.N. system and the entire international community,"" the representative from Algeria said. ""For the Israeli authorities, no narrative nor truth exists except their own.""

However, some permanent members of the council expressed clear support for Israel and condemned Iran for the attack while urging Tehran to cease its support for terrorism through its proxy forces.

U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield ""unequivocally"" condemned Iran's attack and called for further sanctions against Tehran. She also explicitly tied Iran to the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, arguing that ""Iran was complicit... through its funding, training, capabilities and support for the military wing of Hamas.""

ISRAELI MILITARY SAYS REGULAR INFANTRY, ARMORED UNITS JOINING LIMITED GROUND OPERATION IN SOUTHERN LEBANON

""After Hamas's horrific attack carried out nearly a year ago today, the United States sent a clear message to Iran: Don't exploit the situation in ways that would risk propelling the region into a broader war,"" Thomas-Greenfield said.

""The IRGC flagrantly and repeatedly ignored this warning by encouraging and enabling the Houthis in Yemen to disrupt global shipping and launch attacks against Israel by supporting militant groups in Syria and Iraq,"" she continued.

""Iran's stated intention was to avenge the deaths of two IRGC-supported terrorist leaders and an IRGC commander by inflicting significant damage and death in Israel,"" she added. ""Thankfully, and through close coordination between the United States and Israel, Iran failed to achieve its objectives.""

""This outcome does not diminish the fact that this attack, intended to cause significant death and destruction, marked a significant escalation by Iran,"" she stressed.

The United Kingdom also condemned Iran's attack and expressed ""full support"" for Israel ""in exercising its right to defend itself against Iranian aggression.""

France urged Iran to ""abstain from any action that could lead to additional destabilization,"" going further to condemn the ""attack that targeted civilians in Jaffa.""

""Civilian populations are the first victims of this horrible situation,"" the French representative said. ""The situation is serious.""

Iran ultimately pleaded its case before the council, arguing that the Security Council has ""remained paralyzed due to the United States obstruction"" and accused permanent members France and the United Kingdom of acing as ""serious enablers"" of Israel who ""attempt to justify Israeli heinous crimes under the guise of self-defense, shifting the blame onto Iran."""
Will Netanyahu 'take the fight directly to Iran' after massive missile strike across Israel?,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-weighs-israeli-response-irans-massive-missile-attack-amid-fears-all-out-war,2024-10-02T15:11:46Z,"JERUSALEM -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with the heads of the country's security establishment on Wednesday following Iran's firing of 181 missiles into Israel amid fears that a lethal regional war is around the corner.

Fox News Digital spoke to military and Iran experts about the growing chance of a wider confrontation between the Jewish state and the clerical regime in Tehran breaking out.

""After the Iranian missile attack against Israel there is no questioning anymore the basic understanding that Iran is the greatest generator of terror and death in the Middle East. Until now, Israel has been playing a whack-a-mole game with Iran's proxies - fighting Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and others,"" Yaakov Katz, the author of ""Shadow Strike: Inside Israel's Secret Mission to Eliminate Syrian Nuclear Power,"" told Fox News Digital.

ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER TELLS US ONLY 'MILITARY ACTION' CAN RETURN PEOPLE TO HOMES AMID HEZBOLLAH THREAT

Katz, who is a senior fellow at the global think tank Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI), added, ""With Iran again attacking Israel directly, the time has come to take the fight directly to Iran. The ayatollahs there need to be made to pay a price.""

The headline by military analyst Amos Harel in the left-wing Haaretz paper read on Wednesday: ""After an unprecedented Iranian attack, we are in a regional war.""

The Islamic republic has been recognized as the center of Mideast volatility, terrorism and jingoism for decades. In 2010, Saudi Arabian King Abdullah told the United States to ""cut off the head of the snake"" by launching military strikes to eradicate Iran's reported nuclear weapons facilities.

Iran's strikes on Israel forced nearly 10 million people to find safety in bomb shelters on Tuesday. The barrage of aerial warfare was the first time in Israeli history that the country's densely populated cities - Tel Aviv and Jerusalem - in the center of the biblical nation, faced such devastating attacks. The Israelis did not panic and stayed relatively calm under the pressure of the largely surprise attack.

The only fatality from the Iranian barrage was the murder of a Palestinian man in the West Bank (known in Israel by its biblical regional name of Judea and Samaria).

""Tonight Iran attempted to kill thousands of Israeli men, women and children but thanks to our miraculous defense system Iran failed miserably. Tehran is hurting after seeing its proxies in Gaza, Lebanon and Yemen get crushed by Israel. Tehran made a huge mistake tonight and will pay a heavy price at the time and place of our choosing,"" Lt. Col. Yoni Chetboun, former deputy speaker of the Knesset and an IDF special forces operator in reserves, told Fox News Digital.

IRAN'S 'NUCLEAR ENERGY MOUNTAIN' IS 'FULLY SAFE' AFTER ISRAELI STRIKE: STATE MEDIA

Chetboun was a decorated special forces operator from the second Lebanon war, when Israel fought the Iran-backed terrorist movement Hezbollah in 2006.

Prior to Iran's military strike on Israel in April, Fox News Digital reported that the Biden-Harris administration released billions in sanctions relief to Iran that will flow into its proxies' war machines, according to experts.

The topic of funneling billions to Iran's regime surfaced during the vice presidential debate on Tuesday. Republican Sen. JD Vance said, ""Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration.

""What do they use that money for? They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching against our allies. And God forbid, launching against the United States as well.""

BIDEN ADMIN UNDER PRESSURE TO STOP BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SANCTIONS RELIEF TO IRAN

Lisa Daftari, an expert on Iran, said, ""The conflict between the Iran regime and Israel did not commence today, in April, or on Oct. 7 of the previous year. Its origins trace back to 1979, when the mullahs ascended to power, promulgating a doctrine that demonized the 'Great Satan,' a term for the United States, and the 'Little Satan,' referring to Israel.

""Over the past 45 years, the Iran regime has persistently targeted American and Israeli interests, orchestrating terror proxies to execute its strategic objectives against both nations. More recently, U.S. policies that have enriched the mullahs have facilitated billions of dollars on establishing a formidable encirclement around Israel, via the regime's various proxies in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Gaza and the West Bank.""

In April, Iran's regime launched a sprawling aerial attack, with over 300 suicide drones and missiles, on Israel. Jerusalem countered the Iranian swarm of missiles with a targeted strike against military installations in the Iranian province of Isfahan.

Daftari, editor-in-chief of the Foreign Desk news website, added, ""Israel's recent military actions signal a departure from the more restrained posture observed in April, when the nation's defense capabilities against missile threats were deemed a victory. The recent strategic strikes in Lebanon underscore Israel's heightened efforts to neutralize enduring existential threats.""

She noted that it historically has engaged in tit-for-tat-like responses but noted, ""Israel is now poised to take decisive measures aimed at neutralizing this looming risk, with its focus now entirely on the regime in Tehran.""

NETANYAHU CALLS MIDEAST CONFLICTS CHOICE BETWEEN 'BLESSING OR A CURSE,' WARNS ABOUT ISRAEL'S 'LONG ARM'

David Wurmser, a former senior adviser for nonproliferation and Middle East strategy for former Vice President Dick Cheney, told Fox News Digital, ""This is a war between Israel and Iran which began as a direct war on April 14. The war is a twilight struggle between a nation run by a tyranny that seeks to extinguish the other. Either Iran or Israel, but not both, will emerge from this war not only as victor but survivor.""

He said the so-called ""ring of fire that Iran built around Israel not only had an aggressive aim - to choke Israel to death by initiating a violent war of attrition and isolation, including closing ports and ending international airlines' flying to Israel - but also acted as a defensive deterrent against Israel, shielding Iran from any potential Israeli proactive action against Iran. With the destruction of Hezbollah, the strategic linchpin of the proxy network at the center of that ring of fire, as the greatest threat Israel faces, Iran was left fully exposed to the full weight of Israeli power.""

He echoed the strong language of Israel's military and political leadership, which ""promised to inflict severe pain on the regime of the Iran's supreme leader of the Islamic Republic, Ali Khamenei... Iran will surely now feel the vulnerability as the Israelis without fear any more of Hezbollah or Iran will take the war from the defensive to the offensive against Iran's regime, "" said Wurmser.

He added ""The mistake Iran made, as do its proxies and its minions in the West protesting on campuses, is not that they underestimate Israel's capabilities and its unity, but that they internalized their own ideology that Israel is a fake, fragile colonial entity rather than a deeply rooted civilization. Israel has shown that despite its mistakes and setbacks, its internal strength transcend that of any of their neighbors."""

A mother who was ""murdered while shielding her 9-month-old son"" has been identified by Israel as one of the victims of yesterday's terrorist attack at a train station outside of Tel Aviv.

Israel says the actions of Inbar Segev-Vigder in Jaffa on Tuesday ""saved"" the life of her child Ari.

""There are no words. Only heartbreak,"" Israel posted on X. ""May the memory of the victims be a blessing.""

Israeli police said Wednesday that a total of seven people were killed in a shooting that unfolded just minutes before Iran started launching ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for the recent killings of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.

Two Palestinian men from the Israeli-occupied West Bank town of Hebron opened fire, including shooting directly into a light rail carriage crowded with passengers that was stopped at a station.

The suspects -- who police say had no prior arrests, although one had been involved in disturbing the peace at a demonstration -- were later shot and killed by security guards and armed pedestrians, according to The Associated Press. Police and paramedics who responded to the scene treated another 16 people injured from the shooting.

Segev-Vigder lived in Tel Aviv and operated a fitness and Pilates studio, while her husband, Yaari Vigder, is an Israeli reservist soldier, The Jerusalem Post reports.

""Ari was in a carrier that covered Inbar's entire upper body during the attack, he was not injured at all,"" the website cited Yaari Vigder as telling Israel's Channel 11 news.

""For the rest of his life -- may he feel the same love he received from Inbar,"" he reportedly added.

A witness told Ynetnews that the 33-year-old mother was gunned down while stepping off a train in Jaffa, according to The Jerusalem Post.

The website identified four other victims as Revital Bronstein, 24, Shahar Goldman, 30, Nadia Sokolenko, 40, and Ilya Nozadze, 42.

Sokolenko's family told Israel's TPS news agency that they were waiting for her to return home from grocery shopping Tuesday night and her friends started checking area hospitals after her phone stopped answering calls.

Sokolenko, a native of Moldova who worked as an office manager, was described by friends as ""a very creative person and very caring mom"" of a 6-year-old daughter, TPS added.

Greece's foreign ministry also said Wednesday that a Greek national who lived in Jerusalem was among the dead.

Israel Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich wrote on X in the wake of the attack that ""I will now demand in the cabinet discussion that the family members of the abominable terrorists from Hebron who carried out the heinous attack in Jaffa be deported to Gaza tonight and their homes should be turned into ruins for them to see and see."""

As the Jewish community approaches the High Holiday season, many are concerned about rising antisemitism in the U.S. stemming from Hamas' Oct 7, 2023, terror attacks on Israel, which resulted in the murder of about 1,200 Israelis and hundreds of innocents taken hostage to the Gaza Strip.

This year's celebrations of Rosh Hashanah, Oct. 2-4, and Yom Kippur, Oct. 11-12, fall on either side of the one-year anniversary of the attack as Israel fights a multifront war that continues to stoke tensions at home.

The FBI hate crime statistics for 2023, released last week, demonstrate a considerable uptick in antisemitic hate crimes since Oct. 7. The FBI Crime Data Explorer shows a total of 1,951 anti-Jewish hate crimes in 2023, a 55% increase from 1,257 incidents reported in 2022. Of these, 980 incidents occurred between January and September. In the final three months of the year, 971 incidents were reported, an increase of more than 300% over the 318 incidents tallied during the same period in 2022.

GOV WHITMER CONDEMNS 'SQUAD' MEMBER'S 'ANTISEMITIC' ATTACK AGAINST MICHIGAN'S JEWISH AG: 'HATEFUL RHETORIC'

Amid this startling rise in hate, Community Security Service (CSS) CEO Richard Priem told Fox News Digital that he wants Jewish Americans to ""be reassured that there's a lot of competent organizations and individuals, both in government and within the community, proactively working to make sure that these High Holidays will be safe and enjoyable.""

The explosion of intolerance has spawned growth within CSS. It took Priem's nonprofit about a decade to train volunteers to support just under 300 Jewish institutions. Now, CSS partners with 470 institutions, an increase of ""30% over the course of 10 months,"" Priem said.

Some of CSS's new growth is on college campuses, where anti-Israel protests and encampments created hostile environments for Jewish students throughout the previous academic year and continue to cause chaos this year.

Priem said the CSS campus program, now present on a dozen campuses, is ""providing self-defense, awareness and de-escalation training for Jewish students"" as part of the larger CSS mission ""to make sure that Jewish life can continue unimpeded.""

BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY FACULTY VOTES 'NO CONFIDENCE' IN PRESIDENT AFTER 'EXCESSIVE' CRACKDOWN ON STUDENT PROTESTS

The CSS model focuses on ""empowering Jewish community members to become experts"" in securing their institutions. Now, more than 5,000 volunteers stand ready to protect their facilities, which is up from the less than 3,000 last year. With this effort to respond to community needs, ""[W]e are stretching the resources that we have to the maximum,"" Priem said.

But the work has paid off. Priem noted that his team ""reports hundreds of incidents every year, many of which are being investigated by law enforcement, some of which actually lead to arrests and federal charges."" While most of those incidents went uncovered by the media, ABC 7 Washington, D.C., reported on Dec. 17 that CSS volunteers stopped an attack on Jewish worshipers outside the Kesher Israel Synagogue in Georgetown.

NEW YORK ANTI-ISRAEL RALLY AT UN FEATURES SIGN SUPPORTING TERROR GROUP HEZBOLLAH

CSS volunteers were outside the synagogue when a stranger stepped out of a U-Haul parked near the synagogue entrance, shouted ""Gas the Jews"" and sprayed worshipers with a substance that was later revealed to be merely fart spray. CSS volunteers documented the incident and engaged law enforcement, which arrested perpetrator Brent Wood. In August, the U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., secured an indictment charging Wood, now a fugitive from the law, with ""three counts of obstructing by force or threat of force a person's enjoyment of their free exercise of religious beliefs, while using a dangerous weapon.""

The primary force behind the escalating threat to the Jewish community since Oct. 7 is the spillover of hate from continued conflict in the Middle East.

""Because of what's going on between Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah, there might be people coming to target that synagogue because of something politically they disagree with around a foreign country, but they feel justified in targeting a Jewish institution to express their hatred,"" Priem said.

Priem said CSS volunteers have not taken their eye off other threats, like the homegrown extremism of white supremacists like Robert Bowers, who perpetrated an attack that killed 11 congregants at Pittsburg's Tree of Life Synagogue in October 2018. The radical Islamic threat posed by groups like ISIS and al Qaeda also remains a serious concern. On Sept. 4, a Pakistani man pledging support to ISIS was arrested in Canada as he traveled to the U.S. to carry out planned attacks on a New York Jewish center on either Oct. 7 or Oct. 11.

While these threats are diverse and serious, Priem said CSS volunteers are prepared ""to work with law enforcement and make sure that [members of the Jewish community] can still enter and arrive to synagogue safely"" during Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur."

Tim Walz has the capacity to be 'sharp' during the CBS Vice Presidential Debate on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz kicked off his debate against Ohio Sen. JD Vance on shaky footing when he was first asked about his foreign policy platform in the Middle East.

""Governor Walz, if you were the final voice in the Situation Room, would you support or oppose a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran?"" CBS' Margaret Brennan asked Walz on Tuesday evening in New York City during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate.

Walz thanked the moderators for hosting him before delivering a halting and stammering answer while calling for ""steady leadership.""

""Iran, our I, Israel's ability to be able to defend itself is absolutely fundamental. Getting its hostages back, fundamental. And ending the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But the expansion of Israel and its proxies is an absolute fundamental necessity for the United States to have to steady leadership there. You saw it experienced today where along with our Israeli partners and our coalition, able to stop the incoming attack,"" Walz responded, taking a few pauses between words.

ISRAEL UNDER ATTACK: IRAN LAUNCHES MISSILES, GUNMEN KILL AT LEAST 8 NEAR TEL AVIV

Earlier Tuesday, Iran launched more than 100 ballistic missiles at Israel. War broke out in Israel nearly one year ago on Oct. 7 when Hamas launched attacks on the nation.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter. It's clear. And the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago, a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment,"" Walz continued.

GOP LEADER SAYS VANCE 'ABSOLUTELY PREPARED' FOR VP DEBATE SHOWDOWN WITH WALZ

Walz continued his response by taking shots at former President Donald Trump and his former administration officials.

""His chief of staff, John Kelly, said that he was the most flawed human being you'd ever met. And both of his secretaries of defense and his national security advisers said he should be nowhere near the White House. Now, the person closest to them... said he's unfit for the highest office. That was Sen. Vance,"" Walz said, referring to Vance's previous criticisms of Trump before he was elected to the White House in 2016.

Walz summed up his first response by arguing Vice President Kamala Harris has shown ""steady leadership"" on the world stage.

""What we've seen out of Vice President Harris is we've seen steady leadership. We've seen a calmness that is able to be able to draw on the coalitions, to bring them together understanding, that our allies matter. When our allies see Donald Trump turn towards Vladimir Putin, turn towards North Korea, when we start to see that type of fickleness around holding the coalitions together, we will stay committed.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken published an op-ed Tuesday touting the Biden-Harris administration's foreign policy record, stating they took drastic deviations from former President Trump, the same day Iran directly attacked Israel with hundreds of ballistic missiles.

Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles towards targets in Israel Tuesday evening local time in what the administration called a ""signigicant escalation by Iran."" The indiscriminate rocket fire were part of the Shia regime's response to Israel assassinating nearly all of Hezbollah senior leadership, including long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah.

Hours before Iran's attack, Blinken's op-ed touted how Biden-Harris' ""renewal"" strategy post-Trump was working and strengthening America's interests abroad.

""The Biden administration's strategy has put the United States in a much stronger geopolitical position today than it was four years ago,"" Blinken said.

PENTAGON SENDING A 'FEW THOUSAND' PERSONNEL TO MIDDLE EAST DAY AFTER BIDEN SAID HE WOULDN'T ADD COMBAT TROOPS

Blinken said the administration prioritized international cooperation and avoided making decisions abroad in isolation.

""From day one, President Biden and Vice President Harris made a foundational choice that in a more competitive and combustible world, the United States cannot go it alone. If America wants to protect its security and create opportunities for its people, it must stand with those who have a stake in a free, open, secure, and prosperous world and stand up to those who threaten that world,"" he wrote. ""President Biden and Vice President Harris pursued a strategy of renewal, pairing historic investments in competitiveness at home with an intensive diplomatic campaign to revitalize partnerships abroad,"" he said. ""This twin-pillared strategy, they believed, was the best way to disabuse competitors of their assumptions that the United States was declining and diffident.""

Blinken also stated the war in Gaza is interconnected to Iran's maligned behavior.

""Without an end to the war in Gaza and a time-bound, credible path to statehood that addresses the Palestinians' legitimate aspirations and Israel's security needs, normalization cannot move forward. But if these efforts succeed, normalization would join Israel to a regional security architecture, unlock economic opportunities across the region, and isolate Iran and its proxies,"" he continued. ""Glimmers of such integration were on display in the coalition of countries, including Arab states, that helped Israel defend itself against an unprecedented direct attack from Iran in April.""

The State Department referred Fox News Digital to the department's briefing when asked for comment.

House Republicans have described Biden-Harris foreign policy as one aiming at ""appeasement,"" particularly towards Iran.

Iran is preparing to ""imminently"" launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel, a senior White House official told Fox News on Tuesday morning, following weeks of Israeli strikes against Tehran's proxies in the region.

""The United States has indications that Iran is preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel,"" the official said. ""We are actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack. A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran.""

Another U.S. official told Fox News that Iran could launch its attack as soon as Tuesday afternoon, saying that the U.S. has seen additional movement of missiles in Iran to prepare for the now ""imminent"" attack.

The official added that Iran's attack could look like the one it launched in April against Israel, which had more than 300 ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones.

While the U.S. official did not know what the exact scope or size will be, the official said that Iran has been at a state of readiness to launch an attack on Israel within 12 to 24 hours since early August following the July 31st assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.

Iran already launched an unprecedented direct attack on Israel in April, though the regime's proxies, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, have traded attacks with Israel since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7.

On Tuesday, Israel was beginning a limited ground invasion into southern Lebanon against Hezbollah targets. Hezbollah, the most powerful armed group in the Middle East, has been reeling from weeks of targeted strikes that killed its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and several of his top commanders.

A U.S. State Department diplomat was previously involved in a project spotlighting influential figures in the Middle East, which included descriptions of some designated terrorists as individuals aiming to achieve ""social justice.""

Usra Ghazi is a foreign service officer, who got her first stint in the department during the Obama administration in 2015, briefly leaving in 2018. She returned again in 2019 as a diplomat.

The State Department's security clearance process for this role is rigorous; Fox News Digital asked the State Department how Ghazi's process went. ""Due to privacy considerations, the Department cannot provide any information regarding any current or former employees' security clearance,"" they said in a statement, which also confirmed she is currently an employee.

From 2009-2010, Ghazi edited and prepared two of the first editions of a textbook publication called ""The 500 Most Influential Muslims."" The text harshly criticizes attempts to reform traditional Islam, calling modernism ""an object of derision and ridicule [that] is scorned by traditional Muslims and fundamentalists alike.""

STATE DEPARTMENT MANDATES SUPPORT FOR DEI IDEOLOGY AS PREREQUISITE FOR PROMOTIONS: 'YOU ARE JUDGED'

Ghazi worked on the textbook while she studied abroad in Amman, Jordan, at the ""Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre"" from 2009-2010, according to her LinkedIn.

Ghazi went abroad as a participant in an international exchange program sponsored by the Clinton Global Initaitive and the office of Queen Rania of Jordan.

The academic work at times used soft language surrounding America-hating terrorists, like Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.

The publication Ghazi worked on described the terror group Hezbollah as a ""social justice"" movement and an ""International Symbol of Resistance Against Israel,"" according to the publication.

""Hezbollah is a Shi'a Islamic political party and paramilitary organization based in Lebanon. Hezbollah's ideology is based on seeking social justice through Islamic ideals,"" the publication spotlighting the influence of Hassan Nasrallah said.

The long-time Hezbollah leader Nasrallah was killed last week in an Israeli airstrike.

""Political and military successes have made Nasrallah a vastly influential figure in Lebanon, and in the Middle East more broadly. Nasrallah and Hezbollah are also controversial; the US and Canada list Hezbollah as a terrorist organization,"" the description continued.

It then went on to tout Hezbollah's social justice mission.

""Israel remains a key issue for the Muslim world and Hezbollah's aim to achieve social justice there is central to its activities,"" the text said.

""Hezbollah has also won significant grassroots support by cultivating a social welfare system that provides schools, clinics, and housing in the predominantly Shi'a parts of Lebanon, and also in others. These welfare activities are run with efficiency and rival those carried out by the state, giving the organization even broader appeal,"" it continued.

The State Department said its position on Hezbollah was ""quite clear"" and referred Fox News Digital to Monday's State Department briefing, where spokesperson Matt Miller condemned the group as a terrorist organization and stressed Israel's right to defend itself.

""Since becoming head of Hamas, Mashaal has seen the organization through multiple attempts at a roadmap to peace and a major Israeli siege of the Gaza Strip,"" it said.

""Mashaal has been recognized for his persistence with Hamas's efforts -- at present leading in exile from Syria. His determination is combined with a unique effort at diplomacy,"" it said. ""Mashaal has been one of the most direct, and candid leaders in dialogue and confrontation with Israel and this has garnered international recognition.""

In addition to working at the State Department, Ghazi is currently involved in ""America Indivisible"" as a senior adviser, according to her LinkedIn. She was previously its director from 2018-2019. America Indivisible currently promotes its publication from 2020 on its site, recommending that people read ""credible sources"" like ""MuslimGirl"" in order to combat religious intolerance.

MuslimGirl's objective is to draw awareness ""to the Qur'an's message of gender equality and Islam's principle of peace,"" according to the website's description.

Fox News Digital's previous review of MuslimGirl found that it was filled with articles containing pro-Palestinian propaganda from 2016 to the present.

The piece also questioned whether associating Hamas with terrorism was political.

But Vice President Harris, who ought to have presided at the joint session of Congress in her role as President of the Senate along with Speaker Johnson -- with both seated behind Netanyahu -- instead skipped the Israeli PM's address to the joint session of Congress on July 24. Harris thus sent a very public message to her supporters -- she did not care to reschedule previous commitments though Netanyahu's visit was long in planning -- and then met with Netanyahu privately as did President Biden.

Whatever the President and Vice President said to the Prime Minister after what the Vice President did by way of very visible messaging, Netanyahu embraced a different strategy for Israel after his return to Jerusalem. Two months later, when Netanyahu returned to the states to deliver a fiery address the United Nations General Assembly last week, that new strategy had already rolled out in large part in the region, though it is crescendoing still.

First, Israel took the war everywhere in Gaza, and Hamas is all but obliterated as an organized fighting force though 101 hostages remain in the terrorists' tunnel network and the condition of Yahya Sinwar is unknown. Sinwar's military commander, Mohammed Deif, was killed in an Israeli air raid in southern Gaza on July 13, though that news was not confirmed until after Netanyahu's visit to Congress.

Not long after Netanyahu's return to Israel, Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, was assassinated on July 31 along with his personal bodyguard while in the Iran's capital of Tehran.

Fuad Shukr, a senior commander in Iran's proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah, was killed by the Israeli Air Force a day earlier, on July 30. Hezbollah's top military commander thereafter, Ibrahim Aqil, and 10 other senior commanders of Hezbollah's elite ""Radwan Force"" -- structured as special operation forces trained to invade Israel and hold terriroty -- were killed in an air strike on September 20.

On September 28 the leader of Hezbollah, its ""Secretary General"" for four decades, Hassan Nasrallah, and at least 10 other senior members of the terror organization were killed in a massive Israeli air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut. Among the dead was also at least one senior general in Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps. Iranian state media confirmed General Abbas Nilforoushan, 58, had been at the doomed conference in Nasrallah's underground bunker.

HAMAS LEADER KILLED IN LEBANON WAS UN EMPLOYEE, AGENCY CONFIRMS

In the middle of these strikes at all of the senior terror leadership in Lebanon, hundreds if not thousands of Hezbollah terrorists and their accomplices in Lebanon were killed or wounded in the beeper and walkie-talkie attack that astonished the world. (Israel has not claimed responsibility for this attack.)

Over the weekend, strikes continued on the remaining senior leaders of Hezbollah, Hamas and other terror groups and a second round of punishing air strikes on significant assets in Yemen were conducted by the Israeli Air Force in reprisals for that country's ruling terrorists attacks on Israeli via ballistic missiles.

There were also reports on Monday that the Israeli special forces had been conducting raids in southern Lebanon, including inside of Hezbollah's vast tunnel network, in preparation for ground operations to secure northern Israel from the threat of ongoing attacks against the Jewish State which began on October 8th, the day after the barbaric Hamas massacre of 1,200 inside the southern border of Israel (and the kidnapping of 250 more, more than a hundred of whom have been rescued or released via negotiations last fall.) A desperate and disorganized Hamas seems incapable of even responding to proposals for hostage exchanges and the IDF is going about methodically destroying Gaza's 500 miles of terrorist tunnels.

Netanyahu and his governing coalition got stronger this weekend as a former ally turned rival became an ally again as Gideon Saar brought his ""New Hope"" party into the governing coalition led by Netanyahu and his Likud party.

What this week and the next four that follow right up to the United States presidential election will bring in Israel, Lebanon, Gaza and the entire region is unknown, but what is clear is that Israel does not feel in the least constrained by President Biden and his team and their mantra of ""de-escalation.""

Israel tried every tactic requested by the United States, did its best to negotiate a cease-fire and hostage deal, and was repeatedly spurned by the terrorists in Gaza. (The consequences of the U.S.-enforced delays will be assessed after the wars conclude.) Though Vice President Harris had ""studied the maps"" of Rafah and publicly concluded that Israel could not evacuate the more than a million Palestinians taking refuge there, Israel in fact did just that, and without loss of innocent life save those of the soldiers of the IDF killed in the Rafah operations and six hostages Hamas terrorists ruthlessly executed, including an American citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin.

At the same time as the Gaza War intensified, Israel hammered Iran's other proxies in Lebanon and Yemen, both of which -- Hezbollah and the Houthis -- had kept up a barrage of rocket, drone and missile strikes on the Jewish State.

After Netanyahu's visit to the Congress and his snub by the possible next president, it seems clear he returned to Israel resolved to prosecute Israel's seven front war on his terms, not those of the United States, which itself continues to be subject to missile and drone barrages against its fleet and land forces in the region and to reply only intermittently. Nothing the United States has done can compare with Israel's withering counter-attacks. Israel is restoring deterrence in the region and Iran, which threatened to strike back against Israel, has not yet attempted a reprise of its direct assault on Israel in April.

Whatever Biden and Harris and all their senior officials intended Israel to do, unless they recommended Netanyahu do all of the above, then Israel has shrugged off the demands made of it by the appeasement-driven Biden-Harris administration.

Perhaps Netanyahu is simply unwilling to risk what are widely expected to be the anti-Israel policies of Harris should she win. Perhaps he took the measure of President Biden and concluded the American Commander-on-Chief is spent and not really in command at all.

Correlation is, of course, not causation. But whatever Biden and Harris said to Netanyahu in July, unless it was ""Go get them,"" the Israeli Prime Minister has decided to protect his people and not his friendships with the clueless foreign policy blob inside the Beltway."
"Hezbollah terrorists engaged in sex slavery, rape, mass murder of Syrians",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-terrorists-engaged-sex-slavery-rape-mass-murder-syrians,2024-10-01T08:07:05Z,"JERUSALEM -- Photos of Syrians celebrating the assassination of Hezbollah terrorist leader Hassan Nasrallah last week put the spotlight on the brutal activities of the terror group's role in sex slavery, mass starvation and kidnappings in the Syrian civil war which led to the deaths of over half a million Syrians.

Walid Phares, a leading expert on Hezbollah and Lebanon, told Fox News Digital that Hezbollah has ""committed ethnic cleansing"" in Syria. He said Hezbollah ""was behind the uprooting of millions of Syrians, of all communities, mainly Sunni. They have perpetrated rape. They have perpetrated mass sexual abuse, including keeping sexual slaves.""

Israel's targeted assassination of Nasrallah last weekend has prompted greater interest in the inner workings of the Shiite terrorist organization that is widely considered the de facto ruler over Lebanon.

IRAN OFFICIAL ADMITS COUNTRY'S ROLE IN TERROR BOMBING THAT KILLED 241 US MILITARY MEMBERS: REPORT

The Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorist entity is mainly known in America for bombing the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, which killed 63 people in 1983, and the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut also in 1983, resulting in the murders of 241 U.S. military personnel.

A new investigative video series by the Center for Peace Communications (CPC) shines a rare light on the U.S.-designated terrorist movement Hezbollah's role in sexual slavery, rape and mass murder. The shocking expose about Hezbollah's enslavement of a Syrian woman aired days after Israel reportedly launched devastating explosions of pagers held by thousands of Hezbollah terrorists across Lebanon in September.

CPC President Joseph Braude told Fox News Digital ""Hezbollah's war on Israel obscures its larger war to subjugate much of the region -- as a tyrant in Lebanon, an occupier in Syria, a mafia of sex and drug trafficking, and the nerve center of Iran's Arab empire. Millions of Arabs whose lives have been shattered by the militia want a different future. Hezbollah does not want the world to hear their voices.""

CPC's previous series, called ""Whispered in Gaza,"" which was viewed over 20 million times, led to a Fatwa being issued against Hamas by Iraqi and Pakistani clerics. It was used by Gaza anti-Hamas activists during the July 2023 street protests against the terror organization's rule.

He added ""'Hezbollah's Hostages,' an eight-part series produced by the Center for Peace Communications and presented by The Free Press, features the actual recorded testimony of Lebanese and Syrian civilians in Hezbollah's grip. To protect their identities and honor their lives, each recorded interview is accompanied visually by creative images and animation.""

One video depicts the kidnapping and sexual enslavement of Alya, a married 20-year-old woman from the northern Syrian city of Raqqa. She reveals how Yusuf, a member of Hezbollah, ""stalked"" her for months and eventually took her hostage.

Hezbollah took the side of the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad after civilians launched a protest movement in 2011 to secure democracy in the highly repressive nation.

Hezbollah terrorists aided Assad in his scorched-earth campaign to wipe out opposition to his regime, resulting in the killing of over 500,000 people. Syria is now a fragmented and war-ravaged country.

HEZBOLLAH BIGGER CHALLENGE THAN HAMAS TO ISRAEL: 'CROWN JEWEL IN THE IRANIAN EMPIRE OF TERROR'

""They have perpetrated rape. They have perpetrated mass sexual abuse, including keeping sexual slaves.""

Hezbollah's ally, the Sunni terrorist movement Hamas, engaged in rapes and sustained sexual assaults of Israeli women and men after the jihadi terrorist organization invaded Israel on Oct. 7.

Hezbollah joined Hamas' war against Israel on Oct. 8 when it launched rockets into northern Israel. Hamas slaughtered nearly 1,200 people on Oct. 7, including over 30 Americans.

The fundamental corruption and mafia-style criminality of Hezbollah's global organization has been examined by Matthew Levitt, the director of the Reinhard Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at The Washington Institute.

He published a 2018 report on ""Hezbollah's Corruption Crisis Runs Deep."" Levitt noted that ""some prominent figures in Hezbollah are involved in horrific criminal enterprises, including trafficking in sex and human beings."" He cited the example of Hezbollah official Ali Hussein Zeaiter, who according to media reports, was linked to ""a large prostitution network, mainly employing Syrian women.""

Hezbollah's criminal enterprise and terrorism continue to impact Americans.

HOW LEBANON'S HEZBOLLAH GROUP BECAME A CRITICAL PLAYER IN THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Zoya Fakhoury, executive director of the Amer Foundation, told Fox News Digital that ""Hezbollah is a proxy group of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that has the blood of thousands of innocent individuals, including American citizens, on their hands. The death of Hassan Nasrallah is a significant step towards accountability for many individuals but particularly for my family. My father, Amer Fakhoury, was a former U.S. hostage unlawfully detained under direct orders from Hassan Nasrallah.""

She continued, ""He was used a political pawn by Hezbollah and died because of the torture he faced in Lebanon. We hope to see the Lebanese government take this opportunity of the dismantling of Hezbollah to free Lebanon from the occupation of the Islamic Republic and work towards a path of peace.""

In August, Fox News Digital reported the new book by Fakhoury's four daughters covering a first-hand account of his detainment and the harrowing rescue operation to bring him back home to the United States in their book, ""Silenced in Beirut: American Businessman Amer Fakhour's Six-Month Ordeal as a Hostage In Lebanon.""

Walid Phares, a leading expert on Hezbollah and Lebanon, told Fox News Digital that Hezbollah has ""committed ethnic cleansing"" in Syria. He said Hezbollah ""was behind the uprooting of millions of Syrians, of all communities, mainly Sunni. They have perpetrated rape. They have perpetrated mass sexual abuse, including keeping sexual slaves.""

Phares, who has advised U.S. presidential candidates on Mideast foreign policy, said the Hezbollah jihadis defend their hostage taking of women as under Islamist Sharia law that they can take women from the ""enemy camp.""

ISRAEL DEGRADES IRAN-BACKED HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS IN SPECTACULAR PAGER EXPLOSION OPERATION: EXPERTS

He said there is no doubt that if Hezbollah captured Israeli women, they would treat them the same way as the enslaved Syrian women. Phares added that if Hezbollah captured a kibbutz, village or town in Israel, one ""can expect that they will kill the males and the capture the women. Some would be raped and killed and other Israeli women would be kept by Hezbollah.""

Hezbollah is not different from the Islamic state in applying jihadi ideology, said Phares. Hezbollah ""is a global threat. Look at how they treat their own women and how they separate them and organize them in the service of jihadists.""

Braude said that ""'Hezbollah's Hostages' debuted on Sept. 16, one day before pagers exploded across Lebanon. A new episode debuts every Monday through Nov. 4. In forthcoming episodes, we will probe the Hezbollah stronghold of Dahiyeh, just outside Beirut, with help from Shi'ite civilians who live there.""

He added ""Dahiyeh is the shadow capital of Lebanon -- home of Hezbollah's intelligence apparatus, politburo, and prisons -- as well as the central node to all Iran's proxies in the region, from the Houthis of Yemen to Iraq's militias to Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas. Yet the same landscape is also home to some of Hezbollah's many opponents - and in later episodes, we meet them too: Shiite veterans of the countrywide 2019 street protests, who dared to demand a different future; civic activists striving to end the war on Israel, liberate young minds, and restore the rule of law in Lebanon."""
Pentagon sending a 'few thousand' personnel to Middle East day after Biden said he wouldn't add combat troops,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pentagon-sending-few-thousand-us-troops-middle-east-one-day-after-biden-promised-he-wouldnt,2024-10-01T02:00:03Z,"DOD spokesperson Sabrina Singh said Monday the additional troops are to augment U.S. forces already there on heightened alert.

The Pentagon announced on Monday that it is sending a ""few thousand"" U.S. personnel to the Middle East to support Air Force squadrons a day after President Biden vowed not to send combat troops to the region.

Speaking at a press gaggle with reporters on Monday, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said the U.S. was sending a ""few thousand"" more troops to the Middle East to bolster security and to defend Israel, if needed.

Biden gave a firm ""no"" when asked Sunday if he planned to deploy additional combat troops to the Middle East.

This increased presence is to include multiple warplane squadrons, complimenting the F-15s, F-16s, A-10s and F-22s already stationed in the region.

ISRAEL WILL LAUNCH 'LIMITED' GROUND INVASION IN LEBANON 'IMMINENTLY' US OFFICIAL SAYS

The planes were initially supposed to rotate in and replace the squadrons stationed there. Instead, both the current and new squadrons are to remain in place to double the available airpower because of increased tensions in the region and concern that Iran might respond to Israel's killing of Hezbollah's leader last week in Lebanon.

Singh said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has ""increased the readiness of additional U.S. forces to deploy, elevating our preparedness to respond to various contingencies. And DOD (Department of Defense) maintains robust and integrated air-defense capabilities across the Middle East, ensuring the protection of U.S. forces operating in the region.""

The few thousand additional personnel are not combat troops but rather maintenance crews and those who can help with the air defense mission and refueling. The additional forces would raise the total number of U.S. personnel in the region to as many as 43,000.

The Pentagon's announcement follows word that Israel has already launched limited raids across its northern border into Lebanon amid an anticipated wider ground invasion.

It also follows recent strikes into Lebanon and the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, a significant escalation in the war in the Middle East, this time between Israel and Hezbollah, a Lebanese terrorist organization. Israel is also engaged in an ongoing war in the south against Hamas in the Gaza Strip after the Palestinian terrorist group sparked the conflict with its bloody incursion into southern Israel in October 2023.

Secretary Austin announced Sunday he was temporarily extending the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and its embarked air wing in the region. A U.S. official said the extension would be for about a month.

HEZBOLLAH SAYS IT WILL CHOOSE NASRALLAH'S SUCCESSOR 'AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY'

A second U.S. aircraft carrier, the USS Harry S. Truman, sailed from Virginia last week and is en route to Europe. It will head to the Mediterranean Sea and again provide a two-carrier presence in the broader region. It's not expected to arrive for at least another week.

Biden told reporters on Monday, ""I'm more aware than you might know"" about reports that Israel is planning a limited ground campaign in Lebanon after nearly a year of trading attacks with Hezbollah in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war, and he said he wants an immediate cease-fire.

When asked about the reports, Biden said he was ""comfortable with them stopping"" and that ""We should have a cease-fire now."""
Inside NYPD's 'massive' security operation for UN General Assembly amid protests,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/inside-nypds-massive-security-operation-un-general-assembly-amid-protests,2024-09-30T19:03:08Z,"The New York Police Department gave Fox News' CB Cotton an exclusive look at its Joint Operations Center, where federal agencies joined NYPD officers last week to ensure the safety of more than 130 world leaders for the UN General Assembly.

Throughout the past week, New Yorkers braced for traffic standstills and headaches around Midtown Manhattan as the culminating week of the United Nations General Assembly got underway. Meanwhile, members of the New York City Police Department were focused on securing the event as more than 130 world dignitaries came and went.

""It's a massive operation, a massive undertaking,"" Tarik Sheppard, deputy commissioner of NYPD's Public Information said. ""We have a lot of cops and detectives out there assigned, and it's just something that when it's over, you're just proud to be a part of - because it is one of the biggest world events that we have.""

Sheppard gave Fox News an exclusive, behind-the-scenes look at the NYPD's Joint Operations Center, where officers monitor several of the city's camera systems and then deploy officers on the ground when an emergency response is needed.

BIDEN ADDRESSES UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY FOR LAST TIME AS DICTATORS, DESPOTS COME TO NEW YORK

Last week, NYPD officers at the center were joined by members of the Secret Service, FBI, Homeland Security and the White House Military Office.

""So we're partnered up and linked together... just in case something happens [so] the messaging can be in unison,"" Sheppard said.

In addition to safely securing the arrival and departure of diplomats and U.S. leaders, the Joint Operations Center was also closely monitoring protest activity to ensure that everyday residents didn't have an additional hindrance to commutes already disrupted by the United Nations gathering.

""It's the perception of what's happening out there that we have to battle because they [protesters] are filming their videos saying,'No, we're so peaceful,'"" Sheppard said. ""They're not showing you at times the criminal mischief, the destruction of property, the blocking in the roadways where the average citizen is just trying to get home or pick their child up - them being delayed for an hour two can really be disruptive to families and cause major, major issues.""

Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, the NYPD has monitored upwards of 4,000 protests, according to the NYPD's Chief of Patrol John Chell, who shared some of the department's strategy for securing the United Nations during a news conference earlier this month.

The conflict in Gaza arose at the U.N. last week. As speeches from both Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas got underway, protesters gathered nearby intending to disrupt the gathering - without success.

""The important thing is to remember to respect people's First Amendment rights; however, we're not going to allow crimes to be committed,"" Sheppard said."
"Pentagon plans to shrink US 'footprint' in Iraq, but declines to say by how much",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pentagon-plans-shrink-us-footprint-iraq-declines-say-how-much,2024-09-30T17:25:33Z,"National security analyst Rebecca Grant joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the attack on the U.S. airbase in Iraq and why she believes Biden is nearing war with Iran as tensions escalate.

The Pentagon has finalized plans to wrap up the U.S.-led mission to fight ISIS by next year, with many U.S. troops leaving the bases they have occupied for much of the past two decades.

The Biden administration insists their plan is not to fully pull out of the nation but declined to say how many of the 2,500 troops currently stationed in Iraq will remain.

""I think it's fair to say that, you know, our footprint is going to be changing within the country,"" Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Friday.

The Iraqi government announced earlier this month it had reached a deal with the Biden administration to remove most U.S. troops from its nation over the next two years.

U.S. officials disputed characterizations of the plan as a withdrawal, prompting confusion about what the American presence there would look like over the coming months.

""I'd like to emphasize that this is an evolution of the military mission in Iraq,"" a senior Biden administration official said.

The current mission is now set to end by September 2025.

The notion of pulling troops out of Iraq has prompted concerns about a lack of support for the 900 troops currently stationed in Syria.

US, IRAQ TEAM UP TO KILL 15 ISIS OPERATIVES

""Not only will it undercut the fight against ISIS, but more importantly, in the effort to restrain Iran, forces in Iraq -- particularly in the Kurdish north -- are very important. We need Iraq forces in order to support our troops in northeast Syria,"" Ambassador James Jeffrey, former presidential envoy to the coalition to combat ISIS in Iraq, told Fox News Digital.

""We have a very effective ally there, the Kurds, the Syrian Kurds, that we want to not abandon,"" he went on, adding that a U.S. withdrawal would allow space for Russia and Iran to tighten their grip on the nation.

""At the end of the day, it's a decision of the Iraqi Government, and if the Iraqi government is being pressured by the Iranians, just as they were in 2011, and want us out, then we have no choice.""

Tehran and its influence have infiltrated the Iraqi government in a way that some say means a U.S. presence indirectly benefits Iran.

""With the current Iraqi government heavily influenced by Iranian-backed Shia factions, including the Popular Mobilization Front, maintaining U.S. troops doesn't effectively counterbalance Iran. In fact, our resources end up indirectly benefiting those aligned with Iranian interests, making this a misguided strategy,"" director of Concerned Veterans for America and Iraq War veteran Jason Beardsley told Fox News Digital.

""ISIS may be a challenge, but it's a challenge that the government of Iraq should be handling themselves.""

HARROWING FOOTAGE SHOWS US TROOPS BEING FIRED AT

Baghdad and Washington have ""reached an understanding"" that U.S. forces in Syria will be supported from a presence on the Iraqi side of the border through at least September 2026.

U.S. Central Command announced over the weekend that forces in Syria had conducted two targeted strikes in Syria that killed 37 terrorists, including leaders of ISIS and Huras al-Din, an al Qaeda affiliate.

U.S. forces in Iraq, Syria and Jordan have come under increased attacks since the eruption of war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza nearly a year ago.

Three U.S. troops were killed by a drone attack in January at a U.S. base in Jordan supporting operations in Syria.

American forces have responded with periodic airstrikes in response, such as in July near Baghdad, which have drawn sharp rebuke from the Iraqi public.

Last month, seven U.S. troops were wounded in an operation to target ISIS in western Iraq.

At the same time, troops are planning to depart Iraq, elsewhere in the Middle East the U.S. military presence is growing. U.S. officials announced Monday a ""few thousand"" more troops would be added to the roughly 40,000 service members deployed in the region."

A Hamas commander who worked alongside Hezbollah and led the terrorist group's activities in Lebanon has been taken out in an airstrike, Israeli officials say.

Fateh Sherif, the head of the Lebanon branch of Hamas, was killed overnight, according to a joint statement Monday from the Israel Defense Forces and Israel's domestic security agency Shin Bet.

""Sherif was responsible for coordinating Hamas' terror activities in Lebanon with Hezbollah operatives. He was also responsible for Hamas' efforts in Lebanon to recruit operatives and acquire weapons,"" officials said. ""He led the Hamas terrorist organization's force build-up efforts in Lebanon and operated to advance Hamas' interests in Lebanon, both politically and militarily.""

The officials added that Sherif was ""an accredited UNRWA member, and was the head of the UNRWA Teachers Union in Lebanon."" Some members of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency are accused of participating in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, which began the war in Gaza.

The strike targeted Sherif inside his house in the southern Lebanon city of Tyre, Reuters is reporting, citing Hamas.

It unfolded as another terrorist group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said three of its leaders were killed in an airstrike that hit the upper floor of an apartment building in Beirut, according to Reuters.

The Israeli officials said Monday that they will ""continue to operate against anyone who poses a threat to the civilians of the State of Israel.""

ISRAELI MILITARY SAYS HEZBOLLAH LEADER HASSAN NASRALLAH KILLED IN BEIRUT STRIKE

Over the weekend, Israel's military said it killed Nabil Qaouk, the deputy head of Hezbollah's Central Council - just days after an IDF strike killed Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah.

On Monday, the deputy leader of Hezbollah, Naim Qassem, announced that the terrorist group is ready to fight back against any Israeli ground operation in Lebanon.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has moved into hiding and remains at a secure location within the country, sources told Reuters.

The decision came in response to Israel's strikes outside Beirut on Friday that killed the leader and founding member of the Iran-backed terrorist group Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah.

Two sources also told Reuters that Iran reached out to Hezbollah and other proxy forces in the region to determine what action to take in response to Nasrallah's killing.

In a statement Saturday, Khamenei said, ""The fate of this region will be determined by the forces of resistance, with Hezbollah at the forefront.""

ISRAELI FORCES SAY HEAD OF HAMAS IN SOUTHERN SYRIA KILLED IN STRIKE

While announcing five days of public mourning, Khamenei called Nasrallah ""the flag-bearer of resistance"" in the region.

""The blood of the martyr shall not go unavenged,"" Khamenei said, according to Reuters.

Iranian media reported on Saturday that the Israeli strikes outside Lebanon's capital also killed the Iranian Revolutionary Guards' deputy commander, Abbas Nilforoushan.

Israel has killed several other top Hezbollah commanders in Beirut, especially in the past two weeks, in addition to the attack that killed Nasrallah.

Earlier this month, thousands of explosives hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah detonated, killing at least a dozen people and injuring thousands, according to officials in Lebanon. Israel is widely believed to be behind the attack but has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility.

Reuters cited one Iranian security official as revealing that the Revolutionary Guards is carrying out a large scale operation to inspect all communications devices.

Most of the devices were made in Lebanon or imported from China and Russia, the official said, as Iran is conducting a thorough investigation centered on mid- and high-ranking members of the Revolutionary Guards.

Iran is considering the possibility of infiltration by Israeli agents, including Iranians paid by Israel, the official told Reuters.

In response to Nasrallah's death, hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Tehran, waving Hezbollah flags and chanting, ""Death to Israel,"" and, ""Death to Netanyahu the murderer,"" the Associated Press reported.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian partially blamed the United States for Nasrallah's killing, given that Washington has been providing weapons to Israel.

""The Americans cannot deny their complicity with the Zionists,"" he said in a statement aired by state media, according to Reuters.

ISRAEL TARGETS HEZBOLLAH LEADER NASRALLAH IN STRIKE ON BEIRUT HEADQUARTERS

Hezbollah started firing rockets on Israel in support of Gaza on Oct. 8, a day after Hamas terrorists launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking another 250 as hostages.

Since then, the two sides have been engaged in escalating cross-border strikes. Iran's proxies include Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Houthis in Yemen, as well as other forces operating in Iraq. The Houthis have been launching missiles at Israel and ships in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea along the Yemeni coast following the Oct. 7 attacks.

In his first public remarks since Nasrallah's killing, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's targeting of Nasrallah was ""an essential condition to achieving the goals we set.""

""He wasn't another terrorist. He was the terrorist,"" Netanyahu said.

Netanyahu said Nasrallah's killing would help bring displaced Israelis back to their homes in the north and would pressure Hamas to free Israeli hostages held in Gaza. But with the threat of retaliation high, he warned the coming days would bring ""significant challenges"" and warned Iran against trying to strike.

Iran's U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani wrote a letter to the heads of the United Nations and the Security Council on Saturday calling for an emergency council meeting over the attack that killed Nasrallah.

""Using U.S.-supplied thousand-pound bunker busters,"" he wrote, Israel killed Nasrallah and Nilforoushan, among others.

He warned Israel not to attack any of its diplomatic or consular premises, or its representatives, according to the AP.

""Iran will not hesitate to exercise its inherent rights under international law to take every measure in defense of its vital national and security interests,"" Iravani wrote."

Israel's military says it has killed yet another high level member of Hezbollah with an airstrike on Sunday.

The IDF says the strike killed Nabil Kaouk, the deputy head of Hezbollah's Central Council, though they did not offer details on where the strike took place. The claim comes just days after an IDF strike killed Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah.

Israel and Hezbollah have continued to fire barrages of missiles and rockets toward one another as they appear to be on the brink of all-out war.

Hezbollah began its offensive immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 massacre in Israel, in which some 1,200 Israelis were killed or captured. Israel has responded by launching its own airstrikes and massing forces at its northern border with Lebanon.

Israel was forced to evacuate some 60,000 citizens who were living near the border with Lebanon. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed that the campaign against Hezbollah will not stop until those citizens can return safely to their homes.

Meanwhile, Hezbollah says it will only cease its hostilities once Israel has agreed to a cease-fire in Gaza, a deal that has proven almost impossible in recent months.

Hundreds of thousands of people have likewise been driven from their homes in Lebanon. The government estimates that around 250,000 are in shelters, with three to four times as many staying with friends or relatives, or camping out on the streets, Environment Minister Nasser Yassin told The Associated Press.

Israel has killed a slew of top Hezbollah and Hamas commanders with airstrikes throughout the conflict.

On Friday, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin told reporters, ""The United States was not involved in Israel's operation,"" noting there was ""no advance warning,"" from the Israelis about the strike on Nasrallah.

Netanyahu cut short his trip to New York following his speech to the United Nations General Assembly where he warned Hezbollah about Israel's right to go on the offensive.

""As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war, Israel has no choice, and Israel has every right to remove this threat and return our citizens to their home safely and that's exactly what we're doing,"" he said.

The IDF later released a graphic suggesting that nearly all of Hezbollah's top commanders have been killed.

""Real Time"" host Bill Maher took aim at rapper Macklemore over his ""F--- America"" declaration at an anti-Israel event.

The Grammy-winning artist went viral this week for his appearance at Seattle's ""Palestine Will Live Forever Festival"" which raised money for various groups, including the controversial agency known as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which Israeli officials have declared is strongly tied to Hamas, leading to the firing of nine UNRWA staffers allegedly involved in the Oct. 7 terrorist attack.

Israeli officials have declared that UNRWA is strongly tied to Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The U.N. itself announced in August that nine UNRWA staffers would be fired due to possible involvement in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel.

""Straight up, say it. I'm not gonna stop you. I'm not gonna stop you,"" Macklemore said, appearing to reference chants from the crowd.

""Yeah, F--- America,"" he said, sparking cheers from the audience.

BILL MAHER: TRUMP IS 'RIGHT' ABOUT THE DANGEROUS RHETORIC AIMED AT HIM, 'BUT HE IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY!'

That didn't sit well with Maher, who addressed the rapper's declaration during his closing monologue.

""I'm sure it was a big hit with the Queers for Gaza crowd, literally advocating for a government that would imprison you or kill you for being queer from the safety and security of a country that doesn't do that,"" Maher said.

""Yes, America. The only place in the world where a White guy from the suburbs could become a millionaire rapper because here, every person, regardless of race, class or gender has the right to be talent-free,"" he added.

BILL MAHER TRASHES KAMALA HARRIS FOR BEING 'FULL OF S---' ON ISRAEL, MIDDLE EAST: 'JUST SHUT UP'

In a follow-up statement on Instagram, Macklemore seemed to back down from his attack on America: ""My thoughts and feelings are not always expressed perfectly or politely."" He added, ""Sometimes I slip up and get caught in the moment. Saturday night was one of those times. I strive to always lead with love in an effort to bring people together and never to create more division.""

He concluded, ""Unfortunately, the historic event in my hometown that brought thousands of people together to raise awareness and money for the people of Palestine has become overshadowed by two words. I wish I had been in a better place with my grief and anger. But the truth is I'm not ok. I haven't been.""

Maher began his monologue by praising Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for helping Democrats be more patriotic at this year's DNC convention, but lamented their sentiment hasn't resonated with younger people.

""The protests that started off as justice for Palestine have morphed into a broader kind of America is the problem, 'We f---ed up the whole world' thing,"" Maher said.

""Guess what document allows you to chant 'Hey hey, ho ho' followed by something really stupid,"" Maher asked them before answering with the Constitution.

BILL MAHER MAKES THIS BOLD 2024 PREDICTION AFTER TRUMP-HARRIS DEBATE

After citing a study alleging four out of ten Gen Zers believe the Founding Fathers are ""better described as villains,"" Maher noted that how young some of them were including 18-year-old James Monroe, 21-year-old Alexander Hamilton and 25-year-old James Madison.

""They were the Gen Z of their day, and when they were your age, they started a country. What the f--- have you done?"" Maher asked.

""History is complicated, and Gen Z reasoning is not. They think they're pure, but they're really just simplistic. They know two things: White people did some very bad things and- no, that's it. That's all they know,"" Maher said, later adding ""The citizens of Gaza cannot assemble in protest of their own government, cannot do or say what they want or practice whatever religion they want, or have a free press, all rights guaranteed in just our First Amendment! The irony in all of this is that the world the founders birth, flawed though it may be, provides the bedrock for everything that makes life good for the very people who hate them so much.""

""It's so easy to take for granted individual liberty, a bill of rights, the rule of law, checks and balances, getting a trial by jury, the peaceful transfer of power, protecting minority rights and democracy itself, but those are the things that make our pampered, privileged, bratty lives so relatively cushy. No one starves here, even our poor people are fat,"" he continued. ""Why do millions of people every year risk their lives to come here? Because they want what we got! The founders were flawed, but they did build a place the whole world wants to break into. No one is paying a coyote to smuggle them into India or Russia. Immigrants don't see us as the problem. They see us as a solution. And there's a reason they kill themselves to get here.""

""If you strike us, we will strike you,"" Netanyahu said. ""There is no place in Iran that the long arm of Israel cannot reach, and that's true of the entire Middle East: Far from being lambs led to the slaughter, Israel's soldiers have fought back with incredible courage and with heroic sacrifice.""

Netanyahu took the podium in front of a partially empty General Assembly, with some delegates walking out, but those gathered to hear him offered raucous applause ahead of his speech. Seemingly absent from the speech was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was hosting a global health security event on the sidelines of UNGA.

He revealed that he almost didn't attend the U.N. High-Level Week, but that he felt a need to ""set the record straight,"" which included laying out the choice the world faces.

Netanyahu brought several families with loved ones held hostage by Hamas terrorists in Gaza to New York and once again called for their freedom, noting that, ""I'll say this one more time, we remain focused on our sacred mission, bringing our hostages home. And we will not stop until that mission is complete.""

THE ONLY THING NETANYAHU CAN DO IS EXUDE STRENGTH IN THE FACE OF HIS ENEMIES: ELIZABETH PIPKO

""Israel seeks peace,"" Netanyahu said. ""Israel yearns for peace. Israel has made peace and will make peace again - yet, we face savage enemies who seek our annihilation, and we must defend ourselves against those savage murderers.""

Netanyahu framed the issue as a choice between ""a blessing or a curse,"" with Iran's ""unremitting aggression"" as the ""curse"" against the ""blessing"" of reconciliation between Arab nations and Israel.

""A normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel seemed closer than ever. But then came the curse of Oct. 7,"" Netanyahu said. ""Thousands of Iranian-backed Hamas terrorist from Gaza burst into Israel in pickup trucks, on motorcycles. And they committed unimaginable atrocities.""

The prime minister hammered again on Iran's aggression, warning that if left unchecked will ""endanger every single country in the Middle East and many, many countries in the rest of the world.""

""Iran seeks to impose its radicalism well beyond the Middle East,"" Netanyahu warned. ""That's why it funds terror networks on five continents. That's why it builds ballistic missiles for nuclear warheads to threaten the entire world.""

""For too long, the world is appeasing Iran. It turns a blind eye to its internal repression. It turns a blind eye to its external aggression,"" he added. ""Well, that appeasement must end, and that appeasement must end now.""

Netanyahu called on the U.N. Security Council to ""snap back"" sanctions against Iran and do everything in the organization's power to ""ensure that Iran never gets nuclear weapons.""

However, he lamented that the organization has an apparent bias against Israel and in favor of the Palestinians, citing the ""automatic majority"" of countries that will vote in favor of any policy that hurts Israel.

""For the Palestinians, this U.N. House of darkness is home court,"" Netanyahu said. ""They know that in this swamp of antisemitic bile, there's an automatic majority willing to demonize the Jewish state on anything in this anti-Israel, flat Earth society. Any false charge, any outlandish allegation can muster a majority.""

""It's always been about Israel, about Israel's very existence, and I say to you, until Israel, until the Jewish state is treated like other nations, until this antisemitic swamp is drained, the U.N. will be viewed by fair minded people everywhere as nothing more than a contemptuous force,"" he added.

""I think it's a clear show that Europe has lost its ability to project geopolitical power, especially into Africa and the Middle East, because we are basically not able to do any kind of measures to stop this irregular migration,"" Lipavsky said.

""When somebody who really has no right for asylum is in Europe, there are no true mechanisms ... so they will need to put more effort into that, definitely,"" he added.

Czechia, also known as the Czech Republic, sits in the middle of Europe and still considers itself the continent's ""natural crossroads,"" which places it in a unique position to discuss matters regarding immigration and conflicts on the border.

HUNGARIAN FM RECALLS STRONG TRUMP ADMIN 'EXPERIENCE,' CLAIMS 'OUR HOPE IS ALL' ON FORMER PRESIDENT

Despite that prominent perspective, Lipavsky noted that ""the leadership must come from the big"" countries, as ""that's how things are done in international politics.""

Lipavsky argued that this lack of leadership has made the conflict between Ukraine and Russia more difficult, but he admitted the war helped waken the bloc's members to certain issues they had ignored.

""We have rediscovered our ability, at least in the east, to protect Ukraine, but, still, we need to do more, honestly,"" Lipavsky said. ""I would not say it's a dire situation, but certainly the lack of leadership also could be visible.""

""As minister of foreign affairs from Czechia, I'm trying to come up with proposals. I'm trying to call for common action,"" he continued. ""For example, we are delivering a lot of ammunition to Ukraine. We have this ammunition initiative.""

""Those are hundreds, thousands of shells, which then make a difference on the battlefields - more than words,"" he added.

Lipavsky framed the current state of international politics as one of ""global confrontation,"" with conflicts across multiple regions that impact all nations due to their effects on everything from energy to food supplies and general shipping.

""We see many conflicts in the Middle East,"" Lipavsky said. ""It's not only Gaza or now Lebanon, where the north of Israel is being shelled by rockets for many months, but it is also the navigation in Red Sea, which is being endangered by Houthis, and those are supported by Iran.""

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT BACKS UN CLAIM RELIEF WORKERS ACCUSED OF AIDING HAMAS ARE IMMUNE

""This is a very complex matter, and we need to de-escalate,"" he added. ""We need to put a lot of effort into peace, but also not forget that Israel has a right to defend itself.""

Czechia earlier this year voted against the Palestinian States gaining expanded powers in the United Nations and last week was one of 14 countries that voted against a Palestinian-drafted resolution that adopted the International Court of Justice opinion that demanded Israel leave Gaza and the West Bank. Lipavsky explained that the resolution ""skewed in one direction,"" which was ""a very basic reason to vote against"" the resolution.

However, he stressed that Russia remains ""definitely"" the most important crisis facing Czechia and other European countries.

""Russia wants to destroy the complete Ukrainian nation. They want to include them into Russia and ... It's like Hitler during the World War. It's absolutely similar,"" Lipavsky insisted.

""We know that we used to be in a sphere of influence of Soviet Union during Czechoslovakia ... after the Second World War until the fall of the Berlin Wall,"" he said. ""I don't want to happen to Czechia again that some dictator will tell us what to do and what to not and to exploit us.

""So we have to defend from this, from this Russian trust, and then of course, to be a good ally to U.S., and good to NATO,"" he added."

Fox News' ""Antisemitism Exposed"" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world.

IN TODAY'S NEWSLETTER:

- Patricia Heaton leads campaign against antisemitism on college campuses

- DOJ backs UN immunity claim of relief workers accused of aiding Hamas

- Gov. Whitmer condemns 'Squad' member's 'antisemitic' attack against Michigan's Jewish AG

TOP STORY: Seeing the stomach-turning Hamas body-cam footage from Oct. 7 prompted beloved ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" star Patricia Heaton to take action. ""I couldn't believe it, and I was outraged,"" the devout Christian told Fox News Channel. She started the October 7th Coalition, or O7C, to encourage people of all faiths to stand up against anti-semitism.

VIDEO: An anti-Israel protester in New York City was seen holding a sign supporting the Hezbollah terror group during a rally as world leaders convened at the United Nations General Assembly in Manhattan. In footage captured by FNTV, a masked and hooded protester holds a sign in one hand that reads: ""New York for Hezbollah"" with two red hearts drawn next to the words. In his other hand, he waved a Hezbollah flag.

NO LEGAL RELIEF: Victims of the Oct. 7 massacre in Israel and their families don't have the support of The Justice Department in their lawsuit against the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). At least nine employees of the UN agency were allegedly found to have participated in the attack, but the DOJ sided with the UN in the federal case, filing a brief stating that the agency is immune and the New York federal court hearing the case lacks jurisdiction.

'HATEFUL RHETORIC': After facing backlash for refusing to defend her state's attorney general against a suggestion of religious bias, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued a statement Monday condemning Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., for the ""antisemitic"" allegation. ""The suggestion that Attorney General Nessel would make charging decisions based on her religion as opposed to the rule of law is antisemitic,"" Whitmer wrote in a statement

GUEST EDITORIAL: Danny Danon, Israel's permanent representative to the United Nations, writes that the global body has forfeited its power to bring peace to the Middle East by repeatedly siding with Iran-sponsored terror groups.

Against the backdrop of Israel's four-front war for its very existence, the United Nations, with the support of anti-Israel elected officials in the U.S. and elsewhere, are circling the wagons to ensure that UNRWA will continue to brainwash generations of Palestinian children to deny the 3,500-year link of the Jewish people to the land of Israel and the Jewish state's legitimacy.

A new bill launched by anti-Israel members in Congress demands that the U.S. resume its funding of UNRWA, which is currently blocked under U.S. law. This initiative comes as the United Nations insists that all UNRWA employees are legally immune from any prosecution.

This presumably includes UNRWA employees who were members of Hamas and who participated in the Oct 7 Hamas crimes against humanity in southern Israel, where 1,200 Israelis, among them entire Jewish families, were mass murdered and mutilated. Young Israeli women in peaceful communities and at the Nova Peace concert raped, with hundreds kidnapped - dead and alive - to be brutalized and bartered by Hamas for the release of thousands of Palestinian terrorists held by Israel.

The audacity and hypocrisy of a renewed pro-UNRWA campaign is breathtaking. The United Nations has done less than zero to gain the release of innocent hostages taken by Hamas on Oct 7. In fact, U.N. officials and special rapporteurs were eerily silent or, worse, excused Hamas' brutal pogrom.

UN CHIEF DEFENDS UNRWA, SAYS ONLY 'A FEW ELEMENTS' PARTICIPATED IN OCT. 7

And when it comes to the United Nations, words - spoken and unspoken - do count.

Top U.N. officials we recently met with refused to label Hamas a terrorist organization. That policy allows UNRWA's commissioner-general, Philippe Lazzarini to insist that, for the U.N., ""Hamas is not a terrorist group... it is a political movement"".

Lazzarini has refused to say whether UNRWA even considers Hamas a ""militant or armed group."" He hasn't said that membership in an armed group is a sufficient cause for not hiring a person by UNRWA or terminating his or her employment.

Lazzarini has not taken any action to enforce the prohibition on membership in armed groups, let alone take steps to ensure to its donor states that it will identify and dismiss employees who are members of armed groups.

ISRAEL'S UN AMBASSADOR SLAMS WORLD BODY, SAYS UNRWA TAKEN OVER BY HAMAS TERRORISTS IN GAZA

He has neither investigated, suspended nor fired 100 UNRWA staff whom Israel submits are Hamas or Palestine Islamic Jihad's military operatives.

The bottom line is that the day after the war in Gaza ends, unless there is strong opposition from the United States, Hamas is still well-positioned to take back the reins of power over the lives of the people of Gaza and over the minds and hearts of Palestinian children.

Some months ago, I had the opportunity to speak directly to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the State Department. I told him that UNRWA cannot be part of the solution for ""the day after"" in Gaza when it has been a core problem for decades.

As of now, the plans of the U.S. for the day after in Gaza remain unclear.

Events on the ground, and the blood-curdling indifference to Jewish lives and Jewish life by the United Nations only reinforces our fears about the future for Palestinian children and the children of Israel - from Sderot to the Golan Heights.

The fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has drastically escalated over the last month as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has begun targeting the terrorist network's hot spots and military storage units, all of which are strategically embedded within civilian villages.

Images and videos provided to Fox News Digital of the recent strikes in southern Lebanon show precision missiles hitting what have been deemed civilian buildings.

Hezbollah's use of civilian infrastructure has not only created a sophisticated network of meeting houses, weapons storage units and well-hidden missile launching positions across southern Lebanon and in the suburbs of Beirut, it has ensured a war with Hezbollah cannot be conducted without immense collateral damage.

ISRAEL READIES RESERVE TROOPS ON BORDER WITH LEBANON: 'PREPARE YOURSELVES'

Since Monday, more than 1,800 casualties have been reported and at least 560 people are believed to have been killed, including 50 children and more than 90 women, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.

On Thursday, the U.S. again urged Israel to agree to a cease-fire in Lebanon, and deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh confirmed with reporters that the U.S. is not aiding Jerusalem militarily or with intelligence in its Lebanon-based campaign.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the international community's calls for a cease-fire and instead instructed his troops to continue fighting ""with full force.""

French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday warned Israel that it ""cannot without consequence just expand its operations to Lebanon"" as commanders on the Israeli-Lebanon border ordered its troops to ""prepare"" for a possible ground invasion.

No invasion has been ordered at this time, though Israeli and U.S. security experts have told Fox News Digital that the network Hezbollah has established on the foundation of everyday life within Lebanon means war with the terrorist network will likely be even more costly in terms of human lives than what has been witnessed in Gaza.

According to the Israel-based Alma Research and Education Center, a nonprofit organization that researches Israeli security challenges along the border with Lebanon, Hezbollah has long relied on the use of civilian infrastructure to serve its needs.

ISRAEL-HEZBOLLAH WAR: NETANYAHU 'DID NOT EVEN RESPOND' TO US CEASE-FIRE DEAL, PLEDGES TO FIGHT 'FULL FORCE'

""The phenomenon of renting houses, rooms, warehouses within the Shiite civilian areas by Hezbollah is well known since the beginning of the 2000s,"" Tal Beeri, head of the research department at Alma, told Fox News Digital, adding that the terrorists also rent structures in non-Shia areas of Lebanon as well.

""Evidence of this matter was found in looted documents and investigations of Hezbollah operatives during the Second Lebanon War in 2006. Since then, Hezbollah has only accelerated the phenomenon and estimates are that every third house in southern Lebanon has been used by Hezbollah for its needs,"" he added.

Beeri shared research with Fox News Digital that showed findings from 2021 breaking down the sophisticated system in which Hezbollah has intertwined itself in the everyday running of local villages across the country.

Hezbollah officials dubbed a ""Rabat"" - loosely translated to ""the liaison"" - are installed in villages across Lebanon and serve as the representative of the terrorist group, facilitating the needs of the villagers in coordination with the hyper-localized operations of Hezbollah.

The Rabat, which can oversee multiple villages, reportedly establishes relationships with the residents by facilitating requests for aid such as money, food and even with localized disputes.

""In places where Hezbollah decides to expropriate or lease civilian land or properties from the residents for the purpose of its military activities, the 'Rabat' conducts the expropriation or leasing procedure vis-à-vis the relevant resident,"" Beeri found.

The report, based on documents seized following the 2006 war with Hezbollah, found that the Rabat also recommended to local Hezbollah units the best locations in each town that are ""suitable to serve the human shield tactic"" based on the storage requirements surrounding concealment, infrastructure type and weapons placement.

The Rabat then coordinates the logistics between the terrorist organization and the local property owner.

""The 'Rabat' strengthens Hezbollah's grip on the Lebanese village residents' day-to-day life, their property, and needs, allowing Hezbollah to turn them into human shields on a wider scale,"" the report found.

Hezbollah's control over local communities and its ability to stockpile and transfer weapons throughout the country through a sophisticated tunnel system signifies that the UN Resolution 1701 passed in 2006 to prevent a third war between the terrorist network and Israel has failed.

While it remains unclear if U.N. Security Council members are looking to revamp the resolution to counter the terrorist group's movements and stop Israeli operations in civilian areas, the international community has called on Netanyahu to cease his campaign - many leaders from both adversary and allied nations, have fervently warned against invading Lebanon.

Netanyahu is set to address the U.N. body on Friday during what has been described by the Israeli ambassador to the U.N. as the most ""hostile"" environment he has seen in his roughly 10 years of attending the top summit."

""Events, dear boy, events."" That's what the late British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan said remain the greatest challenge facing a political campaign. Back in January 2023, I wrote that the 2024 campaign would likely hinge less on the actual campaigns than on a set of ""Known-Unknowns,"" - the economy, Ukraine, and the Middle East wind up playing out.

At the time, it seemed that President Joe Biden would be running and the GOP nominee wasn't known. Two years later, Biden has been replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris, and former President Donald Trump easily sailed to the nomination - but those Known-Unknowns remain, even as polls show minimal shifts in public opinion.

There are four that are likely to change voter's behavior - or not - in the coming weeks.

THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE: TEAMSTERS IN KEY BATTLEGROUNDS SUPPORT TRUMP OVER HARRIS

Will further actions by the Federal Reserve change views of the economy? The Fed just announced a 0.5% cut in interest rates, which helped cause Wall Street to achieve an all-time high, and suggested that the economy has done better than many thought just a few months ago. Polls that had recently given Trump the edge in who the voters trust more on the economy now suggest that Harris and Trump are at parity.

In the coming weeks, more data will come out on whether the economy is growing and whether wages are keeping up with inflation. Any bad news on that front may help Trump regain the advantage on the economy - which some believe is the key factor in undecided voters making their vote choice.

Does Israel's multi-front war further deteriorate and make the Biden-Harris administration look feckless? Following the October 7th massacre of 1,200 Israelis, the Biden administration has sought to facilitate a deal to free the hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza - and prevent the war from fully engulfing Hezbollah in Lebanon, as well as Iran, which funds both Hamas and Hezbollah.

Despite multiple trips by U.S. representatives in the region, the U.S. has failed to achieve a ceasefire, nor has it been able to achieve the release of the remaining hostages. A negotiated end to the current war would possibly help Harris, but that seems highly unlikely at this late date. Conversely, if the conflict expands to a full-scale war with Hezbollah, it would give Trump an opportunity to highlight the incumbent administration's inability to control the situation.

Does the Ukraine War look to be better than a stalemate and a war of attrition with Russia? In recent weeks, Ukraine's decision - without the U.S. blessing - to invade and capture territory in Russia seems to have allowed Ukraine to appear more like the plucky successful defenders that initially pushed Russia back in 2022. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been visiting Biden and Harris at the White House.

Given that Trump has claimed that he could end the war quickly, and given that he pointedly chooses not to say that he wants Ukraine to win the war, and given that polls continue to show that most Americans support the Ukrainian war effort, any signs that the Biden-Harris administration is having an impact in helping them achieve that could redound to Harris's benefit.

Appalachian Aggression vs. Minnesota Knice™ on October 1. The conventional wisdom is that vice presidents don't matter. That's the conventional wisdom, but in three of the last six elections - 2000, 2012, and 2016 - the Vice Presidential Debate actually changed the trajectory of the election.

Republican Dick Cheney (2000) decisively won his debate against Democrat Joe Lieberman; then-vice President Joe Biden (2012) was able to arrest Obama's falls after his bad first debate; and similarly, Republican VP candidate Mike Pence was able to change Trump's polling trajectory after his bad performance in the first debate against Hillary Clinton.

This year, while GOP Candidate JD Vance seems to be polling poorly, he's proven himself highly effective in many interviews, his legal background may help him make the case against Democrat Tim Walz, and he knows how to embody the grievances that have fueled the MAGA movement.

In the coming weeks, more data will come out on whether the economy is growing and whether wages are keeping up with inflation. Any bad news on that front may help Trump regain the advantage on the economy - which some believe is the key factor in undecided voters making their vote choice.

That said, Walz may appear folksy, but he knows how to throw a populist punch as well (How often does he mention Vance and Yale in the same sentence?). Both these Midwesterners are shrewd - and they'll be armed to try to affect the trajectory of the race.

Those are just the Four ""Known-Unknowns."" Then there's always the possibility of ""Unknown-Unknowns"" - for example a terrorist act that might bring into focus the sense of the different approaches to terrorism that Trump and Harris appear to represent. One has no idea how it - or something else - may play out.

Political analysts like to focus on the dynamics of campaigns: fundraising, digital and television ad spending, press conferences, and so-called ""Get-Out-The-Vote"" efforts. But, if one really wants to know what's going to happen in an election, it's usually worth looking outside the campaign and study what the voters are experiencing."

Harvard University failed to crack down hard enough on students for antisemitic conduct that violated the Ivy League school's own policies, according to the House Education and the Workforce Committee, which has been investigating anti-Israel demonstrations that gripped American college campuses in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel.

Harvard brought disciplinary cases against 68 students related to an April 24 to May 14 campus encampment, according to documents obtained by the committee. Of those 68, none are currently suspended, 52 remain in ""good standing,"" 15 are not in good standing due to disciplinary probation, and one is on leave.

The committee said it believes Harvard is in violation of Title VI, which forbids ""a hostile environment based on race, color, or national origin.""

""Harvard failed, end of story,"" Chair Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""These administrators failed their Jewish students and faculty, they failed to make it clear that antisemitism will not be tolerated, and in this case, Harvard may have failed to fulfill its legal responsibilities to protect students from a hostile environment. The only thing administrators accomplished is appeasing radical students who have almost certainly returned to campus emboldened and ready to repeat the spring semester's chaos. Harvard must change course immediately.""

JEWISH DEMOCRAT SUING HARVARD OVER ANTISEMITISM CHASTISES HIS PARTY FOR INACTION, ENDORSES TRUMP

According to a summary of its findings provided to Fox News Digital, ""Harvard investigated and documented student violations of its policies, some of which were deemed to warrant semesters-long suspensions, but ultimately failed to enforce its own rules and impose meaningful discipline.""

The committee added that discipline ""would have been consistent with the Harvard Corporation's pronouncement that 'calls for violence' and academic disruptions would 'not be tolerated,'"" asserting that ""[t]he records, however, reveal that Harvard failed to fulfill this commitment and has permitted students to engage in such conduct with no real consequences.""

Between Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking hundreds of hostages into the Gaza Strip, and April 24, 2024, when an anti-Israel encampment formed on the university's campus, ""Harvard failed to impose any formal discipline on any students,"" the committee said in the summary of its findings.

Before the encampment was erected, the committee said, ""Harvard only referred 12 students for discipline for conduct related to two antisemitic incidents: the November 16-17, 2023, occupation of University Hall and the disruption of classes with bullhorns and antisemitic chants on November 29, 2023."" The committee added that no students received formal discipline for these incidents and ""all remain in good standing.""

""Harvard has also failed to hold student groups accountable for antisemitic conduct. On September 10, the Harvard Crimson reported that Harvard lifted the April 22 suspension of the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee (PSC),"" the committee wrote, noting that this makes the group eligible for school funding. ""This reversal comes despite the role of PSC and its membership in organizing the unlawful Harvard encampment through the unrecognized group Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine (HOOP).""

The Crimson reported that while PSC itself was not listed as an encampment organizer, many of its members are part of HOOP, and the two groups work together to coordinate their Instagram posts.

HARVARD SLAMMED FOR 'SMOKE AND MIRRORS' ANTISEMITISM RESPONSE: 'THEY ACTUALLY MAKE THINGS WORSE'

The committee noted that Harvard College's Administrative Board downgraded the sanctions of 35 students it initially voted to place on disciplinary probation from a period of six months or longer to periods of less than two months.

""This diminishment meant that none of these students initially slated for longer probation periods remained on probation at the start of the fall 2024 semester,"" their report says.

The board ""initially voted to suspend five students for a year or more for encampment-related conduct violations, but then downgraded their sanctions to probation of no more than a semester,"" the committee said, arguing that those students ""therefore appear to have faced no consequential discipline.""

Documents obtained by the committee show that every Harvard College student who appealed their encampment-related disciplinary sanctions had their sanctions downgraded.

The report cites how one student who participated in the encampment and raised a Palestinian flag over University Hall, which sits on Harvard Yard, ""was initially informed he would receive a three-semester suspension."" But that three-semester suspension was downgraded to probation until Dec. 20, 2024. The committee found four other students who participated in the encampment were each initially told they would be required to withdraw for two terms, but each of these suspensions was downgraded ""to the significantly weaker penalty of probation"" until Oct. 21, 2024.

The committee found that Harvard did not implement any consequences for students who occupied University Hall and who interrupted classes with bullhorns and antisemitic chants.

Nine Harvard students who occupied University Hall on Nov. 16-17, 2023, ""received no formal disciplinary consequences at all"" despite having ""disrupted normal business operations by making loud noises and chanting, with the goal of occupying the building,"" the committee said. Instead, they received informal ""admonishments,"" which, according to Harvard, are ""not considered a formal disciplinary action.""

The five Harvard students who interrupted economics and statistics classes with bullhorns and antisemitic chants, including ""From the river to the sea"" and ""Globalize the intifada,"" on Nov. 29, 2023, received no formal disciplinary consequences, the committee wrote, ""and were instead only 'admonished.'"" Two of those students had also been involved in the occupation of University Hall just weeks before.

"Palestinian President Abbas slams Israel, US during UN speech as critics decry his support for terrorism",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/palestinian-president-abbas-slams-israel-us-during-un-speech-critics-decry-his-support-terrorism,2024-09-26T16:47:24Z,"JERUSALEM -- Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian Authority, once again delivered a stridently anti-Israel speech at the U.N. on Thursday, where he also praised the anti-Israel protests across the U.S. and condemned Washington for its support of Israel.

Abbas, who presented a 12-point plan for a post-war Gaza that calls for a permanent cease-fire, accused the Jewish state of committing genocide, while calling for its expulsion from the U.N. and taking aim at the Biden Administration for vetoing Security Council resolutions on the issue, while supplying arms to the Israelis.

He charged the U.S. ""furnished Israel with the deadly weapons that it used to kill thousands of innocent civilians, children and women. And this further encouraged Israel to continue with aggression.""

Abbas started his speech by questioning Israel's legitimacy: ""We will not leave. We will not leave. We will not leave. Palestine is our homeland. It is the land of our fathers, our grandfathers. It will remain ours. And if anyone were to leave, it would be the occupying usurpers.""

EXTREMISTS RISE IN NEW PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY GOVERNMENT AS BIDEN THREATENS ISRAEL OVER GAZA WAR

""Abbas spoke for 26 minutes and did not say the word 'Hamas' once. Since the massacre of October 7, Abbas has failed to condemn Hamas for their crimes against humanity,"" Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon charged in a statement following the speech.

Yet while leaders from around the world watched his UNGA speech, some critics complain the 88-year-old's rule and domination of Palestinian politics in the West Bank (known in Israel by its biblical name of Judea and Samaria in Israel) has done little for the Palestinian cause.

Abbas was born Safed duing the British mandate period [now in Israel]). His family fled to Syria when Arab armies invaded Israel to prevent the establishment of the Jewish state.

Abbas has been accused of rewarding Palestinian terrorism via the infamous ""pay for slay"" system that supports financial stipends for convicted Palestinian terrorists and their family members.

He has also garnered a reputation over the decades as an anti-American agitator who stokes wild antisemitic conspiracy theories. Just last month, Abbas delivered a speech to the Turkish parliament, where he announced that that ""America is the plague, and the plague is America"" and ""We implement Shari'a law: victory or martyrdom.""

Asaf Romirowsky, executive director of Scholars for Peace in the Middle East (SPME), told Fox News Digital that ""Mahmoud Abbas aka Arafat's appointed successor after 20 years has done what Arafat hoped he would, that is maintain a Palestinian stasis while at the same time refusing to root out the corruption within the PA or combat terrorism. Further, as he has shown during his recent speech in the Turkish Parliament, a clear allegiance to Hamas and an endorsement of 10/7, underscoring the consistent antisemitism of his leadership.""

Romirowsky added ""With no heir apparent, Abbas's legacy, as was Arafat's, is that of self-inflicted victimology while maintaining wealth on the back of his own people in the name of the so-called Palestinian struggle.""

MORE THAN A MILLION PALESTINIANS IN GAZA ARE NOW DISPLACED; WHY ARE ARAB COUNTRIES NOT OPENING THEIR DOORS?

Fox News Digital reported shortly after Hamas slaughtered nearly 1,200 people in Israel on October 7, including over 30 Americans, that the Abbas' PA might compensate convicted Hamas terrorists for their role in the attack.

Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, told Fox News Digital the PA and Abbas ""duplicate all of the corruption, nepotism, and inefficiency of the Palestine Liberation Organization"" that was created by Arafat.

He said ""Abbas does not accept the basic right of the Jewish people to self-determination, and therefore he doesn't recognize the right of the state of Israel to be a nation state of the Jewish people in any borders.""

Michael, who is affiliated with the Misgav Institute continued, ""He has not educated the young generation and has not educated PA officials for peace. On the contrary, Abbas has led and enabled the indoctrination toward hatred and toward delegitimization of the state of Israel.""

In contrast to the U.S.-designated terrorist movement, Hamas, Abbas and the PA are considered to be relatively moderate, according to some Mideast observers.

In 2022, Fox News Digital reported Abbas, issued a shocking diatribe against Israel in the German capital of Berlin, where the Holocaust - the mass extermination of European Jewry - was organized, claiming that the Jewish state has carried out ""50 Holocausts.""

Abbas refused to apologize (or aid in a professional inquiry) in Berlin at the time of the Palestinian Black September massacre of 11 Israeli athletes and a German police officer during the 1972 Munich Olympics."

France has been involved in the discussions, as have other Arab countries with which the U.S. regularly partners.

The U.S. effort to secure the ceasefire isn't tethered to efforts to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the release of hostages in Gaza.

Lebanese officials said a massive Israeli barrage killed at least 560 people on Monday, prompting thousands to flee southern Lebanon. Israeli forces have continued to carry out dozens of airstrikes on Hezbollah targets within Lebanon following months of attacks by the terror group targeting Israeli soil.

Hezbollah said it launched missiles at eight different targets within Israel early Tuesday. The Israeli military said it tracked 55 rockets fired out of Lebanon and landing in Israel.

Biden administration hit with FOIA suit seeking 25th Amendment-related comms,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-administration-hit-foia-suit-seeking-25th-amendment-related-comms,2024-09-25T21:08:01Z,"President Biden speaks about Israel-Lebanon tensions and chances of a cease-fire in Gaza.

A conservative think tank and its public-policy oversight arm filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) suit against the Biden administration seeking any records relating to advice the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) may have offered in regard to the 25th Amendment.

Heritage Foundation Oversight Project attorney Kyle Brosnan characterized the OLC as the equivalent of a White House ""law firm"" that provides legal advice to the executive branch and its officers, adding the timeline for any responsive documents is June 1 to the present day.

Under Section 4 of the 25th Amendment, a majority of the ""principal officers"" of the Cabinet would transmit to the Senate president pro tem - currently Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. - a declaration that the sitting president can no longer perform his duties. The vice president would then be named ""acting president."" The amendment was ratified following the Kennedy assassination.

In the past, temporary cases have arisen, such as President George W. Bush providing a written declaration that Vice President Dick Cheney would assume his powers while he underwent a medical procedure.

DEMOCRAT STATE OFFICIALS LARGELY BACK BIDEN AFTER DEBATE, AS PARTY CHARI SUGGESTS GOP PULLS TRUMP NOM

In that regard, prior to filing the suit, Brosnan said the Heritage Foundation made a media request through its press arm, the Daily Signal, to the offices of each of the Cabinet secretaries, and then followed up with FOIA requests with each for such communications.

Oversight Project President Mike Howell noted that one Cabinet agency provided an email response that appeared to show the ""White House was taking over the comms"" on the matter, in his words.

In a Wednesday interview with the two attorneys, Howell added that concerns about President Biden's ability to perform his duties are not new, and the media have particularly recently appeared to make such a case, and that discussions in the media and elsewhere spurred the Oversight Project to use legal means to find out whether any such communications exist.

""We don't have to take George Clooney's word for it,"" he said, referring to how the longtime Democrat and actor publicly stated following the CNN debate that Biden showed signs of decline at a prior fundraiser.

He further pointed to first lady Jill Biden's unusually prominent role in a recent Cabinet meeting, which was met with some public backlash.

Howell said Congress has largely shirked its duty to provide oversight when it comes to the question, ""Who is really running our country?""

FLASHBACK: BIDEN'S CABINET DOUBLES DOWN ON SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT FOLLOWING DEBATE

""The media clearly decided it can't be Kamala Harris, who would be the constitutional successor or somebody else other than Harris/Biden. Right now, an unelected person is, most likely performing the duties of the president with Biden [conducting] ceremonial duties only when his physical state allows. And so Congress controls the timeline,"" he said.

Another reason the 25th Amendment is a key topic at present is that there is a very real chance that former President Trump could have been put in a coma or killed by recent attempted assassins, Howell said.

He predicted the trend could continue if Trump were elected, given the heated political rhetoric in some corners on the left.

However, positing that Democrats have been loath to even consider utilizing the amendment under the current presidency, it gives Trump and Republicans room to excuse a future Trump presidency from being held to a higher standard when it comes to cognition or ability to perform duties.

""Any of those [assassination attempts] are one day likely to partially... The left has no leg to stand on to say the 25th Amendment needs to be invoked.""

Some House Democrats are already looking at the possibility of investigating former President Donald Trump if they win the House majority in November.

Two top lawmakers, Reps. Richard Neal, D-Mass., and Jamie Raskin, D-Md., did not rule out probing Trump if he won the White House in November.

Neal, the top Democrat on the House Ways & Means Committee who led the probe into Trump's tax returns in the last Congress, told Fox News Digital it would be ""hard to assess"" whether he would see himself resuscitating that effort, but he added that the Supreme Court's recent decision expanding presidential immunity could change the calculus.

""That would be speculative, but I certainly would not back away from the positions I've taken over the years on that issue,"" Neal said.

CLUB FOR GROWTH POURS $5M INTO TIGHT HOUSE RACES AS GOP BRACES FOR TOUGH ELECTION

Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, told Fox News Digital, ""I'd rather look to the future than the past, but we'll do our job.""

In a longer statement provided to Fox News Digital on Wednesday, Raskin accused Republicans of ignoring issues like gun violence and prescription drug costs.

""Instead, for two years, House Republicans have used the gavel to pursue a laughingstock flop of an impeachment investigation to help their presidential nominee and personal cult leader, Donald Trump. Even worse, they have blocked and obstructed Democrats' efforts to investigate the corruption of Donald Trump and his autocrat allies,"" Raskin said.

""Investigating this endless corruption is critical for Congress to create legislative fixes to ensure government serves the people and to put an end to efforts to exploit the presidency and sell out our government to the highest bidder.""

Meanwhile, rank-and-file Democratic Reps. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., and Dan Goldman, D-N.Y., said investigations could be warranted into Trump's family and their business dealings even if the former president lost his re-election bid.

Both singled out his son-in-law and former White House adviser Jared Kushner, whose investment firm got a $2 billion investment commitment from a fund led by Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.

""His family has some ongoing deals that we learned about after we went out of the majority that I think are worth visiting,"" Swalwell said. ""The Kushners and the Saudi deal - I think people want some closure on that.""

He took a shot at the House GOP's probes into the foreign business dealings of President Biden's son, adding, ""If you tell me you're interested in Hunter Biden, then you probably owe it to the country to be interested in what happened there.""

JOHNSON'S PLAN TO AVOID GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN GOES DOWN IN FLAMES AS REPUBLICANS REBEL

Goldman, an Oversight Committee member, told Fox News Digital, ""I think if Trump wins, obviously that'll be the principal purpose [of the committee], is to provide the checks and balances that Congress needs to check, and that Donald Trump especially requires.""

""I think there are a lot of really important, substantive issues that the committee has not investigated this year that are not partisan, that we should be focused on,"" he said, adding, ""But we also were frustrated this term that obvious, obvious concerns were not investigated.""

""How did Jared Kushner get $2 billion from Mohammed bin Salman for an investment company in something that he had never done before...That's a tremendous amount of money. There's been no investigation into that.""

SHUTDOWN FEARS MOVE HOUSE REPUBLICANS TO PROTECT MILITARY PAYCHECKS

Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt responded, ""Swalwell and Goldman should get a life. President Trump has endured two fake impeachments, four baseless witch-hunt indictments, and endless investigations into his businesses -- all of which have failed because they are not based on facts but rather, they are fueled by the vitriolic Trump Derangement Syndrome that has taken over the Democrat Party.""

Raskin's investigatory efforts into Trump during this Congress, as leader of the Oversight Committee's Democratic minority, could also offer a possible preview of what Democrats' probes could look like in a second Trump term.

Earlier this month, he and Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., sent a letter to Trump demanding that the former president prove he did not take a ""cash bribe"" from Egypt's president in 2017. The letter was spurred by a Washington Post report that also alleged former Attorney General Bill Barr had blocked a probe into the matter.

Investigating Biden and his family has been a core focus of the committee under Chairman James Comer's tenure. Comer, R-Ky., released a report recently accusing the president of having committed impeachable offenses - something the White House denies.

He denied that the intensity of his Biden probe could give Democrats cover to investigate Trump, however - insisting their inquiries into Trump were political.

""If the Democrats want to waste taxpayer dollars and time investigating the Trump administration again for the second time, then that's their prerogative. But we focused on waste, fraud and abuse and mismanagement by the federal government,"" Comer told Fox News Digital.

""If Trump wins...They're going to harass and obstruct every step of the way."""

This week, heads of state converged on Turtle Bay for the UN's annual high-level week. If there ever were an occasion for the world's diplomatic juggernauts to collectively solve the world's most pressing geopolitical quagmires, this would be it.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is correct that this is a once-in-a- generation opportunity to address the world's challenges and ""reform outdated international institutions."" One of those outdated institutions we

must talk about is UNRWA in Gaza.

ISRAEL'S UN AMBASSADOR SLAMS WORLD BODY, SAYS UNRWA TAKEN OVER BY TERRORISTS IN GAZA

When it comes to Israel, the UN isn't interested in easing tensions on Israel's northern and southern borders as much as it is in rewarding terrorism and demonizing the Jewish State. For standing up for itself. For defending its people in a war on seven fronts, orchestrated by the Islamic Republic of Iran, a Shiite supremacist empire hellbent on achieving regional dominance, not diplomacy.

Tehran's proxies -- Hezbollah in the north, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria, and

terrorist cells in Judea and Samaria are Tehran's attack dogs, unleashed to

sow death and chaos across the Middle East.

The Palestinian resolution approved by the General Assembly last week --

demanding that Israel end its ""unlawful presence in the Palestinian territories"" while calling for sanctions and an arms embargo against Israel -- demonstrates why the United Nations offers little hope for advancing regional peace. The resolution was nothing short of diplomatic terrorism, designed to sabotage real peace efforts by shifting attention away from condemning Hamas for triggering this 11-month war.

Rather than focusing on condemning Hamas for perpetrating the single greatest massacre of Jewish people since the Holocaust, the UN circus has once again adhered to what has now become a predictable, virulently anti-

Israel script.

Peace is hard to come by while the UN remains loath to come to terms with

the sinister reality that one of its agencies, UNRWA in Gaza, has been overrun by Hamas terrorists. For that reason, and for the sake of peace for Israelis and for Gazans, UNRWA must be disbanded.

UNRWA's stated mission is to advance the human development of Palestine

through the achievement of five strategic outcomes, centered on protecting

refugee rights under international law; safeguarding their health; providing

education to school-aged children; offering sufficient opportunities for earning a living; and providing Gazans with basic food and shelter provisions.

But since its founding in 1949, UNRWA has failed miserably in achieving these goals. UNRWA has failed to ameliorate the lives of Gazans, and it has failed to prevent Hamas terrorists from hijacking the agency's operations in Gaza.

How is UNRWA safeguarding the health of Gazans or providing high-quality

education opportunities when it is overrun by terrorists who use schools not to educate but as Hamas command and control centers?

CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION

The preponderance of evidence pointing to terrorism at UNRWA has done

little to convince the UN. On Aug. 5, the UN conceded that nine UNRWA

employees likely took part in the Hamas butchering of 1,200 people, which

included more than 30 Americans, on Oct. 7.

Earlier this month, more local UNRWA workers were found to have been disguised as Hamas operatives. On a moral and professional level, UNRWA has failed Palestinians, it has failed Israel, and it has failed the UN.

It is time to deploy a new agency in Gaza that is focused more on humanitarian efforts, and not on activism or, in some cases, terrorism. The latest polio campaign, spearheaded by UNICEF, the World Health Organization and IDF, where more than 600,000 Gazan children were vaccinated, shows that progress is possible when Israel is working with partners interested in humanitarian efforts.

President Biden's swan song on the world stage Tuesday at the United Nations General Assembly was a sad demonstration of American weakness and the failed foreign policies of the Biden-Harris administration.

Knowing full well that Iran is the leading state sponsor of terror, responsible for the escalation of instability and hatred on a global scale, the president spent two sentences of his lengthy speech on Iran. He repeated the mantra that Iran will never obtain a nuclear weapon, despite the fact that even the UN's Atomic Energy Agency and everybody listening, knows that under his watch Iran has already become a threshold nuclear power.

President Biden spent more time talking about Gaza than any other specific conflict, notwithstanding the hundreds of millions of people in horrific conditions in conflicts and in countries that the U.N. routinely ignores because the Jewish state is their favorite whipping boy.

And how did Biden talk about ""the Middle East""? Adopting the U.N. narrative, he demanded: ""ease the suffering in Gaza"" and made no mention of the suffering in Israel.

BIDEN ADDRESSES UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY FOR LAST TIME AS DICTATORS, DESPOTS COME TO NEW YORK

While he noted that the families of the hostages are going through hell - alongside ""the innocent civilians in Gaza"" - what about the suffering of all the families of the members of the Israeli Defense Forces killed by Palestinian terrorists or serving on the front lines every day to defend the nation from fiendish adversaries? What about the suffering of millions of Israelis forced to cower in bomb shelters over and over again from the incessant rocket fire?

President Biden then lost his moral compass entirely. He addressed the immediate situation in Lebanon and said: ""too many on each side of the Israeli-Lebanon border remain displaced."" Tens of thousands of Israelis have been displaced from their homes in northern Israel for almost a year because of unprovoked Hezbollah-Iranian attacks. And within one week of Israel finally saying ""enough"" to those attacks and to the imminent catastrophic danger posed by Iran and its proxy, Biden points to displaced Lebanese.

Displaced why? Because Hezbollah has been operating from their homes and neighborhoods and using them as cannon fodder. The moral relativism from the Democratic president of the United States should set off alarm bells.

Adopting yet another U.N. storyline, Biden then told the world to ""address the rise of violence against innocent Palestinians on the West Bank"" - as if there were no rise of violence in the form of Palestinian terror attacks against innocent Israeli Jews for the alleged crime of being Jews in the West Bank, and no Palestinian Authority egging on the terrorists in the West Bank with financial rewards.

In an ominous sign for a President Harris, here's what President Biden didn't take his last opportunity to mention: the global spread of antisemitism. Antisemitism that is promoted and incited by the United Nations and those in his General Assembly audience. Antisemitism that is now doing enormous damage to a tolerant and peaceful America. Antisemitism that fuels the Iranian threat to world peace.

Instead, the Biden-Harris administration issued platitudes about ""common hope"" and ""cooperation"" that are not only commonplace at every U.N. General Assembly gathering but enthusiastically espoused by America's enemies from that same podium.

How a US-backed UN resolution failed to stop Hezbollah terror takeover: 'Bipartisan failure',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/how-us-backed-un-resolution-failed-stop-hezbollah-terror-takeover-bipartisan-failure,2024-09-25T08:09:15Z,"JERUSALEM -- As Israel's air force continues to pound the Hezbollah terrorist movement in some of the most intense clashes since the 2006 war, United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSC) 1701 is facing new criticism for failing to disarm the Lebanon-based terrorist organization.

The U.S. and other world powers passed Resolution 1701 at the United Nations Security Council in 2006 in an attempt to prevent a third war between Israel and the U.S.-designated terrorist organization Hezbollah. Israel fought Hezbollah in 1982 and in the summer of 2006.

Two key elements of Resolution 1701 have proved to be largely ineffective, according to experts on Lebanon and the U.N.

HEZBOLLAH BIGGER CHALLENGE THAN HAMAS TO ISRAEL: 'CROWN JEWEL IN THE IRANIAN EMPIRE OF TERROR'

The first part involved the 10,000 peacekeeping (with added personnel) U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) that was expanded in 2006 to aid the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) in assuming military control over the region, replacing Hezbollah, between the Litani River and the southern border in Lebanon.

UNIFIL was tasked to work with the LAF to ensure the area was ""free of any armed personnel, assets, and weapons."" However, Hezbollah's growing absorption of the Lebanese state has turned it the de facto ruler over the country, according to many experts, or a heavily armed ""state within a state.""

The second crucial element of 1701 was to disarm Hezbollah. Yet, the Lebanese terrorist entity has dramatically re-armed itself to the point where it now has at least 150,000 missiles and rockets aimed at Israel.

ISRAEL DEGRADES IRAN-BACKED HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS IN SPECTACULAR PAGER EXPLOSION OPERATION: EXPERTS

Walid Phares, who has advised U.S. presidential candidates, said 1701 is a ""limited resolution and cannot work by itself."" He added, ""Everybody is hiding behind 1701 and cannot resolve the issue."" He said even within the presence of UNIFIL, Hezbollah would come back.

Phares, who has extensively written on Hezbollah, proposed enforcement of the 2004 UNSC Resolution 1559 to compliment 1701 because it ""expressly asked for a disarming and dismantling of Hezbollah as a militia. That is basically the comprehensive resolution that can serve the purpose of a cease-fire or of actually getting to peace.""

""The Lebanese opposition should be calling on the execution of 1559. What does that mean? The Lebanese government will help to disarm Hezbollah from the center, but that Lebanese government is controlled by Hezbollah, so that government cannot execute 1559. Who can do it? The Lebanese people themselves,"" he said.

Phares noted that some Lebanese Christians, Druze and Sunnis have been doing it themselves over the last few days by ""refusing access to Hezbollah"" in a number of their areas. ""But they need someone to represent them.""

Rich Goldberg, a former member of then-President Trump's National Security Council, told Fox News Digital, ""This is a bipartisan American failure as much as it is a U.N. failure. The Bush administration signed off on 1701 with an obvious poison pill: that UNIFIL could only take action at the request of the Lebanese Armed Forces. No request ever came, no enforcement ever occurred, all while the U.S. pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into both UNIFIL and the Lebanese Armed Forces. We held all the cards and used none for 18 years, and Iran took full advantage.""

""The lesson for today is that whatever comes after Israel's campaign against Hezbollah, it cannot rely on UNIFIL or the Lebanese Armed Forces for verification or enforcement,"" said Goldberg, a senior adviser for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. ""The only party capable and willing to disarm Hezbollah is the Israel Defense Forces.""

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., echoed Goldberg's comments on Monday in the Senate chamber, ""The U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon allowed Hezbollah to build up massive stockpiles on Israel's border in clear, clear preparation for war.""

IRAN TRIED TO INFLUENCE ELECTION BY SENDING STOLEN MATERIAL FROM TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO BIDEN'S CAMP, FBI SAYS

""Why has the U.N. looked the other way as Hezbollah has expanded its corrosive influence over the institutions of Lebanon's government?"" he continued. ""But setting aside the failures of the so-called international community, this past weekend once again cast a spotlight on America's own naivete toward the glaring facts of Iran-backed war on our friend, Israel.""

Hezbollah launched rocket attacks at Israel on Oct. 8, a day after its ally, Hamas, invaded Israel from the Gaza Strip and slaughtered nearly 1,200 people, including more than 30 Americans, and took about 250 hostages.

Middle East analyst and expert Tom Gross told Fox News Digital, ""In many senses, Israel would be forgiven for never trusting the U.N. again. Its utter bias during this conflict, its eagerness to believe whatever fabrications Hamas and Hezbollah feed it, including wildly unreliable civilian death stats and false reports of mass starvation in Gaza, as well as its abysmal failure to enforce previous resolutions (including 1701) designed to stop rocket fire into Israel, mean that almost no one in Israel trusts the U.N.""

On Monday, France requested an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting to address the Lebanon and Israel conflict.

""I have requested that an emergency meeting of the Security Council be held on Lebanon this week,"" French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot announced. He urged all parties to ""avoid a regional conflagration that would be devastating for everyone.""

France had a colonial ruler presence in Lebanon from 1920 to 1946. Paris has vehemently opposed classifying all of Hezbollah's movement as a terrorist entity, in sharp contrast to Germany, Canada, Austria, the United Kingdom and many additional European and Latin American countries that have condemned Hezbollah's entire organization as a terrorist group.

When approached for comment about the alleged failure of 1701, the U.S. State Department referred Fox News Digital to remarks by U.S. Ambassador Robert Wood in late August at the Security Council to extend the UNIFIL mandate. He said at the time that ""Hezbollah made the escalatory decision to bombard communities in northern Israel. And for the past 11 months, it has done so on nearly a daily basis.  It is wrong that this council has yet to condemn Hezbollah for these repeated destabilizing actions, and we regret that a small minority of the council members blocked the council from doing so in this mandate renewal.""

Wood added, ""There is no dispute that Iran, in clear violation of the arms embargo in Resolution 1701, provides Hezbollah with the majority of the rockets, missiles and drones that are fired at Israel."" He called for the ""need to push for Resolution 1701's full implementation, including by establishing an area south of the Litani River that is free of any armed personnel, assets or weapons other than those of the Lebanese government and UNIFIL.""

A statement released by UNIFIL on Monday noted, ""It is essential to fully recommit to the implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which is now more critical than ever to address the underlying causes of the conflict and ensure lasting stability."""
British PM makes unfortunate 'return of the sausages' gaffe during serious speech,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/british-pm-suffers-unfortunate-return-sausages-gaffe-during-serious-speech,2024-09-24T20:35:46Z,"The prime minister was giving a party speech when he misspoke. (Credit: Reuters)

United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer made an unfortunate gaffe during a speech at his party's conference Tuesday when he mistakenly called for the return of ""sausages,"" instead of hostages, held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

Starmer was speaking at the Labour Party's annual conference in Liverpool when he called for a de-escalation between Lebanon and Israel, as well as a cease-fire in Gaza.

He also called for the return of hostages being held by the terror group when he slipped up, before quickly recovering.

""I call again for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza, the return of the sausages -- the hostages -- and a recommitment to the two-state solution: a recognized Palestinian state alongside a safe and secure Israel,"" he said.

The mistake quickly went viral.

During his remarks, Starmer was also heckled by a spectator in the audience who shouted about Gaza.

""This guy's obviously got a pass from the 2019 conference. We've changed the party,"" Starmer joked in response, Reuters reported. ""While he's been protesting, we've been changing the party. That's why we've got a Labour government.""

Multiple hostages are still being held in Gaza nearly a year after the group attacked Israeli communities Oct. 7, sparking the latest conflict between Hamas and the Jewish state.

Israel has proposed ending the war if Hamas releases the remaining hostages, along with the demilitarization of Gaza and the establishment of an alternative governing body. Hamas has rejected several offers to end the conflict.

Israel has bombarded Gaza and pledged to hunt down those responsible for the deadly attack. Meanwhile, it has also had to defend itself on a second front against shelling in its north from Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Two professional sports teams distanced themselves from rapper Macklemore after he told concertgoers at a pro-Palestinian event in Seattle, ""F--- America!""

Macklemore is a part of the ownership groups of the NHL's Seattle Kraken and MLS' Seattle Sounders FC. Both teams released a joint statement on Macklemore's remarks.

""We believe that sports bring people together and unite us. We are aware of Macklemore's increasingly divisive comments, and they do not reflect the values of our respective ownership groups, leagues, or organizations,"" the teams said on Monday, via KOMO News.

He joined the ownership group of the Sounders in August 2019 and was a part of the Kraken's ownership group in in April 2022.

""We are currently evaluating our collective options on this matter,"" the statement added.

Macklemore performed at the ""Palestine Will Live Forever Festival.""

""Straight up, say it. I'm not gonna stop you. I'm not gonna stop you,"" Macklemore said, appearing to reference chants from the crowd.

""Yeah, F--- America,"" the Grammy-winning performer said, sending the crowd into cheers. The video was shared on X by journalist Cam Higby.

He said the proceeds of the event held at Seward Park Amphitheater would go to various groups, including the controversial agency known as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA).

Israeli officials have declared that UNRWA is strongly tied to Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The U.N. itself announced in August that nine UNRWA staffers would be fired due to possible involvement in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel.

Maher Joudi, the event's organizer, told The South Seattle Emerald the event was purely to support Palestinians.

""The only thing I want anybody to take away from this is - anything that we do in this space is 1,000% for Palestine,"" he told the outlet. ""It is in service of Palestine and those that are fighting every day. We do what we can on this side. And I think as long as we're centering and framing all the work that we do as being in service of them, then we're doing the work.""

Macklemore dropped an anti-Israel song in May titled ""Hind's Hall,"" referring to the Columbia University building that students occupied and renamed in honor of a 6-year-old Palestinian girl killed in the Israel-Gaza war. The song praised the anti-Israel encampments and protests on college campuses across the country and called out President Biden, the police and the music industry.

The rapper this month dropped a second version of the song that now calls out Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democratic presidential nominee when Biden backed out of the race in July.

It's been nearly a year since Hamas terrorists entered Israel and killed, raped and took hostage hundreds of people. It sparked Israel's ongoing war in the region and no cease-fire appears to be in sight.

"Biden defends withdrawing from Afghanistan, dropping re-election bid in last UN address as president",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-defends-withdrawing-afghanistan-dropping-re-election-bid-last-un-address-president,2024-09-24T15:38:17Z,"NEW YORK CITY -- President Biden, in his final address to the United Nation's General Assembly, warned that the world is at an ""inflection point,"" while defending his decision to withdraw from Afghanistan and his move to suspend his re-election campaign.

Biden delivered his fourth and final speech to the assembly as President of the United States on Tuesday, addressing leaders and representatives from 134 countries around the globe.

""Today is the fourth time I've had the great honor of speaking to this assembly as President of the United States,"" Biden said Tuesday morning. ""It'll be my last.""

Biden reflected on the global order when he was first elected as a U.S. senator in 1972, saying the world was at ""an inflection point"" and a ""moment of tension and uncertainty.""

BIDEN ADDRESSES UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY FOR LAST TIME AS DICTATORS, DESPOTS COME TO NEW YORK

""The world was divided by the Cold War; the Middle East was headed toward war; America was at war in Vietnam at that point -- the longest war in America's history,"" Biden said. ""Our country was divided and angry, and there were questions about our staying power and our future. But even then, I entered public life not out of despair, but out of optimism.""

Biden said when he was elected president, the world was in ""another moment of crisis and uncertainty,"" referring to the ongoing U.S. presence in Afghanistan.

""We were attacked on 9/11 by Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. We brought him justice. Then I came to the presidency in another moment of crisis and uncertainty,"" Biden said. ""I believed America had to look forward--new challenges, new threats, new opportunities were in front of us.""

Biden said he needed to put the United States ""in a position to see the threats, to deal with the challenges, and to seize the opportunities as well.""

""We needed to end the war that began on 9/11,"" Biden said. ""I came to office as president, with Afghanistan to replace Vietnam as America's longest war.""

""I was determined to end it,"" he siad. ""And I did.""

Biden said it was a ""hard decision but the right decision.""

""Four American presidents had faced that decision, but I was determined not to leave it to a fifth,"" Biden said, while acknowledging the decision was ""accompanied by tragedy,"" as 13 U.S. servicemembers lost their lives, along with hundreds of Afghan civilians in a suicide bombing outside of Kabul Airport during the withdrawal.

But under the Biden-Harris administration, officials have sought diplomacy amid global instability and fears of a growing war in the Middle East, especially following its botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, the years-long Russia-Ukraine war, the growing threat from Iran's nuclear development, increased aggression from China, and a crisis at the U.S. southern border.

""I truly believe we're at another inflection point in world history, where the choices we make today will determine our future for decades to come,"" Biden said Tuesday. ""We stand behind the principles that unite us; we stand firm against aggression; we end the conflicts that are raging today. We take on global challenges like climate change, hunger and disease.""

Also under his administration, in 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine.

""The good news is Putin's war has failed,"" Biden said, while adding though, that the world ""cannot grow weary"" and ""cannot look away"" or ""let up on our support for Ukraine.""

As for increasing aggression in China, Biden said there is a need to continue to ""responsibly manage the competition with China so it does not veer into conflict.""

Biden stressed that he is working to ""bring a greater measure of peace and stability to the Middle East.""

""The world must not flinch from the horrors of October 7th - any country would have the right responsibility to ensure that such attack can never happen again,"" Biden said, referring to Hamas' brutal terror attack in Israel. ""Thousands of armed Hamas terrorists invaded a sovereign state, slaughtering and massacring more than 1200 people, including 46 Americans in their homes and at a music festival, the despicable acts of sexual violence, 250 innocents taken hostage.""

Biden said he has met with the families of those hostages.

""I grieve with them,"" he said. ""They're going through hell.""

But Biden said, ""Innocent civilians in Gaza are also going through hell.""

Biden pointed to the ceasefire and hostage deal his administration has worked on with Qatar and Egypt.

""Now it is time for the parties to finalize terms, bring the hostages home, secure Israel and Gaza free of Hamas' grip, ease the suffering in Gaza and end this war,"" he said.

Biden stressed that his administration has been ""determined to prevent a wider war that engulfs the entire region.""

""A full scale war is not in anyone's interest,"" he said. ""Even as the situation has escalated, a diplomatic solution is still possible.""

""In fact, it remains the only path to lasting security,"" Biden continued, so that ""the residents from both countries return to their homes.""

""That's what we're working tirelessly to achieve,"" Biden said.

But as for the war in Gaza, Biden, notably, did not mention rising antisemitism in the United States and around the globe since the Oct. 7 attacks, but instead, discussed the ""rise of violence against innocent Palestinians on the West Bank.""

Biden said the world needs to work towards ""a two-state solution where the world -- where Israel enjoys security and peace and full recognition and normalize relations with all its neighbors; and with Palestinians, living securely with dignity and self-determination in a state of their own.""

Meanwhile, Biden declared the need to continue to ensure Iran will ""never obtain a nuclear weapon.""

As he closed his, likely, final address to the world, Biden said he and world leaders ""must never forget who we're here to represent--We the people.""

""These are the first words of our Constitution. The very idea of America. They inspired the opening words of the UN charter. I made the preservation of democracy the central cause of my presidency,"" Biden said.

Biden explained his decision to suspend his 2024 re-election campaign, calling it a ""difficult decision.""

""Being president has been the honor of my life. There is so much more I want to get done,"" Biden said, but urged world leaders not to forget that ""some things are more important than staying in power.""

""It's your people. It is your people that matter most,"" Biden said. ""We are here to serve the people, not the other way around, because the future will be won by those who unleash the full potential of their people to breathe free, to think freely, to innovate, to educate, to live in love openly without fear.""

He added: ""That's the soul of democracy. It does not belong to any one country. I've seen it all around the world.""

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian is set to address the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Tuesday afternoon in New York City amid a wash of stories involving Tehran's involvement in assassination attempts against U.S. politicians and election interference.

Pezeshkian, who turned heads this week for his 40-member strong delegation which reportedly includes his adult children, has already made headlines upon his arrival for comments he made suggesting Israel is looking to start an all-out war in the Middle East by turning Lebanon into the next Gaza.

BIDEN TO ADDRESS UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY FOR LAST TIME AS DICTATORS, DESPOTS COME TO NEW YORK

""We do not wish to be the cause of instability in the Middle East as its consequences would be irreversible,"" he told reporters Monday, according to Reuters. ""We want to live in peace, we don't want war.

""It is Israel that seeks to create this all-out conflict,"" he added.

His comments to the General Assembly are expected to largely focus on the ongoing fight in the Middle East as Israel finds itself pitted against Iran's terror proxies Hamas and Hezbollah.

Pezeshkian's comments are likely to draw focus on the high number of Palestinian civilians killed in Gaza, and recently the Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon, where nearly 500 people were killed, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry, reported the BBC early Tuesday. It's not known how many of the dead are Hezbollah terrorists.

IRAN TRIED TO INFLUENCE ELECTION BY SENDING STOLEN MATERIAL FROM TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO BIDEN'S CAMP, FBI SAYS

While the U.N. has condemned Israeli attacks on civilians, the Iranian president's comments are likely to ring hollow among some at the international body as Tehran has substantially backed the terrorist organizations that have engaged in the fight against the Jewish state.

There is the other matter of Tehran's exposed plot to assassinate Donald Trump, as well as potentially President Biden, Nikki Haley, along with other ""politicians, military people or bureaucrats,"" according to FBI documents released by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, earlier this month.

The FBI further confirmed last week that Iran hackers attempted to supply the Democratic presidential campaign with stolen communication files from the Trump campaign.

While it appears the Iranian attempts to mimic the Russia-style hack-and-leak operations utilized during the 2016 campaign was a failed push to cause turmoil in the U.S. ahead of the elections, the assassination plot was likely due to the 2020 killing of Gen. Qasem Soleimani during Trump's time as president.

Pezeshkian's trip to the U.S. for the top U.N. meeting drew condemnation from U.S. lawmakers last month. They encouraged Biden to block his visa over concerns his presence would ""raise serious security issues"" for the U.S. and its allies.

Hunger strikers were also reported at a notorious female prison in Iran in protest of the Iranian president's address amid Tehran increasing the number of executions and in a call for the release of all political and ideological detainees, according to Iran International."

Given that all Vice President Harris can say about Israel and Hamas -- ""We must get a deal done!"" -- what would she say about Israel and Lebanon? What former President Trump has said, consistently, is that Israel needs to win, fast.

For whom do you suppose Israelis would vote if they could vote in U.S. elections? For whom would the Islamist ruling class of Iran vote? (Iran is not a free country like Israel, so the hypothetical question about voting in our presidential election is restricted to those whom the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei would allow to vote.)

We don't know, and there's little to go on. The Jewish People Policy Institute did one survey of Israeli Jews in July, before President Biden withdrew, and found that among Jews in Israel, 51 percent prefer Trump compared to 35 percent who prefer Biden, with 14 percent stating they have no opinion. I have seen no update since then.

We have seen Iran target the campaign of former President Trump. It is a safe bet that the mullahs prefer a Harris-Waltz victory to one of Trump-Vance because Trump ran the ""maximum pressure"" campaign against Tehran which had nearly bankrupted the regime there until President Biden ended it and began not only to ease sanctions but unfreeze billions in Iranian assets in order to secure the release of hostages. Khamenei wants no part of Trump 2.0.

ISRAEL HAMMERS HEZBOLLAH WITH STRIKES, ISSUES WARNING ON WHERE IT MAY HIT NEXT

The Israelis? It's a country deeply divided along political lines but almost wholly united in the need to win the war in Gaza and the one that looms in Lebanon and perhaps beyond (and which may have fully begun overnight). Given that Biden/Harris has played yo-yo with arms shipments to Israel even as it has continually attempted to restrain the Israeli Defense Forces, it's a safe bet that most Israelis are hoping Donald Trump returns to the White House in January.

Many American voters could not care less about Israel or Iran. They are worried about the cost of groceries. Those folks are going to vote for Trump as the certain way to bring down the cost of food is to decrease the cost of producing food and the cost of transporting it to supermarkets. The way to do that is to unleash and fully support American domestic energy production. Trump has the majority of the inflation-driven voter locked up just as Harris has the abortion-on-demand voter locked up.

For those few percent of Americans who vote for national security and ""peace through strength,"" and especially for those who pray for peace in Jerusalem and the region and for freedom for the Iranian people, the choice is clear: Donald Trump.

Gen. Kellogg says Israel 'disregarding' Biden-Harris admin as war on Hezbollah escalates,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/gen-kellogg-says-israel-disregarding-biden-harris-admin-war-hezbollah-escalates,2024-09-24T08:26:52Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Former Trump administration national security official Lt. Gen Keith Kellogg (Ret.) said on ""America Reports"" that Israel does not trust the Biden-Harris administration to be a ""peacemaker"" and will not wait any longer for a cease-fire agreement. Kellogg, former national security adviser to VP Mike Pence, said Israel is ""disregarding"" the United States as troops aim to destroy Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.

HEZBOLLAH LAUNCHES ROCKETS AT ISRAEL: 'OPEN-ENDED BATTLE'

KEITH KELLOGG: Israel does not trust the United States right now to be any type of peacemaker or interlocutor at all. They've just disregarded what the United States is going to do. They're going to handle this on their own and I think they're going to be able to do it now. You can really see that they've shifted away from Gaza with the preponderance of the military force. Look at the airstrikes and look at the map that the targets that they've hit. Look what they did to the command and control. Look at them taking out major infrastructure as well. They're really planning to go ahead and really hard, and they're going to solve this. And I think Netanyahu has got it right. He has decided to take a plan, go forward with it, and actually eliminate, at least from the south, south of the Litani River, all Hezbollah positions to allow those people you mentioned between 60 and 100,000 to return to their homes. And I think he's making a real point. I don't think this thing is going to de-escalate at all. I think you're looking at an escalation not only today and tomorrow, but in the coming weeks. This fight is far from finished.

Israel's military says an ""extensive"" wave of airstrikes has hit more than 300 Hezbollah targets Monday as residents of southern Lebanon are being warned to stay away from buildings where the terrorist group is storing weapons.

The strikes are in response to Hezbollah launching around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel on Sunday following Israeli military operations that resulted in the deaths of multiple top Hezbollah commanders. Monday's strikes so far have killed more than 180 in Lebanon and have left over 700 injured, health officials there told The Associated Press.

""I urge the Lebanese residents... who are inside or near houses where rockets and weapons are stored, to move away immediately! For your safety and protection,"" Israel Defense Forces spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said in a statement.

Israel also bombed targets in the northeastern Baalbek and Hermel regions, where a shepherd was killed and two family members were wounded, the National News Agency said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said during a meeting with military officials Monday that ""For those who have not yet understood, I want to clarify Israel's policy--- we do not wait for a threat, we anticipate it. Everywhere, in every arena, at any time. We eliminate senior officials, eliminate terrorists, eliminate missiles... Whoever tries to hurt us, we hurt him even harder.:

""I repeat and reiterate: Israel does not seek war. But we have the right and the duty to defend our people,"" Israeli President Isaac Herzog added on X, sharing a video he claims ""shows how Hezbollah stores and launches missiles in civilian areas and homes."""
"Who is Amer Ghalib, the Trump-endorsing mayor of the US' only Muslim-majority town?",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/who-amer-ghalib-trump-endorsing-mayor-uss-only-muslim-majority-town,2024-09-23T17:23:54Z,"Former presidential candidate Vivek Ramswamy explains why he believes Trump is better for America than Kamala Harris, and debuts his new book 'Truths' alongside his new Fox Nation special.

Hamtramck, Michigan, Mayor Amer Ghalib made headlines over the weekend by endorsing former President Donald Trump's latest bid for president, putting the U.S.' only Muslim-majority town in the national spotlight.

Ghalib, who became Hamtramck's first Muslim mayor after being elected in 2021, was born in Yemen and immigrated to the U.S. as a teenager in 1997, according to a profile of the mayor posted by Henry Ford College.

He attended Hamtramck High School and worked at a factory, eventually going on to attend then-Henry Ford Community College and Wayne State University, where he earned his bachelor's degree in biology and pre-med. He later attended the Ross University School of Medicine in Dominica, where he completed four years but did not complete his residency.

Ghalib spent most of his career as a medical professional in Hamtramck, an enclave of Detroit with about 28,000 residents. The town was known as a mostly Polish settlement until recent decades, with a large influx of Middle Eastern immigrants eventually making it the nation's first Muslim-majority city.

MAYOR OF MUSLIM-MAJORITY MICHIGAN CITY ENDORSES TRUMP: 'RIGHT CHOICE FOR THIS CRITICAL TIME'

He made history when he defeated former Hamtramck Mayor Karen Majewski, breaking an over 100-year streak of the city being represented by a Polish-American mayor. The city also became the first in the nation with an all-Muslim elected leadership that same year, with Hamtramck's six city council seats being won by Muslim candidates.

However, Ghalib has also attracted controversy during his time as mayor, including his support of a 2023 resolution that banned the display of LGBTQ+ flags on city property.

""You do not know our city more than we do, and you will not know the consequences of opening the door for every group to fly their flag on city properties,"" Ghalib said in a statement to critics of the move in a Detroit Free Press report. ""Our residents are all equally important to us, and we will continue to serve them equally without discrimination, favoritism or preferential treatment to any group. The city government will stay NEUTRAL and IMPARTIAL toward its residents.""

Later the same year, he attracted more controversy when he failed to condemn one of his political appointees who was accused of making antisemitic comments.

According to a report on the controversy from the Hamtramck Review, Hamtramck Plan Commission member Nasr Hussain came under fire for questioning whether Jewish people were being punished by God during the Holocaust for actions Israel is now taking in Gaza.

TRUMP VOWS TOUGH APPROACH TO SANCTUARY POLICIES

""Was the Holocaust God's advance punishment of the 'Chosen People' for the savagery they're committing today against the innocent Palestinians children and civilians,"" Hussain posted on the popular local Facebook page, ""Hamtramck Square.""

""A heinous act proving that they're as savage and cruel as the Nazis themselves, or even worse.(Take into consideration that God isn't confined by space or time and that they believe in reincarnation.),"" he added.

""You can ask Nasr about that. What do I have to do with his posts! I don't have to comment on every resident's opinion, otherwise I would have commented on some posts that insult Islam and other religions, which are posted frequently by some residents on that same Facebook group,"" Ghalib responded when asked by the Hamtramck Review to respond to the post.

Ghalib and the Hamtramck City Council entered the spotlight again earlier this year, when the city voted unanimously to approve a resolution that required the city to avoid investing in Israeli companies or those supporting ""Israeli apartheid,"" according to a report from the Detroit Free Press, a sweeping show of support for the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement that has targeted Israeli companies.

""For now, the city will do its best to refrain from buying, investing or contracting with companies that support the Israeli genocide,"" Ghalib said after the vote.

KAMALA HARRIS HIT FOR BEING VAGUE, DODGING QUESTIONS IN RECENT INTERVIEWS: 'SHE OWES US THESE ANSWERS'

Nevertheless, Trump lobbied hard for Ghalib's endorsement, according to a report in the Detroit News, holding a private 20-minute meeting with the Hamtramck mayor prior to his event in Flint, Michigan, last Tuesday.

""He asked me if I can endorse him and ask people to vote for him? I told him: 'I'm here to talk about that and how we can make it happen,'"" Ghalib told the Detroit News. ""I then handed him an official letter with some details about our concerns and to invite him to come to Hamtramck if possible.""

Ghalib would eventually come through with that endorsement, taking to Facebook to praise Trump as ""a man of principles.""

""Though it's looking good, he may or may not win the election and be the 47th president of the United States, but I believe he is the right choice for this critical time,"" Ghalib wrote in Arabic on his Facebook page. ""I'll not regret my decision no matter what the outcome would be, and I'm ready to face the consequences. For this, and for many other reasons, I announce my support and endorsement for the former, and hopefully, the next president of the United States, Donald Trump.""

Neither Ghalib's office nor the Trump campaign immediately responded to Fox News Digital requests for comment."
IDF ops in Beirut bring closure for some; Hezbollah terrorists who killed Americans now dead,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/idf-ops-beirut-bring-closure-for-some-hezbollah-terrorists-who-killed-americans-now-dead,2024-09-23T11:39:53Z,"JERUSALEM -- Israel secured long-overdue justice for the family members of American military and diplomatic personnel murdered by Hezbollah, including the bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut.

The initial lack of alleged enthusiasm from the Biden administration and Democratic lawmakers for the targeted killings of senior Hezbollah mass murderers sparked criticism among top counter-terrorism experts.

Take the example of Israel's elimination on Friday of Ibrahim Aqil, who was wanted by the United States for both the bombing of the U.S. embassy, which killed 63 people, and the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut in 1983, when 241 U.S. military personnel were killed by the Iranian-backed terror group Hezbollah.

IRAN OFFICIAL ADMITS COUNTRY'S ROLE IN TERROR BOMBING THAT KILLED 241 US MILITARY MEMBERS: REPORT

The U.S. had a $7 million bounty on Aqil's head, who was the commander of Hezbollah's elite Radwan force. In July, Israel assassinated Hezbollah military Chief of Staff Fuad Shukr, who, like Aqil, was involved in the 1983 Beirut bombings.

Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote on X"" The families of the Marines killed in Beirut have waited decades for justice. I'm thankful Israel helped deliver it by taking out one of the world's most vicious terrorists -- Ibrahim Aqil. Let this be a message to Iran and Iran's proxies everywhere.""

A Washington Post report cited Ryan Crocker, whose office was on the fourth floor of the embassy when the blast went off, as commenting on Aqil's death, ""It is still a source of some satisfaction that he finally got it."" Crocker went on to serve as U.S. ambassador to Syria, Iraq and several other nations.

Max Abrahms, a leading expert on counter-terrorism and a tenured professor of political science at Northeastern University, told Fox News Digital that, ""Targeted killings have been a cornerstone of U.S. counterterrorism since the 9/11 attacks. And yet, Israel killing Hezbollah terrorists with American blood on their hands has been rebuked by Democrat leaders.""

He added ""The fact that even targeted killings of terrorists with American blood stained hands get rebuked unmasks the Democratic leadership, which spent the last year pretending that it objected to the Gaza campaign after 10/7 because of its negative impact on the Palestinian population. As we have seen, the Democratic leadership opposes all Israeli measures to counterterrorism, even ones perfectly executed that eliminate any civilian harm.""

Criticism of the Biden administration's initial lackluster response to the killing of Aqil on Friday appeared to prompt a response from U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who called Aqil's death ""a good outcome"" on Saturday.

HEZBOLLAH BIGGER CHALLENGE THAN HAMAS TO ISRAEL: 'CROWN JEWEL IN THE IRANIAN EMPIRE OF TERROR'

""That individual has American blood on his hands and has a Reward for Justice price on his head,"" Sullivan said. He added ""He is somebody who the United States promised long ago we would do everything we could to see brought to justice.""

White House National Security Council communications adviser John Kirby told ""Fox News Sunday with Shannon Bream"" that ""Nobody, including Secretary Austin, is shedding a tear over the death of Mr. Aqil, who does have American blood on his hands. I think the world's better for not having him walking around on the planet anymore. But that doesn't mean we want to see a full out war. We don't believe again, that that's in the best interest of the Israeli people.""

David Wurmser, a former senior adviser for nonproliferation and Middle East strategy for former Vice President Dick Cheney, told Fox News Digital that, ""The success of Israel's aims is a multi-faceted American interest. First, the demise of so many prominent Hezbollah leaders involves the death of many who are on the American wanted lists, on many of whom the United States has placed hefty bounties. Despite the bounties, however, it was clear the United States had long ago abandoned any effort to bring any of these killers of American servicemen, diplomats and intelligence officers to justice. Their wholesale demise in a matter of two or three days by Israel only further highlights the gap between the lofty rhetoric of a half century of the American foreign policy establishment and the more dishonorable reality.""

He added ""That the U.S. is now taking a de-escalatory position - which creates equivalence between our democratic ally and the terrorists that have the blood of thousands of Americans on their hands, is simply disgraceful. At least now, albeit at Israel's hands rather than ours, our sacred servicemen have been avenged.""

Wurmser noted that ""In the Middle East, we are fortunate to have a powerful and loyal ally that shares our values, Israel, that is attracting a collection of other friendly states to begin to forge a local regional alliance to challenge the region's forces of instability, foremost among them being Iran's regime.""

Matthew Levitt, the director of the Reinhard Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at The Washington Institute, told Fox News Digital that, ""Over a short period of time, Israel recently eliminated Hezbollah terrorists who were there from the beginning and played hands on rolls and attacks against Americans in the 1980s. U.S. intelligence has been tracking these people for decades.""

ISRAEL DEGRADES IRAN-BACKED HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS IN SPECTACULAR PAGER EXPLOSION OPERATION: EXPERTS

He added ""But these strikes also have very current implications, given that Fuad Shukr and Ibrahim Aqil, together with Ali Karaki, have been jointly running as well as Islamic Jihad organization as a triumvirate since the death of Mustafa Badreddine in Syria several years ago. They were foot soldiers in the 1980s and rose to the highest ranks of the organization.""

Lisa Daftari, an Iranian-American expert on the Islamic Republic and editor-in-chief of the Foreign Desk, told Fox News Digital that, ""In eliminating Ibrahim Aqil, Israel has once again demonstrated its unwavering commitment to combating global terrorism -- a fight that serves the interests of all nations dedicated to opposing radical extremism.""

She added, ""The Biden administration should openly commend Israel's efforts and provide robust support, rather than calling for restraint. It's crucial to recognize that if groups like Hezbollah and Hamas cease their hostilities, we may achieve peace. But if Israel halts its operations now, it will continue to endure relentless terrorism, similar to the attacks witnessed on October 7. Our collective security hinges on Israel's resolve to dismantle these threats.""

Retired Marine Corps Sergeant Major Steve Aitken, who was stationed on a boat offshore as the injured were transferred to ships for medical treatment following the terrorist attack, told the Washington Post that Aqil's death was ""God's judgment,"" adding, ""You might get away, but you're not going to get by ... Our memory is long. Israel's is even longer.""

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., also stressed the significance of Israel's assassination of Aqil writing on X, ""Ibrahim Aqil was a vicious terrorist mastermind who helped murder hundreds of Americans. On behalf of the families of the Marines killed in the Beirut bombings -- and on behalf of all Americans -- I'm grateful justice has finally been served to this killer.""

Aqil also oversaw Hezbollah's operations in Syria, where he enabled Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad to wipe out hundreds of thousands of his own Arab citizens."

Israel's military says an ""extensive"" wave of airstrikes has hit more than 300 Hezbollah targets Monday as residents of southern Lebanon reportedly are receiving text messages warning them to stay away from buildings where the terrorist group is storing weapons.

The strikes are in response to Hezbollah launching around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel on Sunday following Israeli military operations that resulted in the deaths of multiple top Hezbollah commanders.

""If you are in a building housing weapons for Hezbollah, move away from the village until further notice,"" reads a text message in Arabic that residents of Lebanon have been receiving, according to local media reports cited by the Associated Press.

The Lebanese Health Ministry is asking hospitals in southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa valley to postpone surgeries that could be done later. The ministry said in a statement that its request aimed to keep hospitals ready to deal with people wounded by ""Israel's expanding aggression on Lebanon.""

HEZBOLLAH LAUNCHES ROCKETS AT ISRAEL: 'OPEN-ENDED BATTLE'

Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said Monday's strikes from Israel hit a forested area in the central province of Byblos, about 81 miles north of the Israeli-Lebanese border, for the first time since the exchanges between the two sides began in October, according to the AP. No injuries were reported there.

Israel also bombed targets in the northeastern Baalbek and Hermel regions, where a shepherd was killed and two family members were wounded, the National News Agency said. It added that a total of 30 people were wounded in the strikes.

The Israel Defense Forces said Monday that ""[s]o far over 300 Hezbollah targets have been struck today,"" and that it is ""currently conducting extensive strikes on terror targets belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organization in Lebanon.""

""I repeat and reiterate: Israel does not seek war. But we have the right and the duty to defend our people,"" Israeli President Isaac Herzog wrote on X, sharing a video he claims ""shows how Hezbollah stores and launches missiles in civilian areas and homes.""

""Thousands and thousands of long-range rockets are kept in houses, living rooms, bedrooms, and kitchens, and then launched with the sole intention of killing our people. Would you accept this in your or your neighbor's home?"" Herzog asked. ""What nation would accept its citizens living under such a threat from its neighbors?""

The latest escalation between Israeli forces and Hezbollah comes as Lebanon is still reeling from a series of explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members on Tuesday and Wednesday last week. The explosions killed at least 37 people and wounded about 3,000, according to local officials. The attacks were widely blamed on Israel, which has not confirmed or denied responsibility.

Gen. Anthony Tata breaks down the latest conflicts emerging from the Middle East during an appearance on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.'

Hezbollah fired more than 100 rockets into northern Israel on Sunday in response to a series of Israeli airstrikes on southern Lebanon, pushing both sides closer to the brink of full-scale war.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) airstrikes targeting Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon killed dozens, including one of the group's top commanders, Ibrahim Akil.

Hezbollah's deputy leader, Naim Kassem, said Sunday's rocket attack was just the beginning of what's now an ""open-ended battle"" with Israel.

At Akil's funeral, Kassem vowed Hezbollah would continue military operations against Israel but also warned of unexpected attacks ""from outside the box,"" pointing to rockets fired deeper into Israel.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would take whatever action was necessary to restore security in the north and allow people to return to their homes.

""No country can accept the wanton rocketing of its cities. We can't accept it either,"" he said.

Israel's military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, told reporters the army is prepared to increase pressure on Hezbollah in the coming days, adding, ""We have many capabilities that we have not yet activated.""

ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES CONTINUE ON TERRORIST TARGETS, ROCKET LAUNCHERS IN SOUTHERN LEBANON

The Israeli military said it struck about 400 militant sites, including rocket launchers, across southern Lebanon in the past 24 hours, thwarting an even larger attack.

""Last night, hundreds of thousands of Israelis woke up to rocket sirens as Hezbollah launched over 20 rockets towards northern Israel that left communities in ruins,"" IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani said. ""This attack could have caused much more damage, but we were able to minimize their attack with a preemptive strike on rocket launchers across southern Lebanon.""

The latest tit-for-tat between Israeli forces and Hezbollah comes as Lebanon is still reeling from a wave of explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members on Tuesday and Wednesday. The explosions killed at least 37 people and wounded about 3,000. The attacks were widely blamed on Israel, which hasn't confirmed or denied responsibility.

Israeli forces have been trading fire with Hezbollah fighters almost daily since Oct. 8, the day after Hamas militants stormed into Israel, killing nearly 1,200 people and taking another 250 as hostages. Hezbollah leadership has said its attacks on Israel are in solidarity with its ally Hamas in Gaza.

IDF SAYS KEY HAMAS OPERATIVE KILLED IN GAZA, FOLLOWING CRIPPLING STRIKE ON HEZBOLLAH

The low-level fighting has killed dozens in Israel, hundreds in Lebanon and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the frontier. But the fighting has intensified in recent weeks, with Israel shifting its focus from Gaza to Lebanon. Some have expressed concerns that the fight against Hezbollah will strain resources and complicate prospects for an already elusive cease-fire deal.

Retired Army Brig. Anthony Tata told ""Fox & Friends"" that the conflict would only grow and chided the Biden administration for what he deemed a lack of ""moral clarity.""

""It's critical that Netanyahu keeps his eye on the main fight, which is Hamas, and he eliminates Hamas,"" Tata said. ""The main effort is still Hamas. And I think what they have to do is hold what they've got and hold off Hezbollah until they finish up Hamas, and then they can move to the north and ... destroy Hezbollah. You can't do two things at once equally well.""

Asked Sunday if he was worried about rising tensions in the Middle East, President Biden said, ""Yes, I am.""

""But we're going to do everything we can to keep a wider war from breaking out. And we're still pushing hard,"" Biden added.

Meanwhile, the Israeli military said Sunday it intercepted multiple aerial devices fired from the direction of Iraq after Iran-backed militant groups there claimed to have launched a drone attack on Israel."
Columbia's interim president apologizes to protesters who occupied campus for 'hurt' caused by NYPD,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/columbias-interim-president-apologizes-anti-israel-protesters-hurt-nypd-classes-kick-off,2024-09-22T20:33:46Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The interim president of Columbia University kicked off the new school year by apologizing to anti-Israel protesters on campus who were ""hurt"" by the NYPD when they worked to clear the agitators who descended on the campus last year.

""I know that this is tricky for me to say, but I do understand that I sit in this job, right. And so if you could just let everybody know who was hurt by that, that I'm just incredibly sorry,"" interim university President Katrina Armstrong told student newspaper The Columbia Spectator in her first interview with the outlet since she was named interim president. ""And I know it wasn't me, but I'm really sorry.... I saw it, and I'm really sorry.""

Armstrong became interim president of the elite school last month when Minouche Shafik stepped down as president amid ongoing condemnation of her handling of campus protests last year that often turned violent.

Agitators and student protesters flooded college campuses nationwide last school year to protest the war in Israel, which also included spiking instances of antisemitism and Jewish students publicly speaking out that they don't feel safe on some campuses.

Columbia's campus was notably rocked by student and outside agitators demanding the school completely divest from Israel amid the ongoing war in the Middle East.

Agitators and pro-Hamas demonstrators stormed the university's Hamilton Hall at the end of April, occupying the building for nearly 24 hours before members of the NYPD were granted permission by the university to take it back from the protesters. The officers were overwhelmingly dressed in riot gear to carry out the operation, and ""used electric saws, stun grenades, and other tactical gear to sweep"" the building, according to the student newspaper's report published Thursday.

All in, the NYPD arrested about 200 protesters on Columbia's campus last school year.

""As we face anything, we have to be very committed to the principles, and our principles are our students and are enabling an environment where people can have freedom of expression, and we support debate, and we do those things,"" Armstrong said. ""We have to be committed to our principles in terms of ensuring that our academic activities can continue. And so I think we have to be very clear about that, because that's the commitment I made to our students and to our professors.""

""Why is she apologizing? An apology sends the message that there shouldn't be consequences for breaking the rules,"" Ari Shrage, cofounder of the Columbia Jewish Alumni Association, told the New York Post, calling the remarks ""tone deaf."" ""This is exactly the opposite of what Columbia needs now.""

""Instead of apologizing to the antisemitic protesters, [Armstrong] should be apologizing to the Jewish students for failing to protect them from relentless discrimination and harassment,"" student Maya Cukierman, 19, told the outlet.

Columbia Law School graduate Rory Lancman added that Armstrong kicking off the new school year by apologizing is an ""ominous sign for Columbia's dwindling cohort of Jewish students.""

Columbia University officials told the New York Post when asked about Armstrong's interview apologizing to those ""hurt"" by the NYPD that the interim chief ""remains committed to ensuring everyone at the university feels safe and respected as we rebuild and heal this year.""

A senior U.S. official confirmed to Fox News this week that Israel is behind the explosions of pagers used by members of Hezbollah in Lebanon. Fetterman was asked if he agreed with Sanders' criticisms.

""No. Not at all. I want to be very clear, I thought what Israel chose to do about blowing up the pagers, walkie-talkies and then after targeting and eliminating membership and leadership of Hezbollah, I absolutely support that. In fact, if anything, I love it,"" Fetterman responded.

HEZBOLLAH PAGERS THAT EXPLODED WERE MADE IN HUNGARY, TAIWANESE COMPANY SAYS

""And Israel demonstrated that they will not allow terrorists not to be held accountable, and I fully support that and it's not about nothing, like what my colleague has said,"" Fetterman said.

Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., took aim at Israel following the pager attacks.

""Israel's pager attack in Lebanon detonated thousands of handheld devices across of a [sic] slew of public spaces, seriously injuring and killing innocent civilians,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote on social media.

""This attack clearly and unequivocally violates international humanitarian law and undermines US efforts to prevent a wider conflict. Congress needs a full accounting of the attack, including an answer from the State Department as to whether any U.S. assistance went into the development or deployment of this technology,"" Ocasio-Cortez continued.

Israel's foreign intelligence agency, Mossad, planted explosives inside 5,000 pagers imported by Hezbollah months before Tuesday's and Wednesday's detonations, a senior defense official confirmed to Fox News.

Sanders introduced a pair of joint resolutions that would block U.S. arms sales to Israel.

The Biden administration in August approved a series of arms sales totaling $20 billion to Israel, including ""several systems that are directly tied to tens of thousands of civilian deaths in Gaza,"" according to Sanders.

"UN chief defends UNRWA, says only 'a few elements' participated in Oct. 7",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/un-chief-defends-unrwa-says-only-a-few-elements-participated-oct-7,2024-09-22T17:43:01Z,"UN Watch executive director Hillel Neuer unpacks his perspective on the United Nations Relief and Works Agency amid allegations of terror ties against agency employees.

U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres defended the UNRWA's operations in Gaza on Sunday, saying only ""a few elements"" of the organization were affiliated with Hamas.

Israeli ambassador to the U.N. Danny Danon claimed last week that the UNRWA is completely taken over by Hamas. Guterres has admitted that Hamas ""infiltrated"" the organization, but said during a Sunday appearance on CNN that there is no evidence behind Israel's claims.

""The fact is there was an infiltration with a few elements that indeed participated in the 7th of October,"" Guterres said, condemning the action.

""A lot of things have been invented that do not correspond at all to the truth,"" he continued. ""Of course there are tunnels below the premises of UNRWA, as there are tunnels everywhere in Gaza. But there has never been any commitment of UNRWA in general to provide any kind of support to Hamas.""

ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER: 'DOZENS' OF UNRWA STAFF TOOK PART IN HAMAS' OCT 7 MASSACRE

Meanwhile, Israel has doubled down on its accusations regarding UNRWA. Danon accused Guterres and the U.N. of ""burying its head in the sand"" on the issue. Danon himself was defending an Israeli airstrike that hit the UNRWA al-Jaouni school in a Gaza refugee camp last week.

DOSSIER REVEALS INFORMATION USED TO EXPLAIN UN AGENCY'S DEEP TIES TO HAMAS IN GAZA

""Those who were killed in the IDF strike were nine terrorists with blood on their hands, and some of them participated in the barbaric massacre on October 7. In case there are still any doubts, there are the names of the Hamas terrorists who were at the school compound disguised as 'local UNRWA employees,'"" he Danon said.

The school, which was not operational, was being used as a Hamas command and control center, according to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).

Just last month, Fox News Digital reported that UNRWA was forced to fire nine employees because of their likely involvement in Hamas's slaughter of nearly 1,200 people on Oct. 7 in southern Israel.

The U.S. suspended funding to UNRWA because of the role some of its employees played in the Oct. 7 massacre. President Biden had initially restarted aid to the controversy-hit agency upon assuming office after former President Trump's decision to defund the organization in 2018.

The rapper Macklemore told a crowd of Seattle concertgoers ""F--- America,"" according to video of his recent ""Palestine Will Live Forever"" performance shared on X.

""Straight up, say it. I'm not gonna stop you. I'm not gonna stop you,"" Macklemore said, appearing to reference chants from the crowd.

""Yeah, F--- America,"" the Grammy-winning performer said, sending the crowd into cheers. The video was shared on X by journalist Cam Higby.

Macklemore, a 41-year-old rapper born Benjamin Hammond Haggerty in Kent, Washington, had advertised a ""Palestine Will Live Forever Festival"" on his Facebook page.

RAPPER MACKLEMORE CALLS OUT BIDEN, POLICE AND MUSIC INDUSTRY IN NEW PRO-PALESTINIAN SONG

He said the proceeds of the event held at Seward Park Amphitheater would go to various groups, including the controversial agency known as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).

Israeli officials have declared that UNRWA is strongly tied to Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The U.N. itself announced in August that nine UNRWA staffers would be fired due to possible involvement in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel.

Fox News digital reached out to representatives for Macklemore for comment, but they did not immediately respond.

Macklemore dropped an anti-Israel song in May titled ""Hind's Hall,"" referring to the Columbia University building that students occupied and renamed in honor of a 6-year-old Palestinian girl killed in the Israel-Gaza war. The song praised the anti-Israel encampments and protests on college campuses across the country and called out President Biden, the police and the music industry.

The rapper this month dropped a second version of the song that now calls out Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democratic presidential nominee when Biden backed out of the race in July.

Macklemore seems to threaten that Harris will lose support in the battleground state of Michigan, which has a large Arab and Muslim community in Dearborn, for supporting Israel.

""Hey Kamala, I don't know if you listening but stop sending the money and weapons or you ain't winning Michigan. We uncommitted and hell no we ain't switching positions because the whole world turn Palestinian,"" the song says.

The music video shared on X shows a clip of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Mich., when those lyrics play. The song also includes the antisemitic chant, ""From the river to the sea,"" which calls for the elimination of Israel.

Macklemore, who has an estimated net worth of $25 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth, also declares in the second version of the song, ""Capitalism killing us, that's something we can't afford"" and sings, ""There will never be freedom by pleading with Zionists.""

Macklemore has increasingly weighed in on conflicts in the Middle East. Last month, he canceled an upcoming October concert in Dubai over the United Arab Emirates' role ""in the ongoing genocide and humanitarian crisis"" in Sudan through its reported support of the paramilitary force that's been fighting government troops there, according to The Associated Press.

The Israel Defense Forces said Sunday morning it was conducting retaliatory strikes against the Iranian-backed terror group Hezbollah in Lebanon.

This comes after the IDF says Hezbollah launched about 115 aerial attacks towards civilian areas in northern Israel over the span of a few hours.

The IDF said its defensive arrays are deployed in northern Israel and are on high preparedness to thwart threats targeting the area. Air defense systems had intercepted multiple projectiles over Haifa, Israel.

The military said strikes will continue and will intensify against Hezbollah.

The IDF also said the Israeli Air Force conducted a precise strike on Hamas terrorists in a compound in the northern Gaza Strip.

Before the strike, the IDF says numerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harm to civilians, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence information.

Israel's Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant spoke with U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin several times over the weekend about developments in northern Israel.

Gallant briefed Austin on the precise operation conducted by the IDF to take out the head of Hezbollah's operations unit and commander of the Radwan Forces, Ibrahim Aqil, who is a senior Hezbollah leader and planner of several terror attacks against Israel and who is also wanted by the U.S. for the killing of its citizens.

The minister also talked about Israel's defensive position and operations against the ongoing strikes by Hezbollah against northern cities and civilian areas in Israel. He said the goal is to ensure Israel's northern communities can return to their homes.

""Real Time"" host Bill Maher had some harsh words for Vice President Kamala Harris, insisting she was ""full of s---"" when it comes to her Middle East policy.

During Friday's panel discussion, Maher addressed what's widely believed to be Israel's stealth operation against Hezbollah in Lebanon by detonating their pagers and walkie-talkies this week that led to dozens of terrorist operatives killed and hundreds more injured.

""Here's what Kamala Harris said this week about what we should do when the war is over: 'No reoccupation of Gaza,' 'no changing of the territorial lines of Gaza' and an 'ability to have security in the region for all concerned in a way that we create stability.' I feel like if that's what you have to say, don't say anything. Just shut up,"" Maher reacted.

""I mean, everybody who talks about Israel these days is just so full of s---."" Maher said. ""'I don't want children to die.' Duh. Who does? None of us want children to die. None of us want this war to go on, but it's not addressing what the problem is.""

He continued, ""The problem is that one side wants a two-state solution, or at least always did. It's a little more right-wing now, I'm talking about Israel, but that still has been their position. One side never did and still doesn't. One side uses terrorism to get their goals. One side retaliates against terrorism. One side is accused of genocide, but doesn't do it. The other side actually would love to do it. People keep saying Israel has the right to defend itself, and then whatever Israel does, they object to it.""

BILL MAHER HYPES TAYLOR SWIFT'S ENDORSEMENT OF KAMALA HARRIS: SHE HAS 'SAVED DEMOCRACY'

Despite his scolding, the liberal comedian is not only backing Harris ahead of the November election, he's already predicting her victory following her debate performance against former President Trump.

""I'm gonna make this a very momentous night with a prediction,"" Maher said last week. ""Because I have the credibility for this prediction, because I had been called a 'Trump alarmist' for a very long time. They were wrong, I was right- he wasn't gonna leave power. But ever since then and since the [Access Hollywood] tape... and he survived that. Every time he's done crazy s--- and gotten himself in trouble, I said 'No, no. It's not over.'""

A Democrat from a crucial swing state vowed to support former President Donald Trump in November over his stance on Israel, arguing the endorsement of a pro-Jewish president is critical for the existence of the community.

Steve Rosenberg, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, argued there is only ""one candidate"" for Jewish voters during ""America's Newsroom,"" warning far-left Democrats are working against their cause to support Iran instead.

ISRAEL BEHIND LEBANON PAGER ATTACK TARGETING HEZBOLLAH, SENIOR US OFFICIAL SAYS

""If you're a Jew, if you're pro-Israel, there's only one candidate here,"" Rosenberg told Dana Perino. ""Actions speak louder than words. Kamala Harris has surrounded herself with some of the worst Jew haters that there are. Maher Bitar... Philip Gordon, Ilan Goldenberg's got a nice name, but if you look at their records, they are pro-Iran. They are not pro-Israel.""

""To me, all the other issues that are on the table, whether you be climate-oriented, abortion-oriented, whatever your orientation is, if you are not focused on being a Jew and being pro-Israel right now, we are in the fight for our literal lives,"" he continued.

""And all those issues won't be there if we're dead in four years. They're trying to kill us.""

Vice President Kamala Harris has largely been vague on her stance regarding the war in Israel, although she did address the issue while speaking at the National Association of Black Journalists in Philadelphia this week.

""We need to get this deal done, and we need to get it done immediately,"" Harris said.

""One of the things that we have done that I am entirely supportive of is the pause that we've put on the 2,000-pound bombs, and so there is some leverage that we have had and used,"" she continued. ""But ultimately, the thing that is going to unlock everything else in that region is getting this deal done.""

It was unclear what deal Harris was referring to. Rosenberg suggested she was ""out of her mind"" for possibly suggesting a two-state solution, while Perino mentioned she could have been referring to the hostage deal.

HEZBOLLAH PAGERS THAT EXPLODED WERE MADE IN HUNGARY, TAIWANESE COMPANY SAYS

Meanwhile, Rosenberg argued some Jewish voters are reluctant to publicly declare their support for the former president.

A Fox News Poll from this week indicated Trump has gained steam with voters who value the outcome of the war in Gaza.

Of those surveyed, 52% of voters trust Trump to do a better job in handling the Israel-Hamas war, as opposed to 45% who trust Harris.

""Some are afraid to say that they're going to support Donald Trump for whatever the reasons are,"" Rosenberg said. ""And there are some that still say things like, 'I would never vote for a Republican. I would never vote for Donald Trump.' They're worried about what happened on January 6th, which is insanity to me, because they're not worried about what happens in the country every single day, which is 10 times worse than January 6th.""

""If you are a Jew and you are worried and not worried about your literal existence, then I don't know what else to tell you,"" he continued.

""President Trump proved that he stood with the Jews. He stood with the Israelis. I just came back from Israel. Every single Israeli that I met, and I know a lot of them, has said to me, 'Please vote for Donald Trump. Please vote for Donald Trump,' every single solitary one.""

Trump courted Jewish voters Thursday with a speech to the Israeli-American Council summit in Washington, D.C.

""It's total annihilation ... You have a big protector in me. You don't have a protector on the other side,"" he said."
Children once held hostage still working through trauma: 'Are they coming for us again?',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/health/children-held-hostage-working-trauma-coming-us-again,2024-09-21T08:41:01Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Dr. Efrat Bron-Harlev, CEO of Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, recently addressed the United Nations about the plight of the children who were kidnapped from Israel by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023.

She said that 38 of the 253 people who were abducted that day were children. The youngest was Kfir Bibas, just eight months old at the time.

The child is still in captivity, along with his parents, Yarden and Shiri Bibas, and his brother, Ariel, who turned five last month.

THRIVING WITH ANXIETY: EXPERT TIPS ON EMBRACING THE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION

Bron-Harlev, a pediatrician, said children released after 50 days in captivity are still, to this day, waking up terrified in the middle of the night.

""They were not allowed to cry, not allowed to laugh, not even allowed to stand up.""

She said the children appeared ""like shadows of children. No impressions on their faces. They were not happy. They were not crying. They were mostly very, very silent.""

Dr. Hagai Levine, chair of the Israeli Association of Public Health and head physician of the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, also reported seeing children being afraid to speak.

""In captivity, they were told, 'If you speak, you will be killed' -- that's very, very traumatizing,"" he told Fox News Digital.

In addition to psychological trauma, the hostages were also in extreme physical danger.

Levine, who is also an epidemiologist, said the risks to the hostages' lives ranged from the threat of ""being murdered to lack of food to lack of oxygen, lack of water (and) infectious diseases.""

Referencing the recent polio outbreak in Gaza, Levine noted that he sent a letter to UNICEF and the World Health Organization reminding the organizations ""that every child has a right to health -- and this includes Kfir and Ariel Bibas.""

Levine said he was on a bus this summer with children who were formerly hostages as well as children who are relatives of hostages.

""They have the unique ability to cope.""

The young ones attended a U.S. summer camp in July, he said.

""A couple of people called me a White supremacist. A couple of people called me the N-word.""

""I saw songs and jokes,"" he said, recalling his observations. ""I'm not saying they were happy, but they have the unique ability to cope.""

The doctor said he knows these children have had to grow up quickly -- but the ""plasticity of the brain"" helps children rehabilitate, he said.

He said he has encouraged them to play and dance.

However, ""there is always a shadow"" holding them back, he said -- given that at this moment, there are still other hostages held captive.

Levine said these children grew up in a tight-knit community of a kibbutz -- and seeing hostage posters everywhere of their neighbors is very real to them.

""It's really difficult for them to really recover,"" he said.

SEVERE BURNS REPORTED IN CHILDREN MAKING TIKTOK-FRIENDLY GLASS FRUIT IN MICROWAVE

It is a long process to get these children to be able to trust again, Levine said, and they need someone who is a constant in their lives, especially if their parents were murdered.

He said physical, psychological and educational rehabilitation, such as speech therapy and equine therapy, can help them to regain trust and feel in control.

They ""have been in this horrible nightmare"" for nearly a year.

He also noted that relatives of the hostages are experiencing survivor guilt, severe depression, anxiety, insomnia and physical symptoms such as tremors.

They are traumatized because they don't know what happened to their loved ones, and they ""have been in this horrible nightmare"" for nearly a year at this point, he said.

Roxanne Saar, the aunt of released hostage Gali Tarshansky, age 13, told Fox News Digital, ""I feel like it could have been me.""

Saar had been staying at her father-in-law's home at Kibbutz Be'eri on Oct. 6, 2023, when she decided to return home that night.

LACK OF SLEEP POSES CONCERNING RISK FOR KIDS, STUDY FINDS

The next day, 101 civilians at Be'eri were killed by Hamas terrorists and 32 people were kidnapped, according to JNS (Jewish News Syndicate).

Gali Tarshansky's brother, Lior, 15, and her uncle, Noy Shosh, 36, were among the murdered victims.

Saar said that the first question the young teenager asked when she was released from captivity after 54 days was, ""Where is Lior?""

It was not until after she returned to Israel that she discovered her brother and uncle had been killed, along with her dog, Mocha, as well as friends she grew up with from her kibbutz.

She was held hostage in homes in Gaza with Nova festival survivors and a couple from Kibbutz Be'eri. The husband, Ohad Ben Ami, is still a hostage, Saar said.

""There was no showering, there was no water.""

Saar said that in Gaza, ""there was not enough food, there was not enough medicine, there was no showering, there was no water ... There was psychological terror.""

ISRAELI SOLDIER GRAVELY INJURED IN OCT. 7 TERROR ATTACK FINDS NEW FAITH, OFFERS HOPE TO OTHERS

She said the young woman's captors, some of whom were armed, told her, ""Israel does not exist. Your family doesn't want you anymore.'""

Saar added, ""I'm not sure if we know everything ... I don't have any expectations from terrorists who are capable of kidnapping a 13-year-old girl.""

It is crucial, she said, for the remaining hostages to be freed in order for the released hostages to heal.

Saar said Gali Tarshansky is living in a different area of Israel today, attending a new school. She is in therapy.

Said Saar, ""I don't think there is anyone in the world who can understand the potential future impact of what happened ... Everybody wants to help, but how can someone help with something that we never knew before?""

Professor Merev Roth, PhD, an analyst who works with the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, told Fox News Digital that therapists who are treating released hostages are in uncharted territory.

""Will he come back when I'm really old?""

""All of this is new,"" she said. ""There is not one case in history that so many kids and families were kidnapped from their houses for such a long time and in such a brutal massacre.""

Roth is one of the founders of First Line Med (FLM), an organization that offers pro bono treatment to victims of Oct. 7.

SURVIVOR OF HAMAS TERROR ATTACK ON ISRAEL RECOUNTS PAIN, GRIEF OF LOSING 'ANGEL' BOYFRIEND ON OCT. 7

She supervises child therapists and treats adult family members of child hostages who were released after 50 or 54 days in captivity.

Roth said she had to treat some of the families in their homes or hotels initially, because they were afraid to go outside.

She recalled seeing how frightened a three-and-a-half-year old toddler was when the child heard a gardener working outside.

""I remember the girl running into her mother's body, and her mother immediately took her in her arms. The girl didn't say a word. She was white, she was shaking, she didn't even cry,"" Roth said.

Another time, when the little girl heard noises outside, Roth said the girl asked, ""Are they coming for us again?""

Roth said another child released from captivity is unable to get through a full day of school in kindergarten.

Her father is still a hostage, and Roth said she knows he is in danger and asks her mother, ""Is Father dead? Will he come back when I'm really old?""

Roth said the children who were separated from their parents in captivity, or witnessed family members being murdered or wounded, ""shattered in the most extreme, brutal way"" a child's sense of safety and trust in the world.

""They become easily frustrated, angry and disassociated.""

Some children had captors who were abusive and threatening; other hostages experienced Stockholm Syndrome, where they identified with their captor, Roth said.

JEWISH COOKING 'GODMOTHER' RECREATES VIVID FAMILY MEMORIES AND 'SENSE OF BELONGING' THROUGH FOOD

Antisemitism spreading across the globe is ""a big blow,"" said Roth. ""It added to the feelings that the world went crazy, that everything is distorted.""

She said these children are suffering from ""trauma syndrome symptoms,"" such as anxiety, depression, sleeping disorders and social withdrawal.

They become easily frustrated, angry and disassociated, which means ""you are disconnected from your emotional response ... You become confused. You cannot concentrate and you don't react emotionally in your full scope. You are a bit numb,"" she said.

Dissociation can also be self-protective, Roth noted.

""It takes a long time until they come back into their senses, which is a good thing, because their psyche protects them from feeling all that they would feel if they were connected, and it would be overwhelming for them.""

""They do find any channel they can to be smiling and friendly and cooperative. They're really trying ... They are amazing in their coping, but they are injured.""

Play therapy, she said, enables children to reenact real experiences through imaginary scenarios, and gives therapists insight into their inner thoughts.

""You can see the split of the world into total good and total bad creatures fighting each other ... I see complete evil, revenge, abuse and angels,"" she said.

""You can also see the other side ... life saviors that came from nowhere to save them.""

He also wrote a touching story with his therapist about a family of kittens who had been kidnapped and were found. Roth said that the child told his therapist, ""Now we can finish therapy, because the kitties are back home.""

"Social media erupts after president throws to Jill Biden to speak at Cabinet meeting: 'All yours, kid'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/social-media-erupts-after-president-throws-jill-biden-speak-cabinet-meeting-all-yours-kid,2024-09-21T00:17:34Z,"President Biden speaks about Israel-Lebanon tensions and chances of a cease-fire in Gaza.

Social media erupted after First Lady Jill Biden presented at what may be one of President Biden's final Cabinet meetings in the White House.

Biden convened his Cabinet on Friday for the first time since Oct. 2, 2023 - this time with the first lady joining him to speak about the White House Initiative on Women's Health Research.

The president explained Jill Biden's presence there, saying, ""Here and across previous administrations, first ladies have attended these meetings for specific reasons. This is the first time Jill has joined us, and it goes to show how important the issue is, which she is about to speak to.""

He concluded by handing off to his wife, saying, ""It's all yours, kid.""

FLASHBACK: BIDEN'S CABINET DOUBLES DOWN ON SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT FOLLOWING DEBATE

The New York Post reported that Jill Biden, seated at the head of the Cabinet Room's board table, ""read from a binder about maternal health initiatives for four-and-a-half minutes after her husband spoke for just two minutes off the top of the meeting.""

The president traditionally sits at the center of the table with Cabinet members seated in order of the founding of their departments. The last sitting first lady to attend her husband's Cabinet meeting appears to be Hillary Clinton.

The amount of influence the first lady has over Joe Biden, and therefore his administration, has been a frequent source of controversy, and numerous commentators took to social media to criticize her presence at the meeting.

The New York Post said that Jill Biden is ""considered by insiders to be the most influential first lady since Edith Wilson, who tightly controlled access to her husband, President Woodrow Wilson, after he suffered a debilitating stroke in October 1919.""

Digital strategist Greg Price referenced this comparison, saying, ""She's literally Edith Wilson except right out in the open in a 24/7 news cycle and nobody in the media cares.""

""Wow. A visibly exhausted Joe Biden just held a full Cabinet meeting for the first time in 11 months and immediately turned the mic over to his wife, Jill,"" previous adviser to former President Donald Trump Steve Cortes said. He went on to ask, ""Who is running the country?""

Political commentator Kate Hyde observed, ""Jill Biden is kicking off the first cabinet meeting the White House has had in almost a year and we're expected to act like this is normal.""

""Jill Biden is the head of the table at the cabinet meeting. No one voted for her to be there... this must be part of her deal to have Joe drop out of the race,"" podcaster Tim Young speculated. ""She has no reason to be there.""

'ACCESS GRANTED': BIDEN'S FREE VACATION AT FRIEND'S CALIFORNIA MANSION DRAWS IRE OF CRITICS

The co-founder of The Federalist, Sean Davis, sarcastically quipped, ""I wasn't aware that our constitutional system of government bestowed any power whatsoever to the unelected wife of the figurehead president.""

""It's insane that the world's #1 nuclear superpower just sort of stumbled its way into a power vacuum,"" The Hill columnist T. Becket Adams mused. ""It's even more insane that the vacuum has been filled by the former ruler's wife, who holds no legal governing authority.""

""Is this real?"" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., asked. ""Is this who's running the country""?

""Before President Biden updated his cabinet and the country on the continued achievements of the most successful administration in modern history, he asked the First Lady to join for the top of the meeting to showcase groundbreaking work they are leading to fundamentally change how we fund and approach women's health research,"" White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates told Fox News Digital.

""If the only response these critics have are conspiracy theories that devalue historic progress researching women's health - including terrible diseases - then that says a lot about why more and more American women feel that the right couldn't care less about them, including as it pushes radical abortion bans,"" he added, while also making a dig about Hawley running out of the Capitol on Jan. 6."
"After repeated promises from Biden administration that a cease-fire is close, war in Middle East is escalating",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/repeated-promises-biden-administration-cease-fire-close-war-middle-east-escalating,2024-09-20T19:42:42Z,"The IDF said the targets were ready to be used 'in the immediate future' to fire into Israeli territory. (IDF)

After months of public optimism about the prospects of a ceasefire, Biden administration officials have soured on the prospects of an end to the war between Israel and Hamas.

""We aren't any closer to that now than we were even a week ago,"" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby admitted to reporters on Wednesday. He called the prospects of a completed deal ""daunting.""

""No deal is imminent,"" one U.S. official told The Wall Street Journal. ""I'm not sure it ever gets done.""

Israelis point the finger at Hamas for killing six hostages earlier this month, including a U.S. citizen. Arab officials lay blame on Israel for explosive pagers and walkie-talkies and airstrikes aimed at killing Hezbollah fighters for making the prospect of a multi-front war more likely.

""There's no chance now of it happening,"" an Arab official said after the recent campaign against Hezbollah. ""Everyone is in a wait-and-see mode until after the election. The outcome will determine what can happen in the next administration.""

For Biden, a former chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who ran on his diplomacy chops, failure to secure a deal would be a blow to his legacy. It would mean a presidency bookended by a chaotic pullout from Afghanistan at the start and the false hope that peace -- and the return of some 250 hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7 -- was just around the corner after the outbreak of war in the Middle East.

Along with the recent attacks on Hezbollah, officials cited another main reason for pessimism to the Journal: the number of Palestinian prisoners that Israel would be asked to release to bring home its hostages.

Joel Rubin, former deputy assistant secretary of state, told Fox News Digital he's less pessimistic about the potential for a deal.

""Nobody's walked away from the table. They haven't stated they're done. Qatar and Egypt are still partnering with us on these talks. The three-stage agreed-upon framework is still in place,"" he said.

""The hangups are on the implementation side, not the framework side,"" he said, noting that negotiations as far as which prisoners will be released, how their safety will be guaranteed and what to do with Hamas Leader Yahya Sinwar remain open-ended.

ISRAEL STRIKES HEZBOLLAH TARGETS IN LEBANON

""These implementation issues keep coming up,"" he said. ""That's where you keep hearing Hamas growing its demands, adding new names, expecting more. And that's where you hear Israel, you know, calling for the Philadelphia corridor, which suddenly has dropped out of the discussion, right? They both want more and more advantage and gains on their side, which is why negotiators are exasperated.""

While the Biden administration continues to try to find ways forward on a deal, public comments that have strung along hope for months are now conflicted by some of the privately held sentiment that cease-fire efforts are futile.

On July 19, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said a cease-fire deal was within sight.

""I believe we're inside the 10-yard line and driving toward the goal line in getting an agreement that would produce a cease-fire, get the hostages home and put us on a better track to trying to build lasting peace and stability,"" Blinken said.

On Aug. 17, President Biden said he was ""optimistic"" a deal could be reached. ""We are closer than we've ever been,"" he said, adding that he was sending Blinken to Israel to continue ""intensive efforts to conclude this agreement.""

On Aug. 19, Blinken said that Israel had ""accepted a proposal"" and the next step was for Hamas to agree.

""The next important statement is for Hamas to say 'yes,' and then, in the coming days, for all of the expert negotiators to get together to work on clear understandings on implementing the agreement,"" Blinken said at a press conference in Tel Aviv.

HOW DID THE HEZBOLLAH PAGER EXPLOSIONS HAPPEN? 5 THINGS TO KNOW

""This is a decisive moment, probably the best, maybe the last opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a cease-fire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security.""

But those comments came one day after Hamas had said it would not agree to that proposal. They objected to Israel having control of the Rafah and Philadelphia corridors, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had demanded.

Then again on Sept. 2, Biden claimed the U.S. was ""very close"" to finalizing a cease-fire deal that would see the release of hostages. Asked why he was optimistic despite other deals having failed, he said, ""Hope springs eternal.""

Even this week, Blinken expressed optimism about a deal, though he warned after the pager blasts that ""escalation"" threatens to thwart progress.

""It's imperative that all parties refrain from any actions that could escalate the conflict,"" Blinken said at a news conference in Egypt.

He said he was focused on a deal that would bring calm on all fronts, including Israel's northern border with Lebanon. Blinken said that 15 out of 18 paragraphs of a deal had been agreed by all sides.

He blamed long wait times for messages to be passed between the parties for leaving space to disrupt the talks.

""We've seen that in the intervening time, you might have an event, an incident -- something that makes the process more difficult, that threatens to slow it, stop it, derail it -- and anything of that nature, by definition, is probably not good in terms of achieving the result that we want, which is the cease-fire,"" Blinken said.

After Egypt, he went to Paris to discuss the prospects of a deal with his European counterparts.

U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan met Wednesday with the relatives of the seven remaining U.S. hostages held in Gaza, where the families said they ""expressed frustration with the lack of tangible progress"" to Sullivan.

On Thursday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a televised address called the pager attacks ""a declaration of war"" and that attacks against Israel would continue until the war with Gaza is over. Likewise, Israel's defense minister vowed to continue striking Hezbollah in Lebanon, aiming to stop the group's rocket and missile attacks so some 70,000 Israelis who live in the northern border region could return home."

The Israel Defense Forces confirmed a targeted missile strike was made Friday on Beirut, the capital city of Lebanon.

Security officials claim the airstrike was targeting Ibrahim Aqil, a member of terrorist group Hezbollah's Jihad Council.

""Today, Israel eliminated [Aqil] with a surgical airstrike in Beirut,"" the Israeli government posted on social media. ""Justice is served.""

ISRAEL STRIKES HEZBOLLAH TARGETS IN LEBANON AFTER TWO ROUNDS OF DEVICE EXPLOSIONS

Aqil is wanted by the United States for his alleged role in the bombing of a U.S. Marines barracks in Beirut in 1983. He is also believed to be linked to the taking of American hostages in Lebanon during the 1980s.

Israeli officials released an announcement hours later stating that the ""IAF aircraft conducted a targeted, intelligence-based strike in the area of Beirut, and eliminated Ibrahim Aqil, the Head of Hezbollah's Operations Unit and the Commander of Hezbollah's elite Radwan Forces, who was also in charge of Hezbollah's 'Conquer the Galilee' attack plan.""

Hezbollah officials have confirmed the missile struck a Dahiya district building that Aqil is believed to have been in.

The strike killed at least nine individuals and wounded approximately 60 others, according to Lebanese health officials. Two apartment buildings were flattened by the blast.

""During the strike, senior operatives in Hezbollah's Operations Staff and commanders from the Radwan Unit were eliminated alongside Aqil,"" the announcement continued. ""Ibrahim Aqil and the Radwan commanders who were eliminated today were planning Hezbollah's 'Conquer the Galilee' attack plan, in which Hezbollah intended to infiltrate Israeli communities and murder innocent civilians.""

At least 200 University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill students and staff participated in an anti-Israel walkout led by UNC Students for Justice in Palestine on Thursday, according to the school's student newspaper.

The Daily Tar Heel reported that the ""Walk out for the West Bank"" featured protesters walking in and out of various buildings around campus while spray-painting messages such as ""Free Gaza,"" ""F -- K UNC"" and ""Israel is a terror state.""

""There were several speeches demanding that the University reject Israel and the brutalization of students. Protesters chanted phrases like ""disclose, divest, we will not stop, we will not rest,"" as they walked through Halls,"" the Daily Tar Heel reported.

(Courtesy New York Post)

A Cornell University professor who was accused of ""justifying terror"" after describing Hamas' bloody Oct. 7 operation in Southern Israel as ""exhilarating"" is coming under fire again for taking part in an anti-Israel march on the college campus this week, when protesters could be heard chanting ""long live the intifada"" before crashing a career fair.

Russell Rickford, an associate professor of history at Cornell University, was seen on video with a keffiyeh around his shoulders marching with dozens of anti-Israel supporters on campus Wednesday.

Some of the protesters, many of whom wore face masks and were also clad in keffiyehs, carried Palestinian flags and signs reading, ""Cornell divest from genocide"" and ""defund genocide.""

CORNELL PROFESSOR WHO WAS 'EXHILARATED' AFTER HAMAS ATTACK ISSUES APOLOGY FOR 'REPREHENSIBLE' REMARKS

The boisterous, pan-banging protesters eventually disrupted a career fair at the Statler Hotel on campus, as Rickford could be seen on video looking on and clapping his hands outside.

School officials said the demonstrators pushed past school police officers, although it does not appear that Rickford was part of the group that burst into the career fair.

""Guests of the university felt threatened. And students were denied their ability to experience the career fair,"" Joel Malina, the vice president of university relations at Cornell said in a statement. ""This behavior is unacceptable, a violation of university policy, and illegal.""

One Jewish student told the New York Post that the instructor's presence at the protest was ""insane"" and another accused him of ""emboldening hate."" Video shows the group chanting, ""long live the intifada."" Intifada is an Arabic word for a rebellion or uprising, or a resistance movement.

Rickford, who specializes in African American political culture, was roundly condemned last year when he made inflammatory comments about Hamas' sneak terror attack that killed 1,200 people and led to the current war in Gaza.

""It was exhilarating, it was energizing.... I was exhilarated,"" Rickford said at the time. He later walked back the comments and apologized, describing the speech as ""reprehensible.""

The self-identified ""secular Marxist"" eventually went on leave amid the media firestorm over his comments about the Hamas killing spree against hundreds of civilians, including American citizens, but he has now returned to the college.

Amanda Silberstain, vice president of Chabad and Cornellians for Israel, an Israel advocacy group on campus, said Rickford marched with students to the Statler Hotel but is unsure if he went inside.

""He was wearing a keffiyeh and smiling. Rickford knows he's immune from consequences,"" Sillberstein told the Post. ""We have a professor who is promoting antisemitic narratives and emboldening hate.""

DIVERSITY PROFESSOR ACCUSED OF VERBALLY ATTACKING STUDENTS AFTER TERRORISM REMARK CLEARED OF ANY WRONGDOING

Malina said that students who violated university policies during the protest would be referred to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards for ""immediate action including suspension"" while faculty and staff would be referred to human resources.

""These individuals will also be subject to potential criminal charges,"" Malina said.

Cornell provided Fox News Digital with a prior statement from Molina when asked for comment about Rickford's latest actions.

""Last October, Professor Russel Rickford made a horrific comment at an off-campus rally in downtown Ithaca. As then-President Pollack and Board Chair Kayser noted at the time, his comment was reprehensible and demonstrated a complete disregard for humanity. Professor Rickford apologized for his comments and took a voluntary leave of absence for the remainder of the academic year.""

""Consistent with well-established principles of academic freedom, Cornell has a process for considering whether public statements such as those expressed off campus by Professor Rickford at a political rally fall under the category of protected speech, or rather demonstrate prohibited bias, discrimination, or harassment. Given that Professor Rickford's comments were made as a private citizen in his free time, the university's academic leadership has concluded that Professor Rickford's conduct in relation to this incident did not meet that high bar.""

Fox News Digital was unable to reach Rickford for comment.

Rickford's comments on political violence go as far back as a decade.

In two videos reviewed by Fox News Digital, one from 2021 and another from 2014, Rickford discussed his desire for an anti-racist ""insurgent"" group to take power in the United States. In one of the videos, he said some White people are ready to commit ""race suicide"" and went on to discuss the ""politics of violence"" while simultaneously attacking the ideals of civility.

During a webinar hosted on a Cornell platform in February 2021, Rickford endorsed ""radical frameworks for anti-racism."" The radical frameworks call for a fundamental revolutionary change in society to change the distribution of wealth in neo-Marxist fashion.

""Radical anti-racists ... knew justice required not ... dialogue ... but genuine reallocations of resources and power. Attacking the roots of White supremacy meant challenging the normal operations of capitalism.""

Rickford has also said that the Black Lives Matter movement ""reflects this more ... redistributive mode of anti-racism,"" adding that ""What we need is not more civil dialogue [but] more insurgent popular anti-racist movements that fight the whole apparatus of oppression."""

""I think right now it's kind of heading in a negative direction because I feel like everyone's lost hope,"" said Marina, who added that maybe after the presidential election the country can ""aim for something positive"" once the next president is elected.

Lily from the University of Tennessee said it is currently a very divisive time for the country and added that former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are ""complete polar opposites.""

""I think it's really hard to have that conversation with people and kind of have a peaceful conversation about disagreements,"" she said. ""I hope we're going in the right direction. I do enjoy this country. I love the freedoms that we have, and I hope they stay protected.""

However, several said that they are hopeful for their own personal futures, even if they're not as bullish on the country's.

""I would say I'm optimistic. I mean, anything can happen. I'm very optimistic about my future,"" Noah told Fox News Digital. ""But in terms of this country as a whole, I'm pessimistic.""

""I think the US has done a good job at staying like a superpower country and being able to regain control and taking and taking care of the population. So I am optimistic, but more in the long term rather than short term,"" Marina, the NYU student, said.

""I hope everything goes well, and we continue to just be a good country and everybody can find a place of belonging. And, you know, there's a reason why people like to come here,"" Lily said.

Students expressed concerns about the state of the economy and the cost of education.

""I think in a lot of ways also, like with the economy, it's not looking too good,"" said NYU student Arriena, who added, ""in a lot of ways we are progressing when it comes to inclusion and opening ourselves up to new ideals.""

Lily said, ""It would be nice to have decreased prices and everything and just help people to actually be able to afford to live.""

""Lack of engagement in education just really creates a downward spiral,"" said Kevin. ""I think that it is most important for the future that we do everything we can to empower and encourage the next generation.""

Voters on college campuses in Washington, D.C, Milwaukee, Detroit and Houston cited the economy, immigration and foreign policy as their top issues in interviews with Fox News Digital.

""I would say, definitely, inflation and rent prices, the housing crisis is something that I think the Biden administration didn't really tackle nearly enough. So, domestically, I would definitely say that,"" Alex, a student at George Washington University who described himself as ""far to the left"" told Fox News Digital. He added that securing a ceasefire in Gaza was another top concern for him.

The unveiling of the ambulances for Magen David Adom, the emergency services system, was done in the memory of three American-Israelis killed by Hamas; Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Roi Idan and Smadar Mor-Idan.

""Today we are in Israel to dedicate the two armored ambulances that have just arrived, as well as a new ambulance center near the Gaza border where there has not been one before,"" said Rev. Graham, president of Samaritan's Purse.

""The need is so great, we have just committed to providing 20 more armored ambulances. The MDA team are heroes, saving lives every day, and it is an honor to stand with them,"" Graham added.

Counting Thursday's pledge, Samaritan's Purse has donated 42 ambulances to Israel since the war with Hamas began on October 7, 2023.

Rev. Graham also laid the cornerstone in a ceremony for a new Magen David Adom (MDA) station in Avshalom, which borders Gaza. The Avshalom emergency station would decrease wait times for Israeli paramedics to reach the scenes of emergencies along the Gaza border. MDA also partners with the Red Cross to respond to disasters worldwide.

Samaritan's Purse is also working on another Magen David Adom station in Shlomi, on the northern border of Israel.

""We don't know if we are happy or sad. We walk around between hope and despair. We are waiting for our people to return,"" said Eli Bin, MDA's director general during the ceremony. ""Mr. Graham, you are really one of the most important people to MDA, and one of the most important people to the state of Israel.""

""The building of the station is building a bridge between the awful events that happened and much more hopeful future here,"" added Bin.

Samaritan's Purse donated 14 ambulances to MDA in January after Hamas forces destroyed rescue vehicles in Israel during the October 2023 attack.

(Credit: IDF)

Israeli officials on Thursday were warning residents in the north to stay inside or remain near bomb shelters after the Israeli Air Force (IAF) struck hundreds of Hezbollah military targets inside Lebanon.

The IAF, using intelligence from the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), struck some 100 launchers and additional ""terrorist infrastructure sites"" comprising about 1,000 barrels.

Israeli officials said these barrels ""were ready to be used in the immediate future to fire toward Israeli territory.""

It was not immediately clear if there were any casualties.

HOW DID THE HEZBOLLAH PAGER EXPLOSIONS HAPPEN? 5 THINGS TO KNOW

The strikes come after two days of attacks targeting thousands of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies that have been widely blamed on Israel.

Speaking for the first time since back-to-back attacks Thursday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah described the mass bombing of devices as a ""severe blow"" and threatened retaliation.

During his speech, Hezbollah struck at least four times in northern Israel, and two Israeli soldiers were killed in a strike earlier in the day. Israeli warplanes flew low over Beirut while Nasrallah spoke and broke the sound barrier, scattering birds and prompting people in houses and offices to quickly open windows to prevent them from shattering.

Earlier Thursday, Hezbollah said it had targeted three Israeli military positions near the border, two of them with drones. Israeli hospitals reported eight people lightly or moderately injured.

The attacks have heightened fears that 11 months of near-daily exchanges of fire between Hezbollah and Israel will escalate into an all-out war. Hezbollah says its strikes on Israel are a show of support for Hamas. Israel's nearly year-old war with Hamas in Gaza began after its militants led the Oct. 7 attack on Israel.

Israel has responded to Hezbollah's attacks with strikes in southern Lebanon and has struck senior figures from the group in the capital, Beirut. The exchanges have killed hundreds in Lebanon and dozens in Israel and forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents on each side of the border.

Israeli leaders have stepped up warnings in recent weeks of a potential larger military operation against Hezbollah, saying they are determined to stop the group's fire to allow tens of thousands of Israelis to return to homes near the border.

Dem lawmakers push bill to restore funding to UN agency with alleged ties to Hamas: 'So necessary',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-lawmakers-push-bill-restore-funding-un-agency-alleged-ties-hamas-so-necessary,2024-09-19T22:54:52Z,"The Israeli Defense Force on Tuesday released video they claim shows Hamas terrorists operating inside a UNRWA base near Rafah.

A group of Democratic lawmakers is calling for the U.S. to restore funding to a controversial United Nations agency that supports much-needed humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees but faced accusations that some of its employees participated in the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel.

Speaking at a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol on Thursday afternoon, Democratic Reps. André Carson of Indiana, Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, among others, said passing H.R. 9649, or the UNRWA Funding Emergency Restoration Act, was crucial for helping Gazans.

Carson, who sponsored the bill, portrayed a dire situation in Gaza, calling current conditions ""absolutely deplorable"" and ""inhumane.""

""One million. That's the number of estimated Gazans who will not have enough food this month. 700,000. That's the number of women and girls in Gaza who do not have access to menstrual products or even running water and toilet paper. 100,000. That is the number of Palestinians who have been seriously injured without access to functioning hospitals. 41,000. That's the number of Palestinians killed by Israel since Oct. 7th,"" Carson said.

ISRAEL STRIKES HEZBOLLAH TARGETS IN LEBANON AFTER TWO ROUNDS OF DEVICE EXPLOSIONS

Jayapal said the UNRWA has, for decades, ""played an integral role in supporting the welfare of Palestinian refugees to ensure that they can live with dignity.""

""Unfortunately, UNWRA has been under constant attack by those who want to put a stop to this lifesaving work. The stoppage of funding was an unnecessary and dangerous interruption to continue to provide the humanitarian assistant that is so necessary,"" she said.

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA, has been one of the central agencies distributing aid to Palestinians in Gaza over the course of Israel's ongoing war with Hamas. It has around 30,000 employees.

In January, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres tasked the U.N.'s investigative arm, the Office of Internal Oversight Services, to investigate allegations by Israel that UNRWA staff took part in the Oct. 7 massacre.

Nearly 20 UNRWA staff members were investigated, but the U.N. only found enough evidence to dismiss nine people.

Still, Israel's allegations initially led top donor countries -- most notably, the U.S. -- to suspend funding for UNRWA, causing a cash crunch of $450 million. Since then, all donor countries -- except for the U.S. -- have resumed funding.

IRANIAN NETANYAHU ASSASSINATION PLOT FOILED, ISRAELI MAN CHARGED

Schakowsky said it was ""shameful"" that the U.S. decided to cut funding to UNRWA because only a ""tiny number"" of the agency's roughly 30,000 employees were alleged to have been involved in terrorist activities.

""Every other country, among those of our allies that had decided to stop funding UNRWA, have changed their mind. So now it is the United States alone,"" Schakowsky said. ""And the fact that the United States has decided that it's not going to be there means a danger to the people who are dying, in danger of dying every single day, including children and women and families and everyone for basic needs that they have. And that is shameful. We cannot allow that.""

H.R. 9649 has 65 co-sponsors and support from more than 100 human rights organizations. But not everyone is supportive of restoring funding.

Anne Bayefsky, Director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust and President of Human Rights Voices, said lawmakers' support of H.R. 9649 whitewashes the UNRWA's alleged ""connections to terrorism"" and sends ""the wrong message to Israel and America's enemies at the wrong time.""

""Let's get the facts straight: UNRWA employees directly participated in October 7 atrocities; 10% of UNRWA employees are reported to have ties to multiple Palestinian terror organizations; a significant percentage of UNRWA's senior education leadership are members of Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad,"" Bayefsky said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

Bayefsky also noted that ""UNRWA facilities -- including schools -- have been used as Hamas command and control centers and weapons depots [and] UNRWA's Gaza headquarters powered a Hamas data center directly beneath it.""

Bayefsky slammed the UNRWA for not having taken, in her view, ""serious steps towards accountability or prevention... while at the same time demanding more funding.""

""This is not a small drop in a fictional ocean of humanitarianism,"" Bayefsky said. ""UNRWA's ties to Palestinian terrorism emanate from raising a generation of Palestinian Arabs on the hatred of Jews in its schools, upending the meaning of a 'refugee' to serve as a vehicle to eviscerate the Jewish state. And spreading slanderous lies guaranteed to undermine peaceful coexistence between Palestinians and Israelis to the detriment of all.""

Fox News Digital has reached out to the UNRWA for comment on H.R. 9649. The U.N., meanwhile, told Fox News Digital it does ""not comment on legislations in countries. But we've been clear that UNRWA is the backbone of humanitarian support for Palestinian people and should be supported."""
The BBC flunks Journalism 101 when it comes to Israel,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bbc-flunks-journalism-101-when-comes-israel,2024-09-19T18:01:27Z,"FOX News contributor Joe Concha joined 'FOX & Friends First' to discuss why he believes the editor should be fired.

Bad journalism has bad consequences.

Traduce Israel, and you bring Jew-hating angry mobs onto the street. That is a step away from acts of racial hatred. Journalists know this, yet they willingly act as cheerleaders for such hatred, whipping it up with distorted, manipulative and sometimes dishonest journalism.

They should know better.

THE BBC BREACHED EDITORIAL GUIDELINES OVER 1,500 TIMES IN ISRAEL-HAMAS CONFLICT, REPORT CLAIMS

The BBC is the largest and most 'trusted' brand in journalism. We know this, because the BBC tells us. It earns this sobriquet by dint of its past glories, and the fact that it is legally obliged to produce 'impartial' news. In return for this promise, it is paid more than $5 billion per year by the British public.

The Asserson Report, which I published earlier this month, takes a deep dive into four months of BBC news coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. We look at some 9 million words of output using a traditional litigation style analysis. In parallel, a team of data scientists (operating as the Research for Impartial media - RIMe) conducted a series of experiments using cutting-edge AI techniques. Working independently, yet collaboratively, these two disciplines found strikingly similar results, exposing the myth of BBC impartiality.

'CORROSIVELY WOKE' BBC CONTINUES TO BE PLAGUED BY RETRACTIONS, APOLOGIES RELATED TO ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

We analyzed BBC English language TV output. While some programs were neutral, the remainder were between 90% and 100% pro-Palestinian/anti-Israeli.

The BBC broke almost every rule in its own rule-book - the 'Editorial Guidelines.' They use BBC as a platform for Hamas sympathizers, and Hamas members; they report death figures they know to be wrong without adequately conveying their unreliability to audiences; they air reports from Gaza without mentioning that Hamas controls journalistic output; their own

journalists express personal opinions. Each of these is a separate breach of the BBC's own guidelines on impartiality.

While we found that BBC English was disappointingly bad, we found that BBC Arabic was significantly worse. In a 'sympathy analysis' conducted by the RIMe data scientists across global media, BBC Arabic was snuggled up with such outlets as Al Jazeera; Palestine Chronicle and Iraqi News. It must surely degrade trust in the BBC to discover that it is being used to peddle extremist views.

The BBC News machine displays a strong anti-Israel view from almost every angle we analyzed. Any pretense at impartiality seems to have been abandoned. Indeed, its lead Middle East journalist, Jeremy Bowen, recently boasted that he considers impartiality means him telling the audience what he considers to be 'the truth.' This is the precise opposite of what the Editorial Guidelines dictate.

So, how has the BBC drifted so far from its roots? There are two answers. Firstly - the BBC has been captured by an institutional bias on many issues. Journalists who insist on expressing their own opinions should be shifted to somewhere less harmful - Gardener's Question Time, comes to mind - or they should be removed altogether. This seems rarely, if ever, to happen.

Secondly, and more fundamentally, BBC management needs to get a grip on their most sacred product - news. They need to set targets; monitor output, adjust when targets are not hit; and take steps against recalcitrant journalists and editors. At present, the BBC senior management sets no KPI's; sets no goals; conducts no systematic monitoring of output and is essentially running blind. They hope their journalists will achieve impartiality, but take no effective steps to ensure they do. They have let go of the rudder, and are allowing the BBC to be blown where the winds take it. That means that a bunch of very self-opinionated journalists, many of whom display deeply malevolent views about Israel, control the output.

The Asserson Report blows the myth of impartiality out of the water. The BBC doesn't achieve impartiality and is not remotely close to achieving it. BBC management must either take back control of the ship, or the British people should demand a refund."
How did the Hezbollah pager explosions happen? 5 things to know,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/how-did-hezbollah-pager-explosions-happen-things-know,2024-09-19T12:59:23Z,"The explosions of hundreds of pagers used by Hezbollah members across Lebanon and Syria on Tuesday and the detonation of a second wave of electronic devices a day later remain a mystery, though experts are calling the deadly blasts a sophisticated attack that likely took months of planning.

The two waves of bombings killed at least 37 people, including at least two children, and wounded more than 3,000 others, Lebanon's Health Ministry said.

Here's what to know about the deadly covert, sophisticated attacks:

The sophistication of the pager bombings suggests months of long-term planning, according to experts who believe the supply chain was infiltrated and hundreds of pagers were rigged with explosives before they were imported to Lebanon. But little evidence has emerged so far.

HEZBOLLAH'S NEIGHBORS: ISRAELI BORDER COMMUNITY UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK FROM TERROR GROUP

Few details about what led to the second wave of electronic devices, which Hezbollah officials said included walkie-talkies and solar equipment, were known.

The operation's trail stretched across the globe from Taiwan to Budapest before the devices ended up in Lebanon.

Taiwanese pager firm Gold Apollo said its AR-924 pager brand was licensed to a Hungarian-based company, BAC Consulting KFT. Gold Apollo said it was not involved in the production of the devices, which it says were manufactured and sold by BAC.

Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs said that it had no records of direct exports of Gold Apollo pagers to Lebanon. And a Hungarian government spokesman later added that the pager devices had never been in Hungary, either, noting that BAC had merely acted as an intermediary.

ISRAEL STRUCK BY LONG-RANGE MISSILE FROM YEMEN, 40 PROJECTILES FROM LEBANON IN EARLY MORNING ATTACKS

Walkie-talkies that exploded Wednesday appeared to be knock-off products of Japanese walkie-talkie maker Icom that were not made by the company, a sales executive at the company's U.S. subsidiary told The Associated Press.

Hezbollah has used pagers to communicate for years, though the group's leader recently called on members to stop using cell phones altogether over concerns that Israeli intelligence could track the phones.

Pager technology is simpler than a cellphone and carries lower risks for intercepted communications.

Both attacks are widely believed to be carried out by Israel.

Hezbollah and Lebanon immediately pointed fingers at Israel following the explosions on Tuesday. On Wednesday, a senior U.S. official confirmed to Fox News that Israel was behind the pager explosions.

Experts have said the pager operation was likely carried out by Israel's foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad, which has a worldwide reputation as one of the most formidable intelligence agencies.

U.S. officials have denied that the U.S. was involved or had any knowledge of such an attack before the two waves of explosions.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Tuesday said ""the United States did not know about, nor was it involved in, these incidents.""

The explosions, however, have deepened concerns about an escalation into an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah.

""And we're still gathering, the information and gathering the facts. Broadly speaking, we've been very clear, and we remain very clear about the importance of all parties avoiding any steps that could further escalate the conflict that we're trying to resolve in Gaza,"" Blinken said. ""To see it spread to other fronts. It's clearly not in the interest of anyone involved to see that happen. And that's why, again, it's imperative that all parties refrain from any actions that could escalate the conflict."""
John Kirby denies US involvement in Lebanon device attacks: 'We want to see the war end',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/john-kirby-denies-us-involvement-lebanon-device-attacks-we-want-see-war-end,2024-09-19T01:05:57Z,"Hundreds electronic devices, including pagers and handheld radios, reportedly exploded around Lebanon on Tuesday and Wednesday in an attack widely believed to have been the work of Israel.

National Security communications adviser John Kirby shot down multiple questions Wednesday about possible U.S. involvement in the explosion of hundreds of electronic devices used by Hezbollah members in Lebanon.

""We were not involved in [Tuesday's] incidents or [Wednesday's] in any way. And I don't have anything more to share,"" Kirby said when asked to respond to the attacks.

Kirby's comments came hours after several blasts were heard around Lebanon's capital of Beirut and other parts of the country. Hezbollah's Al Manar TV reported the explosions were the result of walkie-talkies detonating.

At least nine people were killed and another 300 were wounded in Wednesday's attack, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry.

The explosions came just a day after pagers used by hundreds of Hezbollah members exploded throughout Lebanon and parts of Syria, killing at least 12 people - including two children - and wounding thousands more.

HEZBOLLAH'S NEIGHBORS: ISRAELI BORDER COMMUNITY UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK FROM TERROR GROUP

Both attacks are widely believed to have been the work of Israel, which has been fighting with Hezbollah almost daily since Oct. 8, the day after a deadly Hamas-led assault in southern Israel triggered the war in Gaza.

Since then, hundreds have been killed in strikes in Lebanon and dozens in Israel, while tens of thousands on each side of the border have been displaced. Hezbollah said its strikes are in support of its ally, Hamas.

Reporters repeatedly pressed Kirby on Wednesday to say whether the U.S. was involved in the back-to-back attacks targeting members of Hezbollah or had been informed beforehand.

Kirby reiterated that he did not ""have anything more to share today.""

""We want to see the war end. And everything we've been doing since the beginning has been designed to prevent the conflict from escalating,"" Kirby said. ""We still believe that there is a diplomatic path forward, particularly up near Lebanon.""

The attacks have heightened fears that what has been intermittent fighting between Israel and Hezbollah could escalate into an all-out war.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Israeli troops Wednesday: ""We are at the start of a new phase in the war -- it requires courage, determination and perseverance.""

Gallant made no mention of the exploding devices but praised the work of Israel's army and security agencies, saying ""the results are very impressive.""

Hezbollah announced three strikes on parts of northern Israel Wednesday, at least one of which took place after the latest round of explosions in Lebanon."

""Black journalists today at the NABJ [National Black Journalists Association] pressed vice president Kamala Harris on policies from guns to the war in Gaza, but many of her answers lacked specifics,"" Phillip began.

The CNN panel discussed Harris' interview with Black journalists, as well as Hillary Clinton's assertion that it was a ""double standard"" to ask the vice president about policies.

Podcast host Kara Swisher said she didn't necessarily agree with Clinton, and noted that polls show people want to ""know more"" about Harris.

59 DAYS: KAMALA HARRIS HAS YET TO DO A PRESS CONFERENCE SINCE EMERGING AS DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE

Phillip played a clip of Harris responding to a question about whether voters were better off than they were four years ago.

""We came in during the worst public health epidemic in centuries. We came in after the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War and a lot of it due in large part to the mismanagement by the former president, as it relates to COVID and, obviously, January 6. And we had then a lot of work to do to clean up a mess. As of today, we have created over 16 million new jobs, over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. We have the lowest Black unemployment rate in generations,"" Harris said.

Phillip argued that Harris should have something ""quick"" and ""understandable"" ready in response to a question like that, adding, ""and that wasn't really it.""

CNN political commentator Ashley Allison said she wished Harris would have alluded to the next four years in her answer to the question about whether Americans were better off during Trump's presidency.

""Answer the question,"" CNN political commentator Scott Jennings said. ""She got the same question at the debate, and you know what else, why I went back and watched the debate again, every single policy question she got at the debate, she totally ignored and never answered. Why is it that she believes she does not have to answer to journalists who are asking pretty basic questions of a presidential candidate?""

Swisher said that Harris needed to be ""specific while being vague.""

CNN political analyst Colman Hughes suggested Harris keeping her answers vague was working for her.

""What has worked for Kamala Harris is literally to not make headlines, to give vague but presidential sounding answers to questions, and allow voters to project the image of who they hope she is onto her,"" Hughes said.

Hughes added that while he wanted to know more about her strategies on Russia and Ukraine, Harris ""does tend to get into trouble when she answers off the cuff, she can be a gaffe machine when she's unprepared.""

Following the interview, Politico reported on Wednesday that Harris refused to ""veer off script."" The report said Harris evaded questions about important issues, adding, ""she did not break much ground or stray far from her talking points."""

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is demanding an investigation into whether any U.S. resources went toward Israel's coordinated explosion of Hezbollah pagers.

""Israel's pager attack in Lebanon detonated thousands of handheld devices across of a [sic] slew of public spaces, seriously injuring and killing innocent civilians,"" the progressive New Yorker wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

""This attack clearly and unequivocally violates international humanitarian law and undermines US efforts to prevent a wider conflict. Congress needs a full accounting of the attack, including an answer from the State Department as to whether any US assistance went into the development or deployment of this technology.""

""To see it spread to other fronts, it's clearly not in the interest of anyone involved to see that happen.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., meanwhile, dropped a pair of joint resolutions that would block U.S. arms sales to Israel.

""Congress must act to save lives, uphold U.S. and international law, and stand up for U.S. interests. We must end our complicity in Israel's illegal and indiscriminate military campaign, which has caused mass civilian death and suffering.""

Under Senate rules, Sanders can force a vote on the resolutions as soon as next week. They would need 51 votes to be approved.

The Iranian regime-backed Hezbollah organization switched from mobile phones to pagers to prevent Israeli interception of their communications. Hezbollah joined Hamas' war against Israel a day after the Gaza-based terrorist movement invaded the Jewish state on Oct. 7.

Some 2,500 people were wounded and 12 killed in the coordinated pager explosions on Tuesday. Then on Wednesday, 14 people were killed and hundreds more injured when walkie-talkies owned by Hezbollah members exploded across Lebanon on Wednesday afternoon.

Of the 26 who have died in the two attacks, Hezbollah confirmed eight were its members.

Hezbollah is estimated to have more than 150,000 missiles aimed at Israel. The de facto ruler of Lebanon, Hezbollah, has amassed new sophisticated missiles, rockets and drones since its 2006 war against Israel. Hezbollah has launched more than 7,500 missiles, rockets, and drones into Israel since Oct. 8.

One Hezbollah official said the detonation of the pagers was the group's ""biggest security breach"" since the Gaza conflict began.

Hezbollah said in a statement on Wednesday that ""the resistance will continue today, like any other day, its operations to support Gaza, its people and its resistance, which is a separate path from the harsh punishment that the criminal enemy (Israel) should await in response to Tuesday's massacre.""

This is the first resolution proposed by the Palestinians after gaining additional powers as a member following a vote in May, including granting them the ability to propose resolutions.

The Palestinian territories pushed for the resolution on the back of a July advisory opinion by the United Nations' International Court of Justice (ICJ) that determined Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories and settlements is illegal and should be withdrawn.

""The court came out with an opinion in July,"" Tucker explained. ""It's an opinion: It's not a ruling, it's not a criminal case. They're not deciding a dispute. It's a legal opinion that the court is being asked to give by the General Assembly.""

""But it goes to the heart of the Israel-Palestinian conflict,"" Tucker said. ""In essence, the court is being asked to give its opinion on really the key issues that have been disputes between Israel and the Palestinians for decades, and the General Assembly is now implementing that opinion.""

""The Palestinians have a kind of absolute right to self-determination, and that means that Israel's presence in the territories has become illegal,"" he added. ""Now, legally... there's a lot to be said about this. For example... never before has the right to self-determination been given this level of priority.""

Tucker argued that the implications of such a decision could lead to ""greater conflict"" because Israel's expedited exit could leave open the chance for Iran to dig into the West Bank the same way it did with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

Fox News Digital spoke to leading U.S. and Israeli experts about the setback for the Iranian regime proxy.

According to a Reuters report, Israel's foreign intelligence agency, Mossad, planted explosives inside of 5,000 pagers imported by Hezbollah months before Tuesday's detonations that killed nine people, a senior Lebanese security source and another source told Reuters.

ISRAEL WAS BEHIND LEBANON PAGER ATTACK TARGETING HEZBOLLAH, SENIOR US OFFICIAL SAYS, AS NEW BLASTS REPORTED

The Iranian regime-backed Hezbollah organization switched from mobile phones to pagers to prevent Israeli interception of their communications. Hezbollah joined Hamas' war against Israel a day after the Gaza-based terrorist movement invaded the Jewish state on Oct. 7.

Walid Phares, a leading U.S. expert on Lebanon and Hezbollah, told Fox News Digital that the reported Israeli operation, ""is certainly a strike against Hezbollah's national security apparatus. We are talking about thousands and thousands of individuals who are at the heart of the security force of Hezbollah, who are, according to sources we know, in charge of manning many things. One is the missile force.""

Hezbollah is estimated to have over 150,000 missiles aimed at Israel. The de facto ruler of Lebanon, Hezbollah, has amassed new sophisticated missiles, rockets and drones since its 2006 war against Israel. Hezbollah has launched more than 7,500 missiles, rockets, and drones into Israel since Oct. 8.

One Hezbollah official said the detonation of the pagers was the group's ""biggest security breach"" since the Gaza conflict began.

Phares added that the ""Israeli electronic bomb"" operation also degraded many Hezbollah special forces, commandos, electronic forces, and internal security and intelligence apparatus members. He warned, however, that Hezbollah would eventually recover.

Phares noted that Israel's strike ""weakened the image of Hezbollah within the Lebanese population."" He said the psychological benefits of the strike have showed that the Lebanese are now convinced that Hezbollah ""can eventually be defeated"" and its ""grip on Lebanon"" can be weakened.

He said the Israeli cyber strike could also encourage opposition among Sunnis, Druze and Christians to mobilize against the Shi'ite Hezbollah organization.

ISRAEL STRUCK BY LONG-RANGE MISSILE FROM YEMEN, 40 PROJECTILES FROM LEBANON IN EARLY MORNING ATTACKS

An Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman was tight-lipped when Fox News Digital approached him for a comment. Israel frequently retains a policy of deliberate ambiguity about high-profile attacks on its enemies. The Israeli government's policy is to neither confirm nor deny spectacular assassinations or other covert operations. A senior U.S. official later confirmed that Israel was behind the attack, but Israel has yet to do so.

The alleged Mossad operation, with a trail running from Taiwan to Budapest, was an unprecedented Hezbollah security breach that saw thousands of pagers explode across Lebanon, wounding some 2,500 people, including many of the group's fighters and Iran's envoy to Beirut.

Hezbollah said in a statement on Wednesday that ""the resistance will continue today, like any other day, its operations to support Gaza, its people and its resistance, which is a separate path from the harsh punishment that the criminal enemy (Israel) should await in response to Tuesday's massacre.""

Jonathan Conricus, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital that ""Beyond shock and humiliation, the immediate impact on Hezbollah is not yet clear, neither are the Iranian terror proxy's intentions to retaliate. While the pager attack was a brilliant tactical success unlike anything previously accomplished against a terror organization during combat, the strategic benefits of this tremendous move are limited, if not supplemented with swift Israeli action against Hezbollah as it reels from the shock of impact.""

Conricus, a former IDF spokesman, continued. ""It seems that this action was more aimed at softening Hezbollah to agree to a war-avoiding diplomatic solution, and less as a preamble of an Israeli offensive. Israel's main focus remains to facilitate the safe return home of almost one hundred thousand Israelis displaced by Hezbollah attacks for over 11 months. If the pager operation brings this about, then it will have been worth the risk. If not, it will be added to a long list of Israeli tactical successes that were not complemented by strategic thought and action.""

HEZBOLLAH RELIES ON 'SOPHISTICATED' TUNNEL SYSTEM BACKED BY IRAN, NORTH KOREA IN FIGHT AGAINST ISRAEL

Israel's Mossad has garnered a worldwide reputation as one of the most formidable intelligence agencies. Within the last two months, Israel reportedly killed Fuad Shukr, a top Hezbollah terrorist in Beirut, eliminated the Hamas terrorist leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, and its special forces raided an Iranian weapons facility in the Masyaf area in Syria.

Nadav Eyal, a prominent Israeli columnist for the large Hebrew daily Yedioth Ahronoth, told Fox News Digital that while Israel has not claimed responsibility for the operation, ""This will be remembered as one of the most brilliant Israeli intelligence operations ever. It is a substantially meticulous operation.""

Eyal continued, ""This is a very effective operation if you want to restore deterrence in the region. Israel's major strategic problem in the region that it has lost its deterrent force, deterring its enemies from attacking it. Hamas attacked on October 7. Hezbollah attacked Israel on October 8. Iran attacked Israel in April. All of these parties, together with the Houthis, are not deterred.""

The Israeli military expert added, ""By these kinds of operations Israel is really showing those different forces what it can do. And it has done also in its response to the Iranian aerial assault back in April. It's showing them it can operate in ways and means that they did not anticipate. Whether or not it is effective in the long run, we need to see.""

He noted, ""Israel has been preparing for the war in the north with Hezbollah since 2007. These have been 17 years of Israeli preparations... Israel has not been preparing for an invasion of Hamas.""

""We need to push Hezbollah out of south Lebanon and hit their capabilities,"" IDF Reserve Brig. Gen. Amir Avivi told Fox News Digital.

Avivi, the founder and chairman of Israel's Defense and Security Forum, added that while Israel did not take responsibility for the attack in Lebanon on Tuesday, ""This is the first step in really moving the center of gravity from Gaza to Lebanon. In my opinion, war is imminent. We will have to hit Hezbollah and we will have to do a ground incursion. We cannot have Hezbollah on our borders. Israel is sending a very, very strong message. We have knowledge and capabilities. We know everything about Hezbollah and Iran. If they do not retreat, the end game is clear: Hezbollah is going to be destroyed in south Lebanon."""
"Newt Gingrich sounds off on Kamala Harris' 'word salad' interviews, 'insane' position on Israel-Hamas",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/newt-gingrich-sounds-off-kamala-harris-word-salad-interviews-insane-position-israel-hamas,2024-09-18T15:37:21Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris is continuing her campaign blitz, but a series of 'word salad' interviews have some pundits skeptical if she can sway enough undecided voters. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich warned on ""Hannity"" Tuesday that the new interviews have become a ""joke,"" stressing the ""insanity"" of Harris' position on the Israel-Hamas war.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN PLEDGES MORE MEDIA INTERVIEWS AS VOTERS STILL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HER POLICIES

NEWT GINGRICH: The American people aren't stupid. In the recent interviews, for example, with undecided voters, overwhelmingly they believe she's much more radical than Donald Trump. ... They identify her with Biden and the Biden administration so overwhelmingly, they think that she is the candidate of the past and Trump is a candidate of change, by about three-and-a-half to one. Americans want change in current policies, not continuity. Part of this may be psychological and she may not be capable of uttering a clear, coherent policy position. But whatever the reason, the more we get these word salads, the more obvious it is that she either doesn't know what she's saying or she can't articulate it, or she's trying to hide. These things all hurt her. This interview today did not help her at all. The interview in Philadelphia on the local TV station became a joke. I mean, people thought it was absurd.

If you just watch her, it's the same stuff over and over. The things she's memorized have nothing to do with the real world. And I particularly want to point out, at one point in this interview, she talks about we have to get to a truce in Gaza and release the hostages. Now, there are two problems. The first is she is the vice president. They've had 11 months to get to this truce. 11 months. They've gotten nowhere. There's no reason to believe she'd get anywhere if she was president. Why? Because the founding constitution of Hamas says not a single Jew will remain. And when people chant 'from the river to the sea,' they're chanting genocide fully as much as the Nazi Germans were about Jews in Europe. These college students need to understand that. That's a genocidal quote that Hamas means to either massacre or evict every single Jew in Israel. So her fantasy that somehow she's going to sit down with Hamas, talk reasonably with them, get them to agree to something plausible, this is insanity. This is totally out of touch with the real world.

Vice President Kamala Harris has had numerous 'word salad' interviews during her time in office. Although her campaign has been marked by few media appearances, she had her first solo interview with the national media Tuesday.

Harris spoke to the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) in Philadelphia, about a month after former President Trump spoke to the same group and made waves when he questioned Harris' race.

CBS REPORTER FINDS ONLY 3 HARRIS SUPPORTERS IN 3 NEVADA RESTAURANTS: 'PEOPLE ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT TRUMP'

Beyond race-focused topics, the interview included remarks from Harris about her economic plan, abortion, support for Israel and gun control.

Later, the moderators turned to the second assassination attempt made on Trump's life over the weekend. Harris indicated that she spoke to Trump after the close call to check on him.

Harris was asked a follow-up question about her confidence in the Secret Service to protect her, with Harris responding in the affirmative.

""Not everybody has Secret Service. And there are far too many people in our country right now who are not feeling safe,"" she said. ""I mean, I look at Project 2025, and I look at, you know, the Don't Say Gay laws coming out of Florida. Members of the LGBTQ community don't feel safe right now, immigrants or people with an immigrant background don't feel safe right now. Women don't feel safe right now. And so, yes, I feel safe. I have Secret Service protection, but that doesn't change my perspective on the importance of fighting for the safety of everybody in our country.""

"Hezbollah pagers that exploded were made in Hungary, Taiwanese company says",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-pagers-exploded-were-made-hungary-taiwanese-company-says,2024-09-18T11:49:46Z,"WARNING: Graphic footage -- Fox News correspondent Nate Foy has the latest on the explosions on 'Special Report.'

Hundreds of pagers that exploded in Lebanon and Syria in an apparent operation targeting members of Hezbollah bore the brand of a Taiwanese company, though the firm's chair told reporters Wednesday that another company in Budapest manufactured the devices.

Near-simultaneous detonations of pagers used by members of the Iran-backed Hezbollah terror group killed at least 12 people, including two children, and wounded nearly 3,000 on Tuesday.

Taiwanese pager firm Gold Apollo said in a statement that the firm had licensed its AR-924 brand of pager to BAC Consulting KFT, based in Hungary's capital, and was not involved in the production.

""According to the cooperation agreement, we authorize BAC to use our brand trademark for product sales in designated regions, but the design and manufacturing of the products are solely the responsibility of BAC,"" the statement read.

LEBANON EXPLOSIONS: HEZBOLLAH APPARENTLY TARGETED AS PAGERS DETONATE, SEVERAL DEAD, THOUSANDS HURT

Gold Apollo chair Hsu Ching-kuang told reporters Wednesday that his company has had a licensing agreement with BAC for the past three years, though he provided no evidence of the contract.

The pagers started heating up and exploding around 3:30 p.m. Tuesday. The blasts were concentrated in areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence, particularly a southern Beirut suburb and in the Beqaa region of eastern Lebanon and in Damascus, Lebanese security officials and a Hezbollah official told the Associated Press.

Lebanon Health Minister Firas Abiad told reporters Wednesday morning that many of the wounded had severe injuries to the eyes, and others had limbs amputated.

HEZBOLLAH'S NEIGHBORS: ISRAELI BORDER COMMUNITY UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK FROM TERROR GROUP

Hezbollah and the Lebanese government blamed Israel for what appeared to be a sophisticated remote attack. The Israeli government has not commented.

Experts believe a sophisticated supply chain infiltration occurred, during which explosive material was secreted into the pagers prior to their delivery and use.

While it appeared that members of Hezbollah possessed many of the pagers that exploded, it was not immediately clear if non-Hezbollah members also carried any of the pagers.

Hezbollah, which has pointed the blame at Israel, said in a statement Wednesday morning that it would continue its normal strikes against Israel ""as in all the past days"" as part of what it describes as a support front for its ally Hamas, and Palestinians in Gaza.

""This proposal introduced by the Palestinian delegation, ahead of the United Nations' General Assembly, is an absolute disgrace that rewards terrorism. It is a clear insult to the Jewish people and anyone who understands history,"" Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Vice Chairman Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said in a statement that was signed onto by 28 other Republicans.

Signers included Foreign Relations Committee Ranking Member James Risch, R-Idaho, and Senate Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Antisemitism Co-Chair James Lankford, R-Okla.

A draft of the proposal by the Palestinian Authority reportedly cited the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and its nonbinding opinion issued in July, which declared that Israel's presence in the Palestinian territories as well as its actions were in violation of international law, per the Associated Press.

A UN General Assembly vote is expected on the resolution on Wednesday, according to reports.

Since then, Israeli and Hamas forces have continued to fire on one another, and the former has launched several targeted strikes against targets as well as hostage recovery missions. Attempts by the U.S. and neighboring Middle Eastern countries to facilitate a ceasefire agreement have yet to result in an end to the war.

""Instead of proposing biased and counter-productive initiatives, which will do nothing to advance a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, the international community must focus its energy and resources on ensuring Hamas and other terrorist groups are completely destroyed,"" the GOP statement continued. ""We must remain firm to ensure every single hostage held by these terrorists is safely returned to their loved ones.""

Fetterman reams NY Times for platforming terrorist propaganda after interview with senior Hamas official,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/fetterman-reams-ny-times-platforming-terrorist-propaganda-after-interview-senior-hamas-official,2024-09-17T20:12:28Z,"Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., discusses the recent strike in Rafah on MSNBC.

Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn., accused the New York Times of spreading Hamas propaganda after the paper quoted Khaled Meshal, one of the terror group's most senior officials, in a new report Tuesday.

The Times story, headlined ""Hamas is surviving war in Israel. Now it hopes to thrive in Gaza again,"" centers around an interview with Meshal, who insisted Hamas ""is winning the war and will play a decisive role in Gaza's future"" despite Israel's commitment to eradicate the terror group responsible for killing 1,200 people on October 7.

The Times interviewed Meshal for two-hours in his living room in Doha, Qatar, where he ""offered rare insights into the thinking of Hamas officials,"" the report reads.

REP. RITCHIE TORRES CALLS OUT NY TIMES 'BIAS' FOR NOT INTERVIEWING HIM FOR STORY ABOUT HIS ANTI-ISRAEL CRITICS

""In the interview, Mr. Meshal made clear that Hamas officials are not in a rush to conclude a cease-fire with Israel at any price, and will not give up on their main demands for an end to the war and an Israeli withdrawal,"" the Times wrote.

Fetterman posted a screenshot of the story's headline on X, rebuking the outlet for giving one of Hamas' most senior leaders a platform to promote the group's message.

""No idea why NYT would platform this propaganda from a terrorist. Undoubtedly, Israel will hold him accountable,"" the lawmaker wrote. ""Hamas is no different than WWII Nazis and I fully support Israel's commitment to neutralize them.""

The Times report notes that the U.S. accused Meshal and other Hamas leaders of playing ""a central role in planning and carrying out the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel."" Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel.

Still, the paper features quotes from Meshal insisting that the terror group ""has the upper hand,"" and ""has remained steadfast"" while bringing the Israeli military into 'a state of attrition.""

""Hamas's reasoning is simple -- winning simply means surviving and, at least for now, the group has managed to do that, even if it is severely weakened,"" the Times writes.

NETANYAHU TRASHES NY TIMES REPORTING CITING ANONYMOUS OFFICIALS WHO SAY ISRAELI MILITARY WANTS CEASE-FIRE IN GAZA

Meshal told the paper that President Biden's seemingly changed position - from initially supporting Hamas eradication to demanding a cease fire in the region, sends a message that the U.S. is ""practically recognizing"" the terror group.

""Despite Hamas's immense losses, including many senior commanders killed by Israel, Mr. Meshal said he was confident that the group would play a dominant role in Gaza following the war. He dismissed alternative American and Israeli proposals for administering the territory without Hamas,"" the Times report reads.

""All their illusions about filling the vacuum are behind us,"" Mashal said.

The Times report states that many in Gaza are upset at Hamas for the October 7 massacre, which launched a full-scale war in the region. But Meshal ""dismissed criticism of Hamas's decision. Palestinian critics of Hamas represented a minority, he said,"" according to the Times report.

""He acknowledged that the assault had caused enormous destruction but said it was a 'price' Palestinians must pay for freedom.""

The Biden administration's efforts to secure a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas via shuttle diplomacy continued Tuesday as Secretary of State Antony Blinken was due to fly to Egypt in another attempt to ""establish broader regional security.""

The U.S., in coordination with Egypt and Qatar, has been leading indirect negotiations in the pursuit of ending the deadly war in Gaza, which has persisted for nearly a year following the horrific Oct. 7 massacre by Hamas which saw the death of 1,139 people along with the abduction of 251 people from Israel.

However, hopes of finding an end to the war remain unlikely during Blinken's latest visit, which is the 10th trip he has taken to the Middle East since the October 2023 terrorist attacks.

ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER TELLS US ONLY 'MILITARY ACTION' CAN RETURN PEOPLE TO HOMES AMID HEZBOLLAH THREAT

State Department spokesperson Matt Miller told reporters Monday amid U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein's trip to Israel, where he met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, that there is ""no timeline"" for a deal.

""We are working expeditiously to try to develop that proposal, [to] try to find something that would bring both the parties to say yes,"" he added.

A cease-fire deal, which the Biden administration appeared hopeful they were close to achieving last month, appears to have reached an impasse as both Hamas and Israel have made stipulations over access to the Philadelphi Corridor, a non-negotiable issue for both sides.

Blinken's latest trip is not expected to result in any major breakthroughs and comes just one day after Israel's security cabinet updated its war aims against not only Hamas, but Hezbollah.

The goals, which already included the elimination of Hamas' military and government bodies in Gaza, the return of all hostages and ensuring a safe environment for Israelis living along the southern border, now also includes the safe return of some 60,000 Israeli citizens to their homes in the north.

Following the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, more than 65,000 Israelis were evacuated from their homes along the northern border with Lebanon over concerns that Hezbollah could carry out a similar Hamas-style attack.

Despite the devastating effects Hamas achieved in its gruesome attack last year, security experts have long warned that Hezbollah - which is financially and militarily stronger than Hamas - poses a greater threat to Israeli security.

In a late-night statement Monday, Netanyahu's office said, ""Israel will continue to take active measures"" to achieve its new ""goal"" in returning citizens to their northern homes.

The statement followed comments made by both the prime minister and the defense minister on Monday that said Israel is looking to change its force posture along its northern border.

She continued, ""We have also been unequivocal in communicating to Israel that there is no basis - absolutely none - for its forces to be opening fire on clearly marked UN vehicles, as recently occurred on numerous occasions.""

A former school converted into a UNRWA civilian shelter was struck last week by the Israeli Defense Forces, killing 18 people. Six of those killed were UNRWA personnel.

The Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, previously rebuked criticism of the strike on the UNRWA shelter, asserting that the entire agency has become overrun with terrorists and terrorist sympathizers -- including personnel at the destroyed shelter.

""Those who were killed yesterday (Wednesday) in the IDF strike were nine terrorists with blood on their hands, and some of them participated in the barbaric massacre on October 7.""

Danon provided a list of names ostensibly connecting known Hamas terrorists to the civilian shelter.

When approached by Fox News Digital, Juliette Touma, a UNRWA spokesperson, claimed that ""Israeli authorities have not requested UNRWA officially to provide them with the list of staff killed in yesterday's attack on the UNRWA school.""

Nine individuals were fired by UNRWA last month after it was found they likely participated in the Hamas slaughter of 1,200 people, including more than 30 Americans, on Oct. 7 in southern Israel.

(Courtesy: Reuters)

In a meeting with a top adviser to President Biden on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned that ""military action"" against Hezbollah was the ""only way"" to safely return its citizens to their northern homes.

U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein met with both Gallant and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an attempt to avoid a broader conflict between the Jewish state and the Iran-backed terrorist groups.

But Israeli officials appeared steadfast in their position on handling Hamas to the south and Hezbollah to the north, and noted the time to secure a cease-fire agreement to end the war in Gaza was running out, particularly as Hezbollah continues to ""tie itself"" to Hamas.

HEZBOLLAH RELIES ON 'SOPHISTICATED' TUNNEL SYSTEM BACKED BY IRAN, NORTH KOREA IN FIGHT AGAINST ISRAEL

Instead, Gallant told Hochstein that Jerusalem needed to ""change the security situation on the northern border,"" though he did not detail what this would entail.

Israeli security experts have been warning for months that Jerusalem faces a far greater threat along its northern border as Hezbollah - already better financially backed and militarily equipped than other Iranian proxy forces like Hamas - has been gaining power for decades.

Israeli citizens fled their homes in the north following the catastrophic attacks by Hamas in the south on Oct. 7, 2023, fearing a similar attack could be carried out by Hezbollah.

Additional evacuations have since been enforced by government officials along the northern border as Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Hezbollah routinely engage in cross-border skirmishes.

It is unclear how many Israeli residents have been displaced since the onslaught of the war against Hamas nearly one year ago, though some estimates suggest that figure could be as high as 80,000.

""We are in a multi-front campaign against Iran's axis of evil, which is striving for our destruction,"" Netanyahu said following Houthi and Hezbollah missile strikes on Sunday. ""I am attentive to the residents of the north.

""I see their distress. I hear their anguish. The current situation will not continue,"" he added. ""This requires a change in the balance of forces on our northern border. We will do whatever is necessary to return our residents securely to their homes.

""I am committed to this. The government is committed to this, and we will not suffice with less than this,"" Netanyahu warned.

Israeli officials have shown increasing resistance to a cease-fire deal with Hamas and have said no deal can be reached without the return of all hostages, despite pressure from the Biden administration.

Netanyahu has also said there are major security concerns that cannot be compromised for the sake of a cease-fire, like the continued presence of Israeli forces in the Philadelphi Corridor in Gaza, which runs along the border with Egypt.

Following the Monday meeting between Netanyahu and Hochstein, the prime minister, according to a readout of the exchange, said Israel ""appreciates and respects the support of the United States,"" but added that Jerusalem ""will do whatever is necessary to maintain its security and return the residents of the north to their homes safely.""

Danon's remarks came after last week's Israeli air strike that hit the UNRWA al-Jaouni school in a Gaza refugee camp. Danon questioned, ""How long will the U.N. continue to bury its head in the sand and ignore the fact that Hamas terrorists have taken over UNRWA? Those who were killed yesterday (Wednesday) in the IDF strike were nine terrorists with blood on their hands, and some of them participated in the barbaric massacre on October 7. In case there are still any doubts, there are the names of the Hamas terrorists who were at the school compound disguised as 'local UNRWA employees.""

The school, which was not operational, was being used as a Hamas command and control center, according to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).

Danon listed the names of the Hamas terrorists who were affiliated with UNRWA on his X post, while noting ""UNRWA-Gaza is a terrorist organization whose members participated in the October 7 massacre, and whose members abducted and murdered innocent Israeli civilians. It is time to shut down UNRWA.""

Just last month, Fox News Digital reported that UNRWA was forced to fire nine employees because of their likely involvement in Hamas's slaughter of nearly 1,200 people on Oct. 7 in southern Israel.

When approached by Fox News Digital, Juliette Touma, a UNRWA spokesperson, claimed ""The Israeli authorities have not requested UNRWA officially to provide them with the list of staff killed in yesterday's attack on the UNRWA school."" She added, ""The names that appear on today's statement from the Israeli Army have not been flagged to us before by the Israeli authorities in previous occasions prior to today.""

She complained, ""We always find out about these very serious allegations in the media. After the event."" Schools in Gaza have not been in session since shortly after Israel waged war on Hamas in reaction to the Oct. 7 massacre in southern Israel.

DOSSIER REVEALS INFORMATION USED TO EXPLAIN UN AGENCY'S DEEP TIES TO HAMAS IN GAZA

Fox News Digital asked the Israel Defense Forces about Touma's statement. An IDF spokesman said ""From what I understood, it's pretty clear in Gaza who belongs to who. I don't think this is a surprise at all to anyone in UNRWA, just an attempt to shift the discussion and blame."" The IDF spokesman stressed that the UNRWA spokeswoman's comment ""Sounds like a diversion from talking about the important issue - terrorists working for the organization and using UNRWA as a cover.""

Hillel Neuer, executive director of U.N. Watch, told Fox News Digital. ""This was a precision strike targeting terrorists who embedded a command and control center within a compound that had previously served as a school. The U.N. should be condemning Hamas for using civilian buildings for military purposes, which is a war crime under the Geneva Conventions. Instead, they rushed to condemn Israel.""

Neuer, who has testified to Congress about the controversial agency, claimed, ""UNRWA is deeply complicit with the Hamas terrorist organization. Their staff routinely celebrate terrorist attacks against Israelis and Jews, as we have identified in numerous of our reports, listing some 200 names. Next, we identified heads of UNRWA teachers unions, who are senior officials within Hamas. Suhail al-Hindi, who for many years headed the UNRWA teachers union in Gaza, is sitting on the Hamas political bureau with Yahya Sinwar. Likewise, the head of the UNRWA teachers' union in Lebanon, Fathi al-Sharif, is a senior Hamas terrorist, documented on our website, unwatch.org.""

He called on foreign governments to stop funding UNRWA. ""It is high time for all western states who are giving more than a billion dollars to UNRWA to stop funding a terror-infested agency. The Swiss parliament rightly called to stop funding it, and to end UNRWA altogether. We urge all other democracies, the U.S., UK, France, Germany, and Japan, to do the same.""

UNRWA's Touma decried the Swiss decision. ""Switzerland's lower parliament votes to suspend funding to UNRWA. It is beyond comprehension that this happens in circumstances where the Agency is at the forefront of lifesaving humanitarian work in Gaza. Switzerland has been known for championing humanitarian aid and playing a leading role in promoting international humanitarian law.""

Touma added, ""Parliamentarians voting to phase out a U.N. General Assembly mandated Agency without offering a political alternative to Palestinians under occupation are again on the wrong side of history.""

The U.S. suspended funding to UNRWA because of the role some of its employees played in the Oct. 7 massacre.

"Queers for Palestine? Group offers $1 million for LGBTQ advocacy org to hosts Pride parade in Gaza, West Bank",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/queers-palestine-group-offers-1-million-lgbtq-advocacy-org-hosts-pride-parade-gaza-west-bank,2024-09-16T09:12:48Z,"FIRST ON FOX - A watchdog group that aims to expose hypocrisy announced Monday that it would donate $1 million to ""Queers for Palestine"" or any U.S. LGBTQ advocacy organization to host a gay pride parade in Gaza or the West Bank.

Anti-Israel groups such as ""Queers for Palestine"" have surfaced across America since the Hamas terror group attacked Israel on October 6, but homosexuality remains deeply taboo in the Palestinian territories. Gay and transgender people in Gaza and the West Bank face a significant level of persecution and are often subjected to horrific acts.

New Tolerance Campaign (NTC) President Gregory T. Angelo, who is gay and the former president of Log Cabin Republicans, said the campaign is a ""wake-up call"" to anyone who identifies as part of the ""Queers for Palestine"" or ""Gays for Gaza"" movements.

""I don't want people to just shrug off this campaign as some kind of publicity stunt or something that is supposed to be comical. It actually is a legitimate offer,"" Angelo told Fox News Digital.

A PRIDE MONTH NOTE TO QUEERS FOR PALESTINE

""This campaign emerged to call out these purported advocates of LGBT equality and put our money where their mouths are,"" he continued. ""I think that this is a real opportunity for these groups to legitimately step up and host an event that would either highlight the fact that the Palestinian territories are not indeed a good place for LGBTQ individuals to be living, or it could be a breakthrough moment for pluralism and peace in the Middle East.""

The New Tolerance Campaign said it secured commitments for the $1 million prize and will begin publicizing the offer with mobile billboards circulating around Columbia University in New York City, the headquarters of the Human Rights Campaign in Washington, D.C. and UCLA in Los Angeles.

""Obviously, the $1 million prize is something that is flashy. It was designed to get attention; it was designed to turn heads. But the greater drive behind this project is one of equality and broad human rights,"" Angelo said.

The campaign will also allow everyday Americans to send messages directly to the senior leadership of the Human Rights Campaign, GLAAD, the LGBTQ Task Force, and Advocates for Trans Equality encouraging them to fight for LGBTQ rights in Palestinian territories and Arab countries.

""On the left in the United States, all oppression is the same oppression. And I think the left, quite to their disservice, lumps everything from racial discrimination to sexual orientation discrimination to gender discrimination to Islamophobia, all under the same umbrella. That's certainly not the case,"" Angelo said.

Angelo said that many anti-Israel protesters across the United States insist LGBTQ people aren't treated particularly well in the United States when confronted with facts about how they would be treated in Gaza or the West Bank.

""Well, that could not be further from the truth. Here in the United States, we have protection from job discrimination for gay and trans individuals that came through a Supreme Court ruling. We have same-sex marriage is the law of the land in all 50 states, and just more generally, aside from legislation, we have a country that welcomes people of all faiths and family types,"" Angelo said.

""Contrast that with what you see over in the Palestinian territories where same-sex marriage isn't something that's even a possibility or discussed,"" he said. ""There are no protections in terms of employment for sexual orientation or gender.""

Palestinian Authority police in 2019 barred gay and transgender rights group from holding events in the West Bank and threatened to arrest participants. Meanwhile, Israel frequently promotes its tolerance on issues of sexual orientation and Tel Aviv is proud of its reputation as a top destination for gay and lesbian travelers.

Angelo said he was stunned in 2013 when he visited the West Bank during an immersion trip to Israel.

""I got to see with my own eyes the disparity in, not just gay rights, but really human rights that are evident when you cross over between Israel and into the Palestinian territories,"" Angelo said.

New Tolerance Campaign bills itself as a ""watchdog organization mobilizing Americans to confront intolerance double-standards by establishment institutions, civil rights groups, universities, and socially-conscious brands,"" according to its website.

""NTC action campaigns empower ordinary Americans to hold accountable self-proclaimed arbiters of tolerance when they betray their own stated values,"" the site says."
Disabled veteran arrested at Rutgers after posting anti-Hamas flyers: 'Not going to let anyone censor me',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/disabled-veteran-arrested-rutgers-posting-anti-hamas-flyers-not-going-let-anyone-censor-me,2024-09-16T09:08:51Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A Rutgers Law School student who mounted a counter-protest against anti-Israel demonstrators on campus was arrested by police after he refused to stop posting flyers that labeled Hamas as ""savages.""

Yiorgos ""George"" Maravelias, a disabled veteran who previously served as a United States Army First Lieutenant and deployed to Afghanistan, first engaged in campus activism in November 2023. He told Fox News Digital that after October 7, a vocal minority of law school students erected tables and hung flyers that criticized Israel's actions in Gaza.

""I set up a table right next to them with my beliefs, which is that Hamas are rapists, that they are monsters, savages. That October 7 was a terrorist attack. You know, basically, I believe that a lot of the statements that they apply towards Israel, I think they fully hold against America,"" he said.

Maravelias said he then began hanging his flyers on walls and spaces that were riddled with anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian content. Soon after, a woman began ripping down his posters.

RUTGERS STUDENTS WHO STOOD UP TO ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTS WITH USA CHANT SPEAK OUT: 'FED UP WITH ANTI-AMERICANISM'

""I addressed this person. I said, what are you doing? Like, why are you ripping down my flyers? And she told me that it was against the policy to put flyers where I had my flyers, which were right next to where these -- there were these bulletin boards that the whole entire bulletin board was one speech and one viewpoint,"" he told Fox News Digital.

The woman, who was later identified as distinguished professor of law and Chancellor's Social Justice Scholar Sahar Aziz, escorted Maravelias up to Dean Cate Lysionek's office with his crumpled papers in hand. Maravelias claimed that Aziz was informed that no such policy prevented him from engaging in political speech.

Speaking in her individual capacity and not as a representative of Rutgers, Aziz refuted Maravelias' claim that she was informed no policy against his actions existed. She told Fox News Digital that at the time the flyers were posted, the law school had a signage policy prohibiting students from posting flyers on the bare walls of the law school atrium. Flyers could only be posted on the bulletin boards.

Aziz stated that Maravelias violated this policy when he posted numerous signs on the walls and claimed that no other flyers were taped on the atrium walls at the time.

Maravelias said Lysionek told him to report the incident to Dean Johanna Bond as there were consistent reports of Aziz interfering with the free speech of students opposed to the pro-Palestinian activists.

Aziz said she has not interfered with the free speech of students on campus, regardless of their viewpoints, and suggested there is no evidence of Maravelias' ""false claim.""

RUTGERS UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR SAYS WITHOUT DEI OFFICES, THERE IS 'NO ABILITY TO MAKE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS'

She noted that other faculty have hosted at least two pro-Israeli events featuring the Zionist Organization of America and Stand With Us. To her knowledge, the events occurred without interference.

""In stark contrast, there are external self-described Zionist organizations who have sought to censor Palestine-related programming hosted by the Center for Security, Race and Rights - which is an academic center focused on the civil rights of Muslims, Arabs, and South Asians. Fortunately, Rutgers University has an academic freedom policy that applies to all faculty regardless of viewpoint or identity,"" she added.

Maravelias said he brought the incident to the attention of Dean Johanna Bond and Dean Sarah K. Regina.

Bond allegedly declined to repudiate Aziz's actions and refused to meet with Maravelias to discuss the matter.

He also emailed Rutgers President Jonathan Holloway, alleging the school had violated his First Amendment rights.

""In the Army it's an open-door policy. You send it up the chain of command. I heard nothing,"" Maravelias said.

Dean Bond, Dean Regina, Lysionek, and President Holloway did not reply to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

He would again engage in a counter-protest in May when protesters set up an encampment on Rutgers' Newark grounds. Protesters hung signs with phrases like ""From the river to the sea"" and ""Globalize the Intifada."" They also created a list of demands -- one of which stipulated that no military recruiters could be allowed on Rutgers campuses.

JEWISH STUDENTS AT RUTGERS SPEAK OUT IN WAKE OF LATEST ANTI-ISRAEL INCIDENT ON CAMPUS: 'HORRIFYING EXPERIENCE'

""I found that to be grotesque, disgusting, offensive. So, I decided to go down to Rutgers and participate with, once again, the speech that I had in the fall. Same, same exact point of view. Nothing that I would deem to be offensive. Nothing against Palestinian people, nothing racist, Islamophobic or bigoted otherwise,"" he said.

That night, several individuals ripped down his flyers. Campus security instructed him to file a complaint with the police.

""I go to the police. They say, 'Oh, we can't do anything about this.' So, I'm like, where's the accountability? Like, why is my speech being ripped down?"" he told Fox News Digital.

The following day, Maravelias visited Dean Regina's office and asked what the rules were for posting around the school and how he could get accountability if anyone obstructed his speech. Leadership, according to Maravelias, had no answer.

""I said, 'I'm going to go participate in my speech. I'm letting you know right now that if anybody touches my flyers, it's tit for tat. They rip down mine; I'm gonna rip down theirs. I'm not gonna let anybody censor me while I'm participating in free speech,'"" Maravelias recalled.

He then went outside and taped up flyers that criticized Hamas and tied small Israeli and American flags together. Maravelias said he was verbally excoriated by the pro-Palestinian crowd calling him a ""baby killer, genocidal maniac, Zionist"" and more. While he left the encampment's messages in place, activists tore them down as soon as he posted his flyers.

A large group of Rutgers University police officers then surrounded Maravelias. They allegedly asked to speak with him privately.

""I'm like, I'm going to post my flyers where their flyers are posted. If you want to talk to me, I'll talk right here. They kept on trying to, you know, reason with me or try to stop me from posting my flyers,"" he said.

One police officer instructed another to rip down his flyers that said, ""Stand with Israel"" and ""Stand with America."" Maravelias said he was told his speech was ""inflammatory.""

""I go, what happens if I continue to post my speech? Am I going to be arrested? Because if you're ripping down my flyers and I keep posting flyers like, where does this go? What's going to happen? He's like, yes, you'll be arrested,"" Maravelias said.

When he refused to stop posting flyers in the same area where the protest encampment had placed hundreds of signs, the police asked Maravelias to put his hands behind his back.

The Rutgers Police Department then arrested Maravelias, detained him at their station, fingerprinted and photographed him. He was in custody for several hours before being released.

Rutgers University Police Department did not return Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Maravelias had charges filed against him for a petty disorderly persons offense.

The summons issued to Maravelias said, ""Within the jurisdiction of this court, purposely cause or recklessly create the risk of public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm by, specifically by creating a hazardous or physically dangerous condition by an act which serves no legitimate purpose of himself.""

He graduated from Rutgers Law School soon after.

Maravelias said he does not believe there is anything wrong with Rutgers as an institution. Still, he said there needs to be an evaluation to see if people in leadership positions at the school are living up to university standards.

""I think we need to have a real leadership reckoning with the Rutgers institution, especially the law school,"" he said.

Charges against Maravelias were dismissed in July 2024 at the first substantive court date. Rutgers also filed student conduct administrative charges against him and refused to expunge them, according to his lawyer, Christopher J. D'Alessandro.

D'Alessandro was in the Army in the early 1990s. He went to college on a GI Bill and started working for the New Jersey State Parole Board in 1997. He re-enlisted in the New Jersey Army National Guard in 2005 and deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, citing the impact of the 9/11 attacks. D'Alessandro continues to serve as a logistics officer and retired from parole in 2015.

He later attended Rutgers Law School and did a fellowship at Rutgers Law Associates. D'Alessandro is also the former VP of Veteran Alumni at Rutgers University.

COLUMBIA ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS TO REACH 'CRESCENDO OF INTIMIDATION' AS SCHOOL SUFFERS LATEST BLACK EYE

""This is an issue not just for [Maravelias], but for any veteran that would go to Rutgers, and I've encouraged many veterans to go to Rutgers Law School. In fact, I try to talk every veteran into going to Rutgers Law School,"" D'Alessandro told Fox News Digital.

""So, this is a problem that needs to be fixed because I want to be proud of the school I went to and I want to be able to tell a veteran in good conscience, this is a law school that you want to go to because they'll teach you how to obtain justice,"" he continued.

D'Alessandro said that the manner in which Rutgers addressed the Newark anti-Israel encampment was wildly divergent from the way they treated his client.

Citing a Rutgers statement, D'Alessandro, in his personal opinion, said that the school negotiated with the ""pro-Hamas encampment,"" many of whom were non-students, and instead of applying laws, rules, and regulations, allowed the encampment residents to act with impunity.

Maravelias revealed that Newark Mayor Ras Baraka issued 10 housing stipends to encampment protesters because they were homeless.

He also noted that Rutgers had expressed no interest in settling the matter.

Baraka's office did not return Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Maravelias said he received a letter directly from the school stating that while the conduct charges would not be pursued (as he had since graduated), should he ever re-enroll at Rutgers, the charges would be reinstated.

RUTGERS STUDENTS COUNTER ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS ON CAMPUS BY WAVING AMERICAN FLAG, CHANTING 'USA! USA!'

D'Alessandro said that to obtain the Body Worn Camera footage of Maravelias' arrest, Rutgers is requiring them to pay an $804 fee. In addition, they claim Rutgers has refused to produce CCTV surveillance footage of the event, claiming it would jeopardize campus security.

""I did not take the bar exam because I have been too distracted by fighting the criminal charges to study effectively. The actions of Rutgers taken against me also affect my being barred, as I have to pass Character and Fitness, disclosing all that has transpired to the Bar,"" Maravelias said.

D'Alessandro said Maravelias' situation reminds him of an old police adage he recalled from his time in law enforcement: ""You might beat the rap, you won't beat the ride.""

While Maravelias had his charges dismissed, D'Alessandro said he was still arrested, publicly humiliated, made to feel like a criminal, taken down to the station, stuck in a cell, fingerprinted, and photographed. That booking will go into the system that anybody who looks up his client will be able to see.

Maravelias had no legal fees for the Defense. He was represented pro bono by a defense attorney.

D'Alessandro said the case is disappointing because, as a veteran who often represents other veterans in employment cases, they are a group who routinely have their rights violated.

""I learned how to be a lawyer at Rutgers. They taught me to do what I'm doing now. That's a school where I learned to seek justice for my clients. So, it's extremely disappointing that I have to go up against the place I graduated from because they denied a law student First Amendment rights. You can't even make that up,"" he said.

Rutgers Law School did not return Fox News Digital's request for comment."
Hezbollah's neighbors: Israeli border community under constant attack from terror group,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollahs-neighbors-israeli-border-community-under-constant-attack-from-terror-group,2024-09-15T14:18:17Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Six months after Yulia Bar-Dan and her family fled their home on a kibbutz in northern Israel fearing a possible Hezbollah assault following the horrendous Hamas attack of Oct. 7, she returned to gather what she could from a lifetime of memories she'd left behind.

One hour was all she had. ""We were given a chance, under the cover of darkness, to return home for the first time,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""I cried the whole time.""

When she arrived, Kibbutz Manara, once home to close to 300 people, looked like a war zone. ""We heard explosions above us and hurried to our house - the one closest to the Lebanese border. There was no electricity, and we couldn't open the windows,"" she said.

HEZBOLLAH RELIES ON 'SOPHISTICATED' TUNNEL SYSTEM BACKED BY IRAN, NORTH KOREA IN FIGHT AGAINST ISRAEL

With a flashlight in hand, she went room to room, gathering as much as she could in a large trash bag. The family of five is now living in a single room and there's not much space for extras. ""My daughter wanted her dollhouse, but I couldn't bring it. The happiest moment was finding our cat alive. Seeing him brought real joy to the kids,"" she says.

Not long after she collected her belongings and left the kibbutz, a Hezbollah missile hit her house. The strike added her home to the staggering 75% of kibbutz structures in the north that have been damaged by Hezbollah's relentless bombardments.

Since Hezbollah joined the war as a ""support front"" for Hamas on Oct. 8, over 7,500 rockets have been fired from Lebanon into Israel, and more than 200 drones have crossed the border. The toll: 44 people have been killed, 271 wounded and 62,000 evacuated from dozens of communities in northern Israel. Those who have left have no idea when - or even if - they will ever return. The damage to agriculture and tourism has reached billions of dollars, and there is widespread fear that this conflict will escalate further.

The decision to evacuate most northern communities immediately after Oct. 7 didn't come from the government, which was slow to respond. It came from the residents themselves. ""It's sheer luck that Hezbollah's Radwan forces didn't join Hamas in the massacre; if they had, nothing would have stopped them,"" says Yochai Wolfin, the community director of Kibbutz Manara. ""We are right on the border and at high risk. We've known for at least 10 years that Hezbollah's Radwan forces have a plan they've been training to invade the Galilee, seize multiple communities and do here exactly what we saw happen in the south.""

ISRAEL WARNS US DEFENSE CHIEF IRAN AGGRESSION HAS 'REACHED ALL-TIME HIGH'

Naor Shamia, who has lived with his wife and three children on Kibbutz Manara since 2011, doesn't sugarcoat the response of people living near the northern border following Oct. 7. ""We ran away. We were terrified they would slaughter us, just like they did in the Gaza envelope,"" he recalled.

Since Oct. 7, Shamia, who typically would spend his days teaching math and physics, has been focused on leading the kibbutz's rapid response unit - a band of community members with combat experience - which has been tasked with defending against terrorist infiltrations, rocket fire and even wildfires ignited by hot shrapnel or missile impacts. ""Much of Kibbutz Manara is visible from Lebanon, which makes our situation even more challenging,"" Shamia says. ""You can walk through parts of the kibbutz and be fully exposed to Hezbollah.""

In December, when members of the rapid response unit rushed to a blaze that had been sparked by an anti-tank missile, Hezbollah fired three more missiles, injuring two members of the unit. ""Manara sits on a high ridge, making us an easy target for anti-tank missiles,"" Shamia says. ""We're exposed.""

Established in 1943, the kibbutz economy has been primarily based on agriculture, including a famous vineyard, cherry and apple orchards, and poultry farming. Today, much of that has been destroyed by Hezbollah's rockets. The vineyard was burned and the orchards, located in frequently targeted areas, were abandoned.

An aluminum business, which Yulia's husband, Nadav, ran, was also destroyed by a missile strike. Since then, he has been serving with the rapid response unit, while Bar-Dan and their three children live in a single room on a kibbutz in the north but away from the border.

""There's no official declaration of war here, but we're living as if there is a war, constantly bombarded by drones and missiles,"" she says. ""The children go to school, but they spent two hours in a shelter today because of missile fire. People might ask, 'Why don't you move somewhere else?' But this is our home. I can't imagine living anywhere else.""

She continued, ""What would happen if she and others pulled up roots and abandoned the northernmost regions of Israel? Manara is on the border. If we're not there, who will be? We have to come back.""

She says she hopes for the day when the government comes to understand what's at stake ""and does what's necessary to change the situation in the north. While the world's attention is focused elsewhere,"" adding, ""the war between Israel and Hezbollah has left northern Israel in a state of devastation."""
Parents of 22-year-old American held by Hamas speak out: 'They're holding our children',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/parents-22-year-old-american-held-hamas-speak-theyre-holding-our-children,2024-09-14T12:37:09Z,"Ronen and Orna Neutra, New York residents and the parents of Omer Neutra, share how they cope with their son being held hostage by Hamas.

Omer Neutra, a 22-year-old American, has been held hostage by Hamas for more than 330 days.

His parents, Orna and Ronen Neutra, residents of Long Island, told Fox News Digital their son is a friend to everyone.

""He sees people. He pays attention. He has this great sense of humor. So, he touches so many,"" said Orna Neutra.

SURVIVOR OF HAMAS TERROR ATTACK ON ISRAEL RECOUNTS PAIN, GRIEF OF LOSING 'ANGEL' BOYFRIEND ON OCT. 7

He and others have remained in captivity since Oct. 7, 2023, including Israeli American Hersh Goldberg-Polin.

Goldberg-Polin's family confirmed Hersh's death Sunday after he was murdered by Hamas. The Neutra family expressed devastation about the loss.

""They are practically our family now. And knowing that Hersh managed to survive 11 months in the most terrible conditions, including his injury and everything else. And to be executed the way he was with [the] other five hostages is just appalling and shows us who we're dealing with. Hamas is a bunch of monsters,"" Ronen said.

Goldberg-Polin's body was among the remains of six hostages recovered by the Israel Defense Forces.

""This intensifies the sense of urgency to get them out, actually. It's been way too long. Their lives are at risk every single day. ... It's a terror organization. We realize that, and that only makes it even more urgent to get them out because we see that, as time goes by, the risk only increases,"" Orna said.

At least seven American citizen hostages are believed to be in Gaza.

""Unfortunately, making a deal with a terrorist organization like Hamas, it's that impossible. It's not like we're negotiating with them. It's what they want. They're holding our children. You can't negotiate with them. You know, it's almost like losing in advance because they're holding our precious ones so that, you know, they are putting the rules of the game,"" Ronen said.

Orna and Ronen are dual American Israeli citizens with Holocaust survivors on both sides of the family.

After the war, he moved to Israel and was one of the few who survived.

Orna's grandfather saved his family multiple times from the Nazis and hid on the Polish border with Slovakia, she said.

""Due to resiliency and taking action and not waiting for things to just resolve themselves -- these are the qualities that saved both of our families. And we're really praying and hoping that Omer embodies these qualities and is surviving,"" she added.

Orna said people who care about the Palestinian people should be focused on the release of hostages.

""If you are really concerned about loss of life and the devastation in the region, which we are too, then you should be calling for the release of the hostages and for complete escalation in the region and for Hamas to surrender,"" she said.

The Neutras said they have been speaking with the White House on a regular basis, but until their son is back, not enough has been done.

Universities of Wisconsin introduce policy requiring college leaders to stay neutral on controversial issues,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/universities-wisconsin-introduce-policy-requiring-college-leaders-stay-neutral-controversial-issues,2024-09-14T06:14:27Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Universities of Wisconsin leaders must remain neutral in public statements on political and social issues, and they should only make public statements on matters affecting school operations, under a new policy the university system released Friday.

Under the new policy, university leaders' public statements must be limited to matters that directly affect university operations and the university's mission, and they must maintain viewpoint neutrality when referencing any political or social controversy.

The purpose of the policy is ""to uphold and protect academic freedom, freedom of expression, and an environment in which competing ideas can be freely discussed and debated by all members of the university community,"" the policy states.

The policy applies to the system president and vice presidents, the university chancellors, provosts, vice chancellors, deans, directors, department chairs and anyone else who may be perceived as speaking on behalf of a system institution.

PRO-ISRAEL DEMONSTRATOR IN MASS. CHARGED AFTER FIRING AT ATTACKER IN APPARENT SELF-DEFENSE SHOOTING

Any expression of support or opposition must be approved by UW system President Jay Rothman or the university's chancellor.

Statements expressing solidarity or empathy should be avoided if they suggest support for one group's viewpoint over another, the new police states.

The policy does not apply to faculty or staff who may express their expertise or judgment as it relates to their academic discipline or research expertise, including analysis or commentary on a political or social issue.

But, the policy notes, faculty and staff should be careful when posting such statements on university-owned channels to ensure they would not be misconstrued as being made on behalf of the institution. The policy also does not apply to faculty and staff's personal statements on non-university-owned channels.

Rothman and university chancellors may also adopt additional guidance and procedures requiring faculty and staff to include disclaimers when not representing the institution, according to the policy.

The president and chancellors may not expand the scope of the policy to restrict the free expression rights of people or groups of individuals who do not present themselves as speaking on behalf of the institution.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the UW System for comment.

UW system spokesperson Mark Pitsch told The Associated Press that the policy will take effect immediately and does not require the approval of the board of regents.

The policy comes after UW-Milwaukee Chancellor Mark Mone made a deal with anti-Israel demonstrators in May to end campus protests. The agreement, which was slammed by Jewish groups, included the university calling for a cease-fire in the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas as well as for the university to discuss severing ties with Israeli companies.

Rothman criticized Mone's decision to make the deal, writing on the social media platform X that campuses need to remain viewpoint-neutral and ensure actions on campus have consequences.

Mone announced this summer that he plans to resign next year, although he has not specifically said why he is stepping down. He said he is leaving his position next year to give time to find his replacement.

Republican lawmakers have criticized higher education for years, saying conservative voices are censored on campuses across the country while liberal voices are welcomed.

A supporter of Vice President Kamala Harris shouted back at several pro-Palestinian protesters who appeared outside the throng lined up to see the Democratic presidential nominee at Wilkes University on Friday.

""Did I hear something about Hamas?"" a Harris supporter who later identified himself as Frank from Stroudsburg, Pa., hollered back at a man waving a Palestinian flag and criticizing the protesters. The man was joined by a female protester, whose own remarks preceded his, and about five other people.

""You are a bull---- spreader,"" the male pro-Palestinian protester shot back. ""You are the cowardly one here. Come show your muscle... Let the people live; that's what we want.""

The woman had been shouting at the crowd, trying to make the case that there is little daylight between Harris and former President Trump on the issue of the Israel-Gaza conflict and the Jerusalem government's response to the October 7 terror attack.

KAMALA HARRIS: WE NEED A 'CEASE-FIRE' AND CHART A COURSE FOR A 'TWO-STATE SOLUTION'

Frank told Fox News Digital after the kerfuffle that he effectively had had enough of the protesters' invective and had to say something.

""Everybody agrees that the war [in Gaza] is horrible... but they're complaining about Kamala, who has called for a cease fire.

""[The protesters] are representing the Palestinians, which is fine, but they say nothing about Hamas and the horror that started this whole thing,"" Frank added.

""And they don't say anything about how Hamas uses the Palestinians as human shields. So, you know, United States has been trying to negotiate a cease fire here for months and months. And the problem is Netanyahu and the right wing of the Israeli government -- they don't even want a two-state solution.""

Frank criticize Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has and will continue engage in indiscriminate bombings of Gazan territory - while underlining additionally that the U.S. made a promise to Israel and should uphold it:

""[America] has a commitment, a long-standing commitment since the year I was born to defend Israel's right to exist. Hamas's stated purpose is to end Israel as a state,"" he said.

REPORTS OF BIDEN WHITE HOUSE KEEPING 'SENSITIVE' HAMAS INTEL FROM ISRAEL DRAWS OUTRAGE

""You know, look, these guys have a perfect right to say whatever they want to say, but it's a very narrow view of everything; what's really going on here. And virtually everybody wants peace.""

""Kamala Harris is on record as advocating for a cease fire. So, you know, aim your anger where it might do some good.""

After speaking with Frank, Fox News Digital also caught up with Loai, the male protester who had been jawing with the Harris supporter.

Loai said he was born in Palestinian territory but now lives locally in the Wyoming Valley.

When asked why he and his group are protesting the Harris rally, Loai said the vice president supports ""Zionists [and is] supporting Israel.""

Loai added that both Harris and Trump are ""essentially"" the same on the matter. When asked who he prefers if he had to choose, Loai quipped, ""let's see who is less smelly.""

""We want to see the genocide stop,"" he added.

Loai said he also ""doesn't care"" about Israel - and personally is not calling for its demise, as other protesters have shouted ""from the river to the sea"" - a phrase connected to calls for the destruction of Israel.

""We don't care about Israel; that they exist or not. That's not our business. We are American here. We want this genocide to be stopped. - Wherever they go, they just [need] to get the Hell out of [the Palestinian territory]."""
"Israel says top Hamas Rafah brigade 'dismantled' on Philadelphi Corridor, 2,000 terrorists killed",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-says-top-hamas-rafah-brigade-dismantled-philadelphi-corridor-2000-terrorists-killed,2024-09-13T19:16:34Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Thursday said its troops had ""dismantled"" Hamas' Rafah brigade on the Philadelphi Corridor as they look to eliminate cross-border tunnels into Egypt.

In a press release the IDF said its troops in the 162nd Division had conducted ""precise, intelligence-based, targeted operations in the Rafah area over the last few months"" and ""eliminated over 2,000 terrorists.""

Israeli forces destroyed a reported 8 miles of underground routes and have neutralized roughly 80% of all Hamas' tunnels on the strategic security corridor, which runs alongside the border with Egypt.

HEZBOLLAH RELIES ON 'SOPHISTICATED' TUNNEL SYSTEM BACKED BY IRAN, NORTH KOREA IN FIGHT AGAINST ISRAEL

The Rafah brigade was considered one of Hamas' last remaining strongholds, according to the Times of Israel.

Israeli forces continue to conduct operations in the Tel al-Sultan area, located in the south-western portion of Gaza and just north of the Philadelphi Corridor, where tunnels continue to be located and destroyed.

The IDF said that during an operation in the Tel A-Sultan area, first launched a couple of weeks ago, Commander of the Tel al-Sultan Battalion Mahmoud Hamdan had been killed along with 250 other Hamas terrorists.

The Philadelphi Corridor has become a major point of contention as the U.S. looks to establish a cease-fire agreement with the aid of Qatar and Egypt, between Israel and Hamas.

IRAN THREATENS 'NIGHTMARE' FOR ISRAEL AS UN WATCHDOG WARNS TEHRAN NUCLEAR PROGRAMS RUNS UNCHECKED

But any negotiations appear to have reached an impasse as Hamas has suggested that it will not agree to any cease-fire terms so long as Israeli forces remain in the security corridor in Gaza. Similarly, Jerusalem has rejected any calls for it to vacate the corridor, citing security concerns stemming from not only existing Hamas terrorists in Gaza, but also threats posed from the Sinai Peninsula.

Securing the release of all hostages taken by the Hamas terrorist group also remains a top issue for Israel, as officials like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have warned that there are mounting concerns that hostages could be smuggled out of Gaza through the Sinai Peninsula and into the hands of the Iranians.

Brig. Gen. Itzik Cohen, commander of the 162nd Division, told the Times of Israel that his troops had located 203 separate but interconnected tunnels in the Philadelphi Corridor, nine of which crossed over the border with Egypt.

The commander also noted that all nine tunnels had been made inoperable prior to the discovery by IDF soldiers, either by Egyptian or Hamas forces.

The remaining tunnels that have not yet been destroyed are currently being investigated and will be neutralized once all searches of the tunnels are complete."

A 20-year-old Maryland woman who was caught on video spray-painting ""Gaza"" on the Columbus Fountain outside of Washington, D.C.'s Union Station earlier this summer has been arrested Friday and is now facing a federal charge, prosecutors say.

Isabella Giordano of Towson is set to make her first court appearance this afternoon on one count of willfully injuring or depredating any property of the United States, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia. The incident allegedly happened as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was visiting the area.

""Footage obtained from a review of open-source videos posted to X (formerly Twitter) showed Giordano using red spray paint to write 'Gaza' on the Columbus Fountain,"" the Attorney's Office said, referring to an incident on July 24. ""She also spray-painted the base of two of the flagpoles in Columbus Circle.""

Prosecutors say the U.S. Park Police later received tips identifying Giordano and that she was taken into custody this morning.

""According to court documents, on July 24, 2024, an organization was granted a permit to demonstrate in the area of Columbus Circle, located at Massachusetts Ave. NE, and E St. NE, directly in front of Union Station. From approximately 3 p.m. until 5 p.m., demonstrators who had gathered in Columbus Circle pulled down flags affixed to the flagpoles; burned flags and objects; sprayed graffiti on multiple statutes and structures; and interfered with law enforcement's ability to place individuals under arrest,"" the Attorney's Office said.

"Harris' support for Palestinian state rewards terrorism, experts warn",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/harris-support-palestinian-state-rewards-terrorism-experts-warn,2024-09-12T08:16:17Z,"JERUSALEM -- Vice President Harris' endorsement of a Palestinian state during and prior to her debate with former President Trump would further destabilize the Middle East and bring about additional terrorism, according to Israeli and American experts.

During Tuesday's presidential debate on ABC, the Democrat presidential candidate reiterated her support for a two-state solution: ""I will always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates ... to Iran and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel. But we must have a two-state solution where we can rebuild Gaza, where the Palestinians have security, self-determination and the dignity they so rightly deserve.""

The two-state solution means an independent Palestinian state on Israel's borders that encompasses the West Bank territory (known in Israel by its biblical name of Judea and Samaria) and the Gaza Strip. Biden faced intense criticism in February for ignoring the outbreak of Palestinian terrorism in Judea and Samaria while singling out Israeli residents of the region for sanctions.

WITNESS TO TERRORISM: HOW HAMAS RADICALIZED PALESTINIANS FOR THEIR GENOCIDAL ATTACK ON ISRAEL

Trump's former ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, told Fox News Digital, ""After Oct. 7th, the two-state became a dead letter. A Palestinian state between Israel and Jordan will destabilize both countries and bring only additional terror and misery.""

Friedman, who authored the new book, ""One Jewish State: The Last, Best Hope to Resolve the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,"" added, ""Vice President Harris should stop parroting failed theories and trying to force a square peg into a round hole. She should empower Israel to reach a just and workable solution on its own and not interfere in matters where she is neither competent nor well-informed.""

In early September, Friedman blasted Biden on Fox News' ""Your World"" for creating rifts within Israeli society.

Jonathan Conricus, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for 24 years as a combat commander and spokesperson, told Fox News Digital, ""The so-called two-state solution may have been possible to implement 31 years ago, but four straight Palestinian rejections of Israeli peace offers have made it clear that the current Palestinian leadership does not aspire to end the conflict and achieve peace. Palestinian rejectionism has also eroded the political support for the peace process in Israel, since it has become abundantly clear that the Palestinian leadership does not seek peace.""

EXTREMISTS RISE IN NEW PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY GOVERNMENT AS BIDEN THREATENS ISRAEL OVER GAZA WAR

According to Conricus, ""Polling of the Palestinian population in Gaza and Palestinian Authority-controlled areas shows clear popular Palestinian support for Hamas, signaling that the Palestinian population supports the genocidal vision of annihilating Israel through jihad, as demonstrated by Hamas on Oct. 7. Global leaders would do well to listen to the two parties to the conflict to understand how the situation has changed and adapt diplomatic solutions to current possibilities. And whatever the outcome of the Oct. 7 war that Hamas waged against Israel, giving Hamas the ultimate prize of statehood would be devastating for regional stability and peace and for American global standing. Terror must not be awarded with statehood.""

Joel Rubin, former deputy assistant secretary of state and Democrat strategist, told Fox News Digital, ""The two-state solution is on life support right now, but just because this is a difficult moment to envision a peaceful endgame between Israel and the Palestinians that's rooted in diplomatic compromise, that does not mean it should not be the goal. After all, Israel fought multiple existential wars with Egypt and then, only years after the Yom Kippur War, concluded a peace deal that has held and provided Israel with deep security along its southern border for more than four decades. That is what a two-state solution is all about: Ending the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians in a manner that provides stability and security for the long haul.""

NETANYAHU HITS BACK OVER GLOBAL PRESSURE TO MAKE CEASE-FIRE CONCESSSIONS, SAYS DEMANDS ARE 'IMMORAL', 'INSANE'

Rubin, who is a longtime Jewish community activist, added, ""We have seen it achieved with Arab states. There is no reason that it can't be done with the Palestinians as long as the political will is there, extremism is rooted out and security arrangements are solid. So, for Vice President Harris to make this a priority is an inherently pro-Israel position, one that seeks to provide Israel with the long-term security and stability that it still clearly does not have.""

In late August, Harris noted her endorsement of a Palestinian state in an interview with CNN. She said, ""I remain committed since I've been on Oct. 8 to what we must do to work toward a two-state solution where Israel is secure and in equal measure the Palestinians have security and self-determination and dignity.""

ZIONISM EXPLAINED FROM ITS BIBLICAL ORIGINS TO THE REBIRTH OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL

The Harris campaign did not respond to multiple Fox News Digital press queries.

Harris and Biden have provided significant funding for the Palestinian Authority (PA), which is led by Mahmoud Abbas. The PA president is considered by some to be a moderate when compared to the Iranian regime-backed Hamas leadership. Abbas, however, supports stipends for convicted Palestinian terrorists and their families regarding the infamous ""pay for slay"" system that might mean the PA compensates Hamas terrorists.

Fox News Digital reported in November that many of the newly released convicted Palestinian terrorists who were part of a swap that secured the freedom of some Israeli and foreign hostages held by the terrorist movement Hamas could receive U.S. funds via the PA.

Itamar Marcus, director of Palestinian Media Watch, an Israeli-based organization researching Palestinian society, told Fox News Digital at the time, ""The American and European funding boosts the Palestinian Authority budget by $600 million. The Palestinian Authority pays the salaries of imprisoned terrorists and the family members of the martyrs, and the amount comes to $300 million a year.""

Last month, Abbas, according to a translation by the Middle East Media Research Institute, told the Turkish Parliament that ""America is the plague, and the plague is America"" and ""We implement Shari'a law: victory or martyrdom.""

The 88-year-old Abbas, who has clung to power since he took over the presidency of the PA in 2008, has been embroiled in antisemitism and Holocaust-distortion scandals over the years.

In 2022, Fox News Digital reported that Abbas delivered a tirade against Israel in Berlin, where the Holocaust - the mass extermination of European Jewry - was organized, claiming the Jewish state carried out ""50 holocausts."""
Bill Maher and Henry Winkler clash over war in Gaza: 'Are you watching the same footage I'm watching?',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-henry-winkler-clash-over-war-gaza-are-you-watching-same-footage-im-watching,2024-09-12T01:39:01Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Talk show host Bill Maher had a respectful debate with actor Henry Winkler about how Israel should conduct the war in Gaza.

The ""Club Random with Bill Maher"" podcast released an episode on Sunday where the host interviewed Winkler, who is known for playing Arthur ""Fonzie"" Fonzarelli on the sitcom ""Happy Days."" During the interview, Winkler, who is Jewish himself, expressed his frustrations over the war in Gaza and the plight of Israeli hostages. He argued of the Israeli military, ""They're not gonna eliminate Hamas, Hamas is an idea, not a group of people.""

Maher responded by arguing that World War II was a great example of destroying ideas by conquering regimes and turning the countries themselves into American allies, but Winkler suggested that the war's impact on civilians in Gaza is merely radicalizing more of them to join Hamas, ""You don't think that all those people that are now homeless, and their families are destroyed, you don't think that they are now Hamas again?""

They then went back and forth over whether Maher had been implying that by wiping enough Gazans, Hamas could be destroyed, an accusation the host denied, arguing he was simply objecting to the idea that an idea cannot be destroyed.

US TOP GENERAL SAYS TENSIONS IN MIDDLE EAST HAVE 'SOMEWHAT' EASED AMID NEW IRANIAN THREATS

Maher went on to argue that his response to people questioning Israel's conduct in the war is to ask, ""Do you know what's going on, really, underneath Gaza and all the tunnels and how close they are? I don't either, but you know who does know? The Israeli Defense Forces. Now are they perfect? Absolutely not, but again, they're not the ones purposely killing civilians. They try not to kill civilians. If you can't understand that difference, morally, then you're very morally confused.""

""Are you watching the same footage I'm watching?"" Winkler asked.

""You think they are trying to kill civilians?"" Maher replied.

""I think that it is indiscriminate,"" Winkler said.

""That's what war is,"" Maher replied. ""War becomes that. There is no war you can name that didn't. Sherman burned Atlanta to the ground and it wasn't just the military people he was killing. It's a shame, but again, there's a very simple solution to this: Stop attacking Israel. Jews used to know this.""

DEFENSE MINISTER SAYS ISRAEL MUST 'WIDEN THE GOALS' OF WAR TO RETURN RESIDENTS TO THE NORTH

Winkler and Maher expressed their mutual respect for each other, and the actor said that ""I disagree a little bit with what you're saying, I don't think that the head of Israel at this moment is a soulful human being.""

""That may be true too,"" Maher said. ""I didn't say he wasn't, and I didn't say even that he might not be doing what you suggested he might be doing. What I was saying is that even if those things are true, it could also be true that this is the correct policy, which I believe it is. I think you've gone 11 months to do this let's finish it while we're there."""
"Jewish Democrat suing Harvard over antisemitism chastises his party for inaction, endorses Trump",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jewish-democrat-suing-harvard-over-antisemitism-chastises-his-party-inaction-endorses-trump,2024-09-11T18:35:46Z,"Jewish activist and recent Harvard graduate Shabbos Kestenbaum, a registered Democrat, tells Fox News Digital he's decided to endorse former President Trump in 2024 because Kamala Harris ""does not deserve our support.""

A Jewish Democrat who is suing Harvard over antisemitism on campus following the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks in Israel explained to Fox News Digital his decision to endorse former President Donald Trump.

Shabbos Kestenbaum, who's testified before Congress and addressed the Republican National Convention in recent months about antisemitic threats on American college campuses, waited until Sept. 5 to announce that he was endorsing Trump during a speech at the Republican Jewish Coalition Annual Leadership Summit. In an interview with Fox News Digital this week, Kestenbaum, who registered as a Democrat when he turned 18 and has voted for Democratic candidates, including President Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., and former Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., said he could not support Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.

""To sort of paraphrase Ronald Reagan, I don't feel that I've abandoned the Democratic Party. I do feel that the Democratic Party abandoned me,"" Kestenbaum said, explaining that he still supports progressive polices, including a $15 minimum wage, ""reproductive choices for women,"" and ""progressive taxation."" ""But at the end of the day, when American Jewry is facing an existential crisis, we are faced with a binary choice. And I think in the electoral zero-sum game, the binary choice would be President Trump. I think he would just be better for the core issues that are affecting me, that are affecting the American Jewish community.""

FEDERAL JUDGE RULES HARVARD UNIVERSITY MUST FACE ANTISEMITISM LAWSUIT FROM JEWISH STUDENTS

After many months of trying to work with the Harris campaign, the White House and Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate, Kestenbaum said he came to the conclusion that even though he did not vote for Trump in the 2016 or 2020 elections - or even five months ago - he would support him in 2024 because Trump is the ""only realistic and viable option for American Jewry.""

Kestenbaum argued Trump has outlined specific, ""practical policy solutions,"" including withholding federal funds to universities that violate the civil rights of Jewish students and ""giving Israel whatever tools they need to dismantle Hamas and release the hostages,"" while the Biden-Harris administration and Harris' presidential campaign ""have done nothing.""

""They haven't earned our vote. They've ignored our questions or they've given us plainly contradictory answers. And they're taking our votes for granted,"" he said of the Harris campaign. ""So American Jewry, listen up. We will be the deciding factor in this election. There are enough of us in Michigan, in Arizona, in Georgia, in Nevada to really sway this election.""

Because Biden won states like Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania by small margins of between 13,000 to 30,000 votes in the 2020 election, and Jewish Americans make up anywhere from 1 to 3% of the population in those states, Kestenbaum said Jewish voters ""will be the crucial deciding factor"" in 2024. According to Kestenbaum, Trump is on track to receive the most Jewish votes for any Republican presidential nominee since President Dwight Eisenhower, which he credits to the Trump campaign as having ""really been courting the Jewish vote in a way that the Harris campaign just never has.""

JEWISH COLLEGE STUDENT: TOO OFTEN STUDENTS AT HARVARD ARE TAUGHT NOT HOW TO THINK, BUT WHAT TO THINK

""Jewish Americans will be pivotal in this election,"" Kestenbaum said. ""What I would urge the Jewish communities across the country, what I would urge my community, is we know what our issues are.""

""And I urge you, if you care about those policy prescriptions, if you care about the releasing of the hostages, you care about the strengthening of the U.S.-Israel relationship, you care about combating antisemitism on our college campuses, just look at the facts. Look at the data,"" he said. ""Harris has not outlined anything she would do specifically to alleviate those concerns. President Trump has. I get we don't like his persona. I get we don't like many of his policies. But at the end of the day, we are facing an existential issue. And I think there's only one viable choice, and that's President Trump.""

Kestenbaum said when he spoke to the RNC in July, he ad-libbed significant portions of his speech from the teleprompter to omit the parts explicitly endorsing Trump because he wanted to show he was ""bipartisan"" and keep an open mind before attending the Democratic National Convention in Chicago the next month. It took him two hours to get back to his seat after addressing the RNC because so many people came up to him with messages of support and prayers for the hostages who remained held in Gaza, he said.

Kestenbaum said he told DNC leadership that if they didn't want to amplify him at the convention, then at least consider amplifying other Jewish students ""who are fighting for their civil rights on college campuses, who are experiencing unprecedented antisemitism, and we never got a response.""

When he first testified before the House Education and the Workforce Committee about his experiences of antisemitism on Harvard's campus after Oct. 7, Kestenbaum said ""it was pretty remarkable that the majority of the Democratic leadership didn't even show up, and then the ranking Democratic member, Bobby Scott, he used his opening remarks to criticize Republicans for focusing on antisemitism. 'We need to be combating Islamophobia. We need to be combatting sexism,' which is true in theory, but had nothing to do with the reality on the ground and what we were there to testify on.""

""And I didn't want to say anything. I want it to be bipartisan or even nonpartisan. But these incidents just kept on happening. And whether it was the House Judiciary Committee ranking member, Democrat Jerry Nadler, falling asleep when I was giving testimony, it was deeply hurtful and offensive,"" Kestenbaum said. ""And again, I didn't want to say these things because I'm a Democrat and I went to the Democratic convention with an open mind and also with a mission to sort of change my party, to steer them into it, into a direction that would be more palpable for me and American Jewry. And it was very clear that at least for this election in 2024, they're either unable or unwilling to make serious inroads with the American Jewish community. And that's a direct result of them taking us for granted for decades.""

He said he is still a registered Democrat and ""is not ready to throw in the towel yet,"" but he can't decide why the Democratic Party is increasingly shifting toward more anti-Israel rhetoric.

""The state of Israel is a progressive issue. I mean, this is a place where not only can LGBTQ individuals be full members of society, but they serve in Israeli parliament,"" he said. ""This is a hotbed of democracy in an otherwise volatile, regressive region of the world. Israel is a vital ally that provides intelligence gathering to the United States. So why are we de-legitimizing? Why are we demoting a staunchly progressive ally? And I can't understand why my Democratic Party insist that this is proper politics.""

He also took issue with Harris for skipping Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress earlier this year, and for what he categorized as inadequate policy proposals on the Israel-Hamas war that the Democratic nominee finally added to her campaign website this week 50 days after entering the race.

""If Kamala Harris is working around the clock to secure a cease-fire deal and the return of the hostages, then I would shudder to think what four more years would do because she is not working around the clock. And if she is, she's doing a pretty crappy job at that,"" Kestenbaum told Fox News Digital. ""She does not deserve our support. She does not deserve our votes. It's also telling that after 50 days of having zero policies, she doesn't outline policy. She outlines aspirations and goals. Nothing. Nothing that she said on her website, in the one interview she has given, talks about the dismantling of Hamas as a terrorist organization.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

""If a cease fire was agreed to, Hamas would still be in power,"" he continued. ""It is laughable to say that she is working around the clock when we know that President Biden has been eating ice cream on the beaches of Delaware for almost the entirety of the summer. And if she is working around the clock, then as I said, she's doing a bad job. And why would we want her to continue to work around the clock for four years when she can't even get the job done now? So we don't need what I like to call the Beatle-Juicing of a cease fire, simply stating it three times and hoping that it'll appear. We need bold action. Under her leadership, under her watch, 45 Americans were killed in the Middle East, eight American hostages are still being held, and she talks nothing about dismantling this terrorist organization to prevent this from ever happening again.""

Harris' website mentions Israel under a subsection titled, ""Stand With Our Allies, Stand Up to Dictators, and Lead on the World Stage,"" where the campaign promises Harris ""will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to protect U.S. forces and interests from Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups."" It goes on to say Harris ""will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself, and she will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself"" and she and Biden ""are working to end the war in Gaza, such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination."" The campaign vows the vice president and Biden ""are working around the clock to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done."""
On 9/11 anniversary Afghan opposition leader warns country once again a 'safe haven for terrorists',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/9-11-anniversary-afghan-opposition-leader-warns-country-once-again-safe-haven-terrorists,2024-09-11T16:08:59Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Three years since the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan and 23 years since the 9/11 terror attacks that led to the U.S. invasion, Afghanistan finds itself in a worse position now than it was on that fateful day.

""This country has become once again a safe haven for terrorism. It will become a battlefield once again,"" Afghan National Resistance Front (NRF) leader Ahmad Massoud told Fox News Digital in a rare interview.

According to Massoud, the threat emanating from Afghanistan is much greater today than it was on 9/11, and the U.S. failed to achieve its number one objective of rooting out terrorists when it hastily pulled out of Afghanistan in August 2021.

The threat of terrorism from Afghanistan has spread from the U.S. to Europe and recently to Russia. It is just a matter of time, Massoud fears, for it to reach America's shores again.

""I know for a fact the time will come,"" Massoud said.

3 YEARS AFTER US WITHDRAWAL, AFGHAN RESISTANCE STILL IGNORED BY US, WEST

Massoud is not giving up on his vision of a free and democratic Afghanistan despite the odds, and he believes that Americans and Afghans hold intimate bonds over shared values of fighting for freedom against terrorists.

""I feel very much the same feeling with all those victims of 9/11 and the people of the United States and Afghanistan are very much connected to each other because those attacks were carried out by the same team, those who attacked Americans on 9/11 killed my father,"" Massoud said.

Twenty-three years later and four U.S. presidential administrations since, Afghans live under the same threat of Islamic extremism and with the same pain and oppression as they did on 9/11.

Almost immediately after the Taliban regained power, anti-Taliban forces quickly fled to Afghanistan's northern Panjshir Valley and announced their opposition to the new regime.

Massoud, the leader of the NRF, vowed to continue the fight against the Taliban.

""I didn't want to leave my people alone in the hands of evil,"" Massoud told Fox News Digital.

Massoud is the son of Afghan resistance hero Ahmad Shah Massoud. The younger Massoud was only 12 years old when his father was assassinated by al Qaeda two days before the 9/11 terror attacks. Shah Massoud was integral to the rebels who fought against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s and became a leading figure in the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance that resisted the Taliban's reign from 1996 to 2001.

As a young boy growing up in war-ravaged Afghanistan, it was not clear at the time that he would follow in the same footsteps as his legendary rebel father.

WITH TALIBAN VICTORY, AFGHANISTAN COULD BECOME THE 'SECOND SCHOOL OF JIHADISM'

""My father never wanted me to walk in the same path,"" Massoud recounted.

His father did not want him becoming a rebel leader because of the pain that it causes, Massoud remembered, and the enormous pressure and the high expectations it has is unbearable.

Massoud is not doing this for his late father or because he is his son.

""I'm just doing it because I'm madly in love with my people, and I cannot see them in this situation.""

As the years and memories of that sunny, cloudless and traumatic Tuesday morning in September fade away, Massoud is trying to remind America and the world not to forget about the threat from terrorism in Afghanistan.

""Today, al Qaeda is much stronger and entrenched in Afghanistan than it has ever been,"" the resistance leader said.

9/11 FAMILIES CALL ON TRUMP, HARRIS TO OPPOSE US-SAUDI DEAL UNTIL KINGDOM ADMITS INVOLVEMENT IN TERROR ATTACK

The 2020 Doha Agreement negotiated under former President Donald Trump laid the groundwork for the withdrawal of all U.S. forces in exchange for a pledge from the Taliban to prevent any terrorist organization from using Afghan soil to threaten or attack the United States or its allies.

Taliban spokespersons made assurances that they would not allow any terror group to plan an attack from Afghan territory. Although it is true that al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have yet to stage any attacks on the U.S. or its allies, groups like al Qaeda still operate within Afghanistan and have deeply rooted ties with the Taliban.

Numerous United Nations reports note that since their return to power, relations with al Qaeda remain close, and the group that carried out the 9/11 terror attacks is ""strategically patient, cooperating with other terrorist groups in Afghanistan and prioritizing its ongoing relationship with the Taliban.""

Al Qaeda operates at least eight training camps across Afghanistan but does so covertly in order to create the image that the Taliban is adhering to the Doha Agreement, according to U.N. monitoring.

While the U.S. was negotiating with the Taliban, Massoud knew all along they were not negotiating in good faith.

""It is going to fail, and it will also show the world the true face of the Taliban,"" Massoud said.

The leader of the NRF said the international community believed the lies of the Taliban that they had fundamentally changed from the group that previously ruled Afghanistan prior to 9/11.

""Women have been degraded to nothing but property of men and education has been completely destroyed by the Taliban,"" Massoud said angrily.

The elder Massoud, according to his son, warned against an international presence in Afghanistan, saying that the U.S. came to him and proposed operating military bases in the country and to help jointly fight against terrorism.

Shah Massoud was very clear in his vision.

""My father said boots on the ground in Afghanistan will never work,"" Massoud recounts his father saying. ""We fought against the invasion of the Russians. And really, he did not want the presence of another foreign force in Afghanistan,"" he added.

The U.S. did not heed these warnings when they went into Afghanistan.

Massoud wants to continue his father's policy of no foreign troops on Afghan soil and wants to fight terrorism with his own forces based in the country. What he is looking for is the logistical and financial support to carry on the fight.

RETIRED GENERALS DEFEND HARRIS, BLAME TRUMP ON AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL: REPORT

""We indeed need help and support from the world,"" Massoud said, but he also understands the frustration in the United States over ""forever wars"" and respects U.S. policy opposing further wars. The U.S.-Afghan relationship should continue its efforts to fight terrorism, Massoud believes, and that Afghans should not feel betrayed while the same group that killed Americans and Afghans is in power.

Three years later, and with the Taliban cementing their power, the U.S.-Afghan partnership that emerged after 9/11 remains nonexistent.

""We are on our own and there is no external support.""

Massoud believes if the U.S. and international community throw their support behind the NRF, it could make a huge difference.

""Even the slightest of external support, you would see the liberation of a big chunk of Afghanistan. Because the people are very much against the Taliban, the slightest bit of hope and the slightest of opportunities for the people of Afghanistan, and we would see a crack in the armor of the Taliban,"" he explained.

Massoud did not mince words when talking about U.S. policy and was critical of the period immediately after 9/11 and the invasion of Afghanistan when the War on Terror expanded to Iraq and Saddam Hussein's regime.

""The expansion of this war to Iraq completely diverted attention from Afghanistan and Afghanistan for a while [was] the second priority."" Massoud argued that more attention was needed to help build Afghan institutions and make the new government more stable and therefore harder to overthrow.

TALIBAN ARRESTING WOMEN FOR 'BAD HIJAB' AS REPORT SAYS VIOLENCE AND DETENTIONS CONTINUE TO RISE

Massoud was also critical of early U.S. strategy, including the endeavor to create an Afghan army in the image of the U.S. armed forces.

""We did not have American resources or American technology. It was a recipe for disaster.""

Massoud also said that the U.S.' conflicting strategies of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency over the years failed to fully defeat the Taliban and create a stable Afghan government.

""It means that, unfortunately, the Afghans could not make the Americans understand that these strategies don't work in Afghanistan, and they failed to come up with a proper strategy.""

However critical Massoud is of American and international leadership and strategy in Afghanistan, he still placed 70% to 80% of the blame on the Afghan leadership and their flawed thinking that the U.S. and coalition partners would remain in Afghanistan forever like on the Korean Peninsula. The false sense of security did not allow Afghan leaders to focus on national trust, and corruption and criminality ran rampant.

""Unfortunately, the inside political game and personal agendas and not having the capability to see that this situation could never last very long, or that it was not a forever perk,"" hurt Afghanistan's ability to fight terrorism threats it faced or build a stable democracy.

""They missed all of those opportunities,"" Massoud said.

The resistance leader is not unaware of the complicated nature of international politics and realizes that many conflicts are currently raging on, which require U.S. attention and resources.

""There's a fatigue in the U.S. and the West, and they have been stretched from Ukraine to Taiwan to Gaza. So that stress is also another factor for them not to actually pay attention to Afghanistan,"" Massoud lamented."
Michigan 2024 Trump-Harris Polls: Harris Leads In Latest Survey,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/11/michigan-2024-trump-harris-polls-harris-leads-in-latest-survey/,2024-10-11T17:10:22Z,"A new survey shows Vice President Kamala Harris leads former President Donald Trump by two points in Michigan, a departure from other surveys this week showing both Trump leading with three points and Trump tied with Harris, as the race remains razor-thin in the three ""blue wall"" states that could solidify a win for either candidate in November.

Michigan households with a union member have been more likely to vote for a Democratic presidential candidate than union households nationwide in the last three presidential elections, Reuters reported, citing the polling firm Edison Research. The United Auto Workers' endorsement of Harris was considered a boon to her candidacy in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. However, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and International Association of Fire Fighters' decisions not to endorse anyone, after backing Biden in 2020 and historically supporting Democrats, were widely seen as blows to Harris.

Michigan has a sizeable Arab-American population, many of whom have been angered by the Biden-Harris administration's continued support for Israel in its war in Gaza. Recent polling for the Arab American Institute by John Zogby Strategies appears to show the Biden administration's handling of the crisis has severely dented his support among the demographic, with those who identify as Republicans and those who identify as Democrats split at 38%, compared to 40% who identified as Democrats and 32% who identified as Republicans in 2020. The pro-Palestinian group ""Uncommitted"" -- which encouraged primary voters not to back Biden in Michigan and other key states -- has not endorsed Harris, though it said this week it views Trump as worse than Harris.

2.6 points. That's Harris' lead in national polls, according to FiveThirtyEight's polling average. She leads by two points in Real Clear Politics' polling average and by 3.2 points in Nate Silver's Silver Bulletin.

Democrats control all three branches of state government in Michigan for the first time since the 1980s.

Trump had been leading Biden in Michigan in polls by a slim margin prior to Biden dropping out of the race. The state's popular Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, co-chair of both Biden's and Harris' campaigns, is seen as a key asset in helping Harris repeat Whitmer's own success in the state, where she has won two elections by double-digits, increasing her margins in the 2022 election while campaigning on abortion rights in the wake of Roe v. Wade's reversal. Abortion, while still a high-ranking priority for voters, has lost some of its weight in electoral politics since 2022, however, as other issues, including ongoing inflation and the Israel-Hamas war, are also driving voting decisions.

Harris leads Trump in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Nevada, while Trump is up in Georgia, North Carolina and Arizona, according to FiveThirtyEight's swing state polling averages.

A win for Harris across the ""blue wall"" is contingent on her winning Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District and its single electoral vote. The district is an outlier in the state as it typically votes for a Democrat for president. Nebraska is just one of two states that uses a piecemeal approach to allocating electoral votes instead of a winner-takes-all approach. A final-hour GOP-backed effort to change the rule recently failed to gain the traction needed to succeed in the state legislature.

Teams Of IDF Drones Work Together In Gaza Combat Missions,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2024/10/10/teams-of-idf-drones-work-together-in-gaza-combat-missions/,2024-10-10T12:23:31Z,"Some commentators see Ukraine as the laboratory of future drone warfare, but for the last year another drone war has been unfolding in Gaza. The IDF has made extensive use of sophisticated uncrewed systems in tactical operations. While Ukraine's drone industry started from scratch on a shoestring budget, Israel has long been a world leader in the field and their technology reflects this.

XTEND, one of Israel's most advanced drone makers, talked to me about how teams of their co-operative drones are performing in combat operations and what they have learned from a year of intense drone warfare.

Aviv Shapira, XTEND co-founder and CEO, says that their hardware is a few steps up from what is seen in Ukraine.

""In Ukraine, hobby-grade equipment is commonly used, often with analog video and peer-to-peer radio communications,"" says Shapira. ""Modern warfare demands more sophisticated mesh radio networks, where each drone serves as a node in the system. With mesh radio, we can achieve enhanced collaboration between drones, with multiple drones assisting one another.""

Mesh radio allows the drones to maintain communications when there is interference of radio waves may be blocked by terrain or buildings. As in Ukraine, jamming has been a notable feature of the conflict, and communication is not guaranteed. But while in Ukraine developers are starting to experiment with drones with AI, XTEND have already implemented drones with robust autonomy using their XOS operating system.

""Even if communication is lost, XOS enables the drone to continue its mission,"" says Shapira ""This could involve returning to base, searching for a target, or tracking a vehicle. The possibilities are endless; our SDK allows you to develop custom applications per the needs of the user.""

This Software Development Kit can customize drones for specific requirements. Shapira mentions that the IDF have used it to create a drone able to make 3D models of tunnel networks with a laser scanner.

Radio interference also affects satellite navigation, with GPS being rendered almost useless in Gaza due to a combination of jamming and spoofing which gives false positions. Optical navigation, matching the surroundings with a map, is an obvious alternative. While Ukraine has reportedly introduced an optical navigation system called Eagle Eyes on its long range strike drones, XTEND has brought the capability down to quadcopters.

""We adapted our existing indoor localization technology, and developed new algorithms to enable our drones to navigate effectively in outdoor environments,"" says Shapira.

But perhaps the biggest difference with Ukraine is that how a single operator can carry out complex missions with multiple drones.

In Ukraine, drone operations require a lot of personnel. A mission typically involves a reconnaissance drone pilot, assisted by a technician to launch and recover the drone, plus one or more specialist FPV attack pilots, each with their own technician. This takes a significant number of soldiers out of the frontline. In Gaza, a single operator does everything.

Rather than 'swarms', a term used for large groups of co-operating drones, XTEND talk about smaller 'teams'.

""Each team consists of three to five drones or robots, managed by a human operator, with each unit serving as a specialized tool in the operator's toolbox,"" says Shapira. ""A typical team might include an outdoor drone, several indoor drones, and loitering munitions, offering versatility and adaptability for various mission needs.""

The team may also include robotic dogs also using XTEND's operating system.

At any given time in a combat mission most of the drones are set to hover in place in front of a door or window. They act as static cameras, and will automatically alert the operator when they detect a potential threat. This allows the operator to focus on flying one drone at a time. The operator might fly an XTEND Wolverine drone around the outside of a building and identify an entrance, then go inside with an Xtender to explore the interior room by room.

A simple point-and-click interface means that no piloting skill is needed, even flying through narrow openings and corridors, as the drone automatically plots its route and avoids obstacles. The video feed is shared with the mission commander, who can, for example, highlight objects for the drone operator to explore.

Additional drones may have other sensors, for example electronic warfare devices able to detect, identify and pinpoint radio emissions for the scout drones or loitering munitions.

""Collaboration or what we call 'teaming' is essential for success in many scenarios,"" says Rubi Liani, co-founder and CTO of XTEND. ""While many companies are trying to crack the challenges involved in drone teaming, there is a significant lack of experience in real-world battlefield conditions.""

Kamikaze drones, aka loitering munitions, hovering nearby can engage targets located in the building at once. The so-called sensor-to-shooter chain between detecting a possible target, making a decision and carrying out an attack, which typically took 20 minutes in Afghanistan, has been radically shortened.

""Our goal is to empower ground forces to achieve all these objectives with a single operator, enabling them to acquire and engage targets independently, without the need for external airstrike support,"" says Shapira.

In Ukraine, drone-on-drone warfare has recently become a factor and interceptor FPVs are bringing down increasing numbers of Russian winged reconnaissance drones.

XTEND have already mastered this type of warfare. One of their first products was a drone to tackle incendiary balloons and kites launched by Hamas. The group also use basic drones, and XTEND's Griffon is an 80-mph interceptor which can interface with air defence radar to find and bring down incoming drones. While Ukrainian interceptors require skilled piloting, Griffon has an onboard computer vision system to home in on the target.

Shapira says their track record includes over 5,000 successful interceptions of various targets in Gaza border protection.

XTEND are now working on a fixed-wing interceptor powered by a jet engine with longer range. This will likely be used to counter larger Shahed-type drones made by Iran, which threaten Israel just as they threaten Ukraine. Low-cost attack drones threaten to overwhelm missile defenses by sheer numbers, as Israel can only afford so many Tamir interceptor missiles for its Iron Dome at an estimated $50,000 a shot.

""We are conducting live tests of our latest counter-drone technology this month and anticipate operational deployment early next year,"" says Shapira. ""Our goal is to achieve a price point of $10-15,000 per interceptor, making it an affordable solution.""

A major lesson is how rapidly the war throws up new demands. Fortunately the open architecture has allows XTEND to react quickly.

""We have been able to add applications and make critical changes within days,"" says Shapira. He notes that they can easily build interfaces with third-party products when required.

The enemy are likely to develop new drones of their own, and new counter-drone tactics, and the evolution process is very much a continuous one.

The main aim is still the same though: to put greater numbers of capable robots into the front line and reduce the need for humans to be exposed to risk. Advances in AI and drones have reached a stage where a drone can always go in first. The technology is moving forwards and Shapira sounds enthusiastic about its future.

""We are pushing the boundaries of robotics and taking them to the edge,"" says Shapira. ""It's a privilege to be here, saving lives and kicking ass."""

Turkey And Israel Upgrade Azerbaijan's Russian Military Hardware,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pauliddon/2024/10/09/turkey-and-israel-upgrade-azerbaijans-russian-military-hardware/,2024-10-09T19:08:44Z,"Azerbaijan recently publicly presented Russian military hardware upgraded by Israeli and Turkish military technology companies at a defense fair in Baku in September 2024. The upgrades indicate that Azerbaijan wants to keep its older equipment in service and up-to-date, even as it modernizes its armed forces with new advanced drones, also from Israel and Turkey, and modern JF-17C Block III multirole fighter jets from Pakistan.

At the September 24-26 Azerbaijan International Defense Exhibition (ADEX) 2024, Baku showcased its upgraded Su-25 Frogfoot attack aircraft and T-72 main battle tanks. Other older upgraded Soviet-era weaponry displayed at the event included ZSU-23-4 Shilka anti-aircraft guns and 9K33 Osa short-range surface-to-air missile systems. These designs date back to the late 1950s and 1960s.

Azerbaijan did not inherit all its Su-25s from Moscow after it became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991. Baku bought its subsonic Frogfoots in separate deals with Georgia and Belarus, receiving them in 2002 and 2012, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's arms transfers database.

Baku also ordered its MiG-29 Fulcrum fighter jets from Russia in the 2000s, the only fourth-generation fighter it operated until the recent purchase of an unspecified number of JF-17Cs, the first of which also arrived in September 2024.

Turkish Aerospace Industries, also known by its Turkish acronym TUSAS, upgraded the Su-25s. With these new upgrades, the Azerbaijani Frogfoots can launch several Turkish-made guided and glide bombs and even cruise missiles, giving the close air support plane a standoff strike capability. The aircraft's avionics also received a comprehensive upgrade.

Azerbaijan's upgraded T-72s were also presented at ADEX 2024. Azerbaijan built its sizable fleet of these Soviet-era main battle tanks through imports from Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, and Slovakia in the 2000s, according to the SIPRI database. By 2010, Azerbaijan had an estimated 180 T-72s, with one-third purchased in 2009 alone.

Azerbaijan also ordered a fleet of newer T-90S tanks from Russia in the 2010s. Upgrading its T-72s indicates it also wants to keep these older tanks in service for the foreseeable future.

Israel's Elbit Systems, which specializes in modernizing Soviet-era hardware and other older armor and aircraft, performed the upgrades. According to the official ADEX website, the modernization incorporated recent lessons from the deadly Ukraine war.

""The tanks have been equipped with anti-cumulative screens and a protective lattice structure designed to shield the vehicle's upper parts from drone strikes and explosives,"" the site noted. Other upgrades include the incorporation of modern Israeli-built fire control and sighting systems and enhanced reactive armor.

Elbit was previously chosen over Turkey's Aselsan defense corporation to upgrade Azerbaijani T-72s in the 2010s. Baku's use of Turkish and Israeli defense firms makes sense, given its strategic ties with both countries.

Incidentally, the CEO of Turkey's Baykar Defense -- manufacturer of the popular Bayraktar TB2 drone of which Azerbaijan is an operator -- recently deflected criticism for co-sponsoring this year's ADEX fair alongside Israel Aerospace Industries. The criticism comes as Turkey's leadership has repeatedly denounced Israel for its ongoing military campaigns in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon.

Azerbaijan's choice of Turkey over Israel for the Su-25 upgrade was also interesting, considering Israel's experience upgrading Su-25s, as Elbit did with Georgia's Su-25 fleet. It may well have preferred to have its Frogfoots compatible with Turkey's indigenous munitions, as that would increase interoperability with the Turkish military, a shared political goal of Ankara and Baku.

The Azerbaijani military's use of modern Israeli and Turkish drones -- most notably the Turkish TB2 and Israeli Harop loitering munition -- played a pivotal role in its decisive victory in the 2020 war with Armenia. Nevertheless, these upgrades may indicate that Baku sees value in maintaining its quantitative arsenal of older hardware and improving its overall quality.

It's also plausible that Azerbaijan wants to maintain a qualitative and quantitive edge over Armenia. While the incumbent Armenian government is pushing for an extensive peace deal with Baku, it's also rebuilding its armed forces, doubtlessly incorporating lessons from its 2020 rout, with an eye on significantly reducing its overwhelming historical dependency on Russia for military hardware.

As part of this process, Yerevan has purchased rocket systems, air defenses from India, and artillery from France. Baku has denounced these purchases, arguably hypocritically considering it also continues acquiring advanced weaponry.

Most recently, Armenia has reportedly been considering an acquisition of South Korean K2 Black Panther tanks, which would mark a massive upgrade of its existing armor, severely battered in the 2020 war.

Armenia is also seeking help from India to upgrade its four Russian Su-30SM Flankers, the only fighter jets in its entire air force."
Will Israel Attack Iran's Nuclear Program? Here's What To Know As Ex-PM Calls For Strikes,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenpastis/2024/10/08/will-israel-attack-irans-nuclear-program-heres-what-to-know-as-ex-pm-calls-for-strikes/,2024-10-08T21:39:57Z,"While Iran does not yet have nuclear arms, analysts believe the country's nuclear development program might be a prime target for Israeli retaliation -- despite U.S. opposition -- following Iran's missile launches at Israel, as a former Israeli prime minister argues for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.

In April, top Iranian general Ahmad Haghtalab threatened that the country could revise its nuclear policies if Israel hit its nuclear sites, saying such an attack could incite Iranian counterattacks targeting Israel's own nuclear facilities, according to reporting by state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.

Israel and Iran are archrivals with a history of terse relations dating back to Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution. A corresponding decades-long shadow war -- fueled by Iran's years of supporting Lebanese Shia militia Hezbollah and Islamist militant group Hamas -- has become a direct conflict as tensions spiked in recent years, particularly after Hamas' attack on Israel last year and Israel's intense invasion of Gaza. Israel -- alongside the U.S. and the U.N. -- has been concerned with Iranian nuclear progress since Iran started its weapons program in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Israel has spent the decades since targeting the program to prevent nuclear development through Israeli-connected missions like stealing nuclear secrets, sabotaging explosions and launching drone attacks. While Israel never took responsibility, Iran accused the country of assassinating top Iranian scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in 2020. Iran has enough weapons-grade nuclear fuel to make three bombs and is one of the only countries without nuclear weapons that can produce 60%-enriched uranium, a quality of enriched uranium close to the 90% needed for weapons, according to The Wall Street Journal. Russian ties to Iran have deepened in recent years, and Bloomberg has reported the U.S. is concerned about the sharing of information and technology between the two countries -- a potential boon to Iran's nuclear interest. Israel is considered an undeclared nuclear weapons power because it is believed to have nuclear arms but has not confirmed possession of them, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.

While hitting it would be viewed as a major escalation, Israel has long watched Iran's nuclear enrichment plant in Natanz, an enrichment facility buried in the desert with thousands of centrifuges, according to the New York Times. Other facilities, like the enrichment plant buried under a mountain in Fordow, represent another potential target, yet U.S. officials have historically blocked Israel from getting the bomber planes and weapons powerful enough for an attack so deep underground, The Times reports. But Israel's methods have used other methods than bombings or missile attacks. Israel has a strong cyberdefense program -- exhibited recently when it launched an attack that exploded wireless devices owned by Hezbollah members. Another attack believed to be from the U.S. and Iran happened in the early 2000s -- called ""Olympic Games"" and known commonly the Stuxnet virus -- was a cyberattack that used digital ""worms"" to disrupt Natanz's facility operations.

Matthew Bunn, a professor of energy, national security and foreign policy at Harvard, told Forbes that there would be no nuclear fallout, or spreading of radioactive material, from attacking a uranium enrichment facility like Natanz or Fordow. These facilities deal with uranium that has not been irradiated in a nuclear reactor, meaning it's less radioactive. In an attack, some areas may suffer ecological damage, but the result would be isolated to the limited quantity of uranium at the locations, he said.

In April, top Iranian general Ahmad Haghtalab threatened that the country could revise its nuclear policies if Israel hit its nuclear sites, saying such an attack could incite Iranian counterattacks targeting Israel's own nuclear facilities, according to reporting by state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.

In mid-2018, former President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Under the Obama administration deal, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear activities and permit U.N. inspections, and in return, economic and financial sanctions set by the EU, U.S. and U.N. were lifted. The deal outlined three main points: reducing Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium (a key ingredient in making bombs) by 98%, stopping production of higher-grade enriched uranium for 15 years and removing two-thirds of its more than 19,000 centrifuges (machines that enrich uranium). Under the deal, it would take Iran about 12 months to make a nuclear weapon. Trump was outspoken against the deal, calling it ""too much in exchange for too little."" Since 2018, Iran has significantly advanced its nuclear program, and while there is no evidence of nuclear-armed missiles, officials are concerned about metallurgy and computer modeling research related to weapons, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Iran's nuclear capacity is playing out as a point of contention in the 2024 presidential campaign and was the leading question posed in Tuesday's vice presidential debate, with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz arguing Trump was incapable of de-escalating tensions and did not put adequate nuclear protections in place when he pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, argued the Biden-Harris administration has supported Iran financially and that ""Donald Trump consistently made the world more secure."" Trump said on Oct. 4 at a campaign event in North Carolina that Israel should ""hit the nuclear first and worry about the rest later."" When asked in a 60 Minutes interview on Oct.7, Vice President Kamala Harris responded that Iran was the U.S.'s greatest foreign adversary."

Today marks one year since Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed, leading Israel to retaliate and catalyzing the war in Gaza. Nearly 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians.

Despite calls for a ceasefire from the U.S. and allies, the Middle East is on the precipice of a broader war as tensions escalate between Israel and Iran. About 31% of Americans believe Israel's military operations in Gaza are going too far, a slight increase from last December, according to a new Pew Research Center poll.

Meanwhile, the share of Americans who believe Israel is doing enough or should be doing more has fallen in the last 10 months.

The U.S. added far more jobs than expected in September, and the unemployment rate dipped to 4.1%. The Labor Department data delivered good news for investors on edge after July and August saw far weaker labor market expansion than expected.

MORE: Leading stock indexes saw gains Friday on the heels of the jobs report: The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 0.8%, the S&P 500 climbed as much as 0.9% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq bounced as much as 1.2%. But labor market resilience dampened hopes for a second aggressive interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month.

Tencent Holdings is considering acquiring Ubisoft Entertainment with the Guillemot family, which founded the French video game publisher, sending Ubisoft's stock soaring Friday after it falling to a decade-low in late September. Rumors about a takeover of Ubisoft, behind video games like Assassin's Creed and Just Dance, have swirled for years, and private equity firms like Blackstone and KKR & Co. have previously considered buying out the company.

Compare price/earnings to a growth rate and you get PEG, the classic formula for measuring the price tag of a growth stock. But PEG has deep flaws. The superior Super PEG measures how much you pay now to get a certain level of earning power down the road, and then compares that to what you pay to get future earning power from the S&P 500 index.

The ultra-swank Yellowstone Club, located on a remote patch of Montana wilderness, is one of the world's most exclusive clubs: Those who want to be admitted must buy land, a home or a condo, which will set you back $10 million, even for the least expensive undeveloped plot. The club has fewer than 900 homeowners, worth more than a combined $290 billion, including Melinda French Gates and hedge fund tycoon Bill Ackman.

The Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest people has been published every year since 1982, and out of the total 1,739 featured, just 11 have made the list every year. They include Warren Buffett, worth $145.5 billion; Charles Koch, worth $67.5 billion; and Nike's Phil Knight, with a net worth of $36.5 billion.

Alphabet's self-driving car venture Waymo, the only commercial robotaxi service in the U.S., signed a ""multiyear"" agreement with Hyundai Motor to add electric Ioniq 5 hatchbacks to its Waymo One fleet starting next year. Currently, its U.S. fleet includes at least 1,000 electric Jaguar I-PACE SUVs, and reducing costs is critical for Waymo to reach profitability, as it is quickly expanding its service area.

At a recruitment event for his fledgling AI company xAI, billionaire Elon Musk pitched the firm as the anti-OpenAI, calling the ChatGPT maker ""closed"" and profit-obsessed. Musk cofounded OpenAI with Sam Altman, but he has since left and sued the company twice, accusing OpenAI of abandoning its mission to build artificial intelligence to benefit humanity.

Out of office and back on the campaign trail, former President Donald Trump earned an estimated $218 million in operating income last year, roughly double what he made during his final year in the White House. Trump's golf portfolio now generates huge profits, with his golf-connected properties generating $74 million more in operating income last year than they did in 2020.

Perpetua Resources is set to resurrect a shuttered Idaho mine that will once again supply the Pentagon with vital weapons-grade antimony, bust a Chinese monopoly, and underwrite the rehabilitation of 20 miles of backcountry salmon streams. The surge in the price of gold since the pandemic is also propelling Perpetua, which expects to produce an average 300,000 ounces of gold per year at an average all-in cost of $650/oz and eventually generate hundreds of millions of dollars in annual profits.

Shares of Spirit Airlines fell 26% Friday after reports indicated the low-cost airline was exploring bankruptcy. In January, a federal judge blocked a $3.8 billion merger between Spirit and JetBlue, ruling it would eliminate the airline industry's popular discounted flight options and drive up prices.

If you need to renew your passport, now is the time: The average wait time is the shortest it's been in decades. The State Department said Thursday that the average processing time for passports has dropped to four to six weeks, which is a third as long as it took in 2021 during the pandemic backlog.

TOPLINE Over the last several months, joint state and federal task forces have raided more than 100 vape and smoke shops, hemp product manufacturers and distributors in North Carolina, alleging that they are selling marijuana disguised as hemp.

The 2018 Farm Bill allows the production of hemp and all its derivatives so long as it contains 0.3% of THC or less. In 2022, hemp-derived cannabinoid product sales hit $28 billion overall, while legal marijuana products generated $26 billion in sales during that same period, according to cannabis data firm Whitney Economics.

But hemp farmers, Whitney Economics estimates, have lost about $3.1 billion in annual sales due to the state bans and legal confusion that has followed.

Despite what the Farm Bill states, there is plenty of debate about whether hemp-derived THC products are legal under federal law. That's because hemp-derived cannabinoids -- including delta-9 THC and delta-8 THC (a less potent compound that is affectionately called ""weed lite"" or ""decaf kush"") -- are legal under the Farm Bill if those compounds are found naturally in the plant.

Yet most intoxicating hemp products on the market are made by converting hemp-derived CBD isolate into delta-9 THC or delta-8 THC using a chemical process.

North Carolina's crusade against hemp is not the only front in this war on drugs. Late last month, California Governor Gavin Newsom banned hemp-derived THC through an emergency order. Newsom said that the move was to prevent the sale of intoxicating hemp products to children.

But California also views hemp products as a threat to its struggling $5 billion legal marijuana market.

WHY IT MATTERS ""What's going on in the hemp industry right now shows how complicated and nuanced the legalization of cannabis can be,"" says Forbes staff writer Will Yakowicz. ""Even though marijuana and hemp are variations of the same plant -- Cannabis sativa L -- marijuana is still illegal at the federal level while hemp is legal.""

It's important not only to save for retirement but also to plan for the non-financial aspects. For instance, if you enjoy what you are doing or the social aspect of your job, consider working part-time to transition to full retirement. Take the time to build social connections outside of work, join community groups and develop hobbies. And don't wait until you retire to start traveling: Go when you can, because no one's health is guaranteed.

Why The Israel-Hamas War Death Toll Is Uncertain -- 1 Year After Start Of War,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/06/why-the-israel-hamas-war-death-toll-is-uncertain-1-year-after-start-of-war/,2024-10-06T19:18:56Z,"A year after Hamas attacked Israel, prompting a counterattack on Gaza and a regional conflict that recently bled into Lebanon, the death toll continues to grow, but remains uncertain amid discrepancies in figures reported by the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry and logistical challenges in tracking the dead.

The Gaza Health Ministry has struggled to maintain accurate tallies due to the destruction of data-keeping technology and infrastructure in the war, according to analysis published by The Lancet, which noted an estimated 10,000 victims are likely still buried in the rubble of destroyed buildings. Some of the dead also go uncounted because ""what we've seen in Gaza is entire families just being wiped out,"" so there is no one to report them dead, Emily Tripp, the director of Airwars, a watchdog group that tracks war casualties, told Nature.

The non-governmental organization, Airwars, has also determined the death toll is likely underestimated after finding some victims' names are missing from the list released by the Ministry. Some experts, including Israel-based independent researcher Mark Zlochin, believe the death toll is overcounted because it likely includes people who are missing, but not dead, he told the scientific journal Nature.

The Ministry updated its breakdown of the fatalities in May to clarify that approximately 25,000 of the 35,000 reported dead at the time were ""people who have been fully identified."" The Ministry revised its count of women and children estimated to be dead to about 60% of all reported fatalities, down from a previous estimate of about 70%, sparking allegations of inaccuracies from Israeli officials. The World Health Organization, however, expressed confidence in the new tally amid the dispute, noting that it's a ""step forward"" that 25,000 bodies have been identified, World Health Organization spokesperson Christian Lindmeier said during a press briefing at the time that it's ""normal"" for death tolls to shift in conflict.

Nearly every day. The death toll doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants. The death toll includes nearly 16,756 children and more than 10,000 people who are missing.

More than 97,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

1,139 have been killed and at least 8,730 have been injured, as of Sunday, according to Israeli officials.

At least 742 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and more than 6,250 have been injured.

Hamas invaded Israel in a surprise land, sea and air attack launched from the Gaza Strip in what was the deadliest day in Israeli history, and for Jews since the Holocaust, following decades of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Hamas militants took more than 240 people hostage; 154 of whom have been freed or rescued, with 97 remaining in Gaza, including 33 believed to be dead. Israel declared a state of war the day after the attack and launched air strikes, followed by a ground invasion, on Gaza. The Israeli invasion has spawned a humanitarian crisis as the dismantling of critical infrastructure and the Israeli occupation has blocked routes into Gaza, restricting the flow of aid. The outpouring of international support for Israel has dwindled since the start of the war as a broad coalition of its allies, including the U.S., have called for a cease-fire. The war has since expanded to Lebanon as tensions between Hezbollah and Israel reached a tipping point in July when a rocket attack Israel says Hezbollah carried out killed 12 children playing soccer in the Golan Heights region. Israel has retaliated with air strikes followed by a ground invasion, killing Hezbollah's' longtime leader and other top officials, and Hezbollah has vowed its strikes will continue unless there's a cease-fire in Gaza.

56%. That's the share of Israelis who want to see an end to the war if all hostages are returned, according to a July poll by the Israel Democracy Institute.

About 3 in 10 (31%) Americans believe Israel's military operations in Gaza are going too far, a slight increase from last December, according to a new Pew Research Center poll, which shows a plurality of Americans, 36% to be exact, are unsure about Israel's handling of its war with Hamas. Meanwhile, 20% of Americans believe Israel is doing enough while 12% say Israel should be doing more -- but both of those numbers have declined in the past 10 months, from 25% and 16%, respectively.

The Pew Research Center poll also found more Americans in September said the U.S. should play a role in resolving the war diplomatically (61%) than they did in February (55%). And Republicans in September remained more likely than Democrats (25% vs. 13%) to say the U.S. should not be involved in the diplomatic resolution of the war, according to the Pew Research Center, a drop from the 32% of Republicans and 21% of Democrats who said in February there should be no U.S. involvement in the war's resolution.

A new survey from the Pearson Institute and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 25% sympathize more with Israelis, and 15% sympathize more with Palestinians. Most -- 31% -- claimed to have equal sympathy for both sides, and another 26% report having no sympathy for either. These numbers also have not changed much since before the attack on Israel last year.

The Associated Press-NORC survey marked an increase in the number of Americans who support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, up to about 29% now compared to 22% before the Oct. 7 attacks, in August 2023. Around half of the Americans surveyed said they neither favor or oppose an independent state (a drop from 58% in August 2023), while 17% were opposed, about what it was (15%) in 2023.

About 4 in 10 Americans say the U.S. is spending too much on military aid for Israel, very consistent with polls in February and November, according to the Pearson and AP survey.

Even before the Oct. 7 attack -- and Israel's two-front war in Gaza and Lebanon -- a whopping 79% of Americans were either concerned or very concerned about the Israel-Hamas war leading to a larger Middle East conflict, according to a NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll published a year ago.

""The mix of U.S. opinions on the Gaza war reflects the complexity of a conflict where Americans may see bad actors and innocent victims on both sides,"" the Associated Press reported, citing Paul Poast, a political scientist at the University of Chicago and a research affiliate of the Pearson Institute. Poast added the conflict's nuances have lended to ""very strong views on both sides.""

The U.S. has remained a large player in the Israel-Hamas war despite stopping short of putting American boots on the ground in Gaza or Lebanon. President Joe Biden has laid out multiple ceasefire proposals in the last year that have largely failed to materialize, while also trying to walk the rope between supporting Israel's war against Hamas and providing humanitarian support for the people of Gaza, who continue to face strikes from Israel, famine and mass displacement. American concern about a larger conflict in the Middle East has proven relevant, as Israel's attacks against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon have raised the ire of Iran, which launched missile strikes at Israel this week. Biden has continued calling for ceasefires as the conflicts escalate, though it remains unclear how much influence the U.S. will have on Israeli military operations given that the two allies have seemingly been on different pages multiple times in the last year. The White House said last month it was not notified about Israel's strikes in Lebanon that killed longtime Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and provoked retaliatory strikes from Iran.

Iran Launches Missile Strike On Israel, Israeli Military Says (Forbes)"
Iraqi Militia Drone Attack On Israeli Troops Echoes Tower 22 Incident,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pauliddon/2024/10/05/iraqi-militia-drone-attack-on-israeli-troops-echoes-tower-22-incident/,2024-10-05T15:16:55Z,"Israel revealed Friday that a drone launched from Iraq on Thursday killed two Israeli troops and injured 24, two of them severely, in an army base in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. The attack was the first time a drone launched from Iraq at Israel resulted in any fatalities. It also has many noticeable similarities with another drone attack earlier this year against American troops based in neighboring Jordan.

The Israeli military military investigation into Thursday's incident revealed that the militias used two explosive drones in the attack. Israeli air defenses successfully downed one. However, the second struck its target undetected minutes later, causing the casualties. The military noted the soldiers did not receive any alert to take cover and is investigating why that was the case.

The Islamic Resistance of Iraq, IRI, claimed responsibility for the attack. The IRI is the umbrella term for Iran-backed Iraqi militias that oppose Israel and the U.S. military presence in Iraq and Syria.

U.S. troops in the Tower 22 facility in northeast Jordan on the Syrian border similarly received no warning when an IRI drone launched from Syria hit their base on January 28. Three U.S. troops perished when the explosive drone hit their living quarters as they slept, with another 47 suffering injuries.

The initial U.S. military assessment of the attack concluded that U.S. forces likely did not detect the militia drone ""due to its low flight path."" Furthermore, the facility lacked adequate air defense for combating such threats. Nevertheless, as with the Israeli troops in the Golan on Thursday, those American personnel had no forewarning or any chance to take cover.

Both incidents were the first out of hundreds of IRI attacks against Israel and U.S. troops that caused fatalities. The IRI began firing rockets and drones at U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria shortly after the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023. At least 150 attacks against U.S. troops in these countries preceded the Tower 22 attack, with some causing injuries.

The IRI also launched several drones and cruise missiles against Israel in the months preceding Thursday's incident, invariably exaggerating the effectiveness of many of these attacks. Overall, in the past year, they have claimed 170 attacks on Israeli targets. Interestingly, an estimated 70 percent of these have occurred this September, coinciding with the beginning of the ongoing Israel-Hezbollah conflict in Lebanon.

The U.S. retaliated for the Tower 22 attack on February 2. In a series of devastating strikes carried out by drones and B-1 Lancer heavy bombers, the U.S. Air Force struck 85 suspected militia targets in seven locations in Syria and Iraq; four in the former and three in the latter. The attacks killed an estimated 40 IRI militiamen.

As of writing, Israel has not directly responded to the IRI drone attack. It's unclear whether Israel will respond with a rare strike on Iraqi territory since the drones came from there. Israel has repeatedly targeted IRI and a plethora of other Iran-backed militias and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Syria over the past decade. That campaign markedly intensified since October 2023. It did bomb Iran-backed militias in Iraq back in 2019, but those strikes seem to have been a one-off.

The U.S. may want to dissuade Israel from striking back in Iraq. Unlike its 900-strong troop presence in Syria, the U.S. deployment in Iraq is under agreement and coordination with the central government in Baghdad. Furthermore, the U.S. and Iraq have been negotiating the future status of U.S. troops in the country, over a decade after they returned to the country to help Baghdad fight the notorious Islamic State group. Israeli strikes on Iraqi territory amidst a U.S. drawdown could complicate things for Washington there and politically pressure Baghdad to take a firm stance against the American military presence.

Following Iran's unprecedented ballistic missile attack against Israel on Tuesday, these Iran-backed Iraqi groups bluntly warned that U.S. bases in Iraq would once again come under fire if the U.S. joins any Israeli retaliation against Iran or if Israel uses Iraqi airspace for attacks against Iran. Israeli fighter jets may have used Iraqi airspace to fire air-launched ballistic missiles into Iran in retaliation to Tehran's first direct missile and drone attack against Israel in April.

Interestingly, the Middle East Eye outlet published an interesting report on Thursday revealing that pro-Iran political and armed factions in Iraq are wary of incurring any Israeli attack on the country, fearful that it could lead to a government collapse. Iraq's Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani ""has been striving to deprive the Israelis of any pretext that could be used to strike Iraq,"" an advisor told the outlet.

""Any ill-considered action in the coming days will have a high price and could burn everything,"" the advisor added.

Thursday's attack could well give Israel a pretext to strike. Whether or not it will do so has yet to be seen as the wider region lurches closer than ever to the calamity of an all-out war."
U.S. Arms on Both Sides of War in Lebanon,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhartung/2024/10/05/us-arms-on-both-sides-of-war-in-lebanon/,2024-10-05T12:48:49Z,"Not for the first time, a war has broken out in which U.S. arms are present on both sides of the conflict, this time in Lebanon. The billions of dollars in weaponry Washington has supplied the Netanyahu government to sustain its wars in Gaza and Lebanon are widely known about, but many Americans might be surprised to learn that the United States has also supplied significant amounts of arms and training to the Lebanese armed forces. While the Lebanese army is not the primary target of the Israeli invasion, a clash between the IDF and official Lebanese government forces is still a possibility.

Nick Turse, writing in The Intercept, notes that ""[s]ince 2006, America has provided more than $5.5 billion in foreign assistance to Lebanon, including $3 billion in military aid."" Items supplied have included ""light attack aircraft, helicopters, and Hellfire missiles. The U.S. separately provided Lebanon with 130 armored and tactical ground vehicles."" Seth Binder, director of advocacy at the Middle East Democracy Center, told Turse that the U.S. supplies have not had the intended effect: ""Despite the assistance, however, the country remains incredibly unstable and its security forces remain unable to respond to Hezbollah's domestic or regional operations.""

The U.S. government's reasons for arming the Lebanese military are not entirely clear. In one notice to Congress of a sale to Lebanon, the Pentagon relied on vague rationales, stating that it would ""enhance the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the security of a strategic partner."" Equally vaguely, the notice went on to say that the sale would ""improve Lebanon's capability to meet current and future threats. Lebanon will use the enhanced capability to strengthen its homeland defense and to replenish existing stock levels."" The ""threat"" is never named, but the current threat to Lebanon emanates from a U.S. ally, Israel, not from Hezbollah or a designated adversary like Iran.

As noted above, the Lebanese army is not the main focus of Israel's attacks - that is Hezbollah. The Lebanese army has retreated from the south of the country since the Israeli invasion, concentrating its forces in the north. While they would no doubt like to avoid direct combat with the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), analyst Aram Nerguizian of the Center for Strategic and International Studies has suggested that the Lebanese forces might engage in defensive actions against the IDF. But for the most part it appears that the Lebanese army is standing back as their country is bombarded by its neighbor, leaving it as a fight between Israel and Hezbollah- with the people of Lebanon paying the real price.

Unfortunately, the phenomenon of the U.S. arming both sides of a conflict is nothing new, and in many cases U.S. arms have gone to the direct combatants in the war, not to one direct party like Israel plus a secondary force like the Lebanese army. This history of runaway weapons sales goes back at least to the 1970s, when American arms were used by both Greek and Turkish forces in their war over Cyprus. This reality was one of the things that prompted Congress to pass the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) of 1978.

More recently, in 2019, Turkey's U.S.-supplied air force bombarded the U.S.-trained and armed Kurdish opposition forces in Turkey.

The role of U.S. arms in fueling conflict - whether the weapons to both sides or just one - is business-as-usual. In a December 2022 paper I did for the Quincy Institute, I found that the United States had supplied arms to one of both sides of over two-thirds of the world's active conflicts as of that date.

None of the above accounts for cases where U.S. supplied-arms have fallen into the hands of U.S. adversaries, as happened during the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen. Most disturbingly of all, some of the U.S. arms supplied to extremist groups in Afghanistan fighting Soviet occupation forces ended up in the hands of Osama Bin Laden's cohorts in al-Qaida, and ISIS captured large quantities of U.S. arms from the Iraqi armed forces in its 2014 invasion of Iraq.

It's long past time to take a hard look at claims that U.S. weapons supplies are a ""force for stability"" around the world. The historical record suggests otherwise. The current war in the Middle East offers an opportunity to change course, and finally acknowledge that trading in weapons of war is not a guarantee of peace and stability, but an enabler of more war, with all the tragic human consequences that entails."
Iranian Media Claims Israeli F-35 Fighters Destroyed In Missile Strike,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/02/iranian-media-claims-israeli-f-35-fighters-destroyed-in-missile-strike/,2024-10-02T16:46:50Z,"Iran launched its largest attack on Israel to date, firing upwards of 180 missiles on Tuesday. Experts have suggested it was larger and more complex than the strikes conducted in April, and the attack employed the Islamic Republic's Fattah-1 and Kheybarshekan missiles. Israel has claimed that most of the incoming missiles were shot down, and no Israelis were killed -- although Palestinian officials reported that a Palestinian man was killed by falling debris.

Damage was also reported to be minimal, but on social media on Wednesday, many pro-Iranian supporters echoed reports from Iranian state media that the missiles successfully struck Israeli airbases. Claims were made that the attack destroyed entire squadrons of the Lockheed Martin F-35I Adir -- the Israeli Air Force's fifth-generation fighter.

Videos on social media showed missiles targeting Tel Aviv, and showing the devastation that the IAF's F-35s were purported to cause in Gaza. Iranian propagandists have also alleged that Nevatim Air Base, the home of two F-35I squadrons, was also ""completely destroyed"" in the attack.

Yet another post claimed Palestinian activists disrupted domestic F-35 production by damaging a manufacturing facility. When and where the video was filmed hasn't been confirmed.

Together, these are the latest attempts to spread misinformation and propaganda without supporting evidence.

""Some of the missiles fired at Israel seem to have hit Israeli airbases, but the claim that dozens of F-35s were destroyed appears to be completely fabricated,"" explained Dr. Kurt Braddock, assistant professor of public communication in the School of Communication at American University. ""The protest at Teledyne seems to have been very minor in scope, and there is no evidence that it will slow down production of any materials.""

Though it would appear that Tuesday's missile strike was largely thwarted, the commentary on social media suggested it was a huge military success. The news was shared by those who may have believed the original posts, making it seem even more credible.

""The spread of these posts can be considered either misinformation or disinformation. In the case of the former, people on social media may see the videos/images and simply think they are true, and re-post them because they feel they are sharing true news without critiquing it,"" added Braddock.

Iranian state media presented a fictional narrative, and it also likely employed operatives on social media to post their own claims -- which served to provide confirmation for an event that didn't occur.

""The originators of the posts are engaged in spreading disinformation -- the purposeful spread of false information for strategic purposes,"" Braddock suggested.

""The goal of most mis/dis-information is not to convince people that something that didn't happen -- dozens of F-35s destroyed -- happened,"" explained Dr. Matthew Schmidt, associate professor in the National Security Department at the University of New Haven.

""It's designed to flood the mediascape with false information that causes a psychological response where people are overloaded with contradictory information and respond to this cognitively by questioning all the information in the mediascape, true and outlandishly false alike,"" warned Schmidt. ""The attackers hack our brains by flooding us with information and trigger a cognitive response based on the volume of data coming at us, regardless of its veracity.""

The result is that even easily verifiable true information may be doubted, including any factual information that reaches the target audience. Moreover, facts can be attacked and dismissed.

Schmidt said it can be exhausting, and many simply quit trying to find any truth in the ocean of disinformation.

""This creates a benefit for the attacker, because it creates a psychological environment where future lies will be ignored, because the audience has been made too exhausted to do the work to identify and counter them,"" he added.

Even if Israel offers its own social media response that shows largely undamaged bases, such photos and videos are to be equally dismissed as misinformation/disinformation. And that could play into Tehran's favor, at least in the short term.

""The goal was largely to sow doubt about claims by the Israelis that the Iranian attack was largely ineffective -- which is what seems to be the truth,"" said Braddock.

""Reports indicate that although not all Iranian missiles were intercepted, the ones that did land did minimal damage with no Israeli casualties,"" Braddock emphasized. ""That could be seen as an embarrassment for Iran and a show of strength for the Israeli defensive measures. By spreading disinformation that seems to suggest the missiles were more effective than they actually were, the posters are trying to communicate the 'effectiveness' of the Iranian attack."""
Israel Considers Cancelling Lebanon Gas Deal,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielmarkind/2024/10/02/israel-considers-cancelling-lebanon-gas-deal/,2024-10-02T14:11:27Z,"With the whole world watching events in Lebanon to see if Israel next launches a threatened ground invasion into that country, following its recent ""culling"" of the entire Hezbollah high command, another area that bears watching concerns what will now happen to the Israel/Lebanon natural gas deal reached in 2022 that, for a time, held a glimmer of hope for eventual peace in the Middle East, or at least between these two countries.

For those who may not recall that deal had demarcated the maritime border in the Mediterranean Sea between the two countries and gave Israel full rights to the ""Karish"" gas field and Lebanon most rights to the ""Qana"" field, with some revenue from the latter to go to the Israelis.

Recently, Israeli government officials have been broaching the idea of ""finding a loophole"" to invalidate the gas agreement. Even more recently, Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen openly called the deal a ""mistake"" and urged it to be rescinded.

From the time it was signed, many in Israel thought the gas deal was merely a giveaway - that Israel had basically just accepted Hezbollah's position on where to demarcate the maritime border - and that Israel had gotten very little from it, especially considering that the deal, by itself, did nothing to resolve the decades of hostility between the two countries. Since October 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began firing over 9000 rockets into Israel, ostensibly in support of Hamas in Gaza, calls in Israel's energy sector have been growing to declare the agreement invalid. Since Israel started aggressively hitting Hezbollah two weeks ago with the now infamous ""pager attack,"" those calls have now reached ministerial level.

Israel's critics claim that cancelling the deal would fit a decades long pattern of ""Israeli expansionism,"" and that Israel really wants to take all the disputed gas fields for itself. However, given the mood in Israel following the October 7, 2023, massacre, and the Hezbollah rockets, that criticism likely will fall on deaf ears. As TotalEnergies, the French energy consortium, is one of the developers of the Lebanese gas field, Israel might be prepared to scuttle that development as retaliation for what it perceives as untimely actions and certain comments on the situation by French President Emanuel Macron that are perceived, at least to some in Israel, to be pro Lebanese in nature.

Of course, such a move by Israel would come with substantial risks, both domestically and internationally. For one thing, it could make the Jewish State seem less reliable in its agreements and international business affairs generally. That could be economically devastating for a small country with a very limited domestic market. It also could make it more difficult for Israel to develop and find markets for its own natural gas in the future, with further unknown consequences.

In any event, the natural gas story is worth watching for any student of the Middle East or those whose lives are wrapped up in it. As events may continue to deteriorate, natural gas exploration on the Israeli/Lebanese maritime frontier, having once so promising a future for those who earnestly want to see the fighting and hostility replaced by a lasting peace, looks like it may become another casualty of the seemingly endless regional instability. One can only hope that, in the future, after a time when cooler heads and economic realities may eventually prevail, it will be among the first symbols of regional restoration as well."
Oil Facilities In Iran That Could Be In Israel's Sights,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gauravsharma/2024/10/02/oil-facilities-in-iran-that-could-be-in-israels-sights/,2024-10-02T12:40:40Z,"After Iran attacked Israel with nearly 200 missiles late on Tuesday and the latter vowed to retaliate, oil prices surged upwards from their recent lows on heightened tension in the Middle East.

At 7:50am EDT on Wednesday, the Brent front-month futures contract was trading at $75.63 per barrel up $2.07 or 2.80% while the West Texas Intermediate was up $2.21 or 3.16% to $72.04 per barrel.

Iran said it had attacked Israel in response to its ""aggressive acts"", including the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran had ""made a big mistake and will pay for it"".

This may be a coded warning that Israel will go after in Iran's oil facilities. According to industry data aggregator and research firm Kpler, Iran exported 1.194 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and gas condensate in spring 2023, a figure that rose to a five-year high of 1.65 million bpd in the first five months of 2024.

So, the industry is an obvious target for Israel should it choose to, and the extent of the market impact depends on chosen targets and the scale of the response. In this respect, four sites of strategic importance come to mind.

The first of these is the Kharg Oil Terminal, situated on Kharg Island, 15 miles off Iran's Northern Coast. It handles over 90% of the country's global crude oil exports.

The second could be a number of oil terminals in the Southern province of Hormozgan. It also has two free trade zones on Kish and Qeshm Islands. Kish is also home of the Iranian oil bourse - the only exchange of its kind that does not trade oil and derivatives in U.S. dollars.

The third, and more domestically focused site, is the Abadan Refinery located across Shatt Al-Arab River on the border between Iraq and Iran. Reliable up-to-date data on the refinery's production capacity is hard to find. But estimates and local sources suggest it could be producing around 400,000 bpd. As Iran's oldest processing facility, originally built in 1909 by Anglo-Persian oil (which later became BP), it services around 25% of Iran's domestic fuel demand.

Mahshahr Oil Terminal, an oil port located on the Khor Musa Channel, is the fourth site. It stores and shifts products from the Abadan Refinery, and serves as an engineering and jetty construction hub for Iran.

All these sites were targeted by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war and severely crippled the Iranian economy. It makes them obvious potential target for Israel and will likely have an impact on the global oil market to varying degrees.

The most devastating Israeli strike carrying global implications would be an attack on Kharg Oil Terminal. Such an attack will likely result in a short-term crude price spike of around 5% as it carries the potential for international disruption, primarily to Iran's exports to China - the world's largest importer of oil.

On the other hand, an attack on Hormozgan oil facilities will likely be more about symbolism given that many of the province's terminals are largely unused due to sanctions, creaking infrastructure and years of Western sanctions on Iranian oil. Israel may attack these to send a message.

Should Abadan Refinery be targeted, it will largely break Iran's domestic fuel supply chain but perhaps does not carry any significant international implications. However, should the nearby Mahshahr Oil Terminal be subject to an Israeli strike, again both crude and product supply chain issues will likely arise.

If these real-time geopolitical developments were clouding the market a decade ago, most observers would factor in a double-digit near-term uptick in oil prices. However, despite all what the current year has thrown at the oil market, prices - using Brent as a benchmark - are still nearly $10 lower than October last year, and at one point hit lows last seen in 2021 earlier this month.

That's because unlike a decade ago, oil production outside the Middle East has steadily risen. The U.S. is currently the world's largest crude oil producer. Production in Brazil, Canada, Guyana and Norway is also at record levels. Furthermore, the Saudis are holding back substantial spare capacity.

All of this is occurring at a time of uncertain oil demand and global macroeconomic challenges. Even the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) - considered to be among the more bullish demand forecasters out in the market - now expects lower demand growth both in 2024 and 2025.

As does the International Energy Agency (IEA), though both continue to offer vastly divergent oil demand growth forecasts for 2024 of less than 1 million bpd in the agency's case, and just over 2 million bpd in OPEC's case.

So while geopolitical tension in the Middle East may not be new, today's oil market doesn't even remotely resemble that of the last decade. Always remember that when oil futures reflect a geopolitical ""risk premium"", it is based on fears of a potentially imminent loss of supply as is the case at the moment.

Once the loss does happen - say following a potential Israeli attack - it morphs from being a risk to market reality and corrective mechanisms kick in both on the supply as well as pricing side. That's unless there is further loss of supply which is the unknown variable for the market.

Ultimately, elevated tension between Iran and Israel and the wider conflict in Gaza and Lebanon is something the oil market could well do without, but is one that it currently appears capable of handling with all eyes now on what Israel will do next."
Houthis And Iraqi Militias Target Israel Amidst Lebanon Escalation,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pauliddon/2024/10/01/houthis-and-iraqi-militias-target-israel-amidst-lebanon-escalation/,2024-10-01T17:05:25Z,"The Houthis in Yemen and the Iran-backed Iraqi militias that operate under the banner of the self-styled Islamic Resistance of Iraq, IRI, are continuing their long-range missile and drone attacks against Israel. Their latest attacks coincide with Israel's assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and its ground incursion into South Lebanon. They are unlikely to weaken Israel nor substantially distract it from its Lebanon offensive.

Houthi spokesperson Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree boasted in a televised speech on Tuesday that the group launched drones against military targets in Israel's financial hub, Tel Aviv, and the southern port city of Eilat. Israeli media speculated that Saree was referring to drones intercepted by the Israeli Air Force over the Mediterranean Sea off the country's coast.

Despite incurring Israeli retaliatory airstrikes, the Houthis have continued their drone and missile campaign.

The same day Israel assassinated Nasrallah -- Friday, September 27 -- Saree announced the group targeted Tel Aviv and Ashkelon with drones and missiles, vowing to continue such attacks until Israel ceases operations in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip. Israel intercepted a missile launched from Yemen that same day.

The next day, Israel intercepted another missile. The Houthis later claimed they had fired it at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International Airport to coincide with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's return flight from the United Nations. Israel responded Sunday by bombing Yemen in retaliation for those two attacks, killing four people and wounding 29.

The IRI also claimed Sunday that it dispatched a drone toward Eilat, its first since Nasrallah's assassination.

Even before the Hezbollah leader's demise, the IRI vowed to militarily support Hezbollah, especially following the September 17-18 Hezbollah pager and walkie-talkie explosions across Lebanon and Israel's intensified and devastating air campaign against the group.

For example, one of the most powerful groups in the IRI, Kataib Hezbollah, promptly declared it was ""fully prepared to go with them until the end, sending fighters and equipment and support, whether on the technical or logistical level.""

On September 20, a Kaitab Hezbollah commander, Abu Haider al-Khafaji, was killed by a suspected Israeli drone attack on his vehicle at Damascus airport.

When Hezbollah launched its first ballistic missile aimed at Tel Aviv on September 25, the IRI seemingly followed suit by launching drones at Eilat hours later. The IRI attack lightly injured two civilians and caused light damage. Israeli air defenses intercepted the lone Hezbollah missile.

Two days earlier, the IRI launched an estimated six attacks in 24 hours, using cruise missiles and drones. They were either intercepted or did not reach their targets.

The IRI primarily use Iranian-made Shahed 101 and Samad loitering munitions -- informally referred to as suicide or kamikaze drones -- and Al-Arqab cruise missiles, a variant of Iran's Paveh, in their attacks targeting Israel. Overall, the IRI claims it has launched more than 100 missile and drones against Israel since Hamas' fateful October 7, 2023, attacks ignited the current, ongoing hostilities throughout the region.

Iran also supplied these Iraqi militias with short-range ballistic missiles beginning in 2018. It doesn't seem the IRI has used any SRBMs, likely cognizant of the escalatory potential doing so could pose.

""The Iraqi armed factions are still cautious in getting fully involved in the conflict as they're well aware of the risks,"" wrote Middle East analyst Mohammed Salih in a post on X on September 25. ""But they seem to be steadily on course to intensify their attacks, based on their calculations, evaluation of the circumstances, and the level of support they believe is necessary to ease the pressure on Lebanese Hezbollah.""

Israel's first attack against Yemen targeted the Hodeidah port on July 20, killing 14 people, mostly port employees. It had launched the attack a day after a Houthi Samad drone struck Tel Aviv for the first time, killing one civilian. The drone had evaded Israeli air defenses by approaching Israel from its Mediterranean coast. Israel's intercept of a drone from that same general direction Tuesday morning indicates it learned from that fatal incident.

When the Houthis launched what they dubiously claimed was a hypersonic missile directly at Tel Aviv on September 15, Israeli air defenses also intercepted it. Netanyahu referenced the prior Hodeidah strike when warning the group it would pay ""a heavy price"" for such actions but did not launch any subsequent strikes until the one on Sunday mentioned above.

Unlike the Houthis in Yemen, Israel has not retaliated for any of the IRI attacks by striking those militias on Iraqi territory. It may seek to avoid making the situation for U.S. troops stationed in Iraq, who have come under repeated fire by the IRI since October 2023, more precarious, especially at a time when Washington is negotiating a troop drawdown with Baghdad. That could change if any of these attacks cause significant casualties or damage or if the IRI follows in the Houthis footsteps and fires SRBMs directly at Tel Aviv from Iraqi soil.

Following the IRI drone and cruise missile launches on September 22-23, reporters asked Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari whether Israel might retaliate with an attack in Iraq. ""We are following the threat from Iraq,"" he stated. ""We are looking at it during our situation assessment, collecting intelligence and we will do whatever is necessary to deal with the situation.""

The IRI and the Houthis claimed they carried out joint attacks against Israel in recent months, with the Yemen-based group recently opening an office in Baghdad. However, these moves seem more politically symbolic than strategic.

With Hezbollah under immense pressure in Lebanon, these groups are likely to continue firing their drones and missiles at Israel. While these attacks are an irritant for Israel, they are unlikely to pose a serious enough threat for it to divert substantial military resources away from the Lebanon front, at least in the short to medium term. For now, it will rely on its extensive, multi-layered air and missile defenses to shoot down incoming targets and, at least in the case of Yemen, its air force to launch occasional strikes in response."
Trey Yingst: Redefining War Correspondence In The Digital Age,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ianshepherd/2024/09/30/trey-yingst-redefining-war-correspondence-in-the-digital-age/,2024-09-30T20:59:45Z,"In an era where traditional media is rapidly evolving, Trey Yingst stands out as a trailblazer, redefining the role of a foreign correspondent for the digital age. As the chief foreign correspondent for Fox News, Yingst has not only excelled in conventional reporting but has also emerged as a pioneer in leveraging social media to deliver real-time, impactful journalism to a global audience.

The Journey to Fox News

Yingst's journey into journalism began during his college years at American University in Washington, D.C. In 2016, while still a student, he co-founded a company called ""News to Share,"" which allowed him to report from conflict zones around the world. This early experience sparked a passion that would define his career.

""This was my first taste of international journalism,"" Yingst recalls. ""I traveled all over the world, from Ukraine to Gaza to Sub-Saharan Africa. This is when I think my passion was really sparked for what I'm doing today.""

Now, a decade later, Yingst finds himself at the pinnacle of his field, serving as the chief foreign correspondent for Fox News. His role involves leading all foreign coverage for the network, not just from the Middle East but also from hotspots like Afghanistan, Ukraine, Pakistan, Lebanon, and Iraq.

Embracing Social Media in Journalism

What sets Yingst apart is his innovative approach to using social media platforms as an extension of his reporting. Recognizing the changing habits of news consumers, particularly younger audiences, Yingst has adapted his journalistic style to meet viewers where they are - on their phones and social media feeds.

""You know, there are millions of people who want to watch on TV, and they have cable, and each day or night they sit down and they sit in front of their TV and watch the news,"" Yingst explains. ""A new generation of people, they're consuming news in a different way. They're consuming it on social media. They're consuming it on their phones, on the go.""

To cater to this evolving audience, Yingst uses a variety of platforms including TikTok, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and Facebook. He tailors his content to each platform, ensuring that his reporting reaches the widest possible audience in the most engaging formats.

Innovative Content Formats

Yingst's social media strategy involves a mix of different content types, each designed to give viewers a unique perspective on the stories he covers:

1. Selfie Videos: These short, personal videos allow viewers to feel as if they're on the ground with Yingst. He recalls a viral TikTok video of him riding in the back of a pickup truck with the Taliban, which resonated strongly with younger audiences who hadn't seen this type of raw, immediate reporting before.

2. Raw Footage: On platforms like Instagram, Yingst shares unedited video from the field, such as rockets being intercepted or scenes of destruction in Gaza. This gives viewers an unfiltered look at the realities of conflict zones.

3. Real-Time Text Updates: On X, Yingst provides rapid-fire text updates, taking advantage of the platform's features to bold or italicize key information. This creates a newsletter-like experience for followers seeking the latest developments.

4. Photography: Through his Instagram page ""Experience Humans"" Yingst shares powerful still images that humanize the individuals caught in conflicts, fostering empathy and understanding among his audience.

Ethical Considerations in Real-Time Reporting

With the immediacy of social media comes heightened responsibility. Yingst is acutely aware of the ethical considerations in reporting from conflict zones and sharing potentially sensitive content in real-time.

""For me, ethics is of the utmost importance,"" Yingst emphasizes. ""When we're covering an active war zone where things are changing very quickly, you have civilians involved. Oftentimes people are killed or injured in front of you, and so you have to think about that as you are reporting.""

Yingst maintains a strict policy of aligning his social media journalism with the high standards of television reporting. He's transparent with his audience about the information he chooses to withhold for ethical reasons and provides content warnings when sharing graphic or potentially disturbing material.

""Black Saturday"": A Journalistic Milestone

Yingst's commitment to comprehensive, balanced reporting is perhaps best exemplified in his new book, ""Black Saturday."" The book provides an in-depth account of the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas and the subsequent war, offering perspectives from all sides of the conflict.

""Black Saturday is the gold standard in journalism about the October 7 massacre, Black Saturday and the war that followed,"" Yingst states. ""It is a book like no other, because it takes the reader into that day, not just from the perspective of my team on the ground in southern Israel as the attack is unfolding, but you also hear firsthand accounts from police officers, from soldiers, from survivors, from hostages who were taken from their homes and dragged into Gaza and then later released as part of the November ceasefire deal.""

The book also includes accounts from Palestinian civilians, doctors, journalists, and Hamas officials, providing a 360-degree view of the conflict. This approach aligns with Yingst's commitment to objective, informative journalism that follows in the footsteps of industry greats like Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite.

The Mental and Physical Toll of War Reporting

""Black Saturday"" also touches on an often-overlooked aspect of war correspondence: the mental health challenges faced by reporters in conflict zones. Yingst is candid about the difficulties of processing the traumatic events witnessed in the field while maintaining professional composure and meeting the demands of real-time reporting.

To cope with these challenges, Yingst emphasizes the importance of preparation. ""I am a big believer in preparing mentally and physically for war during times of peace,"" he says. His regimen includes daily gym visits, running, meditation, a healthy diet, and practices like cold exposure to maintain mental discipline.

The Future of Journalism

Yingst's approach to journalism represents a new paradigm in news reporting. By combining traditional journalistic values with innovative use of social media, he's creating a model for how reporters can engage with audiences in the digital age.

""I think you'll continue to see a shift in the industry as a whole, as social media gets more and more popular in the way that people consume videos changes,"" Yingst predicts. He envisions a future where audiences can curate their news diet across various platforms, from traditional TV broadcasts to streaming services and social media updates.

For aspiring journalists looking to follow in his footsteps, Yingst offers two key pieces of advice: set a long-term goal and put in consistent, disciplined work. ""Understand that I didn't have more than 400,000 X followers overnight. I've been on X for more than 10 years,"" he says, emphasizing the importance of persistence and hard work in building a following and credibility as a journalist.

As the media landscape continues to evolve, Trey Yingst stands as a prime example of how traditional journalism can adapt and thrive in the digital age. His innovative approach to reporting, commitment to ethical standards, and ability to connect with audiences across multiple platforms make him a true pioneer in the field of modern journalism."
Israel-Hezbollah Fight Offers A Chance To Reset The Region's Balance,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/melikkaylan/2024/09/30/israel-hezbollah-fight-offers-a-chance-to-reset-the-regions-balance/,2024-09-30T19:42:36Z,"In the previous installment dated September 25, this column discussed the repercussions of Israel's hammering of Hezbollah on the stability of Lebanon as a whole. In other words, the column outlined the chance of a renewed Lebanese civil war as a result of Shiite refugees flooding other neighborhoods that didn't want them - notably Druze and Maronite Christian areas. But the column's main argument centered around a positive outcome: a major shake-up in which Lebanon could rid itself of domination by Hezbollah and Iran, something many Lebanese (including many Lebanese Shiites) would quietly welcome. At the time of writing, Nasrallah was still alive.

Some parts of that column, with a brief foray into Lebanese civil war (1975 - 1990) history, also discussed the wider regional implications of a Hezbollah collapse in the present. The fact is the US and the West accepted the ultimate control over Lebanon by anti-Western rivals - Syria/Iran - in exchange for stability in the Middle East, a strategic, oil-producing region. But times have changed. Energy-wise the US has become effectively self-sufficient. It has no pressing need for Mideast oil. Therefore no urgent motivation to accept stability in undesirable configurations. The other side of that coin is that the US has no particular reason for imposing peace or getting over-involved directly. And so, longterm, a vacuum obtains. At first glance, it seems nobody has the clout or incentive to co-ordinate a wholistic peace - not the US, not Moscow, not Tehran, not the Chinese.

For the West though, despite its reluctance, the opportunity may be too good to overlook - eventually. For now though, as the previous column noted, this moment offers Israel itself a rare chance to undertake a quiet diplomatic offensive alongside the military one so that conditions don't return to status quo in Lebanon where another war with Hezbollah will erupt anew in 15 or so years (the last one was in 2006). There are voices aplenty, not least in Israel itself, who argue that Netanyahu has no interest in carving out peace from chaos because conflict is keeping him in power. Maybe so, but conditions have never been so opportune and it may be his only chance for saving his reputation among the Israeli population after such a long war. And after the massive intelligence failure of October 7 that led to so much bloodshed.

Why are conditions uniquely opportune? Let us itemize. All the opposing forces are historically absent. The Soviet Union is gone. Russia is too distracted in Ukraine to play a spoiler role. Saddam is gone. Gaddafi is gone. Syria has fragmented and Assad's government remains barely functional. Iran keeps refusing the invitation to all-out war - largely because it knows that any pressure from outside will reinvigorate domestic rebellion and could collapse the regime. In effect, actively anti-Israel regional powers are weaker than ever before. Furthermore, the Sunni states roundabout would welcome any chance to disrupt Iran's hegemony.

We are talking about Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the like. Which is why the diplomacy must be conducted ultra-quietly. No such leaders in the current climate can openly participate in making peace with Israel after all their criticisms of Gaza. For that reason, the Abraham Accords lie in tatters - a despoliation very deliberately aimed at by Iran and Hamas via October 7. They and Russia were very sore at being left out by the Accords in shaping the region's future and crafted a way to turn things around. But the Middle East is a very hard-headed place. All the above Sunni countries' leaders, despite their public outrage over Gaza, will jump at the chance of creating a new regional order sans the domination of Iran - and participate in restoring the primacy of Sunni over Shia. Present popularity and a place in the history of Islam should prove sufficient incentive for each to grandstand as peacemakers and unifiers of the faithful.

So what's needed now is an expanded reconfigured version of the Accords in which additional Sunni countries, those with the capacity to do so like the above mentioned, share a stake in the stability of Gaza and Lebanon. American participation is unlikely to be a factor until after the US elections. Certainly, Israel cannot expect US help in any direct war with Iran until then at least, if at all. And Iran is unlikely to enter such a face-off for the reason cited above but also because its main ally Russia will discourage a distraction from the focus on Ukraine. (Moscow cannot afford Iran to be diverting its military resources - Shahed drones - en masse elsewhere.) So, the proxy wars will continiue. Sadly, we will likely see for the next few months Hezbollah and Lebanon enduring increased Israeli punishment, likely in the form of an extended invasion and incessant bombing. Syria and even parts of Yemen will taste the wrath of the Israeli war machine. In the meantime, Netanyahu will have a historic opening for rearranging the balance of power in the region with lasting security for Israel if he proceeds with a simultaneous diplomatic initiative."
Israeli Special Forces Reportedly Carry Out Cross-Border Raids Into Lebanon As Air Strikes Continue,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2024/09/30/israeli-special-forces-reportedly-carry-out-cross-border-raids-into-lebanon-as-air-strikes-continue/,2024-09-30T12:43:28Z,"Israeli special forces have conducted small-scale raids into southern Lebanon, reports citing Israeli officials said early on Monday, just days after its defense officials indicated they were preparing for a possible ground invasion into Lebanon that could escalate the conflict into a full-blown regional war.

Hezbollah's deputy leader Naim Qassem delivered the Iran-backed militia's first public statement since the death of its leader Hassan Nasrallah on Monday. He said the group would name a new leader ""as soon as possible,"" adding, ""We will face any possibility and we are ready if the Israelis decide to enter by land and the resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement...We will continue to support Gaza and to defend Lebanon.""

Israel's military began its air strikes on Lebanon last week, with its leaders suggesting at the time they were open to the possibility of a ground invasion. On Wednesday, CNN reported that IDF Chief of the General Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi met with troops along Israel's northern border on Wednesday and pointed to the airstrikes, saying: ""This is both to prepare the ground for your possible entry and to continue degrading Hezbollah."" According to the Journal's report, there is no fixed timeline in place for a potential ground invasion as Israel is ""under heavy pressure from the U.S."" to avoid such an operation.

Israel is facing growing international pressure to agree to a ceasefire in Lebanon amid fears that the situation could spiral into an all-out regional war. Last week, the IDF began conducting a large-scale aerial bombardment campaign targeting what it said were Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon. The strikes have resulted in hundreds of deaths and have forced tens of thousands of civilians to flee from their homes. On Friday, Hezbollah's long-time leader Nasrallah was killed by an airstrike targeting the suburbs near Beirut. A day before the strike on Nasrallah, the U.S., France, and a group of allied countries called for a 21-day ceasefire in Lebanon. But the proposal was dismissed by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said the IDF would ""continue fighting with full force.""

Chappell Roan Cancels Appearances In New York And D.C --  Her Kamala Harris Endorsement Controversy Explained,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/09/27/chappell-roan-cancels-appearances-in-new-york-and-dc--her-kamala-harris-endorsement-controversy-explained/,2024-09-27T17:59:50Z,"Pop singer Chappell Roan, who rapidly rose to fame this year, canceled upcoming appearances at the ""All Things Go"" festivals in New York and Washington, D.C. to ""prioritize my health,"" days after she faced backlash over her comments criticizing both political parties and her initial refusal to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris.

Roan (whose real name is Kayleigh Rose Amstutz) has made several statements in recent weeks criticizing the government and both political parties, largely over her pro-Palestinian views and her advocacy for transgender rights. She told Rolling Stone earlier this month she doesn't ""have a side because I hate both sides"" and is ""so embarrassed about everything going on right now."" She doubled down last week, telling The Guardian she doesn't ""feel pressured to endorse someone"" because ""there's problems on both sides."" Following criticism from Democrats, who compared her unfavorably to straightforward Harris endorsements by fellow pop stars Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish, Roan clarified her views in two TikTok videos this week. On Tuesday, Roan posted a video urging followers to ""use critical thinking skills"" and said it is ""important to question authority and question world leaders,"" clarifying she would not vote for Trump, but did not say whether she would vote for Harris. In another video posted Wednesday, Roan said she will vote for Harris, but clarified she would not fully endorse her because she does not agree with some of Harris' stances, reiterating her views on Gaza and transgender rights. Roan did not specify which of Harris' views on trans rights she opposed, but she previously told Rolling Stone she disagreed with a White House statement sent to the New York Times voicing opposition to gender-affirming surgery for minors -- though the White House reportedly clarified weeks later it will ""continue to fight state and national bans on gender-affirming care"" but believes surgeries should be reserved for adults.

""Yes, one's obviously better than the other,"" Roan said, adding, ""I hope you don't settle for what we have.""

Roan, who is a lesbian and has said much of her artistry is inspired by drag performers, previously turned down an offer to perform at the White House during Pride Month, telling Rolling Stone: ""I'm not going to go to the White House because I am not going to be a monkey for Pride."" Roan said she considered going to read poems written by Palestinian women, but decided against it for security reasons.

Roan has also spoken in recent weeks of feeling pressure because of her rapid rise to fame. She rose to prominence earlier this year following an opening slot on Olivia Rodrigo's tour, a series of successful music festival performances, including what officials estimated was the biggest Lollapalooza set of all time, and a slew of hits including ""Good Luck, Babe!"" and ""Hot to Go!"" Roan has complained about alleged stalkers and harassers in multiple interviews and social media posts, stating: ""I'm allowed to say no to creepy behavior."" She addressed struggling with her newfound fame on stage in June, telling fans: ""I just feel a little off today because I think that my career is just kind of going really fast and it's really hard to keep up.""

The Fed's Rate Cut:  A 'Soft Landing' - Or 'Fake News'?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2024/09/26/the-feds-rate-cut--a-soft-landing--or-fake-news/,2024-09-26T17:53:47Z,"On September 18, at precisely 2:00 pm, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve announced a reduction of 50 basis points (½ of 1%) in the Fed Funds target rate.

It was the first rate cut in 4 ½ years, finally reversing the most aggressive interest rate increase program in decades.

50 bps was said to be ""emphatic."" The Financial Times called it a ""jumbo cut."" The Wall Street Journal headlined ""Fed Goes Big.""

Chairman Powell called it ""an appropriate recalibration"" - and repeated that phrase nine times.

The announcement set the stock market ringing like a bell.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 300 points in the first 60 seconds after Powell began to speak. Then it fell back 300 points. Then it was up 200. And then down 280. Up again, and then down 400. In 2 hours, the supposedly staid Dow racked up almost 2500 points in round trip mileage - trillions of dollars of value sloshing around in the gold-plated bathtub known as the U.S. stock market.

The next day, turmoil gave way to relief. The market surged to a new record. ""A furious rally"" swept global markets. European stocks had their best day in a month. Japan's Nikkei average was up 2%. The announcement pushed all the other big stories of the day - the Presidential race, Gaza, Ukraine - to the sidelines.

A Chick-Fil-A sign in northeast Washington DC alerted customers to the big news: ""50 points."" A strange message from a fast food outlet. Was an update on monetary policy somehow more important than the price of a chicken sandwich? Or maybe it was a clever prompt - Come on in, let's celebrate!

Big, bold, jumbo, emphatic, furious, all that - however, this move was no surprise. It would be hard to even call it ""news."" Chairman Powell all but pre-announced the rate cut 27 days prior to the event - ""the time has come for policy to adjust"" - in his Jackson Hole address. The timing was known. The direction was known. The markets had ample opportunity to price it in. A believer in efficient markets would have said that very little new information was introduced on Wednesday.

(True, the exact size of the rate cut was not known. 25 basis points? or 50? It had become the focus of intense speculation. But does this small difference really matter? Not everyone thinks so. I'll come back to it below.)

The ragged price discovery path on Sept 18 exposed the clash of two opposing ""investment theses,"" battling it out in the market.

On the one hand, monetary easing usually bodes well for the stock market. Since 1974, on occasions where the Fed initiated a rate cutting cycle, the market has been up eight out of ten times the following year.

On the other hand, the last three rate cutting episodes have been less fortunate for investors. In those cases, the cut was followed by an economic downturn. If the economy today really needs a stimulus, maybe it means there's trouble ahead. According to Torsten Sløk of Apollo, the rates markets are already pricing in a recession. The Wall Street Journal was spooked in particular by the size of the reduction.

Still, on Thursday morning the Dow opened up 450 points, and maintained this level for several days now. The optimists' view has prevailed, for now.

But is this optimism justified? In all this sound and fury, what is the real news here? There are several layers of misinterpretation that have to be stripped away to get at the true significance of this event.

An adjustment of the Fed Funds Rate can be interpreted in two ways:

Some assume that lowering the Federal Funds Rate will have a direct positive effect on the economy, reducing the cost of credit, stimulating demand and spending, influencing banks' lending, even boosting the labor market and creating new jobs. But is this likely?

It is not clear.

First of all, what is the Fed Funds Rate (FFR), exactly? The way it's talked and written about, one might think the Fed is immediately mandating lower interest rates across the economy. But no - the FFR applies only to the interest rate target for overnight loans of a very specific type, involving transactions between banks.

The FFR comes into play when a bank finds itself with more cash on account with the Fed (its reserves) than it really needs - or not enough. If Bank A is short and wants to top off its reserves, it can borrow from Bank B which has a surplus - and Bank B can earn some interest. The actual FFR (different from the target FFR) is the interest rate that Banks A and B freely negotiate for this transaction. It is determined by the banks, not by the Fed.

That's a key point. The Fed doesn't actually set the rate; it only defines a target. Whether the FFR target has any effect on the credit markets depends on whether the banks go along.

The Fed is merely an ""influencer"" - albeit a powerful one, with various carrots and sticks to deploy for encouraging the private sector to play along.

[Note: The mechanisms for controlling the market's response to the FFR and reserve levels are quite complicated, involving other interest rates which the Fed can set and are not simply targets. Still, the system is not fully deterministic, and depends substantially on market responses from private sector participants (banks).]

So what is the effect of the Fed dropping the target by ½ of 1%? As noted, that ultimately depends on what the banks do, driven by market conditions and the real demand for credit. Actual market rates for interbank credit transactions that impact the economy are often significantly higher than the FFR target. The interbank offered rate - which was for decades the chief measure of the cost of credit in the market - is almost always higher than the FFR (partly due to the longer term, of course, but also partly due to the difference between ""market reality"" and ""policy goals"").

The shifts in the market rate also tend to lag the reversals in the central bank policy by several quarters.

It is hard to make the case that shaving a few basis points off the target for an overnight funding benchmark that only applies to banks lending to each other (not to consumers or businesses) would per se have an immediate impact on the real economy. The causal link is too attenuated, and the size of the adjustment is too small, to move the needle in a $100 Trillion credit market. For comparison, consider that the interest rate on 30-year home mortgages has fallen by over 100 basis points since May, and home sales have continued to decline, dropping by 12% in that period. Cheaper credit does not necessarily spur more borrowing.

But it is assumed - typically without question - that the reduction in the FFR will at least lead to a lowering of other interest rates. In fact, the rates (yields) on Treasurys actually rose after the announcement of the Fed Rate cut, as The Wall Street Journal reported:

Treasury Yields arguably influence credit markets much more than the FFR.

Over time, trends in short term rates like the FFR and in longer-term rates like 10-year Treasury yields do tend to align, but the relationship is quite noisy. It is neither automatic nor necessarily immediate. This suggests that the causal connection is not as solid as is usually supposed.

Fed rate policy is better understood as a messaging program. The FFR is a crucial signal. But what is it signaling?

The view of many economists and financial market analysts is that the current rate cut, relatively insignificant in itself, predicts the future trend in rate cuts which will eventually cumulate to produce a more substantial impact.

Some observers, including some at the Fed itself, now forecast rates reaching 3% by the end of 2026. The Federal Open Market Committee's dot plots project another ~200 bps reduction over the next two years. (Of course it must be acknowledged that the Fed is ""terrible at predicting what it will do."")

It is an article of faith that a changes in the FFR impact credit costs across the economy. This affects the real economy in certain ways. Changes in the growth rate of consumer loans are inversely correlated with the FFR after a lag of about 6 months - meaning lower rates will stimulate borrowing. But more fundamental measures of economic health - GDP growth, consumer spending, job creation - do not show the same pattern.

For those unfamiliar with the meaning of correlation statistics, all of these readings signal a very weak association, if any. Correlation doesn't prove causality, but lack of correlation is strong evidence for the absence of causality.

The lack of correlation with jobs growth is particularly striking, since Fed officials have explicitly tied the rate-change decision to the health of the labor market. Yet the FFR apparently has had no measurable effect on job creation over the last decade.

The FFR appears to be ineffectual with respect to impacting many measures of real economic performance in the following 1-2 years.

So, was the Fed's announcement, or the media's headline interpretation of it, ""fake news""?

Much of the coverage is misleading at least. The reduction in interest rates will not cure whatever ails the labor markets. Based on past experience, it will not directly spur job creation or economic growth, either immediately or over the next couple years.

The real message of this maneuver is quite different. It is has to do with public psychology, and public trust, which Jerome Powell as has said ""is really the Fed's and any central bank's most important asset.""

The Federal Reserve is a faith-based institution. Its effectiveness rests on the public confidence.

The surge of inflation in 2021-2022 (which trailed through the year-over-year statistics well into 2023) damaged the Fed's credibility enormously. In December 2022, the Washington Post wrote in a lead editorial:

This is strong language. But the danger is real. Confidence in the Fed touched an all-time low in 2023, and is up only slightly in 2024. The Fed's ""most important asset"" has been dangerously impaired.

The rate cut was really about repairing the Fed's credibility. ""Going big"" with 50 basis points is not about the economic impact. It is a psychological gambit, intended to convey decisiveness and self-confidence.

Powell used that interesting new word - ""recalibrating"" - nine times in the press conference. It is the next policy mantra, replacing ""transitory"" and ""higher for longer"" etc. ""Recalibration"" suggests a machine that is capable of precision, accuracy. The Fed needs the public to believe that it can fine-tune policy and control events once again.

This is misleading, however, if not outright deception (""fake news""?). When it comes to the real economy, the Federal Reserve is ineffectual, even helpless, to a degree far greater than it can afford to admit openly. The Central Bank neither caused nor cured the recent surge of price inflation. It can do nothing to affect the price of gasoline or eggs or used cars. It cannot ""create jobs."" It can barely influence the cost of bank credit. It can't even do very much to help the housing market, which is the sector of the economy where interest rates matter most. ""The Fed can cut rates but it can't fix the housing crisis"" headlined Fortune magazine (Sept 19, 2024).

The Fed is the Central Bank not just for the United States, but in effect for the entire world - and the world needs a Central Bank it can believe in. Credibility is crucial and the Fed is right to do what it can to try to recover it. But we should understand what the rate cut was really about. It should not be advertised as something it is not. The Fed shouldn't be selling ""growth."" And the Chick-Fil-A folks should stick to selling sandwiches rather than basis points."
Is the UAE a Force For Stability in the Middle East?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhartung/2024/09/26/is-the-uae-a-force-for-stability-in-the-middle-east/,2024-09-26T15:38:42Z,"During a White House visit earlier this week, President Biden and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan expressed their desire to intensify cooperation between their two nations on a variety of fronts. Most notably, President Biden designated the UAE as a Major Defense Partner, which the White House said ""will allow for unprecedented cooperation through joint training, exercises, and military-to-military collaboration, between the military forces of the United States, the UAE, and India, as well as other common military partners, in furtherance of regional stability."" But the UAE's recent track record raises serious doubts about its interest in promoting stability in the Middle East, and highlights its pursuit of its own narrow interests, often through military means. The new designation amounts to a virtual endorsement of the UAE's aggressive, destabilizing history in the Middle East and North Africa.

With Israel escalating its Mideast war into Lebanon and the presidential campaign heating up, the news that the United States is strengthening its alliance with the United Arab Emirates is far off most people's radar. But it shouldn't be. The Biden administration's decision to double down on its relationship with the UAE is yet another example of its misguided approach to the region, from enabling Israeli aggression in Gaza and Lebanon to attempting to broker a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Far from sowing the seeds of stability and peace, the administration's maneuvers are bolstering three of the most disruptive, destabilizing states in the region - in essence rewarding them for their recent histories of aggression and human rights abuses.

While Saudi Arabia's misdeeds - from the murder of U.S.-resident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi to its devastating war in Yemen - are fairly well known, in many quarters the UAE is viewed as ""the good Gulf state"" - more sophisticated diplomatically, more diversified economically, and less egregious in its domestic and foreign policies. In addition, many U.S. military officials view the UAE as an asset in any future conflict based on their cooperation with U.S.-backed coalitions. The UAE has been nicknamed ""Little Sparta"" for its alleged fighting prowess.

The question is, what is the net effect of the UAE's military activities on its region? It was an active partner in the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, arming and training extremist militias. An investigation by CNN found that Saudi Arabia and the UAE provided the militias with U.S. supplied arms in violation of U.S. law, including everything from anti-tank weapons to armored vehicles. Even worse, the UAE and its Yemeni allies ran a series of secret prisons in southern Yemen where detainees were routinely tortured. It has never been held accountable for these abuses.

Yemen is just one of many recent conflicts where the UAE has played a negative role. As Declan Walsh and Christoph Koettl of the New York Times reported earlier this week, under the guise of providing humanitarian assistance to victims of the brutal civil war in Sudan, the UAE has been ""funneling money, weapons and . . . powerful drones to fighters rampaging across the country."" The UAE's weapons have gone to the Rapid Support Forces, the rebel group that is challenging Sudan's military for control of the country. Both sides of the war have been accused of committing war crimes, from bombing hospitals to blocking the delivery of humanitarian aid.

Sudan is only the latest example of the UAE's intervention in an African civil war. The UAE backed the Ethiopian government in its vicious civil war in the Tigray region earlier in this decade, supplying arms and attacking Tigrayan forces with drones.

And last but not least, in Libya the UAE backed the opposition forces led by Gen. Khalifa Haftar, supplying arms and even bombing a Libyan government military training compound. The UAE also helped finance the intervention in Libya by the brutal Russian-backed Wagner Group.

Is this the record of a nation that is likely to be a force for peace and stability in the region? The UAE has its own agenda - developing a security network and port access across the Persian Gulf and North Africa - that may or may not coincide with U.S. policy or long-term U.S. interests.

The next administration needs to take a careful look at U.S. security policy in the Middle East and recalibrate its relationships with governments engaged in aggression and human rights abuses, from Israel to Saudi Arabia to the UAE. Continuing down the current path is a recipe for continuing war and dangerous escalation."
Afghanistan Suspends Polio Vaccinations: What Are The Implications?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/markkortepeter/2024/09/24/afghanistan-suspends-polio-vaccinations-what-are-the-implications/,2024-09-24T14:14:46Z,"Afghanistan recently suspended its house-to-house polio vaccination efforts. Whether or not vaccinations will resume is uncertain. This has significant implications, because polio remains a threat despite an ongoing global eradication effort.

Afghanistan is one of only two countries left in the world that is endemic for polio, meaning polio continues to spread through the population. Even with recent vaccination efforts there, cases have been on the rise, with two reported in 2022, six in 2023 and 18 thus far in 2024. This is a worrisome trend. In neighboring Pakistan, the other remaining endemic country, cases have also been on the rise, with six reported in 2023 and 21 in 2024. There is significant cross-border traffic between the two countries, which provides opportunity for unchecked spread to new locations.

Infectious diseases have demonstrated over centuries their ability to take advantage of any openings we give them for spread. Active conflict and disrupted public health systems present prime opportunities for disease resurgence. Once we let up on our vaccination campaigns and other efforts to control infectious diseases, they can return with a vengeance. Poliovirus is still out there, lurking, and looking for weak spots in our armor. All it takes is one case to initiate an outbreak.

Unfortunately, we've experienced this situation repeatedly. As we saw recently in Gaza, the war disrupted the routine polio vaccinations. A massive effort was launched to vaccinate over 640,000 children after an unvaccinated 11-month-old became paralyzed. The child was the first polio case there in 25 years. Sewage also tested positive for the virus, meaning other unvaccinated children are at risk, because the disease spreads easily through human feces, which can contaminate food and drinking water.

We saw a similar challenge in Rockland County, New York in 2022. An unvaccinated adult male developed paralysis as the first polio case in New York since 1990. In the developed world, we have seen few cases of polio for decades. Unfortunately, that may create the perception that the disease is no longer a threat, and therefore cause one to question the ongoing need to vaccinate.

Any disruption in vaccination efforts can have negative consequences. I am reminded of John Donne's famous poem, ""No man is an island."" An infection in one place creates a risk everywhere, especially with the current ease of travel across the world. We can't hide easily from infectious diseases. They do not respect national borders. Countries with low vaccination levels are particularly at risk for outbreaks, including Indonesia, Mozambique, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines.

After the successful elimination of smallpox from humans, polio is one of a handful of diseases that were targeted for elimination. Following initial success led by the Pan American Health Organization in the Americas, the World Health Organization and multiple partners established the Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988. At the start of the GPEI effort, 125 countries reported poliovirus transmission. Since then, cases have declined by greater than 99.9%.

According to the latest Polio Eradication Strategy 2022-26, there have been some significant achievements over the past decade in the effort to eliminate polio: ""Wild poliovirus types 2 and 3 (WPV2 and WPV3) were declared eradicated in 2015 and 2019, respectively; the World Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia Region was declared free of poliovirus in 2014; and most recently, the WHO African Region was certified free of wild poliovirus (WPV) in August 2020.""

However, the report acknowledges how challenging it has been to reach the final goal of eradication. Wild poliovirus type one continues to spread in Afghanistan and Pakistan, along with circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type two, which originates from a vaccine strain that has mutated and reverted to become capable of causing disease. The vaccine-derived cVDPV2 also continues to fuel outbreaks in other regions of the world.

According to the eradication strategy, several challenges must be overcome to achieve success, including maintaining political will, better engagement and overcoming mistrust of the effort in affected communities, unfunded commitments, delays in detection of spread and logistical challenges that lead to delays in response to outbreaks.

The cessation of vaccination in Afghanistan adds one more challenge to reaching the desired end state of poliovirus eradication. Ideally, this will change and efforts will be reinvigorated along the lines outlined in the GPEI strategy. Achieving success and a polio-free world is in everyone's best interest."
Israel Launches More Strikes Against Hezbollah In Lebanon -- Killing Over 270 After Urging Evacuations,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2024/09/23/israel-launches-more-strikes-against-hezbollah-in-lebanon-killing-over-270-after-urging-evacuations/,2024-09-23T18:18:32Z,"The Israeli military said Monday it completed a series of strikes targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon, reportedly killing hundreds of people and injuring more than 1,000, marking the deadliest day of Israeli attacks in the country in more than a decade -- extending a months-long exchange of fire between the militant group and Israel.

Monday's death toll is the largest since at least 2006, when Israel and Hezbollah last engaged in a military conflict that killed more than 1,000 Lebanese, the Times reported.

Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesperson for the UN's human rights office, told Agence France-Presse the UN was ""extremely concerned, deeply worried about the escalation in Lebanon."" In a statement on X, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said he spoke with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Sunday evening and provided him with a ""situation assessment of Hezbollah threats and briefed him on IDF operations to degrade Hezbollah's ability to launch attacks against Israeli civilians. We also discussed the wider regional situation and the threats posed by Iran and its proxies.""

Monday's airstrikes come a day after Hezbollah fired more than 100 rockets into Northern Israel on Sunday. On Friday and Saturday, Israel conducted multiple air strikes targeting the militant group's leadership in Lebanon, including senior Hezbollah member Ibrahim Aqil -- who the U.S. accused of killing hundreds of Americans in two terror attacks in the 1980s. Earlier in the week, hundreds of pagers used by Hezbollah members exploded simultaneously across Lebanon and parts of Syria, killing at least a dozen people and injuring more than 2,750. Lebanese officials blamed the attacks on Israel -- who hasn't publicly accepted responsibility -- while Hezbollah leaders vowed to retaliate against the Jewish state. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his government will do whatever is necessary to return residents from northern Israeli cities -- who were forced to flee their homes in the areas amid an escalation along the border with Lebanon -- back to their homes safely.

The intensifying military exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah have raised fears that the situation could escalate into an all-out conflict between the two, even as Israel's war in Gaza is set to enter its second year. On Sunday, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told ABC News that the White House was doing ""everything we can to try to prevent this from becoming an all-out war there with Hezbollah across that Lebanese border."""

In the ultra-competitive world of cancer medicines, biotech company Summit Therapeutics is a relative minnow, with no revenue or approved drugs. But recent news around its most promising drug nearly doubled the company's share price, and minted its co-CEO Maky Zanganeh as a new billionaire.

The Iranian immigrant who fled her home country as a child is now one of just 34 self-made U.S. women billionaires, and one of three American women to have made a billion-dollar fortune in the healthcare sector.

Thanks to a $30 billion state-licensed cannabis economy spanning 38 states, marijuana legalization is no longer a Democratic issue by default, and is now becoming a proxy for classic conservative ideals: pro-business, states' rights and freedom from Big Government. After years of perpetuating the war on drugs, an expert told Forbes, the GOP has finally realized that legalization is happening with or without them -- and many lawmakers have decided to get on the bandwagon.

The Israeli military said it conducted a series of ""extensive"" airstrikes Monday targeting Hezbollah strongholds in southern Lebanon and urged civilians in the region to evacuate from their homes. It comes a day after Hezbollah fired more than 100 rockets into northern Israel, as well as Israeli airstrikes on Friday and Saturday that targeted the Iran-backed militant group's leadership in Lebanon. The intensifying military exchanges have raised fears of escalation into an all-out conflict, even as Israel's war in Gaza is set to enter its second year.

Athletics apparel giant Nike announced it would bring retired exec Elliot Hill back as CEO, replacing John Donahoe next month, in a move that powered a nearly 7% boost to the company's stock Friday. Nike has struggled under Donahoe's tenure, with criticism ranging from his leadership capabilities, to a crowded sportswear space and the broader retail decline in China.

Jeff Ferro, CEO of accounting firm Baker Tilly, reached an uncomfortable conclusion in 2022: To stay competitive, his firm had to invest more in technology, mergers and new hires. His solution was one that's grown increasingly common in the accounting industry: private equity. Five of the largest 25 U.S. accounting firms, ranked by revenue, have taken private equity money, and another five could well announce deals before the end of the year, according to an industry advisor.

Former President Donald Trump said in an interview he doesn't expect to seek office again if he loses to Kamala Harris in November's election. Trump became the oldest major party presidential nominee in history after President Joe Biden dropped out largely due to age concerns, and the Republican nominee would be 82 years old on Election Day in 2028.

The Secret Service was responsible for planning and communication failures that led to the shooting of Donald Trump in a July assassination attempt, according to an internal review of the agency's security practices during the incident. On Friday, the acting director of the Secret Service said the agency ""should have been more direct"" with state and local law enforcement about what was needed to secure the area.

Last week's attacks in Lebanon appear to be an unprecedented act of sabotage by Israel, and questions still remain over how the country's spy agencies were able to infiltrate Hezbollah to put boobytrapped pagers and walkie talkies in the pockets of as many as 5,000 of its members. BAC Consulting is the Budapest-based company apparently responsible for shipping the pagers, but it does not appear to have a history in electronics manufacturing, and its CEO's background is rife with inconsistencies.

The FTC on Friday sued UnitedHealth Group's Optum Rx, CVS Health's Caremark and Cigna's Express Scripts, alleging the companies have created a ""perverse"" drug rebate system that has ""artificially inflated"" the price of insulin. The lawsuit claims the three companies excluded lower-priced insulin in favor of higher-priced options, forcing ""patients to pay more for life-saving medication.""

What makes a growth stock? The first thing most investors look at is the earnings per share, but there's a case to be made for giving equal attention to revenue growth. Financial success starts on the top line, after all, and smart investors like the late Charles Allmon start there, too. ""In the long run, a company cannot grow any faster than its sales,"" he once told Forbes.

TOPLINE Though he's no longer at WeWork, and his attempt to buy back the bankrupt co-working startup was rebuffed earlier this year, Adam Neumann is still very much in the real estate game.

His latest bid to crack co-living and apartment rentals is a startup called Flow, which has quietly opened its first properties in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. Flow Narjis ""soft launched"" in August, peddling ""conscious community"" and two- and three-bedroom apartments in the An Narijis area near Riyadh's airport. The furnished apartments showcase Flow's formula of bundling housing with services like laundry and housekeeping, and amenities like pools, gyms and bowling alleys. Until last month, Flow's only other properties were in America's sun belt, where Neumann bought up over $1 billion of apartment blocks in cities like Miami and Fort Lauderdale.

But when Neumann first announced Flow, its business model was something of a mystery.

Backed with $350 million from Andreessen Horowitz in 2022, Flow's job listings touted an ""ambitious vision for the future of living,"" while in Neumann's speeches it appeared to encompass a mess of ideas extending from crypto-enabled financial services to a nebulous plan for tenants to build equity with their rent. It also posited the idea of renters plunging their own toilets to build ""ownership.""

""If you're in your own apartment, and you bought it and you own it and your toilet gets clogged, you take the plunger,"" Neumann explained in November 2023. ""It's the difference from feeling you own something. From being transactional to being part of a community.""

Flow has close to 1,000 apartments in the Saudi capital with construction slated to finish by the end of the year. Neumann's startup had bought the properties in partnership with private local investors, according to Flow spokesperson Amy Stevens. Saudi's sovereign wealth fund, which backs A16Z, has not invested in Flow, she said.

WHY IT MATTERS Neumann has a tangled history with Saudi Arabia and its sovereign wealth fund, which has emerged as a major backer of both tech startups and investors over the last decade but remains controversial because of the country's human rights record and the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

SoftBank pumped more than $20 billion in equity and debt into WeWork, largely with Saudi money. When SoftBank doubled down on WeWork despite massive, mounting losses, Saudi's Public Investment Fund reportedly boycotted investment in their second Vision Fund. Still, Neumann appeared as a star speaker running a Shark Tank-style competition for startups at last year's ""Davos in the Desert"" summit in Riyadh.

UNICEF USA BrandVoice: Polio Vaccination Campaign Protects Gaza's Children,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/unicefusa/2024/09/20/polio-vaccination-campaign-protects-gazas-children/,2024-09-20T14:51:46Z,"Target reached in first round of polio vaccination campaign

Around 90 percent of children under 10 in the Gaza Strip have received a dose of the polio vaccine following the first round of an emergency vaccination campaign conducted by UNICEF and partners in early September 2024.

In August, an unvaccinated child was confirmed to be partially paralyzed by polio, the first case in Gaza in 25 years. By May 2024, 60 percent of Gaza's water and sanitation infrastructure had been destroyed or severely damaged and nearly 2 million people were displaced, setting the stage for a massive public health crisis.

""Despite the war, the long distance and the bombing, I am determined to vaccinate my children.""

In Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip, Fatima, mother of 4-year-old Adam and his baby sister, Majd, was one of many parents who flocked to health facilities to ensure their children received the novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) to protect them from the highly contagious, crippling disease.

""The place is quite far, but my son desperately needs it as he has no immunity,"" Fatima said. ""Despite the war, the long distance and the bombing, I am determined to vaccinate my children.""

During the 12-day campaign, mobile and transit teams actively reached out to families living in shelter homes, tents and camps for the displaced, alongside community workers engaging families to raise awareness about the vaccination campaign.

""Despite relentless attacks on schools and sites sheltering uprooted children, exhausting displacement orders forcing families to relocate time and again, and widespread hunger levels that have at points pushed parts of Gaza to the brink of famine, families made the effort to turn out in high numbers to the vaccination sites,"" said Adele Khodr, UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa. ""They know there is no time to waste to protect their children.""

Laying the groundwork for the campaign included the implementation of area-specific humanitarian pauses to ensure the safety of children and health care workers.

""Preparing for this ambitious campaign and securing these pauses was not easy but it demonstrates that it is possible to allow supplies into the Strip, silence the strikes and protect civilians,"" Khodr continued. ""There just has to be the will.""

The next step will be to ensure that hundreds of thousands of children receive a second dose of the polio vaccine later this month."
Call For Disarmament And Solidarity As Trump Raises Nuclear Threats,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/globalcitizen/2024/09/20/call-for-disarmament-and-solidarity-as-trump-raises-nuclear-threats/,2024-09-20T04:29:47Z,"Nuclear weapons are back in focus. Donald Trump Jr. and RFK Jr. recently penned a joint article, warning that ""the world is at greater risk of nuclear conflagration than at any time since the Cuban missile crisis."" North Korea shows no signs of scaling back its nuclear ambitions, while Iran blames the U.S. for walking away from its deal with world powers, pushing it to explore nuclear development. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin hints at resuming nuclear tests, breaking a 30-year taboo. Donald Trump, whose administration abandoned the nuclear agreement with Iran, has even claimed -- perhaps bizarrely -- that nuclear war poses the biggest threat to American autoworkers.

Agree with Trump or not, one thing is clear: the nuclear threat is once again front and center. Experts, including the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, say the risk of nuclear Armageddon is higher today than ever before. With nuclear-armed states locked in hot and cold wars, disarmament seems like a distant dream. But history has shown that it's often in moments of heightened danger that diplomacy can produce breakthroughs.

Some say nuclear weapons are an even bigger threat than climate chaos -- and they certainly make it worse. A nuclear war could end humanity, but even without one, the costs are staggering. Last year, nuclear-armed nations spent $91.4 billion on their arsenals -- a 34% increase from the year before. That's $3,000 every second, or $173,000 a minute, wasted on weapons that threaten life instead of saving it. Imagine the impact if that money went towards clean energy -- enough to power 12 million homes with wind or plant 1 million trees every minute.

There's still hope for progress. History shows that breakthroughs in nuclear disarmament often come during times of heightened tension. The Cuban Missile Crisis led to the Partial Test Ban Treaty, and the nuclear missile buildup in Europe resulted in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Today, with conflicts like Ukraine and Gaza threatening to escalate, leaders must find ""off-ramps"" that not only prevent disaster but also advance nuclear disarmament.

The truth is, nuclear weapons are one of the most solvable global problems. We built them; we can dismantle them. What we need is the political will to act. Eliminating nuclear weapons wouldn't just prevent Armageddon -- it would help tackle other crises too. As author Timmon Wallis explains in Warheads to Windmills, global cooperation on climate change becomes much harder when the biggest carbon emitters are armed with nuclear weapons. By disarming, we could reduce carbon emissions, free up thousands of scientists to focus on sustainability, and unlock billions of dollars to combat environmental challenges and achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Times. It's time to act -- for our planet and our future.

Next week, as world leaders convene in New York for the UN General Assembly, they'll adopt a ""Pact for the Future"" -- a set of commitments on sustainable development, security, and governance. However, this broad pact, which requires consensus from all nations, is likely to fall short in holding accountable those most responsible for stalling progress on nuclear disarmament.

A more promising path lies in the UN Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), which entered into force in 2021. Though nuclear-armed states oppose it, this treaty is the first global agreement to ban nuclear weapons and provide a legal roadmap for dismantling them. It also addresses the human and environmental devastation caused by their use and testing. Supported by most of the world's nations, the TPNW is a beacon of hope.

The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons helped push the treaty through the UN and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017 for raising awareness of the catastrophic impact of nuclear weapons. Taking inspiration from the 2017 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the 1997 Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, and the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions, ICAN's strategy deliberately involves constructing treaties without the involvement of every single powerful nation. By generating ample momentum, these treaties not only secured passage through the UN General Assembly but also established new diplomatic norms, making defiance challenging even for nations that refused to ratify them. For example, the US never joined the 1997 Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention but did eventually agree to their phasedown. Now, ICAN's efforts are inspiring a new campaign -- one focused on a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty. We must pressure our political leaders to join these vital treaties and show the same policy entrepreneurship and innovation that grassroots and community leaders are already demonstrating.

They say we live in a world of despair, and things certainly feel dire. The UN Security Council has seen unprecedented division since 1989, and if Donald Trump returns to office, the U.S. could resume nuclear testing -- as his former national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, suggested in Foreign Affairs this summer. But despite the bleak outlook, there's still reason for hope.

The 2024 Global Solidarity Report reveals that despite rising anxiety among young people, there remains a deep -- even remarkable -- well of support for global solidarity. If we can harness this energy for positive, collective action, we can still build a better future. As Jonathan Glennie and Hassan Damluji, two of the report's authors, put it:

""While the reality of today's world rightly concerns us, we want to imagine the possibilities for what we can achieve. Humans make progress when they are hopeful.""

It's not too late to pull back from the brink. In a world where despair often dominates, it's crucial to keep imagining alternative futures and that hope is a verb - it requires doing and continued use to keep it strong. That's why, as the 2024 Global Solidarity Report emphasizes, we urgently need to replace fear of disaster with an intentional, well-funded, fact-based campaign that inspires hope and fosters global solidarity. Only then will solutions like disarmament be within reach."
Book Review: George Gilder's Excellent and Crucial 'The Israel Test',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2024/09/18/book-review-george-gilders-excellent-and-crucial-the-israel-test/,2024-09-18T16:03:56Z,"Without defending some (or a lot) of its anti-growth economic policies, the easily-forgotten truth is that California is by far the most enterprising, entrepreneurial state in the most enterprising, entrepreneurial country in the world. Evidence supporting the previous claim can be found in the fact that 60% of the world's venture capital investment annually flows to startups based in California, not to mention that if the Golden State were a country, it could lay claim to being the world's 4 largest economy. When conservatives oddly politicize what booms as a ""basket case"" (and other pejoratives like it), they shrink themselves.

The great George Gilder has long recognized the herculean genius of California's entrepreneurs, along with that of the remarkable investors who match west coast genius with capital. As he observed in his spectacular 2023 book Life After Capitalism, it's not just the economic activity taking place within California that people should marvel at, it's the surges in productivity that California-based innovation has long made possible outside the state. California is decidedly not an economic basket case, but the world economy would most certainly be a basket case without California.

Gilder's past insights came to mind quite a bit while reading his highly informative, excellent and crucial new book, The Israel Test: How Israel's Genius Enriches and Challenges the World. This essential read gives life to Gilder's assertions about California's economic impact on the world, an impact that is very much informed by technology and financial sectors well populated by Jews.

For those who don't know why California thrives despite certain policies normally inimical to success, they'll understand better from The Israel Test. As Gilder makes plain on the book's very first page, ""we Americans still face our Israel Test, our humbling need to not only recognize our dependence on the genius of the Jews in the United States, but also to acknowledge our reliance not only for innovation but even for our national security on this diminutive and embattled Middle Eastern ally."" While the focus of The Israel Test is not California, what's apparent is that Israel, like California with its sizable Jewish population, is similarly instrumental to global economic health and security. Yes, it's increasingly true that the world economy would be a basket case without Israel.

In Gilder's words, ""Planetary prosperity depends on the outsized genius of a tiny minority of human beings."" More and more of this ""vital few"" (HT: Reuven Brenner) talent resides in Israel. Which is the purpose of Gilder's book, one that should (and hopefully will) attain a large global audience. Particularly as Israel's enemies spew hideous rhetoric of the ""river to the sea"" variety, those who know better need to understand that the words aren't just ugly, not just sickeningly inhumane if acted upon, they would also be globally disastrous economically.

Looked at through a U.S. economic prism alone, Gilder writes that ""most of America's preeminent technology companies"" along with its healthcare giants ""still depend on crucial inventors, engineers, intellectual prosperity, and laboratories in Israel."" Considering our military planes like the F-16, numerous inputs for the latter are crafted in Israel. Assuming an all-out missile attack on the United States, Gilder asserts that ""Israeli technology will be the reason we likely survive it."" Despite this, the country suffers an ""insidious spate of abusive nonsense detailing the alleged flaws - indeed the sins - of Israel.""

What's odd is that the abusive nonsense directed at Israel frequently originates in the United States. Odder still, as Gilder conveys through brilliant Israeli entrepreneurs like Shaul Olmert (son of Ehud, former prime minister), is how much of the criticism of the country comes from Israelis themselves. Gilder laments that Jewish outperformance isn't just financial, technological and cultural, that the Jews ""outperform all rivals even in the arena of anti-Semitism.""

Looking at the U.S. alone, Gilder is of the view that ""the United States has all too often failed the Israel Test"" through its perception of ""Israeli power, prosperity, culture, genius, and self-defense as a problem rather than a supreme global asset."" And a global asset it is. At the same time, it requires stress just how much of a local asset Israel is.

Gilder writes that before the Jews returned to Israel (1/6 of 1 percent of the total Middle East land mass), the land ""scarcely counted as a desirable asset or a prize to be awarded to anyone before the Jews reclaimed it and made its economy valuable and its land capable of supporting life."" And it was surely not desired by Arabs who now make pushing the Jews into the sea from this tiny bit of land their modern raison d'etre. Major evidence required to make this claim can be found in what the land surrounding Israel looks like now, not to mention what Israel would look like if the Jews departed or were pushed out.

Which explains Gilder's assertion that contra all the rhetoric about ""occupation"" and forced ""settlements,"" the ""Jews were not occupying a nation,"" rather ""they were building one."" What they built has proven rather appealing to non-Jews, including Arabs. Gilder notes that ""Arabs flourish in Israel as they do nowhere else.""At present, ""Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank accommodate some 5.5 million Arabs, with a population density ten times that of Jordan."" Human migration is the purest market signal of them all, and the migration of Arabs into and around Israel signals the soaring economic opportunity that reveals itself wherever the commercially skillful take their talents. Genius, per Gilder, is ""a source of wealth and opportunity for all.""

Which raises obvious responses to the frequent critiques of Jews and their ""settlements."" To say these movements are negatives is like saying it would harm a limping U.S. neighborhood if well-to-do, upright neighbors moved in, or that a business district would be harmed if a McDonald's, Whole Foods, or Apple Store showed up. Obviously not. Where prosperous people and businesses go, other thriving businesses and people frequently follow. Where the Jews go, vast improvement follows. Gilder writes this in more of a protective sense for Israel from guns and bombs, but when he writes that ""Israel is not too large but too small,"" it's easy to apply the previous assertion to the wellbeing of the non-Jews in the region not fortunate enough to live in Israel.

Sadly, this view is not shared by Hamas, Hezbollah, the PA, and a myriad of other entities that have directed so much ugly rhetoric, violence and murder at Israel and its people. Even though the Jews have made enormously desirable what formerly wasn't, Hamas et al obviously want the land back. Or do they? Considering the look of the lands abutting Israel, what a disaster for the various terrorists groups if the Israelis were to pull an Atlas Shrugged of sorts and leave.

For now, Hamas and other terrorist organizations like it somehow frame Israel's prosperous, world-enhancing existence as the problem for the region. Worse, they get help not just from Israel's critics, but also its defenders. Gilder writes that ""the central error of Israel's defenders is to accept the framing of the debate by its enemies, whose idea is that peace depends on some marginal but perpetually elusive improvement in Israel's behavior."" Which is something to think about given the Arab population within Israel itself.

While the Israelis live next to Arabs and Christians within Israel, while Arabs and Christians serve in the Knesset, Gilder notes that ""the dispute over the settlements is an argument over whether Jews may reasonably expect to be permitted to live among Arabs anywhere."" Not now, it seems. It's accepted as a ""natural right"" of Palestinians ""to be squeamish about living anywhere near Jews.""

It brings us to the why (or the presumed why) behind the hatred. Religion doesn't seem to suffice, which means it's difficult to countenance the belief of some that ""The Jew carries the burden of God in history [and] for this has never been forgiven."" Gilder references the latter as a good summation of what Joseph Telushkin and Dennis Prager (Prager writes the foreword to The Israel Test) believe, but it didn't ring true and Gilder says as much. Such a view ascribes thought that's hard to find behind all the hatred.

More compelling is the explanation offered by Russian writer Maxim Gorky (and cited by Gilder) that anti-semites ""dislike the Jew only because he is obviously better, more adroit, and more capable of work than they are."" Gilder seems to agree with Gorky. He writes that ""The source of anti-Semitism is Jewish superiority and excellence."" Gilder and Gorky are difficult to argue with, but as Gilder himself notes, Israeli prosperity within Israel has been a magnet for Arabs. Which is important to stop and think about.

Bringing California back into the discussion, it's an undeniable fact that the Jews largely created a film industry that has lured millions west over the decades. More modernly, the technology industry that is heavily populated by Jews similarly exists as a major lure for non-Jews. Perhaps oddest of all, consider how Iranians and Jews live peacefully around each other in Beverly Hills at the same time that Iran the country is very public about its desire to destroy Israel.

It's all a long way of saying it reads as perhaps a little too simplistic to say as Israeli journalist (cited by Gilder) Caroline Glick does, that ""The enviers hate Israel."" There's got to be something more? The view here is that it's rooted in a lack of freedom. Where people are free to live and work as they wish, all the while broadly free of the excessive tax, regulatory, trade, and monetary barriers to production, they prosper alongside the Jews all the while recognizing how much they gain from getting to work alongside such remarkable talent. Again, Jewish prosperity is a magnet for much bigger populations that aren't Jewish.

It brings to mind a question once asked of an old boss: why was Hollywood giant Lew Wasserman so greatly revered? What was it about him? The reply was that Wasserman was ""Michael Jordan"" in the film industry. He made everyone better around him. The desire to be better resides within us all, but when government gets in the way with policy errors that limit the human ability to prosper, those most capable of outrunning government error are scapegoated.

Considering the above argument through the prism of the United States, no doubt there's anti-Semitism in the U.S. But arguably a major reason it's not nearly as evident in the U.S. has to do with all the immense economic opportunity that exists stateside. Contrast this with Germany and the Holocaust. It's seriously hard to imagine that Hitler ever attains power absent the gruesome devaluation of the mark in the aftermath of WWI that robbed so many of all that they'd worked for.

Where people are prospering, they don't have time nor the inclination for racist or murderous thoughts, nor do they seek scapegoats. As in, if the world were freer and by extension more unequal (in a free society genius is rewarded the most) and prosperous, the bet here is that anti-Semitism and its frequently murderous offshoots would be much less evident. This viewpoint shouldn't be construed as an attempt to excuse hideous, frequently gruesome behavior, but it is to say that prospering people are happier and less violent. Freedom is the fix for so much in the world, including anti-Semitism.

Conversely, opportunity suffocated unleashes anger and the desire for scapegoats. History is clear that Jews are routinely the scapegoated, and particularly because they've proven more capable of overcoming barriers to prosperity erected by governments. Gilder references Jewish fortitude with his discussion of what happened to the former Soviet Union under Gorbachev when ""the bulk of Soviet Jews"" were released. He describes what subsequently unfolded as the economic equivalent of ""a frontal lobotomy"" for the U.S.S.R. Yes, even where there was little to no freedom to prosper, Soviet Jews managed to prosper in a relative sense as Anya Gillinson anecdotally notes in her excellent new memoir, Dreaming In Russian.

It further speaks to the economic boom taking place in Israel now. The Soviet Union's loss was the world's gain; that, or parts of the world gained immeasurably from the unshackling of so much talent. Gilder writes that ""the most precious resource in the world economy is human genius,"" and a substantial portion of the Soviet Jews found their way to Israel once freed from the Soviet Union. Getting more specific, Gilder writes that ""immigrants from the Soviet Union constitute fully half of Israel's high-tech workers,"" and that VC outlays in Israel soared ""nearly sixty-fold from $58 million to $3.3 billion"" between 1991 and 2000 subsequent to their arrival. This looms large in consideration of the fact that ""Israel has become a center of innovation second in absolute achievement only to the United States."" Stop and think about it.

In thinking about what the Soviet Union (or Russia) lost in concert with Israel's gain, think back to the needless Cold War. Leaving aside the U.S.'s arms buildup, Ronald Reagan's much greater insight, one that Gilder doubtless helped Reagan arrive at, was that economically, culturally and personally unfree people would be no match for free people and the fruits of their freedom. No argument there, but stop and contemplate if Gorbachev (and those who came before him) had recognized the towering genius that was within the U.S.S.R./Russia all along. Russia quite simply had the people to be a global economic (and military) powerhouse if they'd just set the genius residing with Russia's borders free. It staggers the mind.

Lest we forget, Gilder believes deeply in a tee-shirt slogan spotted by his editor (Richard Vigilante) during an Israel visit, and which said ""Don't Worry America, Israel Is Behind You."" As he sees it, both the U.S. economy and its military would be substantially reduced without the existence of the same Israel that's been so profoundly lifted economically and militarily by Jews from the former Soviet Union. It's a long way of saying that when Vladimir Putin claims the collapse of the Soviet empire ""was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century,"" he's engaging in non sequitur. More realistically, the Soviet Union's or Russia's failure of its own Israel Test was right up there among the biggest Russian tragedies.

As for greatest catastrophe of the century, geopolitical or economic, it would have to be World War II whereby so much of the world's genius was tragically exterminated. About this mass slaughter of Jews, Gilder is so very correct with his assertion that ""the rest of the world has suffered even more in absolute terms by the loss of the vast potential of the six million Jewish victims whose only sin was being Jewish on the European continent in the twentieth century."" About Gilder's oh-so-correct statement, one that he in no way wrote to minimize the suffering of Jews, let's please allow it to exist as yet another indictment of a profession (economics) that makes astrology appear serious by comparison, and whose PhDs assert near-monolithically that the upside of World War II was that it ended the Great Depression.

It would be difficult to find a sicker and more ferociously obtuse viewpoint than the one held by the vast majority of ""trained economists"" about WWII's (and war in general) allegedly positive growth implications. Nothing could be further from the truth, or more dangerous. As Gilder makes plain, ""no one can be rich alone."" Oh well, according to economists Gilder is incorrect. So deluded are they by the GDP ""gains ""achieved via killing, maiming, wealth destruction, and the rebuilding of wealth destroyed, that they've somehow come to the conclusion that the latter ended the Great Depression, after which American producers were allegedly rendered better off by a supine Europe suddenly bereft of its vital few. Worse is that economists have spread their tragic misunderstanding of prosperity to high-level thinkers like Yuval Levin and Edward Conard at American Enterprise Institute who claim that what makes the 1950s so attractive to nostalgic Americans is that so much of the rest of the was destroyed. Adam Smith is no doubt looking down mystified.

What happened in Europe alone doesn't just indict an economics profession that embarrasses itself in all sorts of ways all day and every day (those same economists also believe economic growth causes inflation), it also to some degree exposes American conservatism as less serious than its practitioners would like to believe. Think ""Eurosclerosis"" and the various pejoratives lobbed at Europe by conservatives in similar fashion to how they denigrate California. According to conservatives, the biggest driver of ""Eurosclerosis"" is excessive rates of taxation that deaden the incentive to work.

About the good of lowering taxes all and every way possible, no argument against will be made here. Taxes are a price, or a penalty placed on work and investment. At the same time, conservatives shrink themselves yet again when they ascribe Europe's relative lack of prosperity to ""tax rates."" What has Europe less prosperous was anti-Semitism that revealed itself in the most murderous of ways. Absent it, stop and think how rich Europe would be today, and by extension how much better off the world would be.

Quoting Gilder the same way but a second time, ""the most precious resources in the world economy is human genius."" It lifts us all, only for sickening envy (Gilder, Gorky, Glick) or a lack of freedom (Tamny, surely many others) to reveal itself occasionally in the form of anti-Semitism that shrinks the portion of the population most crucial to cultural, health, and economic progress.

What Gilder believes about the importance of the individually brilliant brought to mind quibbles on occasion. In particular, his chapter about Benjamin Netanyahu as the man that propelled Israel ""into the modern world of finance"" wasn't as compelling as the book's many other arguments. For one, capital always and everywhere finds genius as Gilder's own VC stats for Israel (a sixty-fold increase between 1991 and 2000) indicate. For two, the previous surge was per Gilder himself a function of the arrival of brilliant Soviet Jewry.

This isn't to say that Nethanyahu didn't bring better, more pro-growth policies to Israel. If Gilder says he did, than he did. At the same time, and as overtaxed and over-governed locales like California and New York remind us, talent trumps policy by many miles.

More on Netanyahu, the book plainly went to print before the tragedy of October 7, 2023. No expert on Israel (I've never even visited), isn't the primary job of the prime minister in Israel to protect the people from the many terrorists who mean it the worst of harm? If Netanyahu is so heroic, doesn't he deserve the slings and arrows of the present, and much, much more?

Which leads to another quibble with Gilder's analysis. He writes that anti-Zionists view Israel as a mistake because of ""discrimination against Arabs, sorely maldistributed wealth and income, a runaway engine of west bank settlements that represent an imperial 'occupation,'"" etc. Maybe that's the consensus view, but my problem with Israel is that as presently constituted, it places the most brilliant people on earth directly in harm's way.

The above had me wanting to ask Gilder while reading his spectacular book if Israel itself passes the Israel Test? By Gilder's own estimation, many of the best and brightest within Israel share the negative views of the country held by some of its most ardent critics. That being the case, how can it survive? This is important precisely given Gilder's own assertion that ""no nation is more important to the survival of the United States and the world than Israel."" If true, or even if not true, is Israel itself passing the Israel Test?

About this question, in the aftermath of 10/7 I found myself arguing with Jewish friends that Israel must cease wasting Israeli lives on these wars. What is gained? Gilder argues that ""conspicuous weakness is a prime cause of war,"" and that's long been the right's consensus, but what good did the latter do the U.S. in Iraq and Afghanistan, and seriously, what good has it done Israel? Its military superiority well established time after time (think 1948, 1967, 1973, and many times since), the killers keep coming.

Back to the argument made, I wanted Netanyahu to not respond, to let the hideous videos of heinous Hamas acts travel around the world in concert with intense quiet from Israel. I then wanted Netanyahu to announce that there would be no invasion of Gaza given an aversion to wasting even one more precious Israeli life on a war that never ends. That instead, Israel had hired the Wagner Group to man the country's borders. If the Arabs can't be asked to live among Jews, they would henceforth no longer be allowed to work with Jews inside Israel. In concert with the arrival of Wagner, a wall would be built with the money saved by not going to war yet again with people who value life much less than the Jews do.

None of what's been written is meant as yet another apology for Israel's alleged mis-behavior. Not at all. At the same time, it's a stab at what your reviewer imagines to be realism: the Arabs will never give up. Since they won't, it's time to put to bed the right's mantra about ""conspicuous weakness"" as the ""prime cause of war."" Let's replace it with government is always and everywhere incompetent, and governments are populated with too many people too eager to go to war. It's not working.

Beyond that, by Gilder's own admission Israel is heavily populated with Shaul Olmert-types who are remarkably brilliant, but who are uncomfortable with Israel vis-à-vis those who surround it and who mean it harm. The mention of Olmert once again isn't an expression of agreement with him, but it's a comment that he arguably represents a growing portion of the Israeli population eager to innovate over engage in endless war. Though militarily quite skillful, the Jews aren't a warring people, period. Worse, they're up against people with less to live for, and who are seemingly willing to wait them out.

Three quarters of the way through The Israel Test, Gilder cites a speech given by Nobel Prize winning Israeli game theorist, Robert Aumann. At a presentation of his that Gilder attended in Toronto, Aumann observed that, ""over history many peoples have been expelled from their homes. Only the Jews have been expelling themselves, their own people. From their own homes and synagogues, towns and farms. From Sinai, from Gaza, from the West Bank, from Jerusalem, only the Jews."" Aumann's observation is the counter to the assertion that the Israelis should just take their genius elsewhere, and far away from the Arabs. Aumann makes a hard-to-argue-with case that the Jews have been compromising for way too long, and it's beyond wrong to ask them to move again.

At the same time, and per Gilder, ""if the Arabas or Iranians desired peace, they would have long ago achieved it."" Absolutely. Which is telling. Peace isn't the goal, and it's something to keep well in mind in concert with Gilder's correct assertion that ""the survival of the Jews is vital to the triumph of free economies."" In that very real sense, it's difficult to conclude from this remarkable book anything other than that the United States and Israel are failing The Israel Test, and that their ongoing failure threatens the rest of the free world."
Puncturing The Phillips Curve Myth,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/vipinbharathan/2024/09/17/puncturing-the-phillips-curve-myth/,2024-09-17T20:45:58Z,"We are approaching September 19th when the Fed is widely expected to cut the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points, if not more. The Fed's twin mandate, keeping inflation under control and aiming for low unemployment is really in the service of the American economy and in the public interest. Most of the other functions are regulatory. The choice between the twin mandates are meant to be expressed in the Phillips curve. The Fed and the economic establishment relies on the Phillips curve based models to help them choose between the Scylla of high unemployment and the Charybdis of inflation.

""Reassessing the Effectiveness and Transmission of Monetary Policy,"" was the theme of the economic symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming in August. The Fed telegraphed that rate cuts are on the way. They give themselves credit for falling inflation, which they claim is due to the ""Effectiveness and proper Transmission of Monetary Policy"". They were late to raise interest rates, and now they are late to cut. Mostly, this is due to their reliance on flawed models. Add to this the delay and lack of integrity in the measurement of various economic indicators. Bad models plus bad data yield results once in a while, similar to a broken clock that is right twice a day. The first paper presented during the symposium extends the Phillips curve towards the vertical leg of the Phillips curve.

The Phillips curve, interpreted today as the classic seesaw between unemployment and inflation, was created from pre-WWI data for the UK. That such a curve fitting exercise on local empirical data from the long eclipsed British Empire has become the staple of economic theory and the rationale for action or the lack of it, is completely normal in a discipline that hopes to measure, and control complex phenomena. Today's economic conditions bear no resemblance to the late Victorian era.

Economics is not physics. Even physics is not an exact science when it comes to modeling complex phenomena such as weather and climate. Models depend on simplification. Linking two economic measures such as inflation and unemployment is one of those simplifications. The economic establishment glosses over this simplification.

Low inflation for two decades lulled the economic establishment into a transitory mindset as inflation started going up in 2021. The Fed held down the overnight and fed fund rates. As Jerome Powell noted in his Jackson hole 2024 address team transitory was vanquished and the Fed tightened interest rates in an unprecedented manner. Prominent economists such as Lawrence Summers opined in 2022 that we need huge unemployment over multiple years to bring inflation under control. This is a Phillips curve maximalist view. Some of them even predicted that inflation cannot be controlled without a recession.

The Phillips curve has undergone revisions and updated thinking. This defense of a model, which has lost its predictive power, especially at the ends of its curve speaks to the myths of economics and the paucity of tools that have predictive or even analytic power. Revisions and add-ons have yielded at least nine Nobel prizes. Phillips himself did not consider the eponymous curve significant. The Phillips curve has become somewhat of a shibboleth in economic circles. The fact that an orthodoxy exists is due to the fact that almost all of the economists of note and power in the government and in control of major economic publications come from a handful of institutions. An echo chamber that amplifies these myths.

Phillips curve as Phillips created it was not about inflation at all. The curve shows the relationship between unemployment and rate of change of wages in the years 1861-1913 in the UK. As part of the myth-making process of the 70s and before, the rate of change of wages was meant to stand in for the money supply in the economy. When there is more money, people are willing to pay more for the same goods or services. When people are willing to pay more, then inflation takes hold. Or so the argument goes. As the economist James Forder has shown, the myth of the Phillips curve as a choice between inflation and labor costs was created by an anti-labor cost sentiment among economists. You can read about it in ""Forder, James (2014). Macroeconomics and the Phillips curve myth. Oxford University Press.""

There was a period of low inflation coupled with low unemployment in about two decades leading up to 2020. This phenomenon caused economists to concentrate on the horizontal part of the Phillips curve. Then inflation took hold during the post-pandemic period and later post Ukraine invasion. Further shocks were delivered by the Gaza war. Such unexpected inflation may very well have to do with the amount of money in the system; due to low unemployment as well as pandemic spending. In a globalized economy, the complete stoppage of production in China during the zero-covid period caused supply side ructions and hence higher costs. Rising energy costs due to supply constraints as Russia went offline for most of the developed world as well as the recent disruptions in the supply routes by the Gaza invasion contributed as well. Apportioning inflation to supply or demand is a tough challenge. Nonetheless, it has not deterred academics from trying, they attribute 60% to low unemployment and 40% to supply shocks. They do some fancy somersaults to justify these figures.

If inflation can be traced to price-inflation, because of greed and because of the shutdown of the Chinese economy, America's factory then the Fed is helpless to control it. It does not seem to be wage-inflation that is the main culprit. The executive branch and fiscal policy are also off the hook.

The myth of the Phillips curve as a trade off between unemployment and inflation was born during the ideological struggles of the 70s. This myth focused on short run Phillips curve being flat by the labor friendly economists. It is nearly vertical as unemployment reaches a low point. It is as if, it hit a wall. Arguments about union aggressiveness, the natural rate of unemployment and other such myths get trotted out when inflation rises and unemployment goes down. There is almost no justification for inflation to tend toward infinity as the unemployment rate goes below 1.5 percent. Labor's power to effect wages has also gone down over the years as union representation has gone down. This is notwithstanding the victories eked out in the recent year by the UAW, the Teamsters and others.

The fact that many goods get manufactured globally, the role of innovation and increase in productivity and many of the economic facts of modern production and consumption are not present in a Phillips curve based interpretation of inflation vs. unemployment. Globalization and the export of manufacturing and even services to other countries is not factored in. Immigration is another phenomenon missing in the Phillips curve based analysis in the recent past in the US. Immigrants both legal and illegal have contributed to productivity and lowering labor costs. The numbers in the late Victorian era for the British empire have also been subject to globalization. Captive raw materials, both agricultural and otherwise, flowed into the British Isles. A boom in British manufacturing followed. The Phillips curve should be retired. A new paradigm needs to be born.

A paper presented at the Jackson Hole symposium injected the Beveridge threshold at the lower end. The authors of the paper contend that when the Beveridge threshold is breached, the Phillips curve percentage of wage increases are almost vertical, tending almost to infinity.

Only in dreams can labor hope to get wage increases tending to infinity as unemployment goes down. Instead of abandoning the Phillips curve as they should have, economists double down on it. Creating many variants, this time with the Beveridge threshold.

That there is an inverse relationship between unemployment and wage increases is not a great revelation. That wage increases trigger inflation is not a given. This is true especially when goods and services are produced in lower cost regimes, with lower labor protections and costs. These goods are then shipped to countries that can afford to pay for them. They are also targeted to these richer nations. It is doubtful whether items such as Santa figurines will find much of a market in China or India.

Added to this there are problems with measurement of basic economic data. Vacancy rates, unemployment itself, prices and other data that feed inflation measurements have a lot of lag. They are also often revised, even after actions to counter the wrong numbers have already launched.

So what can be done to bring macro-economic policy closer to reality. Models are important, however we need more insight into what the models lack and to be a little more objective. Milton Friedman had suggested replacing the Central Bank with an algorithm. His concept of the algorithm was a steady increase in money supply, say four or five percent a year. There are others who have also argued for the complete elimination of the Fed.

Without the Fed, the 2008 crisis would have seen the bottom drop out of the world. However, the Fed did bail out the wrong parties. Big institutions, banks and the investors got bailed out over main street. We have seen how this drama plays out without Fed intervention. Decades of misery such as during the Great Depression. Ditto with the pandemic. Intervention and counter-cyclic action is paramount. This sort of immediacy and daily intervention is part and parcel of Open Market Operations. The Fed intervenes in the overnight lending market through OMO to stabilize the economy.

We have much more sophisticated tools now. How about collecting data at the source? The first step is collecting and aggregating such data in a verifiable and audited manner through the intermediary of a decentralized apparatus such as a blockchain, which is excellent for provenance. Once the data has more integrity, AI would be effective to steer the economy, with human intervention of course. Monetary policy changes will be made more frequently than the 9 times a year that the FOMC meets. This would go a long way towards the elimination of what is called the business cycle. A steady state is what the Fed and all of us are after. Close to full employment without run-away inflation. Reliance on outmoded and incorrect tools such as the Phillips curve results in our current state where every forecasted move of the Fed causes market volatility and the destruction of perfectly viable enterprises."

Fighting between Hezbollah and Israel has been escalating for months as Israel continues its war against Hezbollah's ally, Hamas. On Oct. 8, 2023 -- the day after Hamas attacked Israel -- Hezbollah attacked Israel to show it was ""in solidarity"" with the Palestinian people. On Monday, the United States warned Israel against escalating its war with Hezbollah as concern continues that a war in the Middle East could expand beyond Gaza. The warning came as Israel's security cabinet voted to update its goals of its war with Hamas to include the safe return of Israelis who have been displaced from their homes on the northern border with Lebanon. Despite warnings from the U.S., Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement that ""while Israel appreciates and respects the support of the US, it will - ultimately - do what is necessary to safeguard its security and return the residents of the north securely to their homes.""

300. That's at least how many emergency medical staff were dispatched to help evacuate victims, the Lebanese Red Cross told Reuters. More than 50 ambulances were also sent out."
Profit From The Fed's Next Move?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/15/profit-from-the-feds-next-move/,2024-09-16T03:19:00Z,"We believe Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve's next move will not be pivotal. There is an opportunity to step back, see the bigger picture -- and potentially take advantage of that.

Specifically, the Fed's upcoming move from the two-day Sep 17th and 18th, 2024 meeting, could go one of three ways.

[1] Reduce rates by 25 bps, with a weak statement about future cuts

[2] Reduce rates by 25 bps, with a strong statement about more cuts to come

[3] Reduce rates by 50 bps

Option 1 is a less likely scenario right now. Option 2 and 3 will be cheered -- in spirit and action.

Markets won't respond well to Option 1

We'll see a moderate drop in S&P and other major indices, likely less than or around 5% levels, and hopefully not more than 10% levels -- and very unlikely a market crash. However, this can easily deepen in the near-term if additional weaker jobs reports show up, or companies report weak Q3 earnings in October -- especially if, in addition, inflation continues to show upward bias. In either case, we believe such downswings, if they happen, present a buying opportunity (how low can stocks and ETFs/indices go -- from SPY vs. AAPL, to pharma giant Merck, which stocks dropped most during past market crashes?). At the least, we believe investors will be better off not being too reactive.

Why is that?

Here's the thing. Irrespective of what the Fed does as part of their next move, there is little doubt about one thing: this is a data-driven Fed. If they make a smaller 25 bps cut to start, and unemployment data continues to show deterioration, they'll make bigger moves. This Fed has managed inflation, no, a monstrous 8%+ inflation, and restored price stability to 2-3% levels, without killing the job market. They did it extremely well. The Fed has ""0"" interest in messing with the success they've seen. Chair Powell knows well, now -- at this juncture -- the risk to job growth and unemployment is real, the risk has shifted -- it is no longer weighted towards a runaway-inflation, instead unemployment growth is the risk. He said as much in the last meeting.

Point is -- even if the first move is a 25 bps cut, if, and as more data comes in, the Fed will act with 50 bps cuts, and maybe larger cuts. The Fed will do whatever is needed to ensure a soft-landing.

The Fed's on your side. Period. If you agree, then isn't this, and more so if there is a drop in markets, the time to buy?

So now is the time for investors -- to invest in technology, infrastructure, better health outcomes -- better protection and preparation for the next Covid? Sure, invest in Nvidia, other AI stocks -- SMCI (what's a better AI stock SMCI or Nvidia?), invest in Lilly's weight loss drug's success, and DNA/CRISPR tech, Moderna, the new infrastructure projects, Google and Waymo's self-driving efforts, and GE, and everything in the middle? And if you don't like the rollercoaster, invest in the S&P 500, or, learn how the select 30 stocks that make up Trefis High Quality portfolio strategy has outperformed the S&P 500 -- consistently. HQ has seen >80% return since its Sep 2020 inception, Hint: it's simple, and right there in the HQ strategy's performance metrics -- not just size, but defensible revenue growth, and margins, but companies with strong balance sheets, and other quality criteria.

So, is anything to be feared at this time? While in the medium-to-long term things should do well, near-term volatility is likely to persist. Right now, we see this mostly due to the geopolitical unrest, the middle-eastern Gaza conflict, Ukraine/Russia war, and their potential for accompanying destruction. Why? Well, for one, wars are like that. They're an extreme of human expression -- creates more opportunity for results in the long tail. By definition, more volatility, less control, more uncertainty -- more risk. If that's how you see risk. Let's not forget, there is an upside as those conflicts wane and normalcy returns. Not just a psychological upside, but a real flow of goods and services as supply chains become less risky, shorter paths to trade, reliability, and trust develop.

Though it's good to be hopeful, the overhang from wars and conflict isn't going away, not anytime soon. On the flip-side, markets seem to have settled-in with these conflicts. And things can get better.

The other risk -- and always is -- is default on loans. All market crashes happen because someone can't pay back their loans (5 largest market crashes compared). For one, commercial real estate has been suffering for a while, Covid's work-from-home gift was a big curse for the Retail and Office real-estate parts (big variety in real-estate sector). In addition to an altered demand landscape, commercial real-estate loans maturing near-term continue to face high rates, and tough refinancing conditions. Things could break, though that hasn't happened -- and with Fed rates finally on the downtrend, it's less likely. Finally, there's consumer defaults -- credit card, auto loans -- especially credit card loans. That makes the financial sector -- banks like JPM, Citi, and BofA, with large credit card books, vulnerable (How low can JPM stock go in a market crash?). Again, we see this risk only as a transient -- because we believe the Fed will do whatever it takes to create a soft-landing.

There is something else. With rates as high as they are -- the Fed has even more power. There is a lot of room to cut rates, and release more liquidity if things go south. They can do a 100 bps cut. Power to release more money if the economy needs a shot for some reason, for any reason.

We believe, on balance, though the short term is likely to be volatile - there is a higher chance of more favorable market conditions in the medium term, and that's good for investors.

We've developed Trefis strategies to take advantage of such opportunities, while carefully managing risk in developing our Trefis portfolio strategies."
UNICEF USA BrandVoice: Gaza Through The Eyes Of A UNICEF Humanitarian Worker,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/unicefusa/2024/09/13/gaza-through-the-eyes-of-a-unicef-humanitarian-worker/,2024-09-13T04:53:54Z,"Dedicated aid workers won't stop supporting children in the Gaza Strip

Fairooz Abu Warda, a UNICEF early child development officer, travels by car past the ruined buildings lining the streets of Jabalia, a city in the northern Gaza Strip that has sustained heavy bombing.

""There is no safe place at all here,"" she says. ""The sense of safety and security ... seems like just a distant memory to all of us.""

2023 was the deadliest year on record for humanitarian aid workers: 280 aid workers were killed in 33 countries, a 137 percent increase compared to 2022.

Between October 2023 and August 2024, more than 280 aid workers were killed in the Gaza Strip alone.

Families have been torn apart during the escalated conflict. Almost all health facilities have been damaged, and many schools destroyed. Children are suffering from hunger and malnutrition. Access to clean water is limited.

Despite the difficulties, Warda and UNICEF colleagues continue working with partners to meet the essential needs of children in the Gaza Strip: health services, nutrition services, water and sanitation, child protection and education.

""We need to continue doing what we do, no matter how hard the situation, how tough the situation gets. Our work is not only about providing aid. It also brings hope.""

""Returning to work is not just a decision,"" Warda says. ""It's my duty as a humanitarian worker. I can't just stop. What keeps me going is knowing that people depend on us. We need to continue doing what we do, no matter how hard the situation, how tough the situation gets. Our work is not only about providing aid. It also brings hope."""
"A Voice Calls Out In The Silence: Bernard Henri Levy's ""Israel Alone""",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomteicholz/2024/09/11/a-voice-calls-out-in-the-silence-bernard-henri-levys-israel-alone/,2024-09-11T22:27:53Z,"On Sunday September 15, 2024 Bernard Henri Levy will appear in person at the Los Angeles Nova Festival exhibition in Culver City to talk about his new book, Israel Alone (to be published September 19, from Simon and Schuster).

The events of October 7 are not an affront to Israel alone but to all civilization, Bernard Henri Levy reminds us in his passionate reporting on the events of October 7 and what has followed.

In his new book, published in English this September, Levy makes the intellectual, historical, political, even philosophical case for the uniqueness of the tragedy of October 7, its heinousness, and mounts a passionate defense of Israel's existential right to defend itself in the face of such an attack and to pursue the murderers, planners, and collaborators who are still holding more than 100 hostages, not just Jews and Israelis, but citizens from many nations and followers of many religions.

Point by point, argument by argument Levy asserts the truths about October 7 and the Gaza opreation that followed, that so many are quick to dismiss or ignore. In doing so, Levy also calls out all the politicians, foreign governments, not-for-profits, NGOs and humanitarian organizations who remained silent for some 60 days after the attacks, chief among them the United Nations.

Levy makes the distinctions others don't about what genocide is (and isn't), and what Israel has or has not done during the Gaza operation. How all that Israel claimed - and the rest of the news organizations denied or failed to report - that Hamas used mosques, hospitals, and private homes as human shields with no regard for the casualties that ensued (perhaps even planning for them). That UNWRA workers collaborated with and gave material support to Hamas, that the Gaza Ministry of Health is a propaganda arm of Hamas and that its statistics of the dead are inflated -- - All have been proven true and yet ignored.

Levy decries the loss of any human life in Gaza, but he places those deaths in context and in apposition to the murders of October 7. He makes the case for the difficult task Israel faces to free the hostages and find Hamas' leaders.

Isarel Alone, is call to the world to understand the perniciousness of antisemitism and how it is used to incite anti-Israel sentiment all over the world, and particularly at American universities and college campuses.

While Levy is a defender of Israel, he is also no apologist for Netanyahu and Netanyahu's current government. As Levy reminds us, the issues of October 7 and the defense of Israel remain greater than one politician, particularly in a democratic country.

Reading the book is like being swept along in a flood of history, famous names, references and, at times, Levy's own personal history and sentiments.

This is a style Levy has developed in his 48 books, countless articles, speeches, and media appearances in France, the US, and all over the world.

In the twenty years I've known him, Levy has always written as the most French of writers, and also as the most Jewish of French writers. At my father's eulogy, some 30 years ago, I remarked that my father never took a breath that wasn't Jewish. Well, in Israel Alone, there is not a word Levy has written that is not deeply Jewish and deeply French.

This is clearly a book Levy was compelled to write. He went to Israel on October 8 and headed to the South to see the carnage himself. But the more important question is: Who will read this book?

It is Levy's hope that young Jews will read this book and become proud Jews and vocal defenders of Israel. I hope that is so.

I sincerely hope that those who would want to cast Israel as a pariah nation, and have it be Israel Alone, pick up this work mistakenly, and learn from it. I know that these days it is near impossible to change anyone's mind. Emotional loyalties, individuals' belief in their own interpretation of events, a knowledge base informed by podcasts, tiktok and social media, a genuine desire for social justice and human rights, all these do not always lead to greater knowledge about Israel and the events of October 7 -- I hope all these people whose hearts are hardened against Israel for their own reasons, read this book.

I hope that all the University and college presidents in the US, and all the sitting members of the United Nations, and their committees such as their organization that investigates violence against women as war crimes, and all the student protesters on all the college campuses read this book.

Of course, the chance that any of them will, I know, is exceedingly small. But if even one person who holds Israel and its actions in disdain, does read it, then perhaps, Israel will not be so alone."
Questions For The Kamala Harris And Donald Trump Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanmichelson2/2024/09/10/questions-for-the-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-debate/,2024-09-11T00:17:13Z,"As Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump do their last minute preparations for tonight's debate, I queried a handful of experts for questions they suggest - or would like - to be asked, and tossed in a few of my own.

Here are proposed questions the moderators might want to use:

2. Do you believe in democracy? What is your definition of democracy?

3. The peaceful transfer of power is a fundamental principle of democracy. You and Vice President Harris never met in person before tonight because you refused to attend the peaceful transfer of power during the inauguration. Why didn't you attend?

4. You have repeatedly threatened there would be violence, including referring to a ""bloodbath,"" if you lose this election. We experienced that on January 6th when your supporters stormed the Capitol and tried to hang Vice President Mike Pence. Why are you promoting violence?

5. How will you bring the American people together after the election if you win when at least half the public thinks you are unfit to be president again?

7. You repeatedly say that the United States is a failing nation, yet inflation is now lower than it was when you left office, the stock market has achieved historic highs, unemployment is lower than it was when you took office. The U.S. economy has rebounded faster and better than any other nation after the pandemic. What metrics do you have for describing the U.S. economy as failing?

8. The Inflation Reduction Act is pumping billions of dollars in to Republican-dominated, so called ""red"" states, including Texas, Florida, and Georgia, creating thousands of new jobs and boosting those states' economies. Members of Congress and Senators who voted against those bills have even taken credit for them with their constituents and shown up at ribbon cuttings for projects funded by them. If you are re-elected, you have claimed on the campaign trail that you'll reverse this legislation. Why would you undo all that economic growth across the country?

9. The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued its final climate risk disclosure rules, which are on hold as legal challenges work their way through the system. However, investors have been clamoring for such rules for years, because of the measurable financial risks of climate change as visible in the devastation to communities, homes and businesses from extreme weather events. The financial markets see these rules as a way to measure the financial risk companies are taking and how they are preparing for it. Other countries have similar rules and companies that do business overseas need to meet most of those rules too, so they have to do the same reporting. What action would you take regarding those climate rules?

10. You appointed U.S. Supreme Court judges who would overturn Roe v. Wade and bragged about it. Yet, you have changed your position on abortion over the years. What is your position on abortion and reproductive rights?

1. You have pivoted positions on fracking and oil and gas. Why did you change positions and what is your position today on fracking and can the American people trust that you will stick to that position this time?

2. The Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Act that you helped develop and pass include billions of dollars for energy projects, including mostly clean energy, but also carbon capture and natural gas, which favor the oil and gas sectors. But permitting challenges cause these and other energy and infrastructure projects to take as long as seven years in some cases. What specifically will you do to expedite the permitting process without compromising the analysis of the potential impact on the environment and communities?

3. President Biden angered the environmental community by approving the Willow pipeline and allowing some oil and gas drilling in public lands. What is your position on pipelines and why?

4. What is your position on nuclear energy and why? How will you ensure that communities with even the small nuclear reactors are safe?

5. During the campaign and at the Democratic National Convention, climate change and related policies seem to have been sidelined. There were a couple of very short presentations related to it at the convention, but all the mentions focused on clean air and water and not on the impact of climate change. Why and how much importance will addressing climate change have in your administration?

6. Many areas of the country have repeatedly had devastating hurricanes and floods, yet communities continue to rebuild in those areas, putting their lives, homes, businesses and communities at risk. Some insurance companies have even pulled out of those areas because they are tired of the high payouts. NOAA and other scientists predict that these storms will become more ferocious and more frequent and, therefore, potentially more damaging and life-threatening. Extreme weather events over the past 30-40 years have already cost nearly $3 trillion, according to NOAA. Will your administration put limits on where people can rebuild after such devastating weather events?

7. If elected, will you propose to increase the number of seats on the U.S. Supreme Court? If so, how and why?

. During the Biden-Harris administration, the influx of undocumented immigrants at the border hit historic highs. The numbers are much lower now, down to levels from when you and President Biden took office. What will your border and immigration policies be in your new administration and how will you get them passed if you have a divided Congress and Senate?

9. Most Americans want abortion to be safe, legal and rare, and there are millions of people who are offended by abortion as well. When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and turned these decisions over to the states, about 26 state legislatures passed bans of some level on abortion rights and their governors signed them into law. What will your abortion policy be that respects the various choices of all Americans on this issue?

10. Polling on the American electorate reflects that there is a great deal of divisiveness in the country. If you are elected, there will still be millions of people who did not vote for you and who support the very different policies of Mr. Trump. How will you bring such a divided country together if you are elected?

And then there are plenty of foreign policy questions, related to Israel and Gaza, Ukraine and Russia, China, The European Union and beyond."
Israel Says 'Highly Likely' Its Troops Fatally Shot U.S. Citizen In West Bank,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2024/09/10/israel-says-highly-likely-its-troops-fatally-shot-us-citizen-in-west-bank/,2024-09-10T14:26:45Z,"Israel's military said on Tuesday it is ""highly likely"" American Aysenur Eygi was ""indirectly and unintentionally"" shot and killed by the Israel Defense Force during a protest in the West Bank last week, according to an initial probe, following criticism of Israel's response by Eygi's family and U.S. officials.

Eygi's family released a statement on Saturday saying Eygi -- also a Turkish citizen -- was ""peacefully standing for justice"" before she was shot by Israel's military. Her family argued that ""given the circumstances"" of Eygi's death, ""an Israeli investigation is not adequate."" Several Turkish and U.S. officials have condemned Israel's response to the Beita protest, including Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who called the IDF's shooting a ""barbaric intervention."" Sean Savett, a National Security Council spokesperson, said the White House was ""deeply disturbed"" by the incident, adding the U.S. had requested an investigation and more information.

Eygi is a recent graduate of the University of Washington and was raised in Seattle, her family said. Aria Fani, a professor of Middle Eastern languages and cultures at the university, told the Associated Press Eygi had previously participated in pro-Palestinian protests before traveling to the West Bank, which Fani tried to convince her not to do. International organizations have cautioned against traveling to the region since Hamas -- which controlled the Gaza Strip and is separate from the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank -- attacked Israel in October. As of Aug. 21, the United Nations estimated more than 600 people have been killed in the West Bank since Oct. 7, mostly by Israeli forces and settlers in the occupied territory. Other civilians have been killed before the attack in recent years, however, including Al Jazeera journalist and U.S. citizen Shireen Abu Akleh, who was fatally shot while covering an Israeli operation in 2022. The IDF apologized for her death in 2023.

Two other activists with the International Solidarity Movement have been killed in Gaza since 2000. In 2003, American Rachel Corrie was crushed to death as she tried to block an IDF bulldozer from demolishing a Palestinian home, the Associated Press reported. A month later, British citizen Tom Hurndall was shot in the head by an IDF soldier. The IDF ruled Corrie's death as an accident, despite condemnation by human rights groups, and the soldier who killed Hurndall was sentenced to over 11 years in prison."
